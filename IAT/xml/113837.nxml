The loss of IL-2R&#x003b1; expression after expression of the pre-TCR &#x003b1;:&#x003b2; complex on the cell surface is essential for the later specific responses of mature T cells. Using appropriate mouse models and DMS genomic footprinting, we showed that the TATA box in the core promoter region of the murine IL-2R&#x003b1; locus was occupied only in DN CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. Further, by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we evidenced that down-regulation of IL-2R&#x003b1; transcription correlated with (i) loss of the basal transcriptional machinery; (ii) dissociation of histone acetylase p300 and BRG1, a member of the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex SWI&#x0002f;SNF; and (iii) histone N-termini dephosphorylation plus deacetylation. In contrast, occupancy of the proximal enhancer region (positive regulatory region I) was not detected by <italic>in vivo</italic> genomic footprinting though constitutive accessibility of the promoter region for DNase I digestion both in the DN and double-positive stages correlated with the constitutive association of CBP and PCAF to the IL-2R&#x003b1; core promoter.

IL-2 promotes T-cell proliferation by binding to a high affinity receptor composed of three transmembrane proteins, the &#x003b1;, &#x003b2; and &#x003b3;<sub>c</sub> chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c2">2</xref>). &#x003b2;&#x000a0;and &#x003b3;<sub>c</sub> chains combine to form an intermediate-affinity receptor sufficient for IL-2 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c4">4</xref>) but cannot stimulate the proliferation of normal T lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c7">7</xref>). The main functions of the highly inducible &#x003b1; chain (CD25) are presumed to increase the affinity for IL-2, allowing responsiveness to the low levels of IL-2 physiologically produced <italic>in vivo</italic>. IL-2R&#x003b1; is essential, as evidenced by autoimmunity in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c8">8</xref>) and in mice lacking this protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c9">9</xref>). It was also suggested that the IL-2&#x0002f;IL-2R pathway is involved in thymic selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c12">12</xref>) though the phenotype of IL-2R&#x003b1;-deficient mice seems to exclude a critical role for this component during ontogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c9">9</xref>).</p><p>Developing thymocytes follow a strictly regulated differentiation program characterized through the expression of specific cell surface markers. The thymocyte precursors, which lack expression of both co-receptors CD4 and CD8 &#x0005b;CD4<sup>&#x02013;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02013;</sup> double-negative (DN) cells&#x0005d;, develop into an intermediate CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> double-positive (DP) stage before maturing into CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> or CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> single-positive (SP) cells and exiting the thymus. It is now well established that DN thymocytes represent an heterogeneous population that can be further subdivided into four consecutive developmental stages: DN CD44<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x02013;</sup> (stage I), DN CD44<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (stage II), DN CD44<sup>&#x02013;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (stage III) and DN CD44<sup>&#x02013;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x02013;</sup> (stage IV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c15">15</xref>). In mutant mice lacking the recombinase proteins RAG-1 or RAG-2, or in TCR&#x003b2;- or pre-T&#x003b1;-deficient mice, none of them form a pre-TCR complex, &#x003b1;&#x0002f;&#x003b2; T-cell development is significantly arrested at the DN stage III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c19">19</xref>). Therefore, productive TCR&#x003b2; chain rearrangement and assembly of the pre-TCR serves as the first checkpoint in T-lymphocyte development for stage III to stage IV transition. Signaling through pre-TCR mediates the transcriptional activation and repression of several genes, including IL-2R&#x003b1;, and is critical for further proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c20">20</xref>). After transition to the DP stage, thymocytes do not express IL-2R&#x003b1; for the remainder of T-cell development. In resting mature lymphocytes its expression is physiologically triggered by antigen and co-stimulatory signals. In these cells, and more specifically in CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, human IL-2R&#x003b1; is mainly regulated at the level of transcription by at least five positive regulatory regions (PRRI&#x02013;PRRV) spread out over 12 kb. Each regulatory region appears to play a well defined and complementary role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c27">27</xref>). For instance, PRRIII (&#x02013;3786 to &#x02013;3071) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c29">29</xref>) and PRRV, located in the first exon (&#x0002b;3389 to &#x0002b;3596) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c30">30</xref>), are two specific IL-2 responsive enhancers activated by inducible Stat5 proteins playing a crucial role in the IL-2&#x0002f;IL-2R autoregulatory loop which amplifies IL-2R&#x003b1; transcription in the late stage of T-cell activation. Hence, IL-2R&#x003b1; appears critically controlled by IL-2 contrary to the thymus where this cytokine is not directly involved in CD25&#x0002f;IL-2R&#x003b1; transient expression during the transition from the DN stage to the DP stage. Thus, IL-2R&#x003b1; appears to be independently regulated in primary and secondary lymphoid organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c31">31</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the wealth of information on transcriptional regulation of IL-2R&#x003b1; in mature lymphocytes, no attempt has been previously made to identify the molecular mechanisms controlling its expression during ontogeny. In order to differentiate the molecular mechanism enabling IL-2R&#x003b1; transcription to switch on and off in thymus and in the periphery, we investigated <italic>in vivo</italic> during T-cell development the organization of the murine IL-2R&#x003b1; promoter which presents 78&#x00025; identity with the human gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c32">32</xref>). Using appropriate mouse models such as RAG-deficient mice whose thymic development is arrested at the CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DN stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c33">33</xref>) that can be rescued to the CD25<sup>&#x02013;</sup> DP stage by expression of a TCR&#x003b2; transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c34">34</xref>) or by anti-CD3 injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c35">35</xref>), we evidenced by <italic>in vivo</italic> footprinting that the occupation on TATA box (&#x02013;33, &#x02013;28) correlated with IL-2R&#x003b1; gene expression in DN cells and with the binding of TATA binding protein (TBP) <italic>in vitro</italic>. As demonstrated <italic>in vivo</italic> by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP), repression of the IL-2R&#x003b1; gene in DP cells was associated with the disengagement of two components of the general transcription machinery, TBP and Pol II as well as two members of the chromatin modifying complexes, the histone acetyl transferase (HAT) coactivator p300 and the DNA-dependent ATPase BRG1. In contrast, the HAT coactivators CBP and PCAF remained specifically associated to the inactive IL-2R&#x003b1; promoter in DP cells. We also observed that acetylation and&#x0002f;or phosphorylation of histone H3 and H4 bound to IL-2R&#x003b1; promoter was reverted during DN to DP transition. The implications of these observations are discussed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p>The mice used in this study included wild-type C57BL&#x0002f;6J and RAG-1-deficient (Rag<sup>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c33">33</xref>).

This absence of footprint was not apparently due to an heterogeneity of the thymocyte population analyzed since &#x0003e;95&#x00025; are DN CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> in Rag<sup>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</sup> mice. We can also exclude a problem linked to DNA quality since the same batches were successfully used to characterize the occupancy of the TCR&#x003b1; enhancer during T-cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c40">40</xref>). However, enhanced methylation of adenine bases was observed at different positions in comparison with naked DNA but without correlation with IL-2R&#x003b1; expression status. Such enhanced adenine methylation in living cells has already been reported and is probably due to a difference in the buffer composition between naked DNA and nuclear extract samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c41">41</xref>). In contrast, an increased methylation on guanine &#x02013;25 just downstream of TATA box (&#x02013;33, &#x02013;28) in the coding strand was reproducibly observed in Rag<sup>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</sup> thymocytes; however, this footprint was not observed in the non-coding strand (data not shown). This observation suggested the occupancy of TATA box (&#x0002b;33, &#x02013;28) by TBP, its cognate DNA binding protein, was restricted to CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DN thymocytes. Furthermore, no significant footprint (data not shown) was observed on identified regulatory elements within the murine PRRIII&#x0002f;IL-2rE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c32">32</xref>) despite the presence of a strong constitutive DH site.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of the functional TATA box</title><p>To lend further support for a specific binding of TBP to TATA box (&#x02013;33, &#x02013;28), we examined the binding efficiency of this TATA box to recombinant TBP by <italic>in vitro</italic> DNase I footprinting assay. An IL-2R&#x003b1; promoter probe was prepared by PCR using <sup>32</sup>P-labeled mCD25-3&#x02032; primer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf291f2">2</xref>B). Highly purified recombinant human TBP efficiently bound to the TATA box (&#x02013;33, &#x02013;28) as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf291f2">2</xref>C. In contrast, only weak protections were observed on TATA boxes (&#x02013;92, &#x02013;87) and (&#x0002b;2, &#x0002b;7). The most dramatic protection by TBP on TATA box (&#x02013;33, &#x02013;28) correlated with increased methylation of guanine &#x02013;25 in CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> thymocytes.

Purified CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> thymocytes from Rag<sup>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</sup> mice or CD25<sup>&#x02013;</sup> thymocytes from WT mice were treated with formaldehyde to cross-link protein&#x02013;protein and protein&#x02013;DNA complexes. Following precipitation by specific antibodies against Pol II and TBP, the IL-2R&#x003b1; promoter fragment present in the immunoprecipitates was identified by PCR amplification.

TBP and Pol II were permanently associated with the CD3&#x0025b; promoter constitutively active at the DN and DP stages. In contrast, neither TBP nor Pol II fixation was found in the inactive Oct-2 promoter. Comparison of the recruitment of TBP and Pol II with the IL-2R&#x003b1; promoter in the DN and DP stages evidenced that repression of IL-2R&#x003b1; expression at the DP stage correlates with dissociation of TBP and RNA Pol II holoenzyme in DP thymocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Recruitment of histone acetyl transferases and ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex to the IL-2R&#x003b1; core promoter region <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>Besides the interactions of basal transcription machinery and site-specific activators, it has become widely accepted that modification of chromatin structure is an important regulatory mechanism. Nucleosome assembly appears to eliminate the ability of the general transcription factors such as TFIID and the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme to interact with promoter sequences. Thus, efficient transcription initiation by the basal transcription machinery requires the recruitment of components of the chromatin remodeling complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c42">42</xref>). Chromatin modifying activities involve two general classes of protein complexes which differ in whether or not they use covalent modification to alter chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c43">43</xref>). The first class consists of the HATs and histone deacetylases which respectively modify covalently the N-terminal tails of nucleosomal histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c44">44</xref>). The mammalian GCN5&#x0002f;PCAF and the CBP&#x0002f;p300 proteins bear HAT activities and function as coactivators of transcription by the recruitment to promoters via their interaction with various DNA binding proteins. The second class consists of the ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes which facilitate the accessibility to DNA, altering chromatin structure by changing the location or conformation of the nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c45">45</xref>). Among them, the multi-subunit complex SWI&#x0002f;SNF contains eight or more polypeptides in which the DNA-dependent ATPase is either the BRG1 or BRM1 protein.</p><p>Since Pol II and TBP were bound to the IL-2R&#x003b1; core promoter at the activated stage, we investigated the <italic>in vivo</italic> recruitment of CBP, p300 and GCN5&#x0002f;PCAF as well as of BRG1. Surprisingly, we found CBP and PCAF constitutively associated to the IL-2R&#x003b1; promoter both in the activated and suppressive stages whereas p300 and BRG1 were only recruited in CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> thymocytes from Rag<sup>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</sup> mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf291f4">4</xref>). The constitutive binding of CBP and PCAF correlated with the DNA accessibility to DNase I digestion both in the DN and DP stages whereas the dissociation of p300 and BRG1 correlated with the disengagement of the basal transcription machinery and IL-2R&#x003b1; down-regulation in Rag<sup>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</sup>, TCR&#x003b2;<sup>Tg</sup> mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Histone acetylation and phosphorylation correlates with the transcriptional regulation of the mouse CD25&#x0002f;IL-2R&#x003b1; promoter</title><p>N-terminal tail modifications of nucleosomal histones play a central role in transcription regulation allowing for dynamic changes in the accessibility of the underlying genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c46">46</xref>). According to the recruitment of CBP, PCAF and p300 to IL-2R&#x003b1; promoter, the status of the histone proteins bound to this region was investigated by ChIP assay performed with anti-AcH3, anti-AcH4 and anti-pH3 antibodies. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf291f5">5</xref>A and C shows that H3 and H4 bound to IL-2R&#x003b1; promoter were highly acetylated at DN stage. In contrast, H3 and H4 acetylation levels were dramatically reduced in CD25<sup>&#x02013;</sup> thymocytes from Rag<sup>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</sup>, CD3-treated mice whereas both histones associated with the constitutively active CD3&#x0025b; promoter were highly acetylated at both the DN and DP stages. As a negative control, H3 associated with the silent Oct-2 promoter was very weakly acetylated. Surprisingly, H4 bound to this inactive promoter was acetylated at both the DN and DP stages during T-cell development (data not shown). To exclude a lack of specificity of acetylated H4 binding, we used the inactive MyoD promoter as a negative control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c37">37</xref>). H3 bound to the IL-2R&#x003b1; promoter was also phosphorylated in CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> but much less in CD25<sup>&#x02013;</sup> thymocytes. As expected, phosphorylated H3 bound to the active D&#x003b2;-1 promoter in CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD25<sup>&#x02013;</sup> thymocytes (Spicuglia,S. and Ferrier,P., unpublished results). These observations evidenced that acetylation of H3 and H4, and phosphorylation of H3 associated with the IL-2R&#x003b1; promoter region, were strongly reduced when the gene was repressed during the DN to DP transition. Hence, chromatin modification in the vicinity of the core promoter region corresponds to the expression pattern of the IL-2R&#x003b1; gene during T-cell development in thymus.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we have investigated the identity of proteins associated with IL-2R&#x003b1; promoter accessibility during T-cell development. Our studies have revealed that TATA box (&#x02013;33, &#x02013;28) in the IL-2R&#x003b1; core promoter is specifically occupied in the DN thymocytes from Rag<sup>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</sup> mice. IL-2R&#x003b1; expression at the CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DN stage correlated with the specific recruitment of the basal transcription machinery components TBP and Pol II as well as the HAT coactivators CPB, p300 and PCAF, and the DNA-dependent ATPase BRG1, a component of the SWI&#x0002f;SNF chromatin remodeling complex. After undergoing selection for productive TCR&#x003b2; chain rearrangements and pre-TCR signaling, developing thymocytes proceed to the proliferation stage and dramatically down-regulate CD25&#x0002f;IL-2R&#x003b1; expression very rapidly. Down-regulation of IL-2R&#x003b1; transcription after pre-TCR signal correlates with (i) loss of the basal transcriptional machinery, (ii) disassociation of chromatin remodeling complexes and (iii) histone N-termini dephosphorylation and deacetylation on the core promoter region. However, the silenced IL-2R&#x003b1; gene still maintains the accessibility to its proximal promoter&#x0002f;enhancer region. This accessibility correlates with constitutive binding of PCAF and CBP and may enable rapid re-activation of IL-2R&#x003b1; in response to T-cell activation signals.</p><p>Modification of histone tails appears to act in concert as &#x02018;signaling platforms&#x02019;, providing a molecular code for the specific recruitment of transcription factors and coactivators to core promoter (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c46">46</xref>). For example, the acetylated histone N-termini interact with HAT and TAFII250 bromodomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c48">48</xref>) but also most probably with the bromodomain of BRG1&#x0002f;BRM proteins present in the SWI&#x0002f;SNF complex. BRG1 recruitment in DN thymocytes is in agreement with a role in chromatin remodeling for the SWI&#x0002f;SNF complex that allows association of TBP and Pol II holoenzyme, completion of PIC assembly at IL-2R&#x003b1; core promoter and initiation of transcription. The engagement of CBP, p300 and PCAF, which possess intrinsic HAT activity, raises the question of functional redundancy. The dissociation of p300 after the DN to DP transition and the maintenance of CBP and PCAF suggest that each cofactor exerts a distinct and non-redundant role in IL-2R&#x003b1; gene regulation. Several lines of evidence indeed point to functional differences between these three cofactors (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c49">49</xref>). p300 engagement correlated with the level of H3 and H4 acetylation and with TBP, Pol II and BRG1 recruitment to the active IL-2R&#x003b1; promoter. In contrast, CBP and PCAF constitutive binding and the presence of a constitutive DH site appear to participate in the maintenance of a pre-assembled nucleo-protein complex at the IL-2R&#x003b1; promoter in order to allow a rapid response to the incoming stimuli characteristic of mature T-cell activation. Accordingly, maintenance of activator proteins at specific promoters in yeast has already been reported despite their silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c50">50</xref>).</p><p>We have previously reported a correlation between pre-commitment to activation and detection of stable occupancy by <italic>in vivo</italic> footprinting within IL-2R&#x003b1; PRRI enhancer in human mature T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c22">22</xref>). Such T-cell-specific footprints were not observed in the murine DN, DP and WT thymocytes analyzed in the present study, suggesting that transcriptional activation of IL-2R&#x003b1; in DN thymocytes and its down-modulation in DP thymocytes depend on different molecular mechanisms than those involved in mature peripheral blood T cells While further comparative analysis is required to identify the common and divergent peculiarities of Il-2R&#x003b1; gene regulation in thymocytes and mature T cells, our results are in agreement with a previous report evidencing an independent regulation of IL-2R&#x003b1; expression in primary and secondary lymphoid organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c31">31</xref>). Among the common features, the same TATA box seems to be used in thymocytes and peripheral T cells, whereas the promoter region contains four putative TATA boxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c51">51</xref>). The location of the two constitutive DH sites observed in thymocytes appear also identical to two previously reported DH sites in immature T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c39">39</xref>). However, the distal site apparently corresponding to the so-called PRRIII&#x0002f;IL-2rE was apparently inducible upon IL-2 stimulation in mature T cells whereas IL-2R&#x003b1; expression is independent of IL-2 during the early stage of ontogeny. Furthermore, we failed to detect any significant modification of the two NF-&#x003ba;B-binding sites within murine IL-2R&#x003b1;&#x0002f;PRRI suggesting that transcriptional activation of the IL-2R&#x003b1; gene at the DN stage in thymus may be NF-&#x003ba;B-independent while activation of NF-&#x003ba;B has been associated with IL-2R&#x003b1; gene expression in mature T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c52">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c54">54</xref>). Furthermore, none of the other identified regulatory elements within murine IL-2R&#x003b1;&#x0002f;PRRI and PRRIII (data not shown) were found occupied by <italic>in vivo</italic> footprinting. However, HAT and SWI&#x0002f;SNF complexes lack sequence-specific DNA binding, and are therefore thought to be recruited to specific promoters via interactions with specific DNA binding proteins. The site-specific transcriptional activators required for IL-2R&#x003b1; gene activation at the DN stage in thymus remain to be identified.</p><p>Whereas both the mature TCR and the pre-TCR can trigger anti-apoptotic events and proliferative signals, the pre-TCR triggers several additional outcomes, including termination of TCR&#x003b2; locus rearrangements and induction of CD4 and CD8 expression (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c56">56</xref>). The pre-TCR-driven transition from the DN to DP compartment characterized by CD25 transient expression appears as a multi-branched program, involving distinct transduction pathways which can either activate gene expression such as TCR&#x003b1;, CD4 and CD8 or repress other genes such as RAG, germline V&#x003b2;, preT&#x003b1; and IL-2R&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c20">20</xref>). In agreement with a direct role of pre-TCR signaling in its repression, IL-2R&#x003b1; expression persisted to the DP stage in thymocytes expressing specifically &#x003b2;-catenin in the absence of pre-TCR signaling in RAG-2<sup>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c57">57</xref>). Because of the crucial role of the IL-2&#x0002f;IL-2R system in the regulation of the magnitude and duration of T-cell immune response, inactivation of the IL-2R&#x003b1; gene by pre-TCR signal in thymus is required to ensure the specificity of T-cell responses in the periphery. Indeed, most of the biologic effects of IL-2 are mediated through its high affinity receptor as evidenced by the almost identical phenotype of mice with targeted inactivation of the genes for IL-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c58">58</xref>) and IL-2R&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c9">9</xref>). Beside its controversial role in thymocyte maturation, IL-2R&#x003b1; provides a convenient model for the characterization of the molecular mechanisms involved in transcription repression by pre-TCR signaling. The absence of significant DMS footprinting on the known transcriptional regulatory elements within murine IL-2R&#x003b1; PRRI suggests that transcription factors different from those involved in mature T lymphocytes ensure IL-2R&#x003b1; activation and repression during thymocyte differentiation.</p><p>Gene-targeting studies have demonstrated the crucial role as a transcriptional repressor played by Ikaros in regulating multiple stages of B- and T-cell development (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c60">60</xref>). A putative target sequence has been identified overlapping the PRRI NF-&#x003ba;B binding site conserved in human and mouse IL-2R&#x003b1; genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c61">61</xref>). However, we failed to observe any significant occupancy within this region and several lines of evidence seem to exclude a role for Ikaros in IL-2R&#x003b1; repression during ontogeny and in mature T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c62">62</xref>). Alternatively, activation or repression of genes may be regulated by activators or repressors which recognize the chromatin structure, such as SATB1 which appears to orchestrate the temporal and spatial expression of genes during T-cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c63">63</xref>). In SATB1-null mice, IL-2R&#x003b1; is ectopically transcribed in DP thymocytes strongly suggesting that SATB1 acts as a repressor during ontogeny. However, no functional SATB1-binding site has been identified so far in the regulatory regions of the murine IL-2R&#x003b1;. Further work is required to clarify these issues.</p><p>In summary, we evidenced for the first time that IL-2R&#x003b1; repression during thymocyte differentiation is characterized by major reorganization of the transcription machinery and chromatin modifications associated with the IL-2R&#x003b1; promoter in response to pre-TCR signaling. Furthermore, our studies provide another example that the particular order by which the chromatin-modifying activities are recruited and&#x0002f;or function to allow gene activation might be gene specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf291c64">64</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf291f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Analysis of the promoter of the mouse IL-2R&#x003b1; gene during T-cell development by DNase hypersensitivity assay.
