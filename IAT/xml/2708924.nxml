The pathways of caspase activation due to binding/partial assembly by &#x003b1;-HL are unknown till date.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Cells treated with H35N (a mutant of &#x003b1;-HL that remains as membrane bound monomer), have been shown to accumulate hypodiploid nuclei, activate caspases and induce intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. We have earlier shown that the binding and assembly of &#x003b1;-HL requires functional form of Caveolin-1 which is an integral part of caveolae. In this report, we show that the caveolae of mammalian cells, which undergo a continuous cycle of &#x02018;kiss and run&#x02019; dynamics with the plasma membrane, have become immobile upon the binding of the monomer. The cells treated with H35N were unable to recover despite activation of membrane repair mechanism involving caspase-1 dependent activation of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This is for the first time we show the range of cellular changes and responses that take place immediately after the binding of the monomeric form of staphylococcal &#x003b1;-hemolysin.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Binding of pore forming toxins such as staphylococcal &#x003b1;-HL can cause significant changes in cellular signaling of many cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006293-Kahl1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006293-Nuzzo1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The water soluble form of this protein binds to the target cell as a monomer which then recruits other such monomers (which have undergone conformational changes in a similar fashion) to form a non-lytic, pre-pore assembly. This pre-pore assembly then undergoes further conformational changes to form a heptameric, mushroom like transmembrane pore to destabilize the membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006293-Song1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Formation of transmembrane pores on the target cells result in osmotic imbalance of the cell leading to death by necrotic pathway. &#x003b1;-HL's assembly on Jurkat cells resulted in necrotic form of cell death even though caspases were found to be active <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006293-Bantel1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006293-Essmann1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. An intriguing question that remained unanswered as to how the caspases are activated by &#x003b1;-HL's assembly? The answer probably lies in the nature of the structural form of &#x003b1;-HL that is present on the cell surface as the presence of functional pore on the target cell membrane is anticipated to result in osmotic imbalance and necrotic form of cell death. Theoretically, when &#x003b1;-HL binds to the target cell, all the three forms, <italic>viz.</italic>, the cell bound monomer, the non-lytic pre-pore and the lytic pore can be present as only a fraction of the bound &#x003b1;-HL undergoes all the conformational changes to form the lytic pore. The precise nature of disturbances in the cellular signaling, caused by the other two non functional forms, i.e. the membrane bound monomer and the non-lytic pre-pore forms of &#x003b1;-HL are still not clear. In order to understand the changes in cellular signaling due to the membrane bound monomeric form of &#x003b1;-HL, we have employed a mutant, <italic>viz.</italic>, H35N (Histidine 35 mutated to Aspargine) that cannot assemble beyond membrane bound monomer although it folds like the wild type protein. The Histidine-35 of &#x003b1;-HL is essential for efficient inter-protomer interactions during the oligomerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006293-Krishnasastry1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. In the present study, we demonstrate that the H35N arrests the dynamics of caveolae at the cell surface, initiates the membrane repair pathway. Probably due to absence of adequate repair response, the target cells induced apoptosis via the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Annexin-V-FITC apoptosis detection kit was obtained from Calbiochem.

The cells were transfected with Cav-1-GFP DNA (1 &#x000b5;g) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, USA) as per the manufacturer's suggestions. Before 12&#x02013;14 hr of the TIRF recording, the cells were transferred to phenol red free DMEM medium and just before the recording the cover glass was transferred to an Atto chamber and placed in about 800 &#x000b5;l of the same medium. The cells were examined for background and optimal expression of Cav-1-GFP. We have routinely selected cells that showed sub-optimal to optimal expression of Cav-1-GFP to observe clear, distinct dynamics as shown in the videos (over expression leads to excessive signal at the cell surface which obstructs the observations). Video streams of caveolae dynamics were acquired in an Olympus IX-81 TIRF microscope. The Cav-1-GFP was excited with a 488 nm Ar laser and the emission signal was collected through emission filter specific for GFP and images were recorded with a Cascade 512B camera after adjusting the total internal reflection angle. A 100X, PlanApo, N.A. 1.4, TIRF objective was used for all acquisitions. All the recordings were made using 10 MHz digitizer with EM gain of 3(4X) and exposure time of 50 msec. The laser power was adjusted with neutral density filters present in-line which provided about 20&#x00025; of the full power. The shutter of the Ar laser was open only during the recording (90-100 frames at 22&#x02013;24 frames per second) and all other parameters such as laser intensity, EM gain of the camera, exposure time, frame rate and length of recording remained constant throughout the experiment.

The present study is aimed at understanding the full range of changes that take place and their influence on cellular signaling soon after the binding of the staphylococcal &#x003b1;-HL to target cells. We have carried out the present study with the help of H35N mutant of &#x003b1;-HL, an oligomerization deficient mutant of the toxin.

JC-1 is readily taken up by mitochondria of healthy cells as a monomer. This uptake increases the concentration of the JC-1 inside the mitochondria leading to the formation JC-1 aggregates which appear greenish red, whereas, depolarized mitochondria do not accumulate JC-1 which remains in the cytoplasm as green colored monomer. Therefore, increase in green to red ratio symbolizes depolarization of mitochondria. H35N treatment showed a time dependent increase in green/red fluorescence intensity of A431 cells loaded with the JC-1 dye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006293-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). It is known that cytochrome C release from intermembraneous space of mitochondria into the cytosol is one of the key event in the activation of caspase-9, which subsequently initiates the caspase cascade. Since H35N induces the activation of caspase-9, we also investigated for the cytochrome C release in the cytosolic fraction after H35N treatment in order to define the upstream event in H35N induced apoptosis. Immunoblot analysis clearly showed a time dependent increase in cytochrome C release whereas &#x003b1;-HL showed a marginal increase in cytochrome C release as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006293-g005">Fig. 5</xref>. The mitochondrial membrane depolarization and release of cytochrome C signify that the apoptotic cell death, induced by H35N, proceeds via an intrinsic pathway.

Cell death could not be inhibited by broad spectrum caspase inhibitor, zVADfmk as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006293-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>. However, we have also examined the morphology of the H35N induced cell death in presence of zVADfmk by FACS analysis. The decrease in the forward light scatter of cells treated with H35N in presence of zVADfmk indicated that the cell death resembled apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006293-g006">Fig. 6B-D</xref>). In light of this observation, we have also investigated the nuclear morphology of the H35N treated cells in presence of zVADfmk. Interestingly, we observed that there was only partial nuclear condensation in presence of zVADfmk in H35N treated cells as compared to H35N treated cells without zVADfmk, which displayed chromatin condensation along with nuclear shrinkage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006293-g006">Fig. 6E</xref>). One possible candidate that mediates partial nuclear condensation without shrinkage is Apoptosis Inducing Factor (AIF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006293-Loeffler1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006293-Susin1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. It is believed that once mitochondria are irreversibly permeabilised, cell death proceeds regardless of caspase activity. AIF is a mitochondrial flavoprotein which localizes in mitochondrial intermembrane space where it performs oxidoreductase function. However, when the mitochondrial membrane gets depolarized, it is released into the cytosol, gets translocated to the nucleus and triggers high molecular weight DNA (50 kb) fragmentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006293-Loeffler1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006293-Susin1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. The mitochondrial-nuclear translocation of AIF was not prevented by broad spectrum caspase inhibitor zVADfmk nor did it prevents its lethal effect indicating that this protein is involved in caspase independent cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006293-Daugas1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, it has already been shown that the low dose of &#x003b1;-HL which efficiently induce caspase activation in Jurkat T cells, markedly induced high molecular weight DNA breaks along with oligonuleosomal DNA fragmentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006293-Essmann1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

Based on the present and published data so far, the reason for caspase activation might be as follows: when &#x003b1;-HL binds to the target cells, only a fraction of the protein converts to lytic pore, while a substantial amount of protein remains as membrane bound monomer and as non-lytic, pre-pore. In the absence of both the pre-pore and the functional pore, our data clearly highlights the activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Hence, it is possible that the membrane bound monomer activates the intrinsic apoptotic pathway while a successful functional pore assembly results in classical, necrotic form of death. However, the causes for the induction of apoptotic pathway are unclear, as the H35N can neither undergo large scale conformational changes nor it is efficient in inducing membrane damage.</p></sec><sec id="s3h"><title>Link between &#x003b1;-HL binding and caveolae</title><p>In our earlier work, we have provided several evidences by biochemical analysis and molecular modeling that the &#x003b1;-HL can interact with the scaffolding domain of Caveolin-1 (Cav-1; amino acids 81&#x02013;101) through its 9 amino acid binding motif &#x02018;W<sup>179</sup>GPYDRDSW<sup>187</sup>&#x02019; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006293-Pany1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

It is important to know the event that occurs between 2 hr and 8 hr. The blockade of caveolae dynamics by &#x003b1;-HL and H35N, described above, might be one of the first events that occur after binding of the toxin to the membrane. At this stage, we anticipated either of the two major events to occur: 1. The toxin treated cells may undergo a repair mechanism. 2. And if the repair mechanism is not adequate to mount an effective survival response, the cell death might get initiated. Recently, Gurcel et. al have shown that binding of &#x003b1;-HL on HeLa cells initiated the activation of caspase-1 via the inflammasome pathway by translocation of Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein (SREBP) to the nucleus which in turn promotes cell survival upon toxin challenge. SREBPs are membrane bound transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes harboring the sterol reponse elelment (SRE) in their promoter region which are involved in cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis. SREBPs reside in the ER and are converted into the mature form by S1P and S2P. Mature SREBPs then migrate to the nucleus and induce the transcription of lipogenic genes which in turn promote cell survival in response to the toxin induced damage of cell membrane. An important point to note from the work presented by Gurcel et. al is that they have used low concentration of the toxin under which all cells excluded propidium iodide for 10 hr. We would like to emphasize here that after the binding of the toxin to the cell surface, only a fraction of the &#x003b1;-HL converts itself to the heptameric form (membrane damageable form) while a substantial portion of the bound &#x003b1;-HL remains as a membrane bound monomer and some as pre-non-lytic pore. Hence, the presence of the membrane bound monomer in their experiments is inevitable. In order to examine the role of the membrane bound monomer's ability to induce membrane damage, we examined the activation and translocation of SREBP-1 protein in HeLa cells post H35N treatment. We observed that after 7 hr of H35N treatment, there is noticeable translocation of the SREBP-1 protein to the nucleus as compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006293-g012">Fig. 12</xref>). The translocation of SREBP-1 from ER to the nucleus was further confirmed by immunoblotting. In Untreated cells, full length SREBP-1 was found in the membrane fraction and the amount of full length SREBP-1 decreased upon H35N treatment from the membrane fraction with the appearance of mature SREBP-1 in the nuclear fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006293-g013">Fig. 13A</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0006293-g012" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006293.g012</object-id><label>Figure 12</label><caption><title>H35N induces translocation of SREBP-1 to the nucleus:</title><p>HeLa cells were treated with H35N or &#x003b1;-HL for the following time points and stained with SREBP-1 antibody as mentioned in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">materials and methods</xref>.

Once activated, caspase-1 induces the intermediate targets which then mediate the processing of SREBPs by S1P and S2P. We therefore analysed the effect of H35N on caspase-1. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006293-g013">Fig. 13B</xref>, H35N treatment lead to the processing of procaspase-1 with time. Although many details of this pathway still remain to be elucidated, our data indicate that the cells, post H35N treatment, initiated the survival pathway to recover from the H35N induced damage. It must be mentioned here that the notable event that occurred after the binding of H35N was loss of caveolae dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006293-g010">Fig. 10</xref>). Hence, it is reasonable to speculate that the loss of caveolae dynamics or dys-regulated dynamics of caveolae was sensed as damage by the host cell.</p><p>We believe that the repair response seen in case of HeLa cells was inadequate, hence the reason for initiation of apoptosis by the host cell. Based on the published data so far, it is not clear regarding the initial events and/or the nature of yet to be identified intermediate events that activate the inflammasome pathway. In the present study, we have also treated HeLa cells with &#x003b1;-HL and within 45 min there was a complete blockade of caveolae dynamics. Thus, our work provides valuable insight into the first steps of this pathway. Although, there are several missing links between caveolae trafficking and inflammasome activation.</p><p>In brief, the data available on the cell membrane repair and its consequences have been summarized in the schematic representation shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006293-g014">Fig. 14</xref>. When &#x003b1;-HL binds as membrane bound monomer, the caveolae are arrested at the cell surface within 2 hr. This marks the beginning of stress in the form of Caveolin-1 and p38 phosphorylation. Once the cell senses the stress, it activates the Caspase-1 between 2-7 hr which results in translocation of SREBP-1 from ER to nucleus to initiate the transcription of lipogenic genes. If this attempt is successful, the affected cell might survive. In case, the cell's responses are inadequate, it probably can not restore the caveolae dynamics and eventually the apoptotic death pathway gets initiated after 8 hr via the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. p38MAP kinase activation is also shown to activate the survival pathway in non immune cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006293-Huffman1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. It is assumed that the pathway observed by us is same as that of the one shown by Gurcel and co-workers since vital events observed by all of us are same. It is not clear about the exact role of KIAA0999 and MAP3K2 kinases (which are involved in controlling the dynamics of caveolae) at this point of time including its link to the inflammasome pathway activation. In summary, it is becoming clear that caveolae trafficking plays a far greater role in the regulation of cell proliferation and death than is currently known.</p><fig id="pone-0006293-g014" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006293.g014</object-id><label>Figure 14</label><caption><title>Summary of observations known till date regarding the membrane repair mechanism:</title><p>When &#x003b1;-HL begins to assemble, the caveolae are arrested at the cell surface within 45 min. The assembly proceeds through irreversible formation of pre-pore and the final transmembrane pore. Once the cell senses the membrane damage, it activates the inflammasome pathway by activating Caspase-1 and processing and translocation of SREBP from ER to Nucleus to initiate the transcription of lipogenic genes. If this attempt is successful, the cell is expected to survive. In case the cell's responses are inadequate, it appears to activate apoptotic death pathway.
