N363S, ER22/23EK, and Bcl I have been previously described as glucocorticoid-sensitivity modulating polymorphisms.

The choice of steroid depended on course of wound healing and regression. Variations in intraocular pressure (IOP) levels in response to steroid therapy were observed. To genotype DNA, allele-specific PCR amplification was applied for the N363S polymorphism, and PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was performed to examine the Bcl I and the ER22/23EK polymorphisms. We separately analyzed data from three groups of patients: those who received fluorometholone only; those who were initially given fluorometholone then later switched to prednisolone acetate; and those who received prednisolone acetate only. Covariance analysis with forward stepwise variable selection was carried out.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In cases where prednisolone acetate was administered, we found a significant correlation between N363S heterozygosity and steroid-induced ocular hypertension.

Postoperative therapy routinely consists of administration of steroid eye drops, because glucocorticoids (GCs) have a dehydrating effect in the corneal stroma. GCs help maintain refractive stability and inhibits stromal scarring, rethickening, and consequent regression of refraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>] although their molecular mechanism is not clearly known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>]. Topical or systemic administration of GCs may produce a rise in intraocular pressure (IOP), but there is considerable variation in rate of occurrence and side effect severity among individuals with GC sensitivity.</p><p>GC responsiveness occurs in 10-40% of the normal population, and steroid responders are reported to be at increased risk of developing primary open angle glaucoma as compared with nonresponders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. In other clinical studies, occurrence of ocular hypertension in healthy individuals was about 7% in case of four-week long administration of fluorometholone and 35-40% in case of four-week long administration of dexamethasone or betamethasone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. Similar to dexamethasone, prednisolone acetate has a high propensity to cause ocular hypertension in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>].</p><p>There is a considerable body of evidence to suggest a role for GCs in the pathogenesis of IOP elevation. GC-induced cellular and morphologic changes in trabecular meshwork may affect resistance to aqueous humor outflow and lead to ocular hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>].</p><p>In human eyes, GC and mineralocorticoid receptors were identified in multiple types of tissues. Expression of mRNA of GC receptor was high in the trabecular meshwork and lens epithelium given the effects of GCs in elevated IOP and their ability to induce cataract. Expression of mRNAs encoding mineralocorticoid receptor was high in nonpigmented ciliary epithelium, corneal epithelium, and endothelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. Each of the major cell types of the cornea produces glucocorticoid receptor (GR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>].</p><p>It is presumed that the means by which GCs may lead to elevated intraocular pressure is by induction of molecular changes in the trabecular meshwork, resulting in morphologic changes and a reduction in aqueous outflow. These changes include alterations in extracellular matrix production, cell size, nuclear size, DNA content, cytoskeletal organization, phagocytic activity, and protease activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>].</p><p>GC hormones regulate signal transduction in immune and inflammatory systems as well as in growth and development. GCs exert their effects by binding to and activating GC and mineralocorticoid receptors (GR encoded by nuclear subfamily 3, group C, number 1, NR3C1, GeneID; 2908), which are present also in ocular tissues.</p><p>GR has a series of discrete domains that mediate the receptor functions of hormone-binding, DNA-binding, and transcriptional modulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. The ligand-receptor complex migrates into the nucleus and binds to the specific DNA sequences called GC response elements (GRE) as a dimer, altering the transcription of target genes, which leads to altered synthesis of proteins. The N363S polymorphism of exon 2 (rs6195) resulting in an asparagine-to-serine change at codon 363 was associated with an increased sensitivity to glucocorticoids. The molecular mechanism of the effect of N363S polymorphism is unknown. However, some authors hypothesized that a putative new phosphorylation site may alter the protein interactions with transcription cofactors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. The Bcl I restriction site polymorphism was identified as a C/G substitution in intron 2 (IVS2+647), and the G allele was associated with hypersensitivity to GCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. The exonic ER22/23EK polymorphism (rs6189, rs6190) consists of a synonymous and a nonsynonymous polymorphism. In codon 22 the nucleotide sequence GAG changes to GAA, both coding for glutamic acid (E). In codon 23 the nucleotide triplet AGG changes to AAG resulting in an amino acid change from arginine (R) to lysine (K) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. Previous studies demonstrated ER22/23EK had an association with a hyposensitivity or a relative resistance to GCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>].

The mean preoperative IOP was 16.3 mmHg (range 10-21 mmHg). All patients underwent PRK and received postoperative topical steroids, and gave written consent to participate in the study.</p><p>The following selection criteria were used: (1) preoperative IOP less than or equal to 21 mmHg measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry; (2) no personal or family history of glaucoma; (3) at least two follow-up measurements of IOP, the first measurement later than the 21st day, the last one between 5&#x000b1;1 months after the onset of steroid therapy; and (4) continuous steroid administration until the last studied IOP measurement.

The goal of the operation was to gain emmetropy. Prior to PRK refractive surgery, patients were informed of anticipated refractive changes and possible consequences. Informed consent was obtained from each patient before the procedure. PRK was performed with an Aesculap Meditec Mel 70 and 80, 193 nm argon-fluorid excimer laser (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Each patient was followed up one and five days postoperatively. Reepithelization of the cornea was normal in every case. Patients received topical tobramycin 0.3% five times a day for the first seven days; thereafter, topical fluorometholone 0.1% was started five times daily and continued for six to eight months, in a gradually tapered dose. Patients came every four to six weeks for follow-up visits depending on their status and compliance. In some cases, postoperative therapy was changed to prednisolone acetate 0.5% based on wound-healing response, subepithelial haze, and regression of refraction. Topical prednisolone acetate administration was started if haze graded 1.5 or higher according to Hanna's scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>] and refractive regression was more than -1.25 D.</p><p>To determine whether fluorometholone 0.1% and prednisolone acetate 0.5% raised IOP during postoperative treatment, we divided our study population into three groups: (1) patients treated with fluorometholone only (analysis A1, 132 eyes of 73 patients); (2) patients initially treated with fluorometholone but later switched to prednisolone acetate (analysis A2, 42 eyes of 26 patients); and (3) patients treated with prednisolone acetate only (analysis B, 76 eyes of 38 patients). In analysis A1 and A2, follow-up of the patients started with the date of the initial steroid administration, while in analysis B the follow-up started with the date of switch to prednisolone acetate administration.

It is well known that some patients develop side effects, even on low dose of GCs, whereas others need a high dose to achieve desired results and do not experience any side effects. In ophthalmology, steroid responsiveness was first described in the early 1960s. GC-induced ocular hypertension was observed by Armaly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>] after topical treatment of the eye both in healthy persons with normal IOP and in patients with glaucoma. Differences in ocular response to steroids in humans was believed to be genetically linked [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Intraocular pressure response to steroid drugs of different efficacy</title><p>GCs, such as fluorometholone and prednisolone acetate, normally inhibit wound healing and are capable of decreasing corneal edema. Therefore, these drugs are administered during the postoperative period after excimer laser surgery. Fluorometholone and prednisolone acetate are steroid drugs of different efficacy. Fluorometholone did not raise IOP as much as dexamethasone and prednisolone acetate, which have a higher propensity to cause ocular hypertension. According to clinical observations, fluorometholone 0.1% caused a 6.1&#x000b1;1.4 mmHg (mean&#x000b1;SD) rise, whereas prednisolone acetate 1.0% caused a 10.0&#x000b1;1.7 mmHg (mean&#x000b1;SD) IOP rise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>]. In other clinical study on steroid-responders, a six-week-long treatment with fluorometholone 0.5% produced smaller increases in IOP than did dexamethasone 0.1% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>]. In the study of Leibowitz et al., in the prednisolone-treated group, mean IOP increased significantly from 18.1 to 27.1 mmHg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, we used three groups to examine occurrence of steroid-induced ocular hypertension after fluorometholone and prednisolone acetate treatment. When we analyzed the association of genotypes and steroid-induced ocular hypertension, we found patients who carryied the N363S polymorphism showed significantly higher IOP during prednisolone acetate treatment. IOP is influenced by multiple factors, presumably the interaction of haplotype and environmental effects. Accordingly, in our study clinically significant IOP elevations requiring topical treatment occurred in patients of the wild-type group as well.</p></sec><sec><title>Functional consequences of glucocorticoid receptor polymorphisms</title><p>Previous studies on polymorphisms of the GR gene examined how changes in nucleotide sequence could result in changes in receptor function and in diverse clinical manifestations. Most of the mutations were found to be associated with GC resistance syndromes. However the N363S variant and <italic>Bcl</italic>I restriction site polymorphism resulted in GC hypersensitivity; the ER22/23EK polymorphism was associated with relative resistance to GCs.</p><p>There are at least 16 GR isoforms in a cell, combined with several phosphorylation sites, therefore GR presents an enormous potential for signaling diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>]. Various parameters determine GC responsiveness, and several proteins interact with the GR. The mechanism of GC sensitivity may be elucidated by studies on GR-interacting proteins. Transcriptional activation by GR of target genes is subsequent to ligand binding, conformational changes, contact with chaperones, transcription factors, and other proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>]. Polymorphisms in GR may change the function of GR-interacting proteins, which may influence sensitivity to GCs. These mechanisms may explain variation in responsiveness to GC and GC-induced side effects. The ER22/23EK polymorphism resulted in a significant reduction of transactivating capacity. The N363S polymorphism resulted in a significantly higher transactivating capacity. However, neither the ER22/23EK nor the N363S polymorphism seemed to influence the transrepressing capacity of the GR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Maximal intraocular pressure versus intraocular pressure alteration</title><p>As we evaluated data from this study, we considered whether to take the maximal IOP during follow-up as the dependent variable of the statistical analysis or the individual IOP alteration (maximal IOP minus preoperative IOP). Both analyses were evaluated, which led to a decisive result. When treating IOP alteration as the target of the analysis, the preoperative IOP was a significant covariate with a coefficient of -1.02. As this coefficient was close to -1.0, we concluded it was futile to use the preoperative IOP a predictor of maximal IOP during steroid treatment. Thus, our analysing method of choice targeted the maximal IOP. So the studied factors predict the maximal IOP independently of the preoperative IOP. Although this finding enabled us to carry out a simpler analysis, we do not recommend this analysis method in general. Certain diseases may cause some patients to react in unpredictably.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of previous fluorometholone treatment</title><p>We thought about the fluorometholone 0.1% treatment preceding the prednisolone acetate 0.5% treatment to be the better predictor of steroid response, so we studied its effect in an additional statistical analysis as well. We forced the duration of previous fluorometholone 0.1% treatment variable into the model, excluding it from the stepwise variable selection. The parameter estimate corresponding to previous treatment duration was minor and nonsignificant. Thus the effect of the previous fluorometholone 0.1% treatment seems to be insignificant compared to the effect of prednisolone acetate 0.5% treatment.</p><p>In summary, GCs are drugs commonly used to treat systemic diseases, such as immune diseases, chronic inflammation, or to prevent of rejection of organ grafts. High-dose oral GCs may cause side effects, affecting various organs to different extents. Each subject, when treated with GCs, needs an individually optimized dose to maintain a balance between beneficial and adverse effects. By using genotype to identify high-risk steroid responders may allow for individualized therapy, enabling the avoidance of GC side effects. In order to optimize individual GC treatments, N363S genotyping may become everyday practice.</p><p>In our study of a modest number of cases, we showed that the N363S polymorphism of the GC receptor gene was significantly associated with increased IOP as response to prednisolone acetate 0.5% therapy after PRK. In the future, N363S genotyping before steroid treatment may have a role in preventing steroid-induced high IOP.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was supported by a grant from the Hungarian Ministry of Health (ETT 611/2003) and from the Ministry for Education (OTKA T 037452).
