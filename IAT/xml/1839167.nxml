How the fate of internalized microorganisms is monitored by macrophages, and how that information is integrated to stimulate specific immune responses is not understood. Activation of macrophages with interferon (IFN)&#x02013;&#x003b3; leads to rapid killing and degradation of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Listeria monocytogenes</named-content> in a phagosome, thus preventing escape of bacteria to the cytosol. Here, we show that activated macrophages induce a specific gene expression program to <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. monocytogenes</named-content> degraded in the phago-lysosome. In addition to activation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways, degraded bacteria also activated a TLR-independent transcriptional response that was similar to the response induced by cytosolic <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. monocytogenes</named-content>. More specifically, degraded bacteria induced a TLR-independent IFN-&#x003b2; response that was previously shown to be specific to cytosolic bacteria and not to intact bacteria localized to the phagosome. This response required the generation of bacterial ligands in the phago-lysosome and was largely dependent on nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2), a cytosolic receptor known to respond to bacterial peptidoglycan fragments. The NOD2-dependent response to degraded bacteria required the phagosomal membrane potential and the activity of lysosomal proteases. The NOD2-dependent IFN-&#x003b2; production resulted from synergism with other cytosolic microbial sensors. This study supports the hypothesis that in activated macrophages, cytosolic innate immune receptors are activated by bacterial ligands generated in the phagosome and transported to the cytosol.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Innate immune recognition of microorganisms has a direct impact on the type and the magnitude of the immune response elicited.

However, these observations were based on the response of macrophages that were not activated and consequently weakly bacteriocidal. In vivo, during <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. monocytogenes</named-content> infection, cytokines such as IFN-&#x003b3; act on macrophages to render them highly bacteriocidal and therefore less permissive for <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. monocytogenes</named-content> replication &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030051-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. We reasoned that the bacteriocidal activity of macrophages, such as killing and degradation of bacteria, would directly affect the innate immune response to <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. monocytogenes</named-content> infection. In order to test this hypothesis, we studied the response of IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;activated macrophages to infection with w.t. <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. monocytogenes</named-content> and an LLO-minus mutant. The bacteriocidal activity of macrophages was best demonstrated when peritoneal macrophages were infected with <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. monocytogenes</named-content> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030051-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Growth curves of <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. monocytogenes</named-content> in activated peritoneal macrophages showed dramatic killing of w.t. bacteria. The number of bacteria recovered from the activated peritoneal macrophages decreased during 6 h of infection, while in non-activated peritoneal macrophages, bacteria were subjected to initial killing, but survivors continued to grow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030051-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Infection of peritoneal macrophages with the LLO-minus mutant resulted in killing of bacteria even without IFN-&#x003b3; treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030051-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Unlike in peritoneal macrophages, the bacteriocidal activity of bone marrow&#x02013;derived (BMD) macrophages was less profound and was completely dependent on IFN-&#x003b3; treatment. Growth curves of w.t. <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. monocytogenes</named-content> in IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;activated BMD macrophages showed that IFN-&#x003b3; treatment initially restricted the growth of w.t. <italic>L. monocytogenes,</italic> although bacteria were still able to escape to the cytosol and replicate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030051-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). The bactericidal activity of BMD macrophages was best observed when the cells were infected with the LLO-minus mutant. Like in peritoneal macrophages, a one-log decrease in the number of LLO-minus bacteria was recovered after 6 h of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030051-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Since BMD macrophages killed phagosomal-trapped bacteria only upon IFN-&#x003b3; activation, and w.t. <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. monocytogenes</named-content> were still able to escape to the cytosol in activated BMD macrophages, we chose to use these cells to study further the effect of the bacteriocidal activity on the innate immune response to <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. monocytogenes</named-content>. To examine whether <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. monocytogenes</named-content> were subjected to lysis in phagosomes, activated BMD macrophages were infected with w.t. <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. monocytogenes</named-content> or an LLO-minus mutant expressing cytosolic&#x02013;green fluorescent protein (GFP). Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that at 6 hours post-infection (h.p.i.), most w.t. bacteria were cytosolic, as many of them were engaged with actin tails, showed by co-localization of the GFP bacteria with the actin marker rhodamine-phalloidin. Only a few w.t. bacteria were labeled just with GFP, suggesting that they were trapped in the phagosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030051-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). Infection with a GFP-expressing LLO-minus mutant revealed that non-activated macrophages contained one to two intact GFP-expressing bacteria per cell, whereas in activated macrophages the GFP was released from the bacteria and distributed in multiple vacuoles around the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030051-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). While we don't know the precise composition of these vacuoles, co-localization of some of the GFP-labeled vacuoles with the pH-sensitive dye LysoTracker RED suggested that they might have originated from the primary phagosome during its maturation to a phago-lysosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030051-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). As a control, w.t. <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. monocytogenes</named-content> did not localize with LysoTracker RED labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030051-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). These results indicated that macrophage activation led to an enhanced degradative activity and trafficking of host-generated bacterial ligands, which potentially can be sensed by the innate immune system.</p><p>In order to study the innate immune response of activated macrophages to <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. monocytogenes</named-content> infection, we used Mouse Exonic Evidence Based Oligonucleotide (MEEBO) microarrays &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030051-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. Analysis of the gene expression profiles of IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;activated and non-activated BMD macrophages infected with w.t. <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. monocytogenes</named-content> and an LLO-minus mutant were performed. Consistent with previous studies, the response of non-activated macrophages to infection with w.t. <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. monocytogenes</named-content> and the LLO-minus mutant clustered into three groups of genes: i) genes that are largely induced by w.t. cytosolic bacteria (i.e. cytosolic-induced genes), ii) genes that are largely induced by phagosomal LLO-minus bacteria (i.e., phagosomal-induced genes), and iii) genes that are induced by both cytosolic and phagosomal bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030051-g001">Figure 1</xref>D; 253 genes vary &#x0003e; 5.6-fold). Analysis of these genes in IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;activated macrophages infected with w.t. or LLO-minus bacteria reveled that many of the genes that were cytosolic or phagosomal-specific in non-activated macrophages were induced by both bacteria in IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;activated macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030051-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). As expected, w.t. <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. monocytogenes</named-content> triggered expression of genes from the &#x0201c;phagosomal-specific genes&#x0201d; category in the activated macrophages. Under these conditions, some w.t. bacteria failed to escape to the cytosol and remained trapped in the phagosome; consequently, they induced phagosomal-specific genes as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030051-g001">Figure 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030051-g001">1</xref>C). Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)&#x02013;12 and IL-1&#x003b1;, which are normally induced by LLO-minus bacteria, were highly induced by w.t. cytosolic bacteria in activated macrophages compared to non-activated macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030051-g001">Figure 1</xref>E). Conversely, LLO-minus bacteria induced many &#x0201c;cytosolic-specific genes&#x0201d; upon activation of macrophages, including the most highly induced gene in the macrophages' response to w.t. <italic>L. monocytogenes,</italic> IFN-&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030051-g001">Figure 1</xref>E). Like IFN-&#x003b2;, other cytosolic-specific genes that are normally induced by w.t. bacteria, such as IL-15, chemokine CXC ligand 11, chemokine C-C receptor like 2, and type I IFN&#x02013;related genes, were also induced by LLO-minus bacteria in activated macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030051-g001">Figure 1</xref>E). Interestingly, IFN-&#x003b2; was among the 20 most induced genes in activated macrophages infected with LLO-minus mutant (out of 12,344 genes total), together with Nos2, ubiquitin D, and C-C receptor like 2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030051-st001">Table S1</xref>). Since the IFN-&#x003b2; response to w.t. <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. monocytogenes</named-content> is well established, we were interested in whether the IFN-&#x003b2; response to LLO-minus bacteria shares common signaling pathways. Further validation of IFN-&#x003b2; induction by the LLO-minus mutant in activated macrophages was performed using quantative real-time PCR (Q-RT-PCR) analysis. A time course analysis of <italic>ifn&#x003b2;</italic> expression during w.t. <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. monocytogenes</named-content> infection demonstrated that <italic>ifn&#x003b2;</italic> induction increased 10-fold in activated macrophages compared to non-activated macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030051-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Upon infection with an LLO-minus mutant, activated macrophages induced <italic>ifn&#x003b2;</italic> to the same level as in response to w.t. <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. monocytogenes</named-content> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030051-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). This was also the case when activated peritoneal macrophages were infected with the LLO-minus mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030051-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). These results demonstrated that bacteria trapped in the degradative phago-lysosomes of activated macrophages trigger the induction of IFN-&#x003b2;, a response seen in non-activated macrophages only by bacteria able to access the cytosol. An obvious consequence of bacterial degradation is the release of bacterial ligands, such as nucleic acids, that are not normally exposed by either live bacteria or killed, but non-degraded, bacteria. It is possible that these bacterial degradation products triggered the induction of IFN-&#x003b2; by activated macrophages infected with LLO-minus mutant.</p><p>Since several TLRs are known to induce IFN-&#x003b2; through the adaptor molecules MyD88 and Trif, we used macrophages isolated from mice lacking each one of these adaptors to examine their role in the IFN-&#x003b2; response to degraded bacteria. Whereas <italic>ifn&#x003b2;</italic> induction was slightly reduced in <italic>Trif</italic>-deficient macrophages, it was completely abolished in MyD88-deficient macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030051-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). However, examination of IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;activated <italic>myd88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> macrophages infected with LLO-minus GFP-expressing mutants revealed a defect in bacterial degradation. While in C57BL/6 macrophages, bacteria were lysed as shown by GFP distribution, in MyD88-deficient macrophages the LLO-minus mutant remained intact even 6 h.p.i (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030051-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Growth curves of the LLO-minus mutant in MyD88-deficient activated macrophages revealed a slight decrease in bacterial colony-forming units (CFUs) when compared to non-activated macrophages, suggesting that MyD88-deficient macrophages have a defect in killing of the LLO-minus mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030051-sg001">Figure S1</xref>).

In order to test whether degradation of bacteria is a prerequisite for IFN-&#x003b2; induction by LLO-minus mutants, we treated activated macrophages with bafilomycin A, a specific inhibitor of the vacuolar ATPase proton pump (V-ATPase). Bafilomycin A inhibits phagosome acidification and blocks maturation of phagosomes to phago-lysosomes. Bafilomycin A&#x02013;treated macrophages indeed failed to degrade internalized LLO-minus mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030051-g004">Figure 4</xref>A), and did not induce <italic>ifn&#x003b2;</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030051-g004">Figure 4</xref>B), whereas this treatment had no effect on induction of <italic>ifn&#x003b2;</italic> by cytosolic <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. monocytogenes</named-content> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030051-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). To distinguish between the requirement of degradation of bacteria or of acidification of the phagosome for IFN-&#x003b2; signaling, we used alternative endosomal acidification inhibitors, monensin or nigericin, which act differently than bafilomycin A.

We asked whether the phagosomal membrane potential was important for IFN-&#x003b2; signaling. In order to address this question, we dissipated the phagosomal membrane potential of monensin-treated cells by using the K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-specific ionophor valinomycin. Valinomycin transports K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ions in accordance with existing chemical gradients, which together with monensin treatment results in leakage of accumulated K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ions from the phagosome to the cytosol and, consequently, depolarization of the phagosomal membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030051-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). Treatment of valinomycin resulted in lower levels of <italic>ifn&#x003b2;</italic> induction, although it did not affect degradation of bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030051-g004">Figure 4</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030051-g004">4</xref>D).

Importantly, NOD2 dependency was specific for a subset of cytokines like IFN-&#x003b2;, as other cytokines like IL-12p40, which are induced by TLRs, were unaffected by the NOD2 mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030051-g004">Figure 4</xref>E).</p><p>Recently, it was demonstrated that potassium ion flux plays a role in the activation of several proteases in the phagocytic vacuole of neutrophils &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030051-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. Since treatment with monensin generates an influx of potassium ions into the phagosome, we were interested in whether lysosomal proteases play a role in the enhancement of IFN-&#x003b2; signaling by monensin treatment. In order to test this hypothesis, we treated cells with the protease inhibitor, chymostatin, which inhibits lysosomal serine and cysteine proteinases and several cathepsins.

Whereas in non-activated macrophages we could detect intact bacteria, in activated macrophages the FL-Van PGN labeling was distributed in large vacuoles, most likely due to bacterial cell wall (CW) breakdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030051-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). The FL-Van PGN labeling was localized to acidic vacuoles determined by LysoTracker RED staining (not shown).

The delivery of CW fragments and MDP to the macrophages cytosol was mediated by lipofectamine, which resulted in a 5-fold increase in the response to these ligands.

In vivo, IFN-&#x003b3; has a major role in controlling <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. monocytogenes</named-content> infection. By activating immune cells such as macrophages, IFN-&#x003b3; enhances the bacteriocidal activity of macrophages and renders them less permissive to <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. monocytogenes</named-content> replication. In this study, we used the LLO-minus mutant to ask whether the bacteriocidal activity of macrophages has a role in the innate immune response to <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. monocytogenes</named-content> infection. Here, we show that phagosomal-degraded bacteria induce a specific innate immune response that is different than the response to phagosomal intact bacteria. We found that phagosomal-degraded bacteria induced type I IFN, a response that was previously shown to be specific to intracellularly growing <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. monocytogenes</named-content>.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that bacterial breakdown products generated in the phago-lysosome are targets for intracellular innate immune sensors. This study suggests that induction of IFN-&#x003b2; in response to <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. monocytogenes</named-content> in vivo might result from two distinct signaling pathways, one of them largely dependent on NOD2 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030051-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;.

Although MDP (MurNAc-<sc>l</sc>-Ala-<sc>d</sc>-Gln) was shown to be the minimal motif recognized by NOD2, the natural ligand(s) sensed by NOD2 in vivo are not known. Mammals and bacteria contain muramidases, like lysozyme, or in the case of bacteria, lytic transglycosylases, that can generate muropeptide analogs of MDP such as GlcNAc-MurNAc-<sc>l</sc>-Ala-<sc>d</sc>-Gln &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030051-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;. However, only bacteria are known to possess the endopeptidases with the specificity to generate the NOD2 ligands. For example, <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. monocytogenes</named-content> secrets a highly expressed endopeptidase, p60, that cleaves the bond between D-Glu and <italic>meso</italic>-DAP, thus potentially generating NOD2 ligands &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030051-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;. In the phago-lysosome, <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. monocytogenes</named-content> is potentially subjected to degradation by both bacterial and host enzymes. We found that protease inhibitors blocked the NOD2-dependent response without affecting the TLR-dependent response. Therefore, lysosomal proteases might contribute to degradation of the bacterial CW, thereby facilitating further digestion of the PGN. A role for proteases was most evident upon H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ionophors treatment. Interestingly, a role for potassium influx and protease activation in neutrophils has been proposed by Reeve et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030051-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;.

During treatment with H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ionophors that cause a phagosomal potassium influx, we found that protease inhibitors blocked the IFN-&#x003b2; expression, but had no affect on expression of IL-12p40, suggesting that proteolysis is necessary to generate the ligands transported to the cytosol, but not those recognized in the phagosome. Taken together, these results show that phagosomal degradation of <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. monocytogenes</named-content> resulted in the NOD2-dependent production of IFN-&#x003b2;, presumably due to the production of the appropriate muramyl dipeptide(s) generated during bacterial degradation.</p><p>NOD1 and NOD2 are cytosolic proteins that are activated by small PGN fragments.

Although the mechanism of transport in macrophages is not known, here we present pharmacological evidence that the phagosomal membrane potential is crucial for NOD2-dependent IFN-&#x003b2; responses. While monensin and valinomycin treatments did not affect degradation of bacteria, addition of valinomycin to monensin-treated cells resulted in dissipation of the phagosomal membrane potential and reduction in IFN-&#x003b2; response. This observation leads to a hypothesis that the phagosomal membrane potential could have a direct role as a driving force for transport of ligands into the cytosol, or might be involved indirectly by affecting the function of membrane proteins involved in the transport process.</p><p>There are a number of well-characterized host signal&#x02013;transduction pathways stimulated by viral and/or bacterial products that result in the production of type I IFN &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030051-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. Intriguingly, DNA and RNA are recognized by both intracellular TLRs and by caspase recruitment domain (CARD)&#x02013;containing cytosolic proteins, both leading to type I IFN production.

However, none of the individual TLR knockouts had a measurable affect on the production of IFN-&#x003b2;, although it is still possible that there is an overlapping affect of individual TLRs. Recently, two cytosolic dsRNA helicases with CARD-domains, RIG-I and MDA5, have been identified and shown to lead to IFN-&#x003b2; production in response to viral nucleic acids by interacting with the mitochondrial membrane adaptor called MAVS/VISA/IPS-1/Cardif &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030051-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;.

Our in vitro preparation of CW fragments recapitulated the induction of IFN-&#x003b2; when delivered to the macrophage's cytosol. However, this induction was only partially dependent on NOD2.

We demonstrated a direct correlation between bacterial degradation and macrophage expression of IFN-&#x003b2;. Macrophages that failed to degrade bacteria failed to express IFN-&#x003b2;. Blocking degradation of bacteria by bafilomycin A treatment resulted in loss of signaling. While the role of the V-ATPase in phago-lysosome maturation is well characterized, we found that the signaling adaptor MyD88 was also essential for bacterial degradation. MyD88-deficient macrophages failed to degrade bacteria or express IFN-&#x003b2; when presented with intact bacteria, but did express IFN-&#x003b2; when bacterial CW fragments were delivered directly to the cytosol. Although the role of MyD88 in phagosome maturation is controversial, it is possible that MyD88 is involved in the initial signaling pathways that promote macrophage activation and their capacity to kill and degrade bacteria. Indeed, it was shown that the induction of many genes by IFN-&#x003b3; is dependent on MyD88 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030051-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d;. Recently, it was suggested that MyD88 is required for proper assembly of the phagosomal NADPH oxidase, thus affecting the killing of Gram-negative bacteria &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030051-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d;. It is clear that immune signaling pathways affect cellular processes in specialized phagocytic cells, but how these processes, such as pathogen digestion and generation of new ligands, are involved in further shaping the immune response is less understood. We speculate that macrophages can discriminate between ligands that are presented by live bacteria or ligands that are generated after degradation of bacteria (post-mortem). We refer to these ligands as pathogen-associated molecular patterns post-mortem (PAMP-PM). The results of this study suggest that a fully active phagosome provides PAMP-PM for detection by the innate immune system. However, this &#x0201c;information&#x0201d; is not restricted to receptors that are located in the phagosome, but crosses the phagosomal membrane to activate intracellular immune receptors as well. Lastly, we suggest that bacterial degradation in the phagosome plays a major role in the development of innate and acquired immune responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Bacterial strains.</title><p>The <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. monocytogenes</named-content> strains used were a w.t. strain, 10403S and 10403S expressing GFP, or strains containing in-frame deletions of the <italic>hly</italic> gene (LLO, DP-L2161) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030051-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d; and DP-L2161 expressing GFP &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030051-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d;.

Thirty minutes after addition of bacteria, macrophage monolayers were washed three times with PBS, and fresh medium was added. At 1 h.p.i., gentamicin was added to 50 &#x003bc;g/ml to limit the growth of extracellular bacteria. Unless indicated otherwise, infections were completed at 6 h.p.i, and further analyzed.

Each microarray experiment was done in triplicate. Macrophages were infected with w.t. and LLO-minus mutant for 5 h with and without IFN-&#x003b3; treatment. Then, macrophages were washed with PBS, and total RNA was extracted using RNAqueous kit (Ambion, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ambion.com">http://www.ambion.com</ext-link>). A half microgram of RNA was amplified using Amino Allyl MessageAmp II aRNA Amplification Kit (Ambion).

The common reference pool contained equal amounts (5 &#x003bc;g of each) of amplified RNA from all the samples analyzed in the experiment (including uninfected, hly, and w.t. samples from activated and non-activated macrophages). RNA was hybridized to the MEEBO microarrays for 48 h. Microarrays were gridded using SpotReader software (Niles Scientific, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nilesscientific.com">http://www.nilesscientific.com</ext-link>) and GenePix Pro 6 (Molecular Devices, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.moleculardevices.com">http://www.moleculardevices.com</ext-link>), and analyzed using Acuity 4 software (Molecular Devices). Highest quality spots meeting extra-stringent criteria were identified. These highest quality spots were used to calculate normalization factors such that the median Cy5/Cy3 ratio was brought to 1. These factors were then applied to the entire dataset after removing low quality spots. Finally, all arrays were normalized to the uninfected non-activated macrophages array. Significant analysis of microarrays (SAM) algorithm was used with two-class unpaired designs to identify genes that were differentially expressed in w.t. versus LLO-minus infection of non-activated macrophages, and in LLO-minus mutant infections of activated versus non-activated macrophages. Genes that showed a 5.6-fold or greater difference were selected for further analysis. Pearson hierarchical clustering was applied on selected genes.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title><named-content content-type="genus-species">L. monocytogenes</named-content> CW preparation and delivery.</title><p>One liter of <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. monocytogenes</named-content> culture was grown at 37 &#x000b0;C to exponential phase and used for CW preparation.
