The imprinting status, DNA methylation, and genomic landscape of the <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> cluster were determined in eutherian, metatherian, and prototherian mammals including tammar wallaby and platypus. Imprinting across the whole domain evolved after the divergence of eutherian from marsupial mammals and in eutherians is under strong purifying selection. The marsupial locus at 1.6 megabases, is double that of eutherians due to the accumulation of LINE repeats. Comparative sequence analysis of the domain in seven vertebrates determined evolutionary conserved regions common to particular sub-groups and to all vertebrates. The emergence of <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> imprinting in eutherians has occurred on the maternally inherited chromosome and is associated with region-specific resistance to expansion by repetitive elements and the local introduction of noncoding transcripts including microRNAs and C/D small nucleolar RNAs. A recent mammal-specific retrotransposition event led to the formation of a completely new gene only in the eutherian domain, which may have driven imprinting at the cluster.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Mammals have two copies of each gene in their somatic cells, and most of these gene pairs are regulated and expressed simultaneously. A fraction of mammalian genes, however, is subject to imprinting&#x02014;a chemical modification that marks a gene according to its parental origin, so that one parent's copy is expressed while the other parent's copy is silenced. How and why this process evolved is the subject of much speculation. Here we have shown that all the genes in one genomic region, <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic>, which are imprinted in placental mammals such as mouse and human, are not imprinted in marsupial (wallaby) or monotreme (platypus) mammals. This is in contrast to a small number of other imprinted genes that are imprinted in marsupials and other therian mammals and indicates that imprinting arose at each genomic domain at different stages of mammalian evolution. We have compared the sequence of the <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> region between seven vertebrate species and identified sequences that are differentially represented in mammals that imprint compared to those that do not. Our data indicate that once imprinted gene regulation is acquired in a domain, it becomes evolutionarily constrained to remain unchanged.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>A comparative analysis of genomic imprinting between mammals that imprint and those that don't has provided insights into how and why imprinting evolved.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Edwards CA, Mungall AJ, Matthews L, Ryder E, Gray DJ, et al.

The eutherian GC content, &#x00025;CpG and number of CpG islands was significantly higher than the genome average (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01 using Chi-squared test) in contrast to marsupial and monotreme mammals, and chicken, that all lack imprinting at this domain. Repeat content was analysed using the most recent previously unreleased platypus repeat database (kindly provided by R Hubley, Repeatmasker). Eutherian LINE content is consistent with the genome-wide average; however, there is a paucity of LINEs in the region between <italic>Dlk1</italic> and <italic>Mirg</italic> (miRNA-containing gene) in the eutherians (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0060135-t001">Table 1</xref>). The majority of repeats identified in the <italic>DLK-DIO3</italic> domain in the marsupials are LINE1 repeats. This is consistent with the high number of LINEs identified in the opossum genome and suggests that expansion in the <italic>DLK1-DIO3</italic> region, as in the marsupial genome as a whole, is due to LINE1 insertion. The opossum region has a slightly larger proportion of SINEs than expected from the genome average. The SINE content is also greater in the tammar wallaby, although the whole-genome sequence for this species is not currently available for comparison. The relative repeat content in platypus is greater than eutherians despite the region being smaller in this species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060135-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). The majority of repeats in the platypus <italic>DLK1-DIO3</italic> region are SINEs and the more ancient LINE2s. Interestingly; there is a notable absence of long terminal repeat (LTR) elements at this locus in platypus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060135-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). The chicken region is devoid of any SINE elements which is consistent with the whole genome analysis of this species. Hence platypus and marsupials have greater SINE content in the domain than do the eutherian mammals with imprinting. This is consistent with the SINE depletion previously reported when comparing imprinted with nonimprinted domains in mouse and human &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060135-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060135-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;.

Although the greatest number of ECRs is found within the mammalian species, the more ancestral ECRs (the 31 found in all species studied) are on average larger, having a mean length of 494 bp compared with the mean length of all ECRs at 340 bp and suggesting greater functional constraint.</p><p>We used the 31 ECRs found in all vertebrates to align the <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> domain and subdivide it into 30 inter-ECR zones for further comparative analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060135-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). Exons of <italic>Dlk1</italic> and <italic>Dio3</italic> are represented by vertebrate ECRs 1&#x02013;3 and 30&#x02013;31, respectively. The intergenic distribution of the ECRs is not uniform throughout the domain with two-thirds being located in the 3&#x02032; half of the domain.

This provides a measure of the overall expansions/contractions between species. The regional changes between marsupial, monotreme, and eutherian mammals across the domain are not uniform. The most striking differences between the mammals lie in zone 3 (between vECR3 and vECR4), zone 6, and zone 7. Zone 3 which is located between the last exon of <italic>Dlk1</italic> and the conserved intron 5 region of <italic>Gtl2</italic>, is expanded in eutherians (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060135-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). This expansion does not appear to be caused by LINEs, because LINE1 and LINE2 repeats are equivalently represented in eutherians and marsupials (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060135-sg004">Figure S4</xref>). As shown, this zone contains a higher proportion of SINE elements than reported for the whole genome and compared with the entire domain. However, the increased SINE content does not explain the expansion of zone 3, which is due to the acquisition of unique sequence, including the imprinting control region (the IG-DMR) and presumably other eutherian specific regulators. In contrast, eutherian zone 6, located between <italic>Gtl2</italic> and <italic>Rtl1</italic>, is smaller than in marsupials, platypus and chicken, implying either that it contracted or that it is resistant to expansion. This latter explanation is favoured, because in marsupials expansion is predominantly due to LINE1s, and in platypus to LINE2 repeats and SINEs. This exclusion suggests an important previously unrecognized eutherian specific function for that zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060135-g004">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>The eutherian specific expansion of zone 7, as for zone 3, is not associated with the insertion of repetitive sequences, compared with marsupials. Rather, zone 7 represents the region located between <italic>Rtl1</italic> and <italic>Mirg</italic>, which, in eutherians, contains approximately 50 miRNA genes and three clusters of C/D snoRNA genes, all expressed from the maternally inherited chromosome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060135-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;.

Therefore eutherians acquired transcribed non&#x02013;protein coding RNAs in a zone that appears resistant to expansion by LINEs and SINEs.

First, elevated GC content correlates with increased levels of recombination &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060135-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;.

Third, the reduced SINE content in the eutherian indicates the region is under purifying selection, especially because SINEs are usually associated with GC-rich regions.

Whether any of the ECRs plays a functional role in the regulation of the domain is currently under investigation. Those specific to subgroups such as oviparous vertebrates, or the sixteen ECRs specific to therian mammals, might relate to the regulation of specific functions such as the development of extraembryonic structures in therians.</p><p>Expression analysis has provided evidence that <italic>Gtl2</italic> and other noncoding transcripts existed throughout amniote evolution, suggesting that <italic>Gtl2</italic> did not arise from an eutherian-specific retrotransposition event that triggered imprinting at the domain as has been previously suggested &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060135-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. Our results show that weak regional non&#x02013;protein coding transcriptional activity can occur in some places across the domain in noneutherian mammals and suggest that the process repressing the protein-coding genes on the maternal chromosome in eutherians (driven by the imprinting control region upstream from <italic>Gtl2</italic>) facilitated stronger expression from these non&#x02013;protein coding transcripts. The appearance of functional miRNAs and C/D snoRNAs within the locus may therefore have been a consequence of the acquisition of imprinting with the strongly expressed <italic>Gtl2</italic> gene, providing an ideal host transcript. It is not known whether the duplications that gave rise to the miRNA clusters occurred before or after evolution of imprinting at the locus. Interestingly, a role for these miRNAs in the <italic>trans</italic>-regulation of neural and placental processes has been inferred &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060135-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;. A functional role for these transcripts in the regulation of the neighbouring imprinted protein-coding genes also cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, the emergence of a regulatory relationship between <italic>RTL1</italic> and its reciprocally imprinted miRNA-containing antisense transcript is also intriguing. In contrast to the more distal miRNA clusters to which they are not related, these seven <italic>anti-RTL1</italic> miRNAs are not likely to have arisen through duplication/divergence events. Rather, these may have evolved as a host defence mechanism associated with the retrotransposon properties of <italic>RTL1,</italic> and evolved with it to modulate its expression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060135-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d; as it acquired an endogenous function.</p><p>During the course of evolution, the genomic landscape of the <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> region has undergone a number of changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060135-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Most significantly, the region has become imprinted. This analysis has proven that imprinting in this domain emerged after the divergence of marsupials and eutherian mammals. This provides evidence that mammalian imprinting evolved at different loci at different times in response to selective pressures acting on different domains, suggesting an adaptive process. Prior to the divergence of metatherians from eutherians, the Sushi-ichi retrotransposon <italic>Rtl1</italic>, inserted between <italic>DLK1</italic> and <italic>DIO3</italic>, gained no function and was degraded in marsupials. In marsupials, the region expanded 2-fold through the insertion of LINE repeats. As the eutherian lineage evolved through selective regional changes, <italic>Rtl1</italic> evolved into a new gene acquiring a vital function in growth and development. This gain of function may indeed have driven imprinting at the domain, conferred through the acquisition of the imprinting control element. <italic>Gtl2</italic> and associated transcripts became up-regulated on the maternal chromosome in eutherians, and miRNAs and C/D snoRNAs specifically evolved in the region. Once imprinted, gene expression was fixed in the region it underwent purifying selection, correlating with an increase in GC content, reduction in <italic>Dlk1</italic> intron size, and selection against SINE and LINE insertions. Comparison of these results with similar detailed analyses on domains acquiring imprinting prior to the divergence of marsupials and eutherians will provide further insight into the relationships between dynamic changes in genomic landscape and the evolution of imprinting.</p><fig id="pbio-0060135-g007" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Evolution of the <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> Domain in Mammals.</title><p>Schematic illustration of the evolution of the <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> domain in mammals. <italic>RTL1</italic> retrotransposed into the region before the divergence of the eutherians and metatherians. In the marsupial lineage, <italic>RTL1</italic> did not gain a function (or lose it) and became degraded. The region expanded approximately 2-fold in the marsupials; this expansion is mainly due to the accumulation of LINE1 repeats. The snoRNA and miRNA clusters arose after eutherian diverged from marsupials but before the mammalian radiation which took place around 98 million years ago. The eutherian region has also evolved many genomic features associated with imprinted clusters. The entire domain has become increasingly GC-rich, whereas a decline in GC content is the general trend in eutherian genomes. There are fewer SINEs than expected in the region, and the introns of the <italic>DLK1</italic> transcript have become shorter. Finally the region has a sub-telomeric position within the eutherian genome whereas in monotremes and marsupials it is in the middle of the chromosome arm.
