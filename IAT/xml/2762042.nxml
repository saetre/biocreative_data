While not as extensively studied as brain, a few candidate testis-specific splicing regulator proteins have been identified, including the nuclear RNA binding proteins RBMY and hnRNP G-T, which are germ cell-specific versions of the somatically expressed hnRNP G protein and are highly conserved in mammals. The splicing activator protein Tra2&#x003b2; is also highly expressed in the testis and physically interacts with these hnRNP G family proteins. In this study, we identified a novel testis-specific cassette exon TLE4-T within intron 6 of the human <italic>transducing-like enhancer of split 4</italic> (<italic>TLE4</italic>) gene which makes a more transcriptionally repressive TLE4 protein isoform. TLE4-T splicing is normally repressed in somatic cells because of a weak 5&#x02032; splice site and surrounding splicing-repressive intronic regions. TLE4-T RNA pulls down Tra2&#x003b2; and hnRNP G proteins which activate its inclusion. The germ cell-specific RBMY and hnRNP G-T proteins were more efficient in stimulating TLE4-T incorporation than somatically expressed hnRNP G protein. Tra2b bound moderately to TLE4-T RNA, but more strongly to upstream sites to potently activate an alternative 3&#x02032; splice site normally weakly selected in the testis. Co-expression of Tra2&#x003b2; with either hnRNP G-T or RBMY re-established the normal testis physiological splicing pattern of this exon. Although they can directly bind pre-mRNA sequences around the TLE4-T exon, RBMY and hnRNP G-T function as efficient germ cell-specific splicing co-activators of TLE4-T. Our study indicates a delicate balance between the activity of positive and negative splicing regulators combinatorially controls physiological splicing inclusion of exon TLE4-T and leads to modulation of signalling pathways in the testis. In addition, we identified a high-affinity binding site for hnRNP G-T protein, showing it is also a sequence-specific RNA binding protein.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>This study investigates tissue-specific alternative splicing, which plays a key role in generating diversity in animal cells. We found a new testis-specific exon in a human homologue of the important <italic>Drosophila</italic> developmental regulator Groucho, which is activated by germ cell RNA binding proteins. By analyzing splicing control of this exon, we elucidated how variations in the activity and expression of splicing regulators together counterbalance splicing activation, and achieve more tightly regulated physiological splicing patterns. We find that although this new human testis-specific exon is not conserved in mice, it is functionally important in that it encodes a peptide which increases the activity of this developmental regulator as a transcriptional repressor. This study provides new insights into how signalling pathways are evolving in human germ cells and the possible molecular defects that might be occurring in infertile men who have genetic deletions of germ cell-specific RNA binding proteins.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alternative splicing plays a key role in expanding the coding potential of the human genome by enabling multiple mRNAs to be made from even single genes.

These genetic data and evolutionary conservation are indicative of an important function, but to date there are no known physiological target transcripts for either hnRNP G-T or RBMY proteins in the testis.

A few stringent screening steps were taken to enable the identification of exons exclusively expressed in the testis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000707.s001">Figure S1</xref>). First, we presumed that the annotated Ensembl transcripts represented the major transcription isoform. All the exons that matched their Ensembl transcripts (version 38) were removed. The remaining 666 exons were blasted against NCBI human EST (expressed sequence tag) database, and the tissue origin of each EST hit was checked. All exons with EST coverage from tissues other than testis were removed. This resulted in a collection of 150 putative testis-specific exons. The last step was a manual check to eliminate any exons with splicing ambiguities or located in UTRs (untranslated regions). Finally a list of 102 putative testis-specific exons was compiled (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000707.s004">Table S1</xref>).

Although we observed consistent repression of TLE4-T splicing at these increased concentrations of Tra2&#x003b2; protein, the normally germ cell-restricted hnRNP G-T protein was the only hnRNP G family protein which was still able to activate TLE4-T exon splicing. We also observed at these higher levels of Tra2&#x003b2; that hnRNP G protein was noticeably much less potent at repressing the splicing activation of TLE4-B by Tra2&#x003b2; than either RBMY or hnRNP G-T.

TLE4-T splicing is primarily repressed in somatic cells through a combination of a weak 5&#x02032; splice site and the action of surrounding intronic silencing elements. Although normally tightly repressed in somatic cells, TLE4-T exon splicing can be activated through ectopic expression of Tra2&#x003b2; or members of the hnRNP G family amongst the panel of proteins we identified as bound to this exon through pulldown analyses (summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000707-g010">Figure 10A and 10B</xref>).

In <italic>in vitro</italic> splicing reactions, addition of regions of the RBMY protein which are able to interact with Tra2&#x003b2; protein blocked its ability to activate splicing of a cassette exon within an artificial tropomyosin pre-mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000707-Venables1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistent with these previous observations, we found that Tra2&#x003b2;-mediated splicing activation of TLE4 cassette exons is effectively silenced by co-expression of hnRNP G family proteins and <italic>vice versa</italic> (summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000707-g010">Figure 10C</xref>). Based on this model, when both hnRNP G family proteins and Tra2&#x003b2; are co-expressed in HEK293 cells, the net effect on splicing actually depends on which protein predominates overall. If both hnRNP G family proteins and Tra2&#x003b2; are equally expressed, then TLE4-T splicing will also be repressed through mutual antagonism. However, a slight increase in the activity of either protein over the other will result in a net increase in TLE4-T splicing activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000707-g010">Figure 10C</xref>).</p><fig id="pgen-1000707-g010" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000707.g010</object-id><label>Figure 10</label><caption><title>Model showing the splicing regulation of TLE4-T by hnRNP G proteins and Tra2&#x003b2;.</title><p>(A) High levels of hnRNP G family protein expression lead to splicing activation of the TLE4-T exon. The hnRNP G proteins do not directly bind to RNA, but activate splicing indirectly through an RRM-independent mechanism. Here a bridging protein is shown as X. (B) High levels of Tra2&#x003b2; lead to strong activation of the TLE4-B 3&#x02032; splice site. As a consequence of the increased nuclear concentration of Tra2&#x003b2; protein, the multiple GAA-rich binding sites in the TLE4 pre-mRNA are occupied by Tra2&#x003b2; protein. We have directly mapped one of the TLE4-B and the TLE4-T Tra2&#x003b2;-binding site by crosslinking. (C) If both Tra2&#x003b2; and hnRNP G family proteins are expressed, these two sets of proteins will mutually antagonise each other. Any surplus hnRNP G protein or Tra2&#x003b2; will be then able to activate splicing of TLE4-T. In this case the hnRNP G family proteins are shown activating splicing of this exon.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1000707.g010"/></fig><p>Our data is hence consistent with the physiological splicing levels of TLE4-T resulting from changes in the concentration and relative activity of particular nuclear RNA binding proteins in germ cells. Firstly increased levels of hnRNP G family proteins are expressed in the testis because of the exclusive germ cell expression of RBMY and hnRNP G-T proteins, and the splicing response of TLE4-T to these proteins is dose dependent (data not shown). Secondly, by normalizing ectopic expression levels we found that the ubiquitously expressed hnRNP G protein functions much less potently than the germ cell specific RBMY and hnRNP G-T proteins, both in TLE4-T splicing activation and Tra2&#x003b2; sequestration. Hence in somatic cells hnRNP G protein alone might not be sufficient to sequester Tra2&#x003b2; and to override the splicing repressive genomic environment of the TLE4-T exon. However in germ cells, higher expression levels of the more potent TLE4-T splicing activators RBMY and hnRNP G-T would lead to TLE4-T splicing. While this is the first report presenting evidence for functional differences between RBMY and hnRNP G-T proteins and the anatomically more ubiquitously expressed hnRNP G protein, distinct activities have been reported for members of other families of splicing regulators expressed in different cell types. For example the nPTB protein is a less splicing repressive isoform of PTB, and nPTB expression leads to splicing switches in neural tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000707-Boutz1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. The TLE4-T exon is also the first testis-specific splicing target pre-mRNA to be identified that is regulated by RBMY and hnRNP G-T.</p><p>We identified direct RNA binding sites for Tra2&#x003b2; within the TLE4 pre-mRNA, but found the hnRNP G family proteins each operate as splicing coregulators (this indirect interaction is labelled as X in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000707-g010">Figure 10</xref>), even though RBMY and hnRNP G-T proteins can bind in and around TLE4-T. In particular hnRNP G-T strongly binds to a GUU-rich sequence within the TLE4 pre-mRNA immediately downstream of the weak 5&#x02032; splice site of TLE4-T. This GUU-rich sequence is the first reported hnRNP G-T target RNA binding site, and differs from the RNA target sequences recently identified for both RBMY and hnRNP G <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000707-Skrisovska1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000707-Heinrich1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence hnRNP G-T is a sequence-specific RNA binding protein distinct from both hnRNP G and RBMY, and although direct RNA binding does not play a role in the TLE4-T splicing reported in this study, direct protein-RNA interactions through such sites elsewhere in the transcriptome might be functionally important. Given that the binding site we have observed for hnRNP G-T would be perfectly positioned to stabilise interactions of early splicing components with this weak TLE4-T 5&#x02032; splice site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000707-Venables3">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, the RRM-independence suggests splicing activation might even occur after the initial steps of exon recognition and during spliceosome assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000707-House1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>.

Through antagonistic protein interactions hnRNP G family proteins may provide additional checks on Tra2&#x003b2; functional concentration (as opposed to overall level) in the nucleus. In this way hnRNP G family proteins may help control the fidelity of the splicing process by preventing the selection of aberrant splice sites like the TLE4-B 3&#x02032; splice site which is only weakly selected in the testis despite the high concentration of Tra2&#x003b2;.</p><p>While the TLE4-T exon evolved in the primate lineage and so is not shared in the mouse, functional assays carried out using ectopically over-expressed human TLE4 proteins in zebrafish show the peptide encoded by this exon results in enhanced repression of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signalling by the encoded TLE4 protein. Hence although not essential for Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signalling <italic>per se</italic>, TLE4-T splicing may play an important role in modulating specific signalling pathways in the human germline. As well as the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway, TLE4-repressed target genes are also regulated downstream of the Notch signalling pathway which plays a critical role in germline development in the worm <italic>C. elegans</italic> and may also be important in mammalian spermatogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000707-Kimble1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Our analysis indicates that the physiological TLE4-T splicing pattern is established at several levels, but particularly through the Tra2&#x003b2;, RBMY and hnRNP G-T proteins. Failure of such signalling pathways may thus underlie the germ cell defects in men without RBMY protein and mice haploinsufficient for hnRNP G-T protein.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Bioinformatic selection of testis-specific exons</title><p>Testis-specific exon hunting was carried out by searching against the HOLLYWOOD-RNA Alternative Splicing Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hollywood.mit.edu/">http://hollywood.mit.edu/</ext-link>).

We analysed the splicing of 21 of 102 putative exons in RNA prepared from different human tissues using RT-PCR and identified testis-specific splicing in 4 exons (1&#x02013;70, 2&#x02013;23, 2&#x02013;49 and 1&#x02013;85 which is TLE4-T) and 1 alternatively spliced exon (2&#x02013;50) in a testis specific gene. The expected PCR products including the tested exons are indicated by arrows. This high recovery of testis-specific exons from our screen indicates that this bioinformatic approach is a valid method to identify tissue specific splicing events. However it is crucial to use an early version of Ensembl annotation for efficient recovery of alternative exons. It is likely the reason for this is that before the exhaustive sequencing of ESTs, early versions of Ensembl transcripts represent dominant splicing variants of each gene which do not contain tissue-specific exons. If all the ESTs had been annotated, all the candidate alternative exons would be eliminated in this step.</p><p>(5.65 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000707.s001.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000707.s002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p>The SR family proteins examined do not activate splicing of TLE4-T.

(B) RT-PCR analysis showing splicing pattern of TLE4-T minigene splicing detected in the RNA made from the same cells as analysed for protein content. Co-expression of any of the SR proteins detected as bound to the TLE4-T exon did not activate TLE4-T splicing, and in fact actually repressed splicing of the TLE4-T exon. Expression of SRp30c and SF2/ASF induced splicing of the TLE4-B exon, and co-expression of SC35 and 9G8 induced splicing of further aberrant splice forms which have not been cloned and sequenced. Of two other proteins which bound to TLE4-T in nuclear extracts, hnRNP H slightly enhanced TLE4-T splicing activation (lane 3) while co-expression of p68 (DDX5) had no effect (data not shown).

SiRNA depletion of hnRNP A1 leads to a weak activation of the TLE4-T exon. Top panel: the levels of hnRNP A1 and actin in cells treated with siRNAs for hnRNP A1 or non-silencing siRNAs were assayed by Western blotting. Middle panel: splicing of exon TLE4-T encoded by the minigene was assayed in the cells depleted or mock depleted for hnRNP A1. Bottom panel: a bar chart shows quantitation of RT-PCR analysis. Although splicing inclusion of the minigene encoded exon TLE4-T was partially enhanced by depletion of hnRNP A1, it was still largely repressed in somatic cells. Hence down regulation of hnRNP A1 is not sufficient by itself to account for the somatic repression of TLE4-T. Consistent with this, in these same cells siRNA depletion of hnRNP A1 did not activate splicing of the TLE4-T exon for the endogenous pre-mRNA encoded by the genomic TLE4 locus (data not shown).</p><p>(2.48 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000707.s003.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000707.s004"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Full list of putative testis-specific exons.</p><p>(0.04 MB XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000707.s004.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Franck Ruffenach (IGBMC, Illkirch, France) for his help in the analysis of mass spectrometry data.
