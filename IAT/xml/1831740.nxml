Most cases are of a type called non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Like other cancers, treatment of NCSLC depends on the &#x0201c;TNM stage&#x0201d; at which the cancer is detected. Staging takes into account the size and local spread of the tumor (its T classification), whether nearby lymph nodes contain tumor cells (its N classification), and whether tumor cells have spread (metastasized) throughout the body (its M classification). Stage I tumors are confined to the lung and are removed surgically. Stage II tumors have spread to nearby lymph nodes and are treated with a combination of surgery and chemotherapy. Stage III tumors have spread throughout the chest, and stage IV tumors have metastasized around the body; patients with both of these stages are treated with chemotherapy alone. About 70&#x00025; of patients with stage I or II lung cancer, but only 2&#x00025; of patients with stage IV lung cancer, survive for five years after diagnosis.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>TNM staging is the best way to predict the likely outcome (prognosis) for patients with NSCLC, but survival times for patients with stage I and II tumors vary widely. Another prognostic marker&#x02014;maybe a &#x0201c;molecular signature&#x0201d;&#x02014;that could distinguish patients who are likely to respond to treatment from those whose cancer will inevitably progress would be very useful. Unlike normal cells, cancer cells divide uncontrollably and can move around the body. These behavioral changes are caused by alterations in the pattern of proteins expressed by the cells. But what causes these alterations? The answer in some cases is &#x0201c;epigenetic changes&#x0201d; or chemical modifications of genes. In cancer cells, methyl groups are aberrantly added to GC-rich gene regions. These so-called &#x0201c;CpG islands&#x0201d; lie near gene promoters (sequences that control the transcription of DNA into mRNA, the template for protein production), and their methylation stops the promoters working and silences the gene. In this study, the researchers have investigated whether aberrant methylation patterns vary between NSCLC subtypes and whether specific aberrant methylations are associated with survival and can, therefore, be used prognostically.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers used &#x0201c;restriction landmark genomic scanning&#x0201d; (RLGS) to catalog global aberrant DNA methylation patterns in human lung tumor samples. In RLGS, DNA is cut into fragments with a restriction enzyme (a protein that cuts at specific DNA sequences), end-labeled, and separated using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to give a pattern of spots. Because methylation stops some restriction enzymes cutting their target sequence, normal lung tissue and lung tumor samples yield different patterns of spots. The researchers used these patterns to identify 47 DNA methylation targets (many in CpG islands) that together distinguished between adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas, two major types of NSCLCs. Next, they measured mRNA production from the genes with the greatest difference in methylation between adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas. <italic>OLIG1</italic> (the gene that encodes a protein involved in nerve cell development) had one of the highest differences in mRNA production between these tumor types. Furthermore, three-quarters of NSCLCs had reduced or no expression of OLIG1 protein and, when the researchers analyzed the association between OLIG1 protein expression and overall survival in patients with NSCLC, reduced OLIG1 protein expression was associated with reduced survival.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These findings indicate that different types of NSCLC can be distinguished by examining their aberrant methylation patterns. This suggests that the establishment of different DNA methylation patterns might be related to the cell type from which the tumors developed. Alternatively, the different aberrant methylation patterns might reflect the different routes that these cells take to becoming tumor cells. This research identifies a potential new prognostic marker for NSCLC by showing that OLIG1 protein expression correlates with overall survival in patients with NSCLC. This correlation needs to be tested in a clinical setting to see if adding OLIG1 expression to the current prognostic parameters can lead to better treatment choices for early-stage lung cancer patients and ultimately improve these patients' overall survival.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040108">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040108</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Patient and professional information on lung cancer, including staging (in English and Spanish), is available from the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/types/lung">US National Cancer Institute</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007194.htm">The MedlinePlus</ext-link> encyclopedia has pages on non-small cell lung cancer (in English and Spanish)</p></list-item><list-item><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancerbackup.org.uk/Cancertype/Lung">Cancerbackup</ext-link> provides patient information on lung cancer</p></list-item><list-item><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancerquest.org">CancerQuest</ext-link>, provided by Emory University, has information about how cancer develops (in English, Spanish, Chinese and Russian)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Wikipedia pages on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics">epigenetics</ext-link> (note that Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit)</p></list-item><list-item><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://epigenome.eu">The Epigenome Network of Excellence</ext-link> gives background information and the latest news about epigenetics (in several European languages)</p></list-item></list></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Brena RM, Morrison C, Liyanarachchi S, Jarjoura D, Davuluri RV, et al.

Consent from participants was waived under CFR 46 subpart A. A total of 70 snap-frozen matched tumor-free/adenocarcinomas and 70 snap-frozen matched tumor-free/SCCs were procured. For immunohistochemical studies, two lung tissue microarrays (TMAs) were generated. All specimens included in these arrays were cored from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks.

Positive staining was visualized by incubating the slides with diaminobenzadine (Sigma-Aldrich).</p><p>The slides were examined by an experienced lung pathologist (CM) and reviewed by the primary investigator (RMB). The evaluation of the immunohistochemical results was performed as follows: each tissue core was assigned an &#x0201c;OLIG1 index score,&#x0201d; calculated on two parameters, percent of positive (stained) cells in the tumor epithelium and intensity of staining &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040108-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;.

The OLIG1 index for each core was then calculated by multiplying the value assigned to each parameter. In order to ensure the accurate assessment of OLIG1 protein expression in each tumor, either three or four cores of the same sample were placed in the tissue arrays. This design helped overcome the problem of tumor heterogeneity, which could affect the results depending on what area of tumor is cored. The final OLIG1 index score for each sample was determined by taking the average of the indexes given to each individual core.</p><p>OLIG1 protein levels were also assessed via immunohistochemistry in H1299 cells treated with 1 &#x003bc;M of 5-aza-dC for 48 and 72 h.

Age was used as a dichotomous variable based on the median age value of the patients in the sample sets. OLIG1 index was used as a continuous variable composed of nine discrete values (1&#x02013;9). In the multivariate model, the assumption of proportional hazards was examined for each variable by testing the significance of correlation coefficient between transformed survival time and the Schoenfeld residuals of that variable.

The samples were selected so that gender, race, age range, and tumor differentiation were comparable in both groups. RLGS was performed using both NotI and AscI as restriction landmark enzymes. As previously reported &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040108-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;, the recognition sequences of these enzymes occur preferentially within CpG islands as defined by Gardiner-Garden and Frommer &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040108-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;, effectively creating a bias towards the assessment of DNA methylation in promoter sequences &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040108-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. Additionally, recent bioinformatics analyses indicate that 92.7&#x00025; of NotI sites fall within the 5&#x02032; end, inside, or 3&#x02032; end of transcripts (R.V. Davuluri, personal communication). The DNA methylation profile from each tumor was scored against a profile generated from tumor-free lung from the same patient. On average, the methylation status of 3,442 RLGS loci (range: 2,590&#x02013;4,108) was analyzed per sample. The variation in the number of RLGS fragments analyzed per sample stemmed from individual differences in the quality of RLGS gels. Low level DNA degradation in specific samples resulted in RLGS fragments located in the periphery of the gel to become diffuse or not separated well enough to be analyzed accurately in all specimens. Aberrant DNA methylation was detected at least once in 395 of the total 4,108 different RLGS loci scored. The average frequency of CpG island methylation in the adenocarcinomas was 4.82&#x00025; (range: 3.39&#x00025;&#x02013;6.26&#x00025;) and 4.23&#x00025; (range: 3.13&#x00025;&#x02013;5.42&#x00025;) in the SCCs. The methylation level for each sample was calculated based on the exact number of RLGS loci scored for that sample.</p><p>We identified 36 RLGS loci, whose methylation frequency was significantly different (<italic>p</italic> &#x02264; 0.050, Fisher's exact test) between the adenocarcinomas and the SCCs in the study. Of these, eight (22&#x00025;) were methylated in only one of the tumor subtypes and not the other. The remaining sequences were methylated in both subtypes, but in varying frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040108-g001">Figure 1</xref>A).</p><p>Next, hierarchical clustering was performed to determine if the aberrant methylation events detected in our RLGS scan were sufficient to distinguish the adenocarcinomas from the SCCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040108-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). The best segregation of the tumors according to their subtype with the lowest number of misclassifications was achieved when the DNA methylation status of 47 RLGS loci was considered. While the adenocarcinomas clustered into one major group, the SCCs were split into two groups, one of them branching closer to the adenocarcinomas (SCCs 2, 10, and 14). Also, SCC8 and SCC12 clustered within the adenocarcinoma group. In order to validate if the DNA methylation status of these 47 RLGS loci could be applied to distinguish a new set of adenocarcinomas from a new set of SCCs, RLGS was performed on 15 additional samples (Adenos 12&#x02013;19 and SCCs 15&#x02013;21). These samples were also selected to ensure that gender, race, age range, and tumor differentiation were comparable in both tumor subtypes. Hierarchical clustering of these 15 samples showed a pattern where, again, the adenocarcinomas separated in one major group, while the SCCs were split into two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040108-g001">Figure 1</xref>C); a segregation pattern also seen in the combined cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040108-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). Interestingly, most of the SCCs grouping close to the adenocarcinomas (SCC group 1) were moderately differentiated (four of six), while the SCCs clustering entirely separately from the adenocarcinomas (SCC group 2) were predominantly poorly differentiated (eight of 13). This distribution, though not statistically significant, could indicate a trend that the two aberrant DNA methylation patterns observed in SCCs may reflect, in part, the differentiation state of the tumor.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Differentially Methylated Loci in Adenocarcinomas and SCCs</title><p>Altogether, 33 of the 47 RLGS loci derived from our analysis were cloned either previously or in this study &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040108-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040108-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;.

In light of the high number of OLIG1 negative and low expressing cases in both lung tumor subtypes, we hypothesized that OLIG1 protein expression may influence survival in NSCLC patients.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. All clinical and geographical variables available for the dataset (gender, age, tumor subtype, and T and N stages) were included in the models in order to account for potentially confounding factors independent of OLIG1 index, which may affect survival. The results of these analyses yielded a hazard ratio of 0.86 for OLIG1 index (95&#x00025; CI 0.76&#x02013;0.98, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.023), indicating an association between reduced OLIG1 protein expression and reduced overall survival. In our analysis the OLIG1 index variable was composed of nine discrete values (1&#x02013;9), where 1 represents lack of protein expression and 9 represents normal protein levels, as described in the Methods section. Therefore, our results indicate that for every unit increase in OLIG1 index, there is a risk reduction of 14&#x00025; in relation to the risk associated with the lower index. For example, an OLIG1 index of 6 is associated with a 14&#x00025; reduction in the risk afforded by an OLIG1 index of 5. By the same token, an OLIG1 index of 5 is associated with a 14&#x00025; decrease in the risk afforded by an OLIG1 index of 4.</p><p>In order to validate our observations, OLIG1 immunohistochemistry was performed on an independent sample set (TMA2), comprising 74 adenocarcinomas (Adenos 104&#x02013;182) and 79 SCCs (SCCs 130&#x02013;208). The tissue cores were scored as previously described, and an OLIG1 index value was assigned to each sample. After completion of the data collection, univariate and multivariate analyses were performed on the dataset. The analyses were carried out in the same manner as for TMA1, including gender, age, tumor subtype, and T and N stage variables in the models. For this second dataset, the OLIG1 index hazard ratio was assessed at 0.83 (95&#x00025; CI 0.74&#x02013;0.93, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.0012) lending further support to the observation that reduced OLIG1 protein expression is associated with reduced overall survival.</p><p>In an effort to improve the precision of the multivariate model, TMA1 and TMA2 were combined and reanalyzed in the same fashion as each individual dataset. The rationale for this approach was to increase the sample number, thereby increasing the statistical power and, potentially, the accuracy of the analysis. The OLIG1 index hazard ratio for the combined data was determined at 0.84 (95&#x00025; CI 0.77&#x02013;0.91 and <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). The complete Cox proportional hazard model for TMA1 and TMA2 combined is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0040108-t002">Table 2</xref>.</p><p>Finally, we calculated the OLIG1 index hazard ratio for patients who were positive and negative for OLIG1 protein expression. This hazard ratio was generated by dividing the combined sample sets (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 285) into two groups. Samples with an OLIG1 index &#x02264;3 were considered negative, while samples with an index &#x02265;4 were considered positive &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040108-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;.

From this multivariate model, the probability of survival at five years was calculated for both groups. For OLIG1-positive cases, the probability of survival at five years was assessed at 0.62 (95&#x00025; CI 0.55&#x02013;0.70), while for OLIG1-negative cases the probability of survival at five years was determined at 0.38 (95&#x00025; CI 0.24&#x02013;0.50). The difference between both survival probabilities, 0.24, was statistically significant (95&#x00025; CI 0.11&#x02013;0.36), further strengthening our previous observations.</p><p>Overall, the comprehensive statistical analysis of our datasets led us to conclude that reduced OLIG1 protein expression is associated with reduced overall survival, and this association is independent of clinical variables such as tumor subtype, T and N stages, or geographical variables such as gender and age. In particular we were able to show that survival at 60 months, a common clinical parameter for assessing lung cancer prognosis, is significantly associated with OLIG1 protein expression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study we have demonstrated that lung adenocarcinomas and SCCs can be distinguished by the DNA methylation status of 47 discrete loci. This is a remarkable observation, since it not only lends further support to the fact that aberrant CpG island methylation is nonrandom &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040108-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;, but it also indicates that different subtypes of neoplasias arising from the same organ can potentially be distinguished by their aberrant DNA methylation patterns.</p><p>One of the 47 aberrantly methylated loci was <italic>OLIG1,</italic> a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor required for oligodendrocyte differentiation but of unknown function in adult lung &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040108-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. Immunohistochemical analysis of a large set of adenocarcinomas and SCCs uncovered missing or reduced OLIG1 protein expression in 68&#x00025; of the specimens tested, suggesting that abrogation of OLIG1 might be of clinical relevance in these subtypes of NSCLC. The impact of OLIG1 protein expression on patient survival was assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses. Cox proportional hazard models indicated that lack of OLIG1 protein was strongly associated with poor survival in NSCLC patients. Validation of these observations in an independent dataset mirrored the results first generated, further strengthening this association. Altogether, our results suggest that OLIG1 protein expression may provide an additional clinically useful parameter to determine the utility of supplementary therapy for patients suffering from lung NSCLC, especially since survival at 60 months is significantly correlated with OLIG1 protein expression. This finding is potentially of great significance, as the addition of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy in T2N0 NSCLC, for example, is currently a matter of great debate &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040108-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040108-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The percentage of samples lacking OLIG1 protein was higher than expected within the adenocarcinoma subgroup. On the basis of the totality of the data collected in this study, it is possible that a post-transcriptional mechanism acting preferentially in the adenocarcinomas may account for either lack of <italic>OLIG1</italic> mRNA translation or rapid degradation of the OLIG1 protein product. This scenario reconciles the initial observations of lower DNA methylation and higher mRNA expression in adenocarcinomas compared to SCCs with the later finding of a higher proportion of <italic>OLIG1</italic> negative adenocarcinomas. Nevertheless, this phenomenon deserves further investigation. The corroboration of a tumor subtype-specific post-translational regulatory mechanism in lung cancer would be an immense contribution toward further understanding the etiology of this disease.</p><p>The importance of <italic>OLIG1</italic> expression in adult lung may be explained, in part, by extrapolation of known functions of this gene in oligodendrocyte development &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040108-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040108-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. It has been shown that oligodendrocytes derived from <italic>OLIG1<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic><sup>/<italic>&#x02212;</italic></sup> mice are unable to differentiate &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040108-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;, suggesting that at least one of the functions of <italic>OLIG1</italic> may pertain to initiation or maintenance of cellular differentiation. At the same time, <italic>sonic hedgehog (SHH),</italic> a secreted ligand of the hedgehog-signaling pathway known to be overexpressed in lung cancer &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040108-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;, has been shown to be necessary and sufficient to activate <italic>OLIG</italic> genes in oligodendrocytes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040108-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, abrogation of OLIG1 protein expression may play a role in inhibiting cellular differentiation, but it could also contribute to the tumor phenotype in other ways through some of its downstream targets. <italic>MAG</italic>, a single-pass type I transmembrane protein involved in brain cellular adhesion &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040108-b039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040108-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d; is highly expressed in adult lung &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040108-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;, and it is also a known target of <italic>OLIG1</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040108-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. In light of these genetic interactions, a growth advantage could be conferred to tumor cells that overexpress SHH through interaction with currently unknown growth promoting targets, while at the same time abrogating OLIG1 expression concomitant to MAG down-regulation. This scenario would explain the high frequency of deletions and DNA methylation observed at the <italic>OLIG1</italic> locus. This hypothesis is reinforced by our observation that N0 NSCLC cases are more likely to be OLIG1 positive than N1 cases. Therefore, this phenotypic difference could stem, in part, from lack or reduced <italic>MAG</italic> expression in OLIG1 negative tumors, which could facilitate detachment of tumor cells from the primary tumor mass.</p><p>Taking into consideration the relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression, our study demonstrates that genome-wide DNA methylation patterns can be as useful in tumor subtype distinction as gene expression profiling, an approach that has been successfully utilized in the past to distinguish not only lung tumor subtypes but also phenotypic differences associated with survival within a lung tumor subclass &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040108-b042">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040108-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;. In light of our results, the establishment of differential DNA methylation patterns could reflect an intrinsic difference in the cellular origin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040108-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d; of each of the tumor subtypes, or by distinct oncogenic pathways activated predominantly in one subtype over the other. It has been well documented that gains in 3q22&#x02013;q26 where the alpha catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is located, occurs almost exclusively in SCCs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040108-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;. Overexpression of this gene could be correlated with increased activity of its downstream effector, protein kinase B, in this lung tumor subtype &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040108-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;. Given the evidence that DNA methylation may be the result of a priori down-regulation of gene expression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040108-b047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040108-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;, the establishment of differential DNA methylation patterns between lung tumor subtypes may be the result of distinct oncogenic activities affecting primarily one type of neoplasia and not the other. Additional studies will be needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms governing the establishment of tumor subtype specific DNA methylation patterns.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed-0040108-sd001"><label>Alternative Language Abstract S1</label><caption><title>Translation of the abstract into Spanish by Romulo Martin Brena.</title><p>(21 KB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.0040108.sd001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed-0040108-sg001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title><italic>Olig1</italic> Bisulfite DNA Sequencing in A549 and H1299 Cell Lines</title><p>(459 KB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.0040108.sg001.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed-0040108-st001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><title>Adenocarcinoma and SCC Samples Analyzed by RLGS to Generate Clusters</title><p>All clusters are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040108-g001">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>(A) Adenocarcinoma samples; samples A1 to A11 were used to generate cluster 1B.
