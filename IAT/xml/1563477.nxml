Both <italic>Pax6</italic><sup>+/+ </sup>and <italic>Pax6</italic><sup>+/- </sup>epithelia activated immediate wound-induced waves of intracellular calcium signaling. However, the intensity and speed of propagation of the calcium wave, mediated by release from intracellular stores, was reduced in <italic>Pax6</italic><sup>+/- </sup>cells. Initiation and propagation of the calcium wave could be largely decoupled, and both phases of the calcium wave responses were required for wound healing. Wounded cells phosphorylated the extracellular signal-related kinases 1/2 (phospho-ERK1/2). ERK1/2 activation was shown to be required for rapid initiation of wound healing, but had only a minor effect on the rate of cell migration in a healing epithelial sheet.

A model is presented whereby minor abrasions, which are quickly healed in normal corneas, transiently persist in aniridic patients, compromising the corneal stroma.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The transcription factor PAX6 is required for development and maintenance of several human ocular tissues, including the corneal epithelium. The gene <italic>PAX6 </italic>was identified by positional cloning as the defective gene in human aniridia and its associated ocular complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Heterozygous deficiency in <italic>PAX6 </italic>leads to ocular surface disease characterized by corneal opacification (aniridia-related keratopathy; ARK), and the <italic>Pax6</italic><sup>+/- </sup>mouse model displays all the morphologic defects of human ARK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. ARK in <italic>Pax6</italic><sup>+/- </sup>mice and humans is characterized by the presence of thin, fragile vacuolated corneal epithelia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. There is ingrowth of blood vessels into the cornea, sporadic appearance of goblet cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and infiltration by inflammatory cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The cell biology that links <italic>Pax6 </italic>dosage to changes in cellular behavior remains poorly understood. Maintenance of the structural integrity of the corneal epithelium is essential for corneal transparency. Impaired re-epithelialization after wounding increases the risk of infection, exacerbates inflammation, and undermines normal stromal remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The cumulative effect of very small corneal scars following chronic failure of wound repair may result in loss of transparency. It has recently been suggested that ARK may be due to corneal epithelial fragility combined with an abnormal wound-healing response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], resulting in degeneration of the cornea.</p><p>Epithelial sheets react to mechanical injuries via a complex process that relies on coordinated proliferation and migration into the denuded area, matrix deposition and tissue remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Wound-induced migration and proliferation are regulated by cytokines, extracellular matrix molecules, and growth factors including insulin-like growth factor, keratinocyte growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor and epidermal growth factor (EGF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>One of the first reactions to injury of the cell monolayer is an intracellular calcium rise spreading as a wave from the injury site to the neighboring cells. This has been reported in a range of cell systems, mainly in cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The wound-elicited calcium wave stimulates cell proliferation after injury, and is required for further healing processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The intensity of the calcium response quantitatively controls the subsequent rate of healing in some epithelial cells, and remodeled calcium signaling may underlie disease states such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, manic depression and Alzheimer's disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>Alongside the calcium wave, the other early response of epithelial cells to wounding is at least one slower wave of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) ERK1/2 phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The migration of at least some epithelial cell types appears to be ERK1/2-driven [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Addition of EGF activates ERK1/2 in a 'wild-type' rabbit corneal epithelial cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], and exerts positive effects on epithelial wound healing by promoting migration and mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In corneal epithelial cells, EGF exhibits a positive effect on proliferation via orchestrated calcium influx from intracellular calcium stores and extracellular space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>Work by our laboratory and several others have investigated the roles of Pax6 in control of cell adhesion in development and disease, but the downstream cell-signaling pathways have received less attention. We hypothesised that cell signaling may be faulty. As a model for the reactive cellular pathways that may be controlled by Pax6, we have developed an <italic>in vitro </italic>wounding assay for murine primary corneal epithelial cells and have investigated the roles of <italic>Pax6 </italic>in corneal healing. We find that unlike wild-type, <italic>Pax6</italic><sup>+/- </sup>cells fail to commence healing within the first 2 hours after wounding, and that wound-induced waves of calcium and phospho-ERK1/2 signaling are required for rapid response to wounding. Propagation of the wound-induced calcium wave is defective in <italic>Pax6</italic><sup>+/- </sup>cells, but addition of EGF restores calcium signaling and promotes ERK1/2 phosphorylation, rescuing their rapid response to wounding.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Wound healing is delayed in <italic>Pax6</italic><sup>+/- </sup>corneal epithelial cultures</title><p>The wound-healing response was investigated in primary murine corneal epithelial cells, cultured as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] on plastic or glass on which epithelial cells could attach and proliferate.

Epithelial monolayers were strongly positive for nuclear Pax6 staining (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>), which is required for corneal epithelial development and is a definitive marker for these cells.

Pax6 directly binds matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9, also known as <italic>gelB</italic>) promoter to upregulate MMP-9 in wounded corneas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. MMP-9 is one of a family of proteins required for tissue remodeling during wound repair.

The etiology of ARK is complicated, because anterior eye development is coordinated to some extent by the lens, which is very sensitive to Pax6 dosage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], and although the corneal epithelium expresses high levels of <italic>Pax6 </italic>throughout life, the stroma also expresses <italic>Pax6 </italic>around birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Corneal epithelial dysgenesis in Pax6 mutants might be the result of intrinsic defects within the epithelial cells themselves or the fault of defective tissue-tissue interactions in the eye. The extent to which tissue-tissue interactions contribute to corneal epithelial dysgenesis can be addressed by isolating the epithelial cells. If cultured mutant corneal epithelial cells were phenotypically and molecularly normal, we would infer that the corneal epithelial defects were secondary to a problem with Pax6 dosage elsewhere in the eye. To identify the primary defects that underlie the etiology of the disease, we therefore investigated wound healing in <italic>Pax6</italic><sup>+/- </sup>corneal epithelial primary culture. We developed and validated an <italic>in vitro </italic>system for wound healing in primary murine corneal epithelia. Cells formed <italic>Pax6</italic>-positive confluent epithelial sheets, and we demonstrated that they show physiological calcium and MAPK responses to injury. The results of the investigation were surprising, with fundamental implications for the links between transcription-factor action, cell signaling, cell behavior, and disease.</p><sec><title>Pax6 dosage and wound healing</title><p><italic>Pax6</italic><sup>+/- </sup>corneal epithelial cultures expressed substantial quantities of Pax6, estimated to be about 60&#x02013;70% that of wild-type.

Furthermore, corneal epithelial cells are derived from Pax6-positive stem-like cells in the corneal periphery (limbal stem cells) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>], and heterozygosity at the <italic>PAX6 </italic>locus compromises these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and leads to the production of corneal epithelia that may not be fully differentiated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>].

The first 2 hours of wound healing were not studied by Ramaesh et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>], levels of Pax6 were not assayed, and the calcium or MAPK response to wounding in the epithelium was not studied. As described above, in the whole-eye culture system, the corneal epithelial migration is modulated by the presence of an inflamed stroma, which would be expected to accelerate cell migration over extended periods of healing. Another important difference between the experiments is the size of the wounds, which were very large (1000&#x02013;1200 &#x003bc;m) in the study by Ramaesh et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>], encompassing up to half the cornea and encroaching on the limbal region. Larger wounds in <italic>Pax6</italic><sup>+/- </sup>corneal epithelia healed faster than smaller wounds (presumably because larger wounds were closer to the source of proliferating limbal stem cells), and extrapolation from figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> in that study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>] suggested that wounds smaller than 500 &#x003bc;m in diameter would heal more slowly than wild-type. Wounds in our system are smaller and more physiological, rarely larger than 200 &#x003bc;m, so there is therefore no immediate contradiction between our work and this new study; however, the situation appears to be more complicated than that presented by either paper, and there is clearly more work needed.</p><p>Our data show that there is no defect <italic>per se </italic>in the ability of mutant cells to migrate normally, providing they get the correct signals.

The mechanisms underlying this failure have wide relevance for the understanding of the molecular basis of the wound-healing response. In this study, it was found that the delay in <italic>Pax6</italic><sup>+/-</sup>wound healing was associated with a decrease in the intensity and rate of propagation of the wound-induced calcium wave. Extracellular calcium was required for the large initial calcium rise, and intracellular calcium stores were shown to be essential for wave propagation. Hence, it is suggested that the failure in <italic>Pax6</italic><sup>+/- </sup>cells is due to slow or inefficient release of calcium from stores. It has been shown previously that a quantitative decrease in capacitive calcium entry to wounded gastrointestinal mucosal epithelial cells, facilitated by calcium release from the stores, leads to a quantitatively reduced healing response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].

The pattern of immunolabeling was identical to that found previously by Matsubayashi et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] upon wounding of MDCK epithelial cells.

Our data suggest that EGF signaling functions via enhanced calcium and ERK1/2 signaling to initiate cell migration.</p></sec><sec><title>Wound healing in <italic>Pax6</italic><sup>+/- </sup>corneas</title><p>Based on our data, we divide wound healing into an immediate period of 2 hours when calcium and MAPK signaling occur to initiate a rapid migratory response, and the subsequent 'post-initial' coordinated movement of epithelial sheets when cell migration is maintained. In the hours subsequent to this, cell proliferation is initiated; this last process is also modulated by Pax6 and the role of Pax6 in this regard has been studied previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>].</p><p>We propose a model, based on our data combined with previous studies cited earlier, which postulates that <italic>Pax6 </italic>dosage does not affect the rate of corneal epithelial cell migration <italic>per se </italic>on a neutral substrate. In contrast, the primary defect of the <italic>Pax6</italic><sup>+/- </sup>corneal epithelium is the initial failure to respond to wounding. We have shown that upon wounding a corneal epithelium, external calcium enters cells around the wound, and this is quantitative similar in both wild-type and <italic>Pax6</italic><sup>+/- </sup>cells. Further propagation of calcium rise to cells away from the wound is required for the wound response, which is realized by cell-cell signaling via P2Y receptors and involves predominantly calcium from intracellular stores. We have shown that this process is inefficient in <italic>Pax6</italic><sup>+/- </sup>cells, and that secondary messenger ERK1/2 signaling pathways must also be activated following wounding to initiate immediate cell migration. Calcium signaling occurs in the first 2 minutes, whereas ERK1/2 signaling is expected to peak about 3&#x02013;10 minutes after wounding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Both calcium and ERK responses are sensitive to EGF, which is present in tears at 1&#x02013;10 ng/ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>], and we show that calcium response to EGF is diminished in heterozygotes (possibly due to mislocalisation of EGFR in the mutant epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]). Together, these cell-signaling problems decelerate the response of mutant cells to small physiological wounds. <italic>In vivo</italic>, the chronic delay in sealing small holes caused by minor abrasion or other cell loss may be sufficient to allow the corneal stroma to become compromised, leading to opacity. We therefore link a transcription factor mutation, via defects in calcium signaling, to a cellular abnormality that underlies human disease.</p><p>Microarray study in the lens suggested that as many as 5000 genes may be regulated by <italic>Pax6 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. It was perhaps expected therefore that the links between Pax6 and cell behavior would be pleiotropic, with a complex etiology intractable to mechanistic investigation. Our data suggest, however, that this is not the case, and that the link between genetics of disease and pharmacological correction (in this case via EGF) may not be so esoteric.</p><p>Wound healing is in part a recapitulation of important developmental pathways, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>] and it is very likely that the genetic pathways investigated here recapitulate genetic pathways that are controlled by Pax6 during development. We hypothesize that in other organ systems where Pax6 and calcium signaling are both known to be required, such as axon guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>], Pax6 dosage may directly control the kinetics of the calcium response of cells to their external environment.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Propagation of wound-induced signaling via calcium release from intracellular stores is inefficient in <italic>Pax6</italic><sup>+/- </sup>corneal epithelial cells, and this underlies an intrinsic wound-healing delay. Pax6 dosage does not, however, affect the rate of cell migration in healing epithelia, 2&#x02013;6 hours after wounding. MAP kinase signaling via phosphorylation of ERK1/2 is required for the immediate wound-healing response, but has only a marginal effect on the rate of cell migration in a healing epithelium. Addition of EGF prior to wounding rescues the calcium response in mutant cells and exaggerates the levels of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, restoring rapid wound-induced cell migration. Failure to respond quickly to minor wounding in fragile <italic>Pax6</italic><sup>+/- </sup>corneal epithelia could lead to the observed chronic corneal degeneration in patients, but our data suggest that pharmacological manipulation of the EGF pathway is a potential therapeutic strategy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mice and cell culture</title><p><italic>Pax6</italic><sup>+/<italic>Sey</italic>-<italic>Neu </italic></sup>(<italic>Pax6</italic><sup>+/-</sup>) mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>] were maintained on the CBA/Ca genetic background by heterozygous mating.
