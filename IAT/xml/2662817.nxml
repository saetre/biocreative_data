Continued growth of the condensations and differentiation of the mesenchymal cells into chondrocytes results in the formation of cartilage templates, or anlagen, which prefigure the shape of the future bones. The chondrocytes in the anlagen further differentiate by undergoing a complex sequence of maturation and hypertrophy, and are eventually replaced by mineralized bone.

The development of the vertebrate limb skeleton is initiated when multipotent mesenchymal cells in the limb bud aggregate to form mesenchymal condensations which prefigure the skeletal elements. Cells within the pre-chondrogenic condensation up-regulate cell adhesion mechanisms and begin to synthesize specific extracellular matrix molecules, and the condensations expand through a combination of proliferation and recruitment of surrounding mesenchyme. The generation of these condensations creates an environment which is conducive to chondrogenic differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. As the cells differentiate into chondrocytes, they synthesize a framework of cartilage matrix, known as an anlage, in the approximate shape of the future bone. Chondrocytes in the centre of the anlage proceed through a series of discrete developmental stages that include proliferation, maturation and hypertrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The hypertrophic cartilage is first calcified and then, following vascular invasion, replaced by primary bone that is subsequently remodelled to form secondary bone. This process radiates outwards from the centre of the anlage with the development of highly ordered growth plates that separate the cartilaginous epiphyses from the bony diaphysis. Later in development, secondary centres of ossification develop within the epiphyses and, with subsequent fusion of the ossification centres during puberty, endochondral ossification and bone growth ceases.</p><p>The regulatory network that controls early chondrogenesis is incompletely understood although several key components have been characterized. Prior to pre-chondrogenic mesenchymal condensation in the developing vertebrate limb bud, Bmp expression is upregulated in the mesenchyme flanking the anterior and posterior margins and in the presumptive interdigital mesenchyme, in a manner consistent with a role for these genes in limb patterning and in initiating chondrogenesis and skeletal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, viral misexpression of the Bmp-antagonist, Noggin, in the developing limb during embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and targeted over-expression of Noggin in chondroprogenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], both result in complete blockage of mesenchymal condensation and chondrogenesis, proving the requirement for Bmp signalling in the initiation of chondrogenesis. Bmp signalling serves multiple purposes during the initiation of chondrogenesis; it may contribute to the recruitment of cells to the condensation, the proliferation of cells within the condensation, as well as regulating the expression of genes involved in driving the differentiation of condensed mesenchyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In addition to the roles of Bmps in skeletal development <italic>per se</italic>, Bmp, along with Bmp antagonists (eg., chordin and noggin) and members of the Gdf (growth and differentiation factor) family are involved in controlling the cartilage condensations that develop into the synovial joint. The Fgf family of growth factors and their receptors also play an important role in chondrocyte differentiation, possibly by limiting chondrocyte proliferation, since activating mutations in <italic>FGFR3 </italic>cause achondroplasia and thanatophoric dysplasia and <italic>Fgfr3</italic>-deficient mice have an enlarged growth plate. A critical component of chondrocyte lineage specification is Sox9 (a high mobility group transcription factor), which exerts its influence over chondrogenesis, in part, by regulating the expression of multiple cartilage-specific proteins including Col2a1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The influence of Sox9 on chondrogenesis is largely dependent upon Sox5 and Sox6, with which it co-regulates the chondrogenic program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>In addition to the signalling cascades, the extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a fundamental role in morphogenesis and development by regulating cell differentiation, proliferation, adhesion, and migration, and by modulating growth factor bioavailability. Mesenchymal condensations are characterized by the expression of a specific ECM, components of which include fibronectin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], tenascin C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], NG2 proteoglycan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], syndecan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and chondroitin-sulphate proteoglycans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The ECM has important roles in promoting the condensation and differentiation of mesenchymal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. As the cells differentiate into chondrocytes they express specific ECM components with unique functional and biological characteristics which are critical for cartilage structure and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The predominant, well-characterized cartilage matrix components are the proteoglycan, aggrecan, and members of the collagen protein family. Collagen II is a major homotrimeric collagen expressed throughout the cartilage that interacts specifically with other minor collagens such as IX and XI to modulate interfibrillar interactions between the heterotypic collagen fibrils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Mutations in many of these collagen genes have been identified in human chondrodysplasias and in mouse models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Collagen VI is a microfibrillar collagen which is found localized in the pericellular space around chondrocytes in epiphyseal cartilage.</p><p>Cartilage contains many other proteins, some of which have been well-characterized and whose roles in cartilage structure and function have been elucidated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Some of the best characterized components are the small leucine-rich proteins (SLRPs), such as decorin, fibromodulin, lumican and biglycan which interact with collagen fibrils and influence collagen fibrillar architecture and function. These SLRPs have growth factor binding properties that may have profound influences on cartilage cell proliferation. Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein also binds collagen fibrils and may also mediate cell-matrix interactions. Other proteins include chondroadherin and thrombospondin which have cell-matrix binding properties; tenascins, osteonectin and members of the matrilin family, matrilins 1 and 3, that are thought to form interacting assemblies integrating the collagen and proteoglycan networks.</p><p>While a number of the chondrogenesis genes have been extensively characterized, the full spectrum of components involved in regulating chondrogenesis during limb development has yet to be determined. However, with the advent of high quality whole genome microarrays we now have the unique opportunity to determine the comprehensive gene expression pattern of processes such as chondrogenesis, to define novel components and further unravel the complex developmental processes involved. The application of such expression profiling approaches to cartilage formation <italic>in vivo </italic>has thus far been restricted by the technical challenge of obtaining high quality RNA from the target tissues. Consequently, expression studies to date have been conducted on either whole mouse limbs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] or on <italic>in vitro </italic>models of chondrogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. While these studies have been useful in identifying some chondrogenic genes, they suffer from the limitations of analysing heterogeneous tissues or the complex gene expression consequences that may result from <italic>in vitro </italic>culture.</p><p>In this study we report the first global gene expression profiling analysis of the transition of pre-condensed mesenchymal cells into mesenchymal condensations, and their subsequent differentiation into chondrocytes, using tissue microdissected from <italic>in vivo </italic>mouse limb buds. By comparison of the gene expression profiles of cartilage pre-condensation tissue at 11.5 dpc, mesenchymal condensations at 12.5 dpc, and differentiated cartilage tissue at 13.5 dpc, we were able to identify the candidate gene cohorts involved in the initiation of chondrogenesis and in the early development of cartilage anlagen. As well as identifying novel genes that may be critical in the regulation and maintenance of chondrogenesis, our data allowed us to present the first comprehensive expression analysis of the known developmentally important gene families during <italic>in vivo </italic>chondrogenesis during mouse limb skeletal development. These data provide confirmation of the role of many members of these key gene families, and also implicate other members of these, and other gene families in chondrogenesis for the first time.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Microdissected samples from 11.5 dpc to 13.5 dpc encompass the initial developmental steps of chondrogenesis</title><p>Prior to microarray analysis, the differential expression of selected key markers of mesenchymal condensation and chondrogenesis was assayed by semi-quantitative PCR to confirm the developmental stage represented by each microdissected tissue sample (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

Ncad is a cell-cell adhesion molecule whose role in mesenchymal condensation during limb development has been well characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].

The chondroinductive potential of the Bmp family has been extensively analysed, and it is known that chondrogenesis may be induced by the activity of Bmp2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], Bmp4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], Bmp5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], Bmp6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], and Bmp7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Moreover, expression of Bmp8a in developing long bones has been demonstrated, and it is known to map to the mouse achondroplasia locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], suggesting that it too may be an important regulator of chondrogenesis.

Gdf5 may induce chondrogenesis <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], and it has been used to induce ectopic chondrogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>, in part by stimulating expression of another marker of chondrogenesis, transcription factor Barx2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Moreover, single gene knock-outs of <italic>Gdf5 </italic>and <italic>Gdf6 </italic>resulted in defects in multiple elements of the appendicular and craniofacial skeletons, while a more severe skeletal phenotype was observed for the <italic>Gdf5</italic>/<italic>Gdf6 </italic>double knock-out mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].

The steady up-regulation of <italic>Gdf10 </italic>observed between 11.5 dpc and 13.5 dpc in the present study however, suggests that Gdf10 may play an important role in mesenchymal condensation and chondrocyte maturation. Overall, six <italic>Gdf </italic>genes were expressed during <italic>in vivo </italic>chondrogenesis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). <italic>Gdf6 </italic>was found to be most highly differentially expressed, peaking at 12.5 dpc, although overall expression of <italic>Gdf6 </italic>was very low. Both <italic>Gdf5 </italic>and <italic>Gdf10 </italic>were strongly expressed, and highly differentially expressed. <italic>Gdf1</italic>, although not highly differentially expressed, was found to be expressed strongly throughout <italic>in vivo </italic>chondrogenesis.</p><p>It is well established that Wnt proteins mediate important signalling pathways at various stages of chondrogenesis. Accordingly, Wnt gene expression <italic>in vivo </italic>is found to be spatially and temporally restricted within the developing cartilage anlage. <italic>Wnt4 </italic>expression is localized to the developing joints, <italic>Wnt5a </italic>to the perichondrium, and <italic>Wnt5b </italic>to the perichondrium and prehypertrophic chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Moreover, functional work presented in the same studies demonstrated that Wnt4 promotes chondrocyte hypertrophy, while Wnt5a and Wnt5b operate conversely, by impeding terminal chondrocyte differentiation. Thus, while the data generated by microarray analysis here provides valuable information about relative expression levels, the authors recognise that it cannot provide information regarding the spatial distribution of transcripts within the microdissected tissues.

Our differential expression data (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>) support and extend these findings by revealing significant up-regulation of both <italic>Fgf18 </italic>and <italic>Fgfr3 </italic>between 11.5 dpc and 13.5 dpc, and by clarifying the differential expression patterns of <italic>Fgf </italic>ligands and <italic>Fgf </italic>receptors within chondrogenic tissue <italic>in vivo</italic>. Of considerable interest was the finding that <italic>Fgfr4 </italic>expression is significantly up-regulated between 11.5 dpc and 13.5 dpc.

Four <italic>Hoxb </italic>genes were weakly expressed during <italic>in vivo </italic>chondrogenesis, and none of them were highly differentially expressed. Only one <italic>Hoxc </italic>gene (<italic>Hoxc10</italic>) was highly differentially expressed during <italic>in vivo </italic>chondrogenesis, down-regulated by almost 3-fold from 11.5 dpc to 13.5 dpc. None of the other <italic>Hoxc </italic>genes were significantly differentially expressed, although the expression level of <italic>Hoxc9 </italic>was found to be very high throughout the time course. Most of the <italic>Hoxd </italic>gene cluster were very weakly expressed. The most highly down-regulated <italic>Hoxd </italic>genes were generally the more 3' members of the cluster (<italic>Hoxd9</italic>, <italic>Hoxd10</italic>, <italic>Hoxd11</italic>, and <italic>Hoxd13</italic>). While <italic>Hox </italic>genes have established roles in pattern formation, they may play additional roles in chondrogenesis. The overall down-regulation of the more highly expressed members of the <italic>Hox </italic>family suggests that <italic>Hox </italic>gene silencing may be required for the progression of cartilage formation. Transgenic mouse data showing that the persistent expression of <italic>Hoxa2 </italic>in cells entering chondrogenesis impairs cartilage development and causes chondrodysplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>], supports this inhibitory role for at least a subset of <italic>Hox </italic>genes.

Moderate expression levels were detected for five <italic>Sox </italic>genes and of these, only <italic>Sox8 </italic>was significantly differentially expressed, up-regulated by almost 4-fold between 11.5 dpc and 13.5 dpc. Seven <italic>Sox </italic>genes were found to be expressed weakly during <italic>in vivo </italic>chondrogenesis. Expression data generated in the present study are consistent with the importance of <italic>Sox9 </italic>throughout chondrogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. <italic>Sox9 </italic>was not highly differentially expressed from 11.5 dpc to 13.5 dpc but its average Log<sub>2 </sub>intensity was found to be extremely high, indicating ubiquitously high expression of <italic>Sox9 </italic>throughout the transition from pre-chondrogenic mesenchymal cell to fully differentiated chondrocyte. It is known that Sox9 exerts its influence over chondrogenesis, in part, by regulating the expression of multiple prominent components of the cartilage matrix including the quintessential chondrocyte marker, <italic>Col2a1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This transcriptional activity was found to be largely dependent upon the combined activity of a long form of Sox5 (L-Sox5), and Sox6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. In the present study, <italic>Sox6 </italic>expression closely resembles that of <italic>Sox9 </italic>in that although it was not found to be highly differentially expressed throughout chondrogenesis, its absolute expression level (average Log<sub>2 </sub>intensity) was found to be very high.</p><p>Interestingly <italic>Sox5 </italic>expression was quite low in the present study (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5I</xref>). It is possible that this result does not accurately reflect the abundance of <italic>Sox5 </italic>transcripts because of technical limitations with array design. The single probe for <italic>Sox5 </italic>on the microarray is located 1445 bp upstream of the 3'-end of the mouse <italic>Sox5 </italic>coding sequence, and since the amplified RNA used to interrogate to array has an inherent 3' bias, it is likely that this results in an inability to hybridize efficiently.</p><p>Our results also demonstrate that additional <italic>Sox </italic>genes, <italic>Sox4, Sox8</italic>, <italic>Sox10, Sox11 and Sox13 </italic>participate in chondrogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>.

Moreover, in the same study it was noted that each of these genes was up-regulated in ectopic cartilages in response to Bmp7, implying roles for Sox8 and Sox10 in chondrogenesis. The highly similar expression patterns detected for <italic>Sox8 </italic>and <italic>Sox10 </italic>here suggest that these genes may have overlapping functions <italic>in vivo</italic>. That <italic>Sox8 </italic>and <italic>Sox10 </italic>are most highly expressed at 13.5 dpc points towards roles for these genes <italic>in vivo </italic>in chondrocyte maturation, or in preparing chondrocytes for subsequent hypertrophy. <italic>Sox13 </italic>was up-regulated from 11.5 dpc to 12.5 dpc, to a level at which it was maintained until 13.5 dpc.

In order to identify such genes, ontological approaches were undertaken to classify differentially expressed genes according to biological process and thus identify those for which an association with ontologies relating to cartilage and skeletal development has yet to be made. Accordingly, the 931 genes for which a differential expression of greater than three and a average Log<sub>2 </sub>intensity of greater than or equal to six was observed between 11.5 dpc &#x02013; 13.5 dpc (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>) were interrogated by GOstat software using the MGI GO gene association database <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gostat.wehi.edu.au/"/> in order to identify highly represented gene ontologies. As predicted, ontologies relating to cartilage and skeletal development were observed. Among the down-regulated genes, 9 were classified under 'skeletal development' (GO:0001501). Among the up-regulated genes, 30 were classified under 'skeletal development' (GO:0001501), 20 under 'ossification' (GO:0001503), 15 under 'cartilage development' (GO:0051216), 5 under 'chondrocyte differentiation' (GO:0002062), and 4 under 'cartilage condensation' (GO:0001502). Of these genes, 44 appeared under multiple classifications. Therefore, a total of 39 genes were classified by GOstat analysis as having previously been implicated in cartilage or skeletal development, leaving 892 novel genes for which an ontological association with chondrogenesis has yet to made. Thus, this study has served to identify a large cohort of novel genes whose expression or function during <italic>in vivo </italic>chondrogenesis is uncharacterized and potentially represents important developmental regulators. This dataset is therefore an important reference for future gene discovery and stands as an invaluable resource for ongoing research into skeletal development and disease.</p><p>Our studies are the first comprehensive attempt to identify genes which regulate the initiation of chondrogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>. We have described the differential expression patterns observed for major gene families encoding adhesion molecules, transcription factors, and signalling molecules known to be important in many developmental processes, and have implicated members of these developmental gene families in chondrogenesis for the first time. In addition, we have identified many new candidate genes that may be involved in the initiation of chondrogenesis, on the basis of their differential expression patterns observed here, in combination with their known association with specific biological processes or known molecular function.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>By conducting whole genome microarray analyses of RNA derived specifically from tissues representative of key stages of <italic>in vivo </italic>limb bud chondrogenesis, we have generated and thoroughly validated expression profiles which for the first time define the suite of genes expressed by chondrogenic tissues in the formation of cartilage from pre-condensed mesenchyme during embryogenesis. In doing so, we have defined the expression profiles of known chondrogenically and developmentally important gene families expressed by chondrogenic tissues during cartilage formation, and have identified 931 genes significantly differentially expressed during this process, consisting of large gene cohorts particular to each stage of cartilage development &#x02013; pre-condensed mesenchyme, mesenchymal condensations, and cartilage anlagen. It is anticipated that these data will be important in further unravelling the fundamental control networks which drive cartilage development, in investigating the molecular pathology of inherited skeletal diseases, and in exploring which properties of pre-skeletal limb bud mesenchymal cells predispose them to efficient chondrogenic differentiation, the understanding of which promises to aid research into therapeutic cartilage repair. Thus, the data-set generated in this study stands as an important development for skeletal biology research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Microdissection of chondrogenic condensations and preparation of RNA</title><p>We have previously reported global differential expression profiles corresponding to zones of the growth plate generated by microarray analysis of RNA derived from tissue microdissected from long bones of Swiss white mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. So that these datasets could be compared with those of the present study, Swiss white mice were used here also. Accordingly, pregnant female Swiss white mice were sacrificed in accordance with Institutional Animal Ethics guidelines and embryos were harvested at 11.5 dpc, 12.5 dpc and 13.5 dpc and transferred to PBS at 4&#x000b0;C. The hind limb buds were promptly dissected and embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT (Sakura Fine Technical), snap-frozen in isopentane and stored at -80&#x000b0;C. 6 &#x003bc;m sections of limb tissue corresponding to the regions of tibial and fibular development were prepared using a cryostat (Leica CM1850), mounted on RNAse-free SuperFrost Plus slides (Biolab Scientific), fixed in 70% ethanol, washed in RNAse-free water, and dehydrated in 70%, 95%, and 100% ethanol for thirty seconds each, and air-dried. Regions corresponding to the mesenchymal condensations of developing tibiae and fibulae were microdissected from slides immobilized on the stage of an inverted light microscope (Leica DM IL) using an ophthalmic scalpel (Feather) fixed to the scanning xy-object guide. Mesenchymal condensations and cartilage anlagen at 12.5 dpc and 13.5 dpc were readily visible in untreated (ie fixed and dehydrated, but not stained) sections by light microscopy, allowing precise microdissection of these tissues. In 12.5 dpc hind limb sections, a prominent blood vessel was found to run between, and perpendicular to the developing tibia and fibula, thus appearing in the transverse plane as the tibia and fibula came into view (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The appearance of this blood vessel was used as a guide for locating the precondensed mesenchymal cells in 11.5 dpc hind limb sections. 231 sections from a total of four 11.5 dpc mouse hind limbs, three 12.5 dpc mouse hind limbs, and four 13.5 dpc mouse hind limbs were microdissected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The tissue from each time point was pooled into RNase-free Eppendorf tubes and total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen). To assess RNA yield, purity, and integrity, total RNA samples were interrogated by capillary electrophoresis with a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies), using a Series II RNA 6000 Pico Kit, according to the manufacturer's specifications (Agilent Technologies). All total RNA samples were confirmed to be of high quality, with a RIN of &#x0003e;7.7 (Agilent). Total RNA from tibial and fibular tissue microdissected from each time point was linearly amplified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>] in two rounds using the MessageAmp aRNA kit (Ambion) following the manufacturer's instructions. 100&#x02013;150 ng of first-round amplified cRNA was used as template for each of the second round amplifications. Quality and yield was assessed by capillary electrophoresis. Amplified RNA samples (1.25 &#x003bc;g) were fluorescently labelled with Cy3 or Cy5 fluorophores (Amersham) according to the manufacturer's instructions, analysed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis, and visualized using a Typhoon fluorescence scanner (Amersham) (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>). These data demonstrated that the majority of transcripts in each sample were approximately 150 nt &#x02013; 400 nt in length, and the lack of low molecular weight fluorescent signal confirmed that all unincorporated dyes were successfully removed during the purification procedure.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Mouse hindlimb microdissections</bold>. 11.5 dpc, 12.5 dpc, and 13.5 dpc mouse hindlimb cryosections stained with Toluidine Blue.

Thus, cRNA samples from each time point were labelled with both Cy3 and Cy5 fluorophores, and six hybridizations were performed such that each time point was compared with each other time point using both dye combinations (to normalize against dye biases). 44 K whole mouse genome microarrays (G4122F, ID014868, Agilent) were hybridized according to the manufacturer's instructions. The arrays were then scanned at 10 &#x003bc;m resolution on an Axon 4000B scanner and the features acquired with the GenePix Pro 4.1 software (Axon Instruments).

Reverse transcription reactions were performed using equal quantities of cRNA as template, to generate cDNA. Equal quantities of cDNA were used as template for PCR amplification of specific genes, using primers designed as close as possible to the end of the 3' untranslated region of the cDNA sequence. To ensure that the reactions were stopped during the linear phase of amplification, reactions were set up in triplicate and routinely removed from the thermocycler at 25 cycles, 30 cycles, and 35 cycles. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used for quantitative validation of the differential expression of specific genes during hind limb chondrogenesis. Primers for qPCR were designed using online software <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.roche-applied-science.com/sis/rtpcr/upl/adc.jsp"/>. qPCR was performed using the FastStart TaqMan Probe Master real time PCR kit in 10 &#x003bc;l reactions comprised of 5 &#x003bc;l Roche FastStart Probe Master (Rox), 50 ng cDNA, 240 nM additional ROX Reference Dye, 100 nM UPL Probe, and 200 nM each primer. Thermal cycling was conducted on an Applied Biosystems 7700 Real-Time PCR System, as follows: initial denaturation at 95&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes, followed by 50 cycles of denaturation at 95&#x000b0;C for 30 seconds, annealing and polymerization at 60&#x000b0;C for one minute. qPCR data were analyzed using Applied Biosystems SDS 2.2.2 software.
