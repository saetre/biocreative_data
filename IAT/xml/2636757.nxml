Several HS chains are attached to a syndecan or glypican protein core. HS has been found to bind and regulate the activity of various extracellular matrix metalloproteases (MMP) such as MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-7, MMP-9 and MMP-13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In Alzheimer's disease the activity of BACE1, an enzyme responsible for the production of the amyloidogenic peptide, has been shown to be directly regulated by interactions with HS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Cell surface proteases take part in cell signaling by i) producing soluble extracellular mediators such as growth factors, chemokines and cytokines from membrane bound precursors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and ii) generating intracellular signaling molecules from transmembrane protein receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. One such cell surface protease is tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;) converting enzyme, TACE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>TACE has also been shown to cleave various cell surface receptors including ErbB4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. ErbB4 receptor belongs to the EGF receptor family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), which share homology with the avian erythroblastosis virus oncogenic factor v-erbB. It has been shown to stimulate cell survival, proliferation and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Four different ErbB4 isoforms can be generated by alternative splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The juxtamembrane isoform JM-a is recognized and cleaved by TACE, whereas JM-b is not cleavable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The cytoplasmic isoforms either bind (JM-a CYT-1, JM-b CYT-1) or can not bind (JM-a CYT-2, JM-b CYT-2 phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-K) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Proteolytically produced ErbB4 CYT-2 80 kDa fragments has been shown to favor cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>The expression of heparan sulfate cleaving &#x003b2;-endoglucuronidase, heparanase, is tightly controlled in normal tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, in inflammed or cancer tissue and in several cancer cell lines the expression of heparanase has been shown to be elevated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and the high expression of heparanase has been linked to highly invasive cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In breast cancer nuclear localization of ErbB4 receptor has been demonstrated and nuclear ErbB4 expression has been shown to be associated with unfavorable disease prognosis when compared to membraneous ErbB4 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>In this communication we describe for the first time that removal of cell surface HS increases membrane bound ErbB4 80 kDa fragment formation by TACE-like activity. Further, removal of cell surface HS enhanced the capability of living cells to cleave synthetic TACE substrate peptide suggesting that cell surface HS regulates TACE activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Preparation of expression constructs</title><p>Hemagglutinin (HA) -tagged human TACE encoding vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] was a generous gift from Professor A. Ullrich, Max Planck Institute, Germany. HA-tagged ErbB4 JM-a and JM-b CYT-2 receptor constructs were generated as follows: Sequence encoding the aminoterminal part of the full length receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] was joined in front of a sequence encoding HA-tag at the C-terminus of ErbB4 CYT2 80 kDa fragment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Flag-tagged syndecan-4 expression construct in pcDNA3.1 Neo vector (Promega, USA) was generated by trimming the flag-peptide encoding sequence to the 3'-terminus of syndecan-4 cDNA derived from MCF-7 cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Generation and maintenance of the MCF-7 human breast cancer cells expressing human ErbB4 JM-a CYT-2 has been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. T47D cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10 FCS and glutamine. For immunoblot analysis cells were grown to 40&#x02013;50% confluency on 6-well tissue culture plates. For confocal microscopy, cells were grown on coverslips in flat-bottomed 24-well tissue culture plates. Transfections were done by using Fugene-6 transfection reagent (Roche, Switzerland).</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation and analysis of cell lysates</title><p>Cells grown to 70% confluency on 6-well tissue culture plates were washed twice with PBS prior to treatments. Incubations with enzymes and control treatments were performed at +37&#x000b0;C for 30 min in PBS supplemented with 10 &#x003bc;M calcium acetate and 10 mM glucose. Heparitinase and chondroitinase (Seikagaku, Japan) were used at 0.01 U/ml. After incubation cells were lysed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] in the presence of TACE inhibitor 2 mM 1,10 orto-phenanthroline (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. For immunoprecipitation the NaCl concentration of the lysates were adjusted to 150 mM. The precipitations and immunoblots were performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of TACE activity</title><p>Recombinant human TACE and TACE substrate peptide (Fluorescent substrate peptide III) were purchased from R&#x00026;D Systems (USA). The amount of generated fluorescence was measured according to manufacturer's instructions after 60 min incubation at +37&#x000b0;C in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of bovine lung heparin (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) or bovine kidney HS (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). TACE activity on living MCF-7 cells was measured after cells were grown to 80% confluency on flat-bottomed 96-well plates. Cells were incubated for 30 min in PBS containing 10 mM glucose in the presence or absence of 0.001 U/ml heparitinase or chondroitinase (Seikagaku, Japan). After incubation, cells were washed and the generation of fluorescent end product was followed at 5 min intervals. The enzyme assay buffer was supplemented with 0.2 mM phenylmethyl sulphonium fluoride and 5 mM EDTA.</p></sec><sec><title>Confocal microscopy</title><p>Cells grown on coverslips were fixed and permeabilized with ice-cold methanol. Primary antibodies were used as following dilutions: HFR-1 monoclonal mouse anti-ErbB4 intracellular fragment (Neomarkers, USA) at 1:50; monoclonal rat anti-hemagglutinin 12CA5 epitope and monoclonal mouse anti-myc 9E10 epitope at 1:100 (Zymed, USA). Secondary antibodies were diluted in 10% FBS-PBS as follows: Alexa-568 goat anti-rat at 1:400; Alexa-488 goat anti-mouse at 1:400 (Molecular Probes, USA). Coverslips were embedded on Vecta Shield Hard Set mounting solution containing DAPI. Samples were analyzed with Zeiss LSM-510 Meta confocal microscope.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>Cleavage of ErbB4 receptor to soluble ectodomain and membrane-bound 80 kDa fragment can be induced by receptor-ligand binding and phorbol myristyl acetate (PMA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and the cleavage is dependent on TACE activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The quantity of ErbB4 JM-a CYT-2 80 kDa fragment upon treatment of MCF-7 cells with heparitinase was increased to extent comparable to control treatment with PMA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). No increase in the amount of ErbB4 80 kDa fragment could be detected after degradation of cell surface HS with the presence of TAPI-0, a potent inhibitor for TACE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. To ascertain that presence of TACE-cleavable ErbB4 juxtamembrane domain is required for the cleavage of the receptor induced by HS removal, MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with carboxy-terminally hemagglutinin-tagged ErbB4 JM-a CYT-2 or JM-b CYT-2 receptor isoform. The carboxyterminal HA-tag has recently been shown not to affect the ErbB4 receptor cleavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. As expected, no 80 kDa HA-immunoreactive protein was present in JM-b CYT2HA expressing cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The enhancement of ErbB4 80 kDa fragment formation could be demonstrated also in the context of endogenously expressed ErbB4 in T47D human breast cancer cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Degradation of chondroitin sulfate did not impose similar effect on ErbB4 80 kDa fragment formation as heparitinase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Degradation of cell surface HS can potentially release growth factors or induce their processing form membrane bound precursors which in turn may trigger growth factor receptor processing. Members of the epidermal growth factor family are generally heat-stabile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] whereas heparitinase is readily inactivated in temperatures over 52&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Incubation supernatant from heparitinase treatment of T47D cells was heat inactivated 10 minutes at 65 &#x000b0;C and used to treat T47D cells. Only minor effect on ErbB4 80 kDa fragment formation could be demonstrated with heat-inactivated supernatant compared to heparitinase treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). This indicated that the effect of heparitinase treatment appears to be mainly due to the removal of HS <italic>per se</italic>. However, growth factor release induced receptor processing may simultaneously happen in smaller extent.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>A) The effects of heparitinase and PMA can be reverted by adding 40 &#x003bc;M TAPI-0 to the incubation medium</bold>. MCF-7 cells were treated for 30 minutes and Triton-X100 soluble lysates containing 40 &#x003bc;g protein were subjected to immunoblot.

B) The effect of heparitinase is specific for TACE-cleavable (JM-a) ErbB4 isoform. MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with ErbB4 JM-a CYT2HA or JM-b CYT2HA gene construct. Lysates were subjected to immunoblot with HA-specific monoclonal antibody. C) The effect of heparitinase treatment could be demonstrated in T47D cells treated similarly to MCF-7 cells. D) Degradation of chondroitin sulfate did not increase the formation of ErbB4 80 kDa fragment in T47D cells. E) Heat inactivated incubation medium from heparitinase treatment of T47D cells had only small effect on ErbB4 80 kDa fragment formation. The intensity of the ErbB4 80 kDa fragment staining as indicated in C and D was quantified with ImageJ software vs. 1.38 (NIH, USA). Beta-actin was used as load control (not shown).

If degradation of HS leads to elevated TACE-like activity, it should be possible to inhibit it with exogeneous heparin or HS. Indeed, the enhanced formation of ErbB4 80 kDa fragment by heparitinase could be inhibited with the presence of 1 &#x003bc;g/ml heparin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> shows that, exogenous heparin had no effect on ErbB4 80 kDa fragment formation in untreated MCF-7 cells. The capability of heparin and HS to inhibit TACE activity was further demonstrated by using recombinant TACE and a TACE-specific peptide substrate as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>. Further, we evaluated heparin dependent inhibition of TACE activity on living cells. TACE substrate peptide cleavage was accelerated when MCF-7 cells were treated with heparitinase prior addition of substrate peptide (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). Moreover, the effect of heparitinase could be largely reverted by addition of TACE inhibitor TAPI-0 to the enzyme assay buffer.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Exogeneous heparin or HS inhibit heparitinase-induced ErbB4 80 kDa fragment formation</bold>.

Further, the co-immunoprecipitation of syndecan-4 could be abolished by heparitinase treatment of the cells prior lysis. Confocal microscopy revealed that in untreated cells TACE is mostly located at the cell surface and the Golgi compartment. Also, syndecan-4 is mostly present at cell surface, and the cell surface immunoreactivity is located at the same structures as TACE-HA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>).

HS may hinder TACE-mediated ErbB4 cleavage by forming steric barriers between the enzyme and its substrate cleavage site or directly inhibiting TACE activity with interactions between the enzyme and HS side chains. As soluble heparin and HS inhibited cleavage of fluorescent substrate peptide by recombinant TACE enzyme, the presence of the latter mechanism is suggested. This is further supported by the fact that exogenous heparin and HS hindered the HS degradation induced ErbB4 cleavage.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this communication removal of cell surface HS was shown to increase TACE activity and TACE-dependent formation of ErbB4 80 kDa intracellular domain. The high HS degrading activity reportedly present in tumor tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] thus probably favors TACE-activity which may lead to elevated processing of ErbB4 and promotion of cell survival.
