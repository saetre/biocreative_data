Recently the transient receptor potential (TRP) channels TRPM8 and TRPA1 have been identified and proposed to be molecular sensors for cold. Here we have investigated the expression of TRPM8 and TRPA1 mRNA in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and examined the cold sensitivity of peripheral sensory neurons in the chronic construction injury (CCI) model of neuropathic pain in mice.</p><p>In behavioral experiments, chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve induced a hypersensitivity to both cold and the TRPM8 agonist menthol that developed 2 days post injury and remained stable for at least 2 weeks. Using quantitative RT-PCR and in situ hybridization we examined the expression of TRPM8 and TRPA1 in DRG. Both channels displayed significantly reduced expression levels after injury with no change in their distribution pattern in identified neuronal subpopulations. Furthermore, in calcium imaging experiments, we detected no alterations in the number of cold or menthol responsive neurons in the DRG, or in the functional properties of cold transduction following injury. Intriguingly however, responses to the TRPA1 agonist mustard oil were strongly reduced.</p><p>Our results indicate that injured sensory neurons do not develop abnormal cold sensitivity after chronic constriction injury and that alterations in the expression of TRPM8 and TRPA1 are unlikely to contribute directly to the pathogenesis of cold allodynia in this neuropathic pain model.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neuropathic pain is a debilitating condition that is poorly understood and often untreatable. It is initiated by damage to the nervous system and is characterized by the emergence of spontaneous pain (i.e. pain that occurs in the absence of stimulation), hyperalgesia (an increased sensitivity to noxious stimuli), and allodynia (pain evoked by normally innocuous stimuli) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007383-Woolf1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. A common complaint of neuropathic pain patients is an increased sensitivity to cold temperatures, or cold allodynia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007383-Jensen1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007383-Lindblom1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. This symptom, which is also observed in animal models of neuropathic pain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007383-Zimmermann1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, leads to pain and discomfort at temperatures that are normally perceived as being innocuously cool. Despite the importance and prevalence of cold allodynia, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms.</p><p>Recently, much progress has been made in our understanding of cutaneous thermosensation and of the thermal transduction mechanisms intrinsic to peripheral sensory neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007383-Caterina1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Several candidate thermosensor molecules have been identified belonging to the Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) ion channel family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007383-Dhaka1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Two of these ion channels, termed TRPM8 and TRPA1, have been proposed to function as cold transducers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007383-Reid1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007383-McKemy1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. TRPM8 is expressed by a small population of cold-sensitive sensory neurons and is activated at cool temperatures (&#x0223c;26&#x000b0;C) and by the cooling compound menthol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007383-McKemy2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007383-Peier1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Mouse knockout studies have revealed that TRPM8 is required for cold sensation over a broad range of innocuous and noxious cold temperatures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007383-Bautista1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007383-Dhaka2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. TRPA1 is also expressed by sensory neurons and was initially described as a noxious cold sensor with an activation temperature of 17&#x000b0;C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007383-Story1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

An increased expression of these channels or an alteration in their functional properties could lead to the lower thresholds for cold pain and increased sensitivity to cold seen in neuropathic pain states. We therefore examined the expression and function of TRPM8 and TRPA1 in DRG neurons in a mouse model of neuropathic pain. We demonstrate that the TRPM8 agonist menthol evokes nociceptive behavior after nerve injury, and that TRPM8 is a potential transducer molecule for cold-mediated allodynia. However, we find no evidence of increased expression of TRPM8 and TRPA1, or of changes in the cold sensitivity of sensory neurons after injury.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Behavioral responses to cold and menthol</title><p>We used a chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve to model neuropathic pain.

We therefore investigated whether TRPM8 activation might be important for cold allodynia. We reasoned that if TRPM8 is a receptor for cold-evoked allodynia after injury, then activation of the ion channel with its agonist menthol should also evoke nociceptive behavior.</p><p>We applied 40 &#x000b5;l of (-)-menthol or vehicle to the ipsilateral paw of CCI or control mice and monitored behavioral responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007383-g001">Fig. 1b</xref>). Vehicle application did not evoke nociceptive behavior in CCI or control mice. Application of (-)-menthol in control mice led to a small increase in licking duration compared to vehicle, but this was not statistically significant (P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.0956, two-way repeated measure ANOVA). However, application of (-)-menthol in CCI mice led to a significant increase in licking duration (P&#x0003c;0.001 compared to (-)-menthol control mice, two-way repeated measure ANOVA) that became apparent 2 days after injury and peaked 7 days after injury, paralleling the development of cold allodynia in the acetone test. In addition to licking of the treated paw, CCI mice also displayed behaviors such as flinching of the paw and brushing of the affected area that also developed with a similar time course to cold-evoked behavior. This suggests that activation of TRPM8 after nerve injury, either by (-)-menthol or cold, can evoke nociceptive behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>TRPM8 and TRPA1 expression levels after nerve injury</title><p>Injury-induced alterations in the number of cold transduction molecules in sensory neurons could underlie the development of cold allodynia. We therefore examined gross expression levels of TRPM8 and TRPA1 mRNA in DRG of injured neurons using qRT-PCR. We detected a relatively low level of mRNA for TRPM8 and TRPA1 in the DRG of control mice (TRPM8, 106400 copies/&#x000b5;g total RNA, TRPA1, 280900 copies/&#x000b5;g RNA) which correlates well with the selective expression of these channels within small subpopulations of neurons. After injury, the expression level of the channels was slightly decreased, reaching statistical significance on day 14 for TRPM8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007383-g002">Fig. 2a</xref>) and on day 7 and 14 for TRPA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007383-g002">Fig. 2b</xref>). We investigated the relevance of these small reductions by comparing them to the expression of the neuropeptide galanin as a positive control. Galanin has been shown to be strongly up-regulated after nerve injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007383-Nahin1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> and indeed in our experiments we measured a considerable increase in galanin mRNA levels at 7 and 14 days post CCI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007383-g002">Fig. 2c</xref>).

This indicates that activation of TRPM8 in CCI mice triggers nociceptive behavior and that TRPM8 might be a key component of cold hypersensitivity. In agreement, Colburn et al. (2007) reported that TRPM8 knockout mice display reduced acetone responses after nerve injury, suggesting that in neuropathic pain states TRPM8 acts as the predominant sensor for cool-evoked pain.</p><p>Menthol is also known to have analgesic actions in a number of painful conditions.

We applied cold stimuli as low as 8&#x000b0;C (well below the proposed temperature threshold for TRPA1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007383-Story1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007383-Sawada1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>) but were unable to activate the majority of mustard oil sensitive neurons (over 80&#x00025;). It is possible that the duration of our cold stimulus (30 seconds) was not sufficient to activate TRPA1 since it has been reported that prolonged cooling is required to evoke a response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007383-Karashima1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. We recently reported that TRPA1 is activated by intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and that cold sensitivity occurs indirectly through an increased Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration in HEK293 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007383-Zurborg1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. However, cold does not evoke a general increase in Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration in sensory neurons (as occurs in HEK293 cells), thus even an indirect role for TRPA1 in acute cold sensation seems unlikely. Consequently, we did not examine behavioral responses to mustard oil in CCI mice and we continued our functional analysis by designating cold responsive neurons as either menthol-sensitive, or menthol-insensitive as has been reported in previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007383-Nealen1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007383-Thut1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Intriguingly, we found that the number of mustard oil responsive cells was strongly reduced after CCI but not changed following CFA injection. It is difficult to gauge the functional significance of TRPA1 down-regulation and its contribution to the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain. However, voltage-gated Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> currents are also diminished after nerve injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007383-Hogan1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref> and this has been proposed to lead to increased excitability in injured sensory neurons via reduced activation of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> activated K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> currents. Since TRPA1 is gated by, and is permeable to Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007383-Zurborg1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, it is possible that reduced expression of the channel might also contribute to diminished Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> currents and enhanced excitability after injury. We also measured the amplitude of responses to mustard oil in neuropathic and inflammatory pain models. In CCI animals there was no alteration, however CFA injection resulted in an increased amplitude. Again this could reflect a change in basal intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration in TRPA1 positive neurons during inflammatory pain. An increased level of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> via activation of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> signaling pathways by inflammatory mediators would serve to increase the sensitivity of TRPA1 to its agonists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007383-Zurborg1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>A surprising aspect of our results is that we observed no differences in any parameters of cold sensitivity post-injury. This is in contrast to some studies examining cold sensitivity in the SNL and CCI models or neuropathic pain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007383-Xing1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007383-Djouhri1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007383-Ji1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Using the SNL model, it was reported that while cold responses remained constant in injured neurons, a proportion of uninjured neurons of the L4 DRG developed sensitivity to cold after injury. Similarly, in the CCI model a small population of capsaicin-sensitive neurons developed cold sensitivity after injury. These novel populations of cold sensing neurons could potentially contribute to cold allodynia, however our data suggests that this is unlikely to be a universal mechanism for cold hypersensitivity. In support of this, using an experimental neuroma model in mice, Roza et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007383-Roza1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref> demonstrated that cold sensitivity of axotomized fibers does not change from pre-injury levels.</p><p>Our data indicate that an alteration in the number of cold sensitive DRG neurons is not a mechanism for cold allodynia in the CCI model of neuropathic pain. However, it does not exclude the possibility that changes in cold sensitivity might occur in the peripheral terminals of sensory neurons. For example, it is possible that CCI alters the transport of cold sensitive channels to the periphery leaving a deficit of mRNA at the level of the DRG. Similarly, alterations in cellular context could shape the response of cold sensitive neurons at their peripheral terminals. Recently Madrid et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007383-Madrid1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref> demonstrated a correlation between expression level of I<sub>KD</sub> (a current dependent upon Shaker-like Kv1 channels) and threshold of activation by cold. Blocking I<sub>KD</sub> shifted the activation threshold of noxious cold activated neurons to higher temperatures and it was argued that a similar mechanism could account for cold allodynia.</p><p>In the absence of a peripheral mechanism for cold allodynia, a modification of central processing of cold stimuli after nerve injury could underlie the emergence of cold hypersensitivity. In a recent fMRI study of healthy human volunteers, it was reported that cold allodynia induced by 40&#x00025; menthol, recruited the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the midbrain to cold pain processing, regions not normally associated with cold sensation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007383-Seifert1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Changes at the spinal cord level could also trigger cold allodynia and several spinal mechanisms such as structural reorganization, central sensitization of dorsal horn neurons, and disinhibition of nociceptive circuitry have been postulated to contribute to neuropathic pain states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007383-Woolf1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, a number of human studies have shown that cold pain sensation is under tonic inhibitory control. Thus blockade of myelinated fiber conduction during cooling has been demonstrated to abolish innocuous cold sensation and induce burning and stinging pain rather than coolness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007383-Yarnitsky1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, fibers transmitting innocuous cold might also exert inhibition, a hypothesis that is supported by the observation that some neuropathic pain patients are unable to perceive cold but report burning pain on cold exposure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007383-Ochoa1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. Intriguingly, the central terminals of TRPM8 expressing neurons have been demonstrated to overlap with glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) in lamina I of the spinal cord <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007383-Dhaka3">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. GAD65 synthesizes the inhibitory enzyme GABA, suggesting that TRPM8 positive cold sensory neurons could form contacts with inhibitory dorsal horn neurons. From our results we are unable to identify the central mechanism of cold hypersensitivity, however it is interesting that we observed decreases in TRPM8 expression. If this were to occur selectively in cool sensing neurons involved in the suppression of cold pain, it could lead to an unmasking of cold nociceptive pathways. A shift in the balance of inhibitory to excitatory input would allow TRPM8 activation, either by menthol or cold, to evoke pain.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Surgical procedures</title><p>All experiments were conducted on C57/B6 mice or Wistar rats with the approval of the state animal care and use committee (Landesamt f&#x000fc;r Arbeitsschutz, Gesundheit und Technische Sicherheit Berlin).

Cells were plated in a droplet of medium on poly-L-lysine (100 &#x000b5;g/ml, Sigma, Germany) coated coverslips and left to adhere for 30 minutes before the coverslip was flooded. Experiments were conducted 1&#x02013;3 hours after plating of cells.</p><p>Ratiometric calcium imaging was performed with FURA-2/AM dye (Invitrogen, Germany) and analyzed using Tillvision software (Till Photonics, Germany).

Pairs of images were collected every 2 seconds at alternating exposures of 340 nM and 380 nM (exposure time 70 ms) using a Polychrome V monochromator and CCD Imago camera (Till Photonics, Germany). Following subtraction of background fluorescence the ratio of fluorescence at 340 nm and 380 nm was calculated.</p><p>Coverslips were superfused with CIB buffer at approximately 2 ml/min. Drugs were applied via a gravity driven perfusion system that allowed rapid exchange of solutions. Cold stimuli were applied using a peltier device (ESF electronic, Germany) and temperature changes were monitored with a thermocouple placed within the flow of buffer and close to the cells.</p><p>Following selection of a suitable field of view, coverslips were maintained at 31&#x000b0;C for 5 minutes. A cold stimulus was then applied which cooled the cells from 31&#x000b0;C until an endpoint of 8&#x000b0;C had been reached. Cooling occurred at approximately 1&#x000b0;C per second and was reproducible such that in more than 95&#x00025; of experiments the cold endpoint was reached within 30 seconds. After a recovery period of 5 minutes at 31&#x000b0;C, either (-)-menthol (100 &#x000b5;M unless indicated), or in separate experiments, mustard oil (50 &#x000b5;M based on dose response date (not shown)) was applied for 1 minute.

The number of responders to cold, (-)-menthol or mustard oil was expressed as a percentage of KCl responsive cells. The maximum amplitude of the response, the temperature threshold of cold responses and the cell diameter were also determined. Cold threshold temperatures were calculated as the temperature at which fluorescence ratio increased by 0.5&#x00025; upon cooling. These relatively stringent selection criteria for cold responsive cells plus the fact that we started our recordings at 31&#x000b0;C (rather than 35&#x02013;37&#x000b0;C used by some researchers) may account for the low temperature thresholds we observed.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using Sigmastat software (Systat, San Jose, CA).
