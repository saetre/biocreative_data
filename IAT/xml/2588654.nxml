We studied whether CXCR4-MIF associations occur in rat bladder and the effect of experimental cystitis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>Twenty male rats received saline or cyclophosphamide (40 mg/kg; i.p.; every 3<sup>rd</sup> day) to induce persistent cystitis. After eight days, urine was collected and bladders excised under anesthesia. Bladder CXCR4 and CXCR4-MIF co-localization were examined with immunhistochemistry. ELISA determined MIF and stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1; cognate ligand for CXCR4) levels. Bladder CXCR4 expression (real-time RTC-PCR) and protein levels (Western blotting) were examined. Co-immunoprecipitations studied MIF-CXCR4 associations.Urothelial basal and intermediate (but not superficial) cells in saline-treated rats contained CXCR4, co-localized with MIF. Cyclophosphamide treatment caused: 1) significant redistribution of CXCR4 immunostaining to all urothelial layers (especially apical surface of superficial cells) and increased bladder CXCR4 expression; 2) increased urine MIF with decreased bladder MIF; 3) increased bladder SDF-1; 4) increased CXCR4-MIF associations.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These data demonstrate CXCR4-MIF associations occur in vivo in rat bladder and increase in experimental cystitis. Thus, CXCR4 represents an alternative pathway for MIF-mediated signal transduction during bladder inflammation. In the bladder, MIF may compete with SDF-1 (cognate ligand) to activate signal transduction mediated by CXCR4.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is an ubiquitous pleiotropic cytokine involved in cell proliferation and inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Bucala1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Flaster1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. MIF plays an important and unique role in inflammation since MIF stands upstream of other pro-inflammatory mediators and it can counter-regulate the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Flaster1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus, based on our experimental observations, our hypothesis of a pro-inflammatory role for MIF during bladder inflammation agrees well with MIF's pro-inflammatory role in several disease models (e.g. arthritis, Crohn's disease) where treatment with neutralizing MIF antibodies results in decreased inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Ohkawara1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Mikulowska1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The mechanism for MIF's action is not completely defined and remains an active area of investigation. MIF may exert autocrine effects through binding to intracellular JAB1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Lue1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> and also paracrine effects by binding to cell-surface receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Leng1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Until recently, complex formation between MIF and cell-surface CD74 was the only described mechanism for MIF-receptor interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Leng2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> . CD74 is part of the major histocompatibility class-II (MHC-II) complex; however, a small amount of CD74 can be found on the cell-surface not associated with MHC-II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Starlets1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. MIF binds to cell-surface CD74 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Leng2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> and the MIF-CD74 complex then activates signal transduction by binding to another cell-surface receptor, CD44 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Leng1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. We showed that MIF, CD44 and CD74 are all upregulated in the urothelium after experimental inflammation in rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Vera2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-MeyerSiegler5">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, all of the components are in place during bladder inflammation for MIF-activated signal transduction to occur.</p><p>Recently, however, a novel functional association between MIF and chemokine receptors CXCR2 and CXCR4 was described in T cells in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Bernhagen1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Chemokines are small proteins that direct leukocyte traffic to sites of inflammation or injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Charo1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. CXCR4 is a G-protein coupled receptor for stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1/CXCL12). Although chemokines typically display a high degree of receptor promiscuity, CXCR4 was (until recently) thought to bind only to SDF-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Charo1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. MIF, however, competed with the recognized ligand for CXCR4 (SDF-1/CXCL12) for binding to CXCR4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Bernhagen1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>CXCR4 is expressed by normal urothelium and may be associated with bladder cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Eisenhardt1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Murdoch1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, we hypothesized that CXCR4-MIF complex formation may also occur in the bladder (as described occurring in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Bernhagen1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>). Such associations, if present, would indicate another possible receptor target for MIF during cystitis, aside from the already described MIF-CD74 association <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Leng2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The object of the present study was to determine if there was an association between MIF and CXCR4 receptors in the bladder. Therefore, we examined: 1) location of cytokine receptor CXCR4 in the rat bladder; 2) baseline bladder levels of SDF-1 (cognate ligand for CXCR4) and changes in response to a chemically-induced (cyclophosphamide; CYP) model of bladder inflammation; 3) CXCR4 expression changes after CYP-induced cystitis and 4) association between CXCR4 and MIF in the bladder before and after CYP-induced cystitis.</p><p>Our results show that both CXCR4 and SDF-1 are constitutively expressed in normal rat bladder and upregulated during CYP-induced cystitis. Using dual immunohistochemistry we show that MIF and CXCR4 are colocalized within the same cells in the urothelium and co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrate MIF-CXCR4 associations in the bladder. These MIF-CXCR4 associations are increased during CYP-induced cystitis.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cyclophosphamide-induced bladder inflammation</title><p>Repeated measures ANOVA showed differences between saline- and CYP-treated rats in body weight, with significant decreases observed in CYP-treated rats as early as day 3 and continuing throughout the experiment (day 8; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003898-t001">Table 1</xref>) but remaining below a 10&#x00025; weight-loss threshold established as a protocol endpoint.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0003898-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003898.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Effect of cyclophosphamide on body weight (g)</title></caption><graphic id="pone-0003898-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0003898.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" alternate-form-of="pone-0003898-t001-1"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Treatment</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Day 0</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Day 3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Day 6</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Day 8</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Saline (N&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;10)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">321&#x000b1;2.6 g</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">322&#x000b1;2.8</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">326&#x000b1;3.5</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">326&#x000b1;3.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CYP (N&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;10)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">320&#x000b1;3.6</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">303&#x000b1;2.5<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt102">&#x0002a;&#x0002a;&#x0002a;</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">300&#x000b1;3.0<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt102">&#x0002a;&#x0002a;&#x0002a;</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">295&#x000b1;3.0<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt102">&#x0002a;&#x0002a;&#x0002a;</xref></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><label/><p>Mean&#x000b1;S.E.M.

CYP treatment (aside from producing bladder inflammation and urothelial hyperplasia, well-described effects of cyclophosphamide in the bladder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Koss1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Philips1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>) also resulted in up-regulation of bladder CXCR4 mRNA and redistribution of CXCR4 to the entire urothelial area (including apical area of superficial cells previously devoid of CXCR4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003898-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). Our findings of apical CXCR4 staining in superficial urothelial cells are in agreement with observations in colonic epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Dwinell1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>CYP treatment although producing CXCR4 mRNA upregulation (a novel finding) did not result in increased CXCR4 protein levels, and scoring of CXCR4 immunostaining actually showed a decrease in staining intensity following CYP treatment. A similar discrepancy between CXCR4 mRNA expression and protein levels has been reported in the rat neurons and shown to reflect activation, increased internalization and degradation of CXCR4 receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Kolodziej1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> . Such activation, internalization and degradation of CXCR4 receptors may also account for the patchy CXCR4 immunostaining in the urothelium (especially with immunostaining in the apical surface of superficial cells) and may represent focal areas of CYP-induced CXCR4 response.</p><p>CXCR4 mRNA expression in normal human urothelium, bladder cancer and also bladder cancer cell lines (J82 and T24) was previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Eisenhardt1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> . Addition of SDF-1 (presumably activating CXCR4 receptors) increased Matrigel invasion and cell growth but was not effective in increasing intracellular calcium in these particular urothelial cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Eisenhardt1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. However, other investigators using a different bladder cell line (RT-4) did report an increase in intracellular calcium upon stimulation with SDF-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Murdoch1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Taken together these results suggest that CXCR4 receptors are functional in the urothelium. There is also evidence of CXCR4 mRNA expression in other areas of the human urogenital system (e.g. urethra, cervix) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-McClure1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We examined protein levels of SDF-1 in the bladders of both saline-treated and CYP-treated rats using ELISA. We report constitutive levels of SDF-1 in saline-treated bladders which increase after CYP treatment. Although SDF-1 immunofluorescence was readily detectable in skin keratinocytes, we were unsuccessful in detecting SDF-1 by immunohistochemistry in the bladder (or the spleen). Since the levels of SDF-1 in the skin (measured by ELISA) are approximately twice the levels found in bladder or spleen, we consider it likely that the levels in these organs were below the detection level for immunohistochemistry.</p><p>Recently, down-regulation of SDF-1 mRNA expression in the bladder (and other pelvic viscera) was reported afer vaginal distension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Woo1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. To our knowledge, our findings represent the first demonstration of SDF-1 protein levels in the bladder. Thus our findings indicate that bladder injury produced by CYP-treatment results in mRNA upregulation of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 and increased protein levels of its cognate ligand, SDF-1. In addition to several cytokines reported upregulated in the bladder after CYP treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Malley1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, changes in another chemokine (CX3CL1) and its receptor (CXC3R1) were described as a result of cyclophosphamide treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Yuridullah1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, chemokines (in addition to cytokines) likely represent important mediators of bladder injury and possible targets for ameliorating bladder inflammation.</p><p>Until recently, CXCR4 was considered to bind exclusively to SDF-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Charo1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. However, recent in vitro evidence showed that CXCR4 is also capable of binding MIF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Bernhagen1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study we confirm these in vitro finding since we demonstrate 1) co-localization of CXCR4 and MIF in the urothelium, both in saline treated rats and after CYP treatment; 2) CXCR4-MIF associations are present in saline-treated bladder and increase after CYP treatment. Therefore, although, not directly tested in this study, our results suggest that MIF in the bladder may participate in bladder inflammation either through binding to CXCR4 in the urothelium (formerly thought to only bind SDF-1 but recently shown to also bind MIF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Bernhagen1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>) or to CD74 (recognized binding protein for MIF which is upregulated in bladder inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Vera2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>) to activate signal transduction pathways that result in the production of other inflammatory cytokines. Given that bladder MIF concentrations are approximately 30-fold greater than bladder SDF-1 concentrations, it is possible that MIF may be the primary ligand at the CXCR4 receptor in the urothelium. Moreover, CYP-treatment induced immunostaining of CXCR4 in superficial urothelial cells previously devoid of CXCR4 (or MIF) immunostaining. This raises the possibility that these cells will be activated by MIF present in the urine and in fact, CYP (present study) and other inflammatory stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Vera3">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-MeyerSiegler4">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> increase luminal MIF release. We cannot rule out a contribution of renal or ureteral MIF release to increased urine MIF levels observed in this study after CYP-treatment, Yet our current findings of increased urine MIF with concomitant decrease in bladder MIF protein levels are consistent with earlier findings where, in animals with bladders isolated from the kidneys (thus removing potential renal and ureteral contributions), we observed similar results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-MeyerSiegler2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-MeyerSiegler3">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>). Thus, based on our experimental evidence we consider likely that MIF is released into the lumen from pre-formed stores in the bladder during inflammation. Therefore, luminal MIF may contribute to bladder inflammation through binding to at least these two urothelial cell-surface receptors and suggests that blocking MIF or cell-surface receptors associated with MIF may prevent or ameliorate bladder inflammation.</p><p>The exact role of CXCR4 and MIF-CXCR4 associations in the bladder was not addressed in the present study and remains to be investigated. However, recent evidence from other models suggests, at least, two interesting and important possibilities for the involvement of CXCR4 in bladder inflammation and repair from injury. First, CXCR4 may be mediating urothelial cell proliferation and repair. CXCR4 and SDF-1 are also expressed in human intestinal epithelial cells where recent evidence indicates it participates in epithelial repair following injury and maintaining mucosal barrier integrity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Moyer1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Smith1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. In this model then, chemokines and chemokine receptors (and particularly CXCR4/SDF-1) may represent an autocrine/paracrine loop that helps maintain mucosal barrier integrity and repair as well as regulating mucosal pathogenesis (including chronic inflammation as seen inflammatory bowel disease and progression to colon cancer) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Zimmerman1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> . The results from the present study indicate that MIF, by associating with CXCR4 receptors in the bladder (presumably urothelial in origin), may be competing with SDF-1 at CXCR4 receptors to participate in epithelial repair following injury. Second, CXCR4 activation may mediate pain hypersensitivity in the bladder. Recent evidence has clearly shown expression of CXCR4 (and other chemokine receptors) on dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Oh1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, activation of these receptors produced excitatory effects on DRG neurons and stimulated release of Substance P <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Oh1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Also, CXCR4 (and other chemokine receptors and chemokines) expression was reported in DRG neurons following a rodent model of persistent neuropathy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Bhangoo1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Bhangoo2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. These receptors were functional since intracellular calcium was increased following administration of SDF-1 in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Bhangoo1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, based on their findings, these authors suggest that chemokines and chemokines receptors may be important targets in the treatment of chronic pain. In CYP-induced cystitis, then, activation of CXCR4 receptors, either by its recognized ligand SDF-1 (upregulated as a result of CYP) or due to interaction with MIF (also upregulated as a result of CYP and present in greater quantities than SDF-1) may in fact be contributing to pain hypersensitivity. A similar suggestion has already been made for another chemokine, CX3CL1, and its receptor during CYP-induced cystitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003898-Yuridullah1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results contribute to such a hypothesis and expand it to a different chemokine/receptor system.</p><p>In summary, the chemokine receptor CXCR4 is constitutively expressed in rat urothelium (in basal and intermediate cells) while CYP-induced bladder inflammation resulted in upregulation of CXCR4 and immunostaining of superficial cells (previously devoid of CXCR4). Its cognate chemokine ligand, SDF-1 is also upregulated by CYP-treatment. CXCR4 and MIF are co-localized in cells in the urothelium and CYP induced co-localization of CXCR4 and MIF to superficial cells of the urothelium. Immunoprecipitation demonstrated an association between CXCR4 and MIF in the bladder. Therefore, our results suggest that CXCR4, as a receptor for MIF in urothelial cells, may contribute to MIF-mediated bladder inflammation. Examining the differences between MIF activation of CXCR4 receptors versus MIF activation of CD74 receptors then might provide insights into the actual mechanism for MIF-mediated effects in the bladder and possibly other sites.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><p>All experiments were conducted after obtaining full institutional animal care and use committee approval and conformed to NIH Guide for animal experimentation.
