In man a number of such gene products have been identified, including DDB (or XPE), a heterodimeric protein composed of 127 and 48 kDa subunits, which has been shown to be essential for DNA excision repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf490c1">1</xref>). DDB reportedly recognizes many types of DNA lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf490c2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf490c7">7</xref>) and is inducible by treatment with DNA-damaging agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf490c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf490c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf490c9">9</xref>). However, DDB was found not to be required in nucleotide excision repair (NER) reconstitution studies <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf490c10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf490c12">12</xref>). The xeroderma pigmentosum group E (XPE) gene product, homologous to DDB, is involved in NER, and the damaged DNA-binding activity of DDB is absent from cells of a subset of XPE patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf490c13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf490c16">16</xref>). Recently, functions of DDB other than directly in DNA repair have been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf490c17">17</xref>). DNA repair is complex, with multiple overlapping and intersecting pathways with contributions of replication, transcription, meiotic recombination and gene silencing. A large fraction of mutations isolated on the basis of meiotic recombination defects or embryo developmental anomalies are conferred by and predispose to mutagen hypersensitivity.</p><p>To generate a deeper comprehension of the nature of DDB, we have chosen <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> as a suitable model animal. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> many genes associated with DNA metabolism and morphogenesis are well characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf490c18">18</xref>) and mutants can be easily prepared. This factor, coupled with a refined system for genetic analysis, provides a valuable research resource.</p><p>In this report, we document characterization of <italic>Drosophila</italic> DDB1, the larger subunit of DDB, and details of its relation to repair, cell proliferation and development, including spermatogenesis. Interestingly, the gene was found to be controlled by the DRE&#x0002f;DREF system, which is responsible for activating the promoters of nucleus encoded genes for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), the 180 and 73 kDa subunits of DNA polymerase &#x003b1; and cyclin A, among others. Our results provide evidence that <italic>Drosophila</italic> DDB1 acts as a cell proliferation- or development-associated factor as well as a repair factor.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Separation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> UV-damaged site-binding proteins</title><p>Aliquots of 10 g of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Kc cells were homogenized in 4 vol of buffer containing 10 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, pH 8, 1 mM EDTA and 5 mM dithiothreitol, and then 40 ml of ice-cold buffer (containing 50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, pH 8, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 25&#x00025; sucrose and 50&#x00025; glycerol) and thereafter neutralized, saturated ammonium sulfate solution (10 ml) was added slowly to the homogenized suspension. After gentle stirring for another 30 min on ice, the homogenate was centrifuged at 50 000 r.p.m. (optima L-70k/70Ti, Beckman) for 3 h at 4&#x000b0;C. The supernatant was dialyzed against the same buffer (TNMD) as that used for UV cross-linking analysis (containing 20 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol and three protein inhibitors, 1 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml pepstatin A, 1 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml leupeptin and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride).

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf490c20">20</xref>) (lanes 8&#x02013;11), and the 30 kDa protein eluted at 1 M NaCl might be a UV-damage-specific endonuclease 1 (D-DDB P1), as we reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf490c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf490c27">27</xref>) (lane 13). Here, we have concentrated our attention on the 126 kDa protein fraction eluted at 2 M NaCl, because it demonstrated the highest affinity for UV-damaged DNA in <italic>D.melanogaster</italic>. The 126 kDa protein in fractions 37&#x02013;46 of the column was collected, purified by SDS&#x02013;PAGE and used to raise rabbit antiserum against the polypeptide. The antiserum recognized multiple polypeptides, including the 126 kDa protein, in Kc cell extracts.</p><p>Expression screening of a Kc cell cDNA library using the antiserum resulted in isolation of six clones containing partial DNA sequences with high homology to human DDB1 (p127) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf490c28">28</xref>). We then carried out a detailed analysis of the 126 kDa protein homologous to human DDB1, provisionally designated <italic>Drosophila</italic> damage-specific DNA-binding protein 1 (D-DDB1). The nucleotide sequence data have been lodged in the DDBJ&#x0002f;EMBL&#x0002f;GenBank nucleotide sequence databases with accession no. AF132145. The cDNA of <italic>d-ddb1</italic>, obtained by RT&#x02013;PCR using specific primers, was characterized as follows. The open reading frame predicted a protein of 1140 amino acid residues, with a molecular weight of 126 038. Overall similarity of the sequence to the human and rat DDB1 sequences was 49.8 and 49.4&#x00025;, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf490c28">28</xref>). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f1">1</xref>B shows a western blot of the gel pattern of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f1">1</xref>A using the anti-DDB1 antibody generated against D-DDB1 recombinant fragment (see left panel). The 126 kDa protein indicated to be D-DDB1, and the molecular mass was 126 kDa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f1">1</xref>B, lane 1). Fraction 37 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f1">1</xref>A was tested by SDS&#x02013;PAGE and confirmed to have another small subunit of &#x0223c;50 kDa (<italic>Drosophila</italic> DDB2) (data not shown). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f1">1</xref>C shows the results of a native gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay using fraction 37 (containing D-DDB1) in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f1">1</xref>A. After UV-irradiation, shifted protein bands occurred in the native gel (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f1">1</xref>C, lane 8). When <sup>32</sup>P-labeled unirradiated TC31 was used, the shifted protein bands did not occur (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f1">1</xref>C, lanes 1&#x02013;6).

Since &#x0003e;90&#x00025; of (6&#x02013;4) photoproducts in UV-damaged nuclear DNA could be repaired within 3 h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf490c30">30</xref>), and since DDB binds to (6&#x02013;4) photoproducts, we checked the amount of mRNA every hour after UV-irradiation at 70 J&#x0002f;m<sup>2</sup>. The amount of mRNA increased after UV-irradiation, reached a maximum within 4 h, and then gradually reduced, indicating the transcripts to be UV-inducible (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f2">2</xref>A). Transcripts of <italic>d-ddb1</italic> were also induced by 0.1&#x00025; MMS treatment, although they reached a maximum more quickly (2 h) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f2">2</xref>B).</p><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f3">3</xref> illustrates the effects of UV-irradiation on Kc cells in which the <italic>d-ddb1</italic> gene was knocked out by the RNAi method using 600 bp dsRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f3">3</xref>A). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f3">3</xref>B, the transcripts of <italic>d-ddb1</italic> were significantly reduced by the RNAi treatment at 2.5 and 5.0 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml compared with same amount of <italic>rp49</italic> transcript. The signals between <italic>d-ddb1</italic> and <italic>rp49</italic> are non-specific bands, because the subjacent band was only detected in Kc cells (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f5">5</xref>, lane 14). In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f3">3</xref>C, data for viability of cells every 6 h after UV-irradiation at 70 J&#x0002f;m<sup>2</sup> are presented.

To investigate its relationship to <italic>Drosophila</italic> development, northern hybridization experiments were performed using the <italic>d-ddb1</italic> cDNA as a probe and total RNA extracted from <italic>Drosophila</italic> at various developmental stages: unfertilized eggs, 0&#x02013;2, 2&#x02013;4, 4&#x02013;8, 8&#x02013;12, 12&#x02013;16 and 16&#x02013;20 h embryos, first, second and third instar larvae, pupae, adult males and females, and Kc cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f5">5</xref>). A single hybridization band of &#x0223c;4 kb was detected throughout all stages, the size corresponding to that of the full-length cDNA. The amount of <italic>d-ddb1</italic> mRNA changed considerably during development. Although UV-irradiation was not performed, the highest level of mRNA was detected in unfertilized eggs, then early embryonic stages from 0 to 8 h, adults and Kc cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f5">5</xref>). Low levels were also detected in the 8&#x02013;20 h embryos, larvae and pupae (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f5">5</xref>). The expres sion pattern was similar to those for the genes for DNA polymerases &#x003b1; and &#x003b5; and PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf490c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf490c32">32</xref>).</p><p>Since this suggested a link with cell proliferation, we searched for transcription factor-binding sequences in the <italic>d-ddb1</italic> gene and, interestingly, found a DRE site (5&#x02032;-TATCGATA) and a DRE-like site (5&#x02032;-AATCGATT, which matched 6 of the 8 bp DRE consensus sequence) in the upper cascade, respectively located at positions &#x02013;218 and &#x02013;264 with respect to the transcription initiation site of the <italic>d-ddb1</italic> gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f6">6</xref>A). Therefore, we next tested whether gene expression is regulated by the DRE&#x0002f;DREF system.</p><p>As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f7">7</xref>, the <sup>32</sup>P-labeled DRE-P, DRE-wt or DRE like-wt oligonucleotides shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f6">6</xref>B were incubated with or without Kc cell nuclear extract and several competitor complex bands were detected. The <sup>32</sup>P-labeled DRE-P probe was used as a positive control and when non-labeled DRE-P, DRE-wt and DRE like-wt were added as competitors the complex band was reduced (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f7">7</xref>A, lanes 2, 3 and 6). Similarly, <sup>32</sup>P-labeled DRE-wt or DRE like-wt probes competed with unlabeled DRE-P, DRE-wt and DRE like-wt (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f7">7</xref>A, lanes 10, 13, 16, 18, 19 and 24). A probe mutated in the DRE site did not compete or only very weakly with DRE-wt, DRE like-wt and DRE-P (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f7">7</xref>A, lanes 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15 and 20&#x02013;23). Next, to confirm that the complex band was the DRE&#x0002f;DREF complex, we examined the effects of anti-DREF monoclonal antibodies (Mab-1 and Mab-4) on the binding reaction with Kc cell nuclear extract. Mab-1 inhibited binding of DREF to DRE-P, and Mab-4 supershifted the band with DRE-P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf490c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf490c33">33</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f7">7</xref>B, lanes 1&#x02013;4). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f7">7</xref>B, one of the shifted bands with the DRE-wt and DRE like-wt probes was diminished by addition of Mab-1 (lanes 7 and 10) and was supershifted by Mab-4 (lanes 8 and 11).</p><p>For further confirmation of the stimulatory effects of the two DREF recognition sequences on the promoter, we prepared luciferase expression constructs having the wild-type DRE-wt and DRE like-wt with several mutations in the DRE and DRE-like sequences ligated with the the luciferase gene in a PicaGene basic vector (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f8">8</xref>A). The plasmids carrying these constructs were then transfected into <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells and luciferase expression levels were determined. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f8">8</xref>B, mutation in any of the two DREF-binding sequences caused a reduction in luciferase expression levels. The two DREF-binding sequences appeared to cooperate to provide high promoter activity.</p><p>For further investigation, an antibody against D-DDB1 was used for western blot analysis with extracts from <italic>Drosophila</italic> bodies at various developmental stages. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f9">9</xref>A, the 126 kDa subunit level decreased throughout embryogenesis; D-DDB1 levels were high at early stages when the rate of DNA replication was maximal and decreased as development proceeded (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f9">9</xref>A). Although no or a very slight signal for D-DDB1 protein was detected in extracts from larval, pupal and adult whole bodies, probably due to dilution of D-DDB1 with large amounts of other proteins, a specific signal was detected from the brain lobes and imaginal discs dissected from third instar larvae, testes and ovaries (data not shown). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f9">9</xref>B shows imaginal discs dissected from third instar larvae and immunostained with antibody against D-DDB1. Anti-D-DDB1 antibody stained the cells of imaginal discs (A&#x02013;C). No significant staining signal was observed with normal rabbit IgG as the primary antibody (D&#x02013;F). In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f9">9</xref>C, D-DDB1 protein is evident in ganglion cells in the brain (A, B), flight muscles (C), testis (D) and ovaries (E).</p><p>Pursuing the roles of D-DDB1 in relation to development, testis immunostaining was conducted because transcripts of <italic>d-ddb1</italic> were found to be abundant in adult male flies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f5">5</xref>B, lane 12) and D-DDB1 protein was detected in the testis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f9">9</xref>C). Interestingly, D-DDB1 appeared to be transiently present in meiotic cells during spermatogenesis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f10">10</xref>). We applied double staining with D-DDB1 and RPA30, because there is a report that DDB mediates NER activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf490c34">34</xref>) and because RPA30 is known to be an indispensable factor for replication. Triple labeling (D-DDB1 in green, DNA in blue and RPA30 in red) gave, in merged views: green, D-DDB1; blue, DNA; red, RPA30; yellow, D-DDB1 and RPA30. In young spermatocytes D-DDB1 accumulated in the cytoplasm, although RPA30 was present in the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f10">10</xref>A). In mature primary spermatocytes both D-DDB1 and RPA30 accumulated in the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f10">10</xref>B). At the telophase stage of meioses I and II both D-DDB1 and RPA30 were found in the cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f10">10</xref>C and D). In early spermatids the typical features included a spherical mitochondrial Nebenkern (NK) lacking both D-DDB1 and RPA30 in the NK, but both accumulated in the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f10">10</xref>E). In elongating spermatids D-DDB1 disappeared from the nucleus, although RPA30 was present (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f10">10</xref>F). In fully elongated spermatids neither D-DDB1 nor RPA30 was detected. Since at this stage chromatin condensation becomes tighter due to protamine, D-DDB1 and RPA might be removed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f10">10</xref>G). Thus, during spermatogenesis, D-DDB1 is first located in the cytoplasm, then accumulates in the nucleus of the mature primary spermatocyte, and finally disappears (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f10">10</xref>H). In the nucleus positive stages (6&#x02013;4) photoproducts were not detected using a specific monoclonal antibody.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Damage-specific DNA-binding protein (DDB) has been implicated in numerous aspects of DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf490c10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf490c12">12</xref>). To elucidate precise functions we have focused on DDB in an animal model, using <italic>D.melanogaster</italic>. We thereby succeeded in isolating four UV-irradiated DNA-specific binding proteins from Kc cells and established one of them to be a <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of the p127 subunit of DDB. We then cloned the <italic>d-ddb1</italic> gene. D-DDB1 appeared to be a protein that recognizes UV-damaged DNA <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>It has been reported that CREB-binding protein and p300 histone acetyltransferase can interact with the small subunit of DDB (the DDB2 or p48 subunit) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf490c35">35</xref>), while the human STAGA complex (SPT3&#x02013;TAFII31&#x02013;GCN5L acetylase) interacts with the large subunit of DDB (the DDB1 or p127 subunit) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf490c36">36</xref>). DDB might have functions as a repair protein factor in the context of chromatin structure for recruitment of NER factors to DNA damage sites, because it physically interacts with histone acetyltransferase subunits, believed to be important in altering chromatin structure. Transcription of <italic>ddb2</italic>, but not <italic>ddb1</italic>, is strongly activated by p53 tumor suppressor protein in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf490c1">1</xref>). However, the response of DDB to DNA damage remains to be clarified. We investigated D-DDB1, a homolog of DDB1, and found it to be directly related to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> DNA repair system. This was confirmed in cells knocked out for the <italic>d-ddb1</italic> gene by the RNAi method. To our knowledge there has been no report of <italic>ddb1</italic>-deficient cells, although lack of <italic>ddb2</italic> has been studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf490c17">17</xref>). D-DDB1 was detected in the cytoplasm of Kc cells at interphase, but not in the nucleus, suggesting that D-DDB1 is ordinarily present in the cytoplasm. Interestingly, after UV-irradiation, D-DDB1 is shifted to the nucleus within 12 h. This phenomenon is in line with recruitment of NER factors to DNA damage sites. It has been reported that DDB2 possesses nuclear localization signals and is required for the nuclear accumulation of DDB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf490c37">37</xref>). D-DDB1 was detected in adult brain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f9">9</xref>C). D-DDB1 protein may play an important role in the central nervous system (CNS) and muscles. DDB reportedly recognizes a class of oxygen free radical-induced base lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf490c38">38</xref>). Since O<sub>2</sub> consumption in the CNS and muscles is known to be particularly high as compared with other organs, their data suggested that the amount of D-DDB1 protein in the CNS and muscles of <italic>Drosophila</italic> might correspond to the necessity of NER in the CNS and muscles.</p><p>Northern hybridization of developmental stages here revealed a pattern of expression very similar to those of <italic>Drosophila</italic> enzymes involved in nuclear DNA replication (DNA polymerases &#x003b1; and &#x003b5;, PCNA, etc.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf490c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf490c32">32</xref>). During embryogenesis <italic>d-ddb1</italic> transcript and D-DDB1 protein levels were high in the early stages when rates of DNA replication were maximal and decreased markedly as development proceeded. A clear decrease in <italic>d-ddb1</italic> mRNA in the embryos from 0 to 20 h is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf490f5">5</xref>. This may indicate that the presence of a AUUUA signal within the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region of <italic>d-ddb1</italic> mRNA is associated with rapid mRNA turnover. D-DDB1 protein level also decreases throughout embryogenesis, as does <italic>d-ddb1</italic> mRNA level. This may indicate a short half-life of the D-DDB1 protein. Maternal loading of the <italic>d-ddb1</italic> transcript indicates an importance related to blastogenesis. Reportedly, it has been shown that DDB2 interacts with the activation domain of E2F1 and stimulates E2F1-activated transcription in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf490c29">29</xref>). E2F is a transcription factor playing important roles in the regulation of cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf490c39">39</xref>). In mouse liver the nuclear levels of both DDB1 and DDB2 increase in late G<sub>1</sub> phase and several hours before the peak of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf490c40">40</xref>). These phenomena may indicate that DDB has an important role in entering S phase. As shown here, DRE and DRE-like sequences are located upstream of the transcription initiation site of the <italic>d-ddb1</italic> gene. The DRE&#x0002f;DREF system regulates the expression of several genes encoding key factors involved in nuclear DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf490c23">23</xref>) and the present gel mobility shift analyses have demonstrated that the DRE and DRE-like sites of the <italic>d-ddb1</italic> gene are essential for formation of stable DNA&#x02013;protein complexes. Furthermore, mutations in any one of these two DREF-binding sites resulted in an extensive reduction in promoter activity. The data suggest that transcription of the <italic>d-ddb1</italic> gene is under control of the DRE&#x0002f;DREF system. The results of western blotting analysis of DREF levels during <italic>Drosophila</italic> development reported by Yamaguchi <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf490c31">31</xref>) are similar to those of northern blotting for <italic>d-ddb1</italic>. We conclude that D-DDB1 must contribute to both DNA repair and replication.</p><p>Like D-DDB1, another DNA repair protein factor, Rad51, is reportedly induced several-fold in murine cells ectopically expressing E2F1 or E2F2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf490c41">41</xref>). It may thus be required during replication to ensure genomic integrity. The <italic>dE2F</italic> gene has three tandemly arranged DNA replication-related element (DREs) and is one of the most critical target genes of DREF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf490c42">42</xref>). The <italic>d-ddb1</italic> gene has two DRE sites and the fact that its transcription was activated by DREF is clearly of interest in this context. The mechanisms by which DDB stimulates E2F-activated transcription and functions in DNA repair should next be deciphered. Further analysis should provide more precise insights into the molecular roles in different physiological processes.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf490f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> (<bold>A</bold>) UV cross-linking analysis of UV-damaged site-binding polypeptides.
