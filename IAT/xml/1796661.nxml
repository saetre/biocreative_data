New structural information on this channel has inspired computational studies aimed at clarifying various aspects of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> recruitment and binding in the periplasm, as well as its deprotonation. However, precise mechanisms for these events are still unknown, and, so far, explanations for subsequent NH<sub>3</sub> translocation and reprotonation at the cytoplasmic end of the channel have not been rigorously addressed. We employ molecular dynamics simulations and free energy methods on a full AmtB trimer system in membrane and bathed in electrolyte. Combining the potential of mean force for NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/NH<sub>3</sub> translocation with data from thermodynamic integration calculations allows us to find the apparent pK<sub>a</sub> of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> as a function of the transport axis. Our calculations reveal the specific sites at which its deprotonation (at the periplasmic end) and reprotonation (at the cytoplasmic end) occurs. Contrary to most hypotheses, which ascribe a proton-accepting role to various periplasmic or luminal residues of the channel, our results suggest that the most plausible proton donor/acceptor at either of these sites is water. Free-energetic analysis not only verifies crystallographically determined binding sites for NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and NH<sub>3</sub> along the transport axis, but also reveals a previously undetermined binding site for NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> at the cytoplasmic end of the channel. Analysis of dynamics and the free energies of all possible loading states for NH<sub>3</sub> inside the channel also reveal that hydrophobic pressure and the free-energetic profile provided by the pore lumen drives this species toward the cytoplasm for protonation just before reaching the newly discovered site.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Selective flow of ammonium manifests itself in a unique way in the case of the ammonium channel, AmtB, allowing it to interact closely with cytoplasmic signal transduction proteins in order to &#x0201c;sense&#x0201d; the presence of extracellular ammonium. Although it is well known that AmtB transports ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) rather than ammonium ion (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>), it is unclear from the channel's atomic structure exactly where and how, along its pathway toward the cytoplasm, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> becomes deprotonated to form NH<sub>3</sub>, and reprotonated on the cytoplasmic end of the channel to form NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> to enter the cell. We use a combination of molecular dynamics simulation techniques to glean the thermodynamics associated with these key events in ammonium translocation. Our findings provide a novel perspective on how this family of channels indirectly controls ammonium protonation&#x02014;by directly controlling its hydration. Such a perspective should lend new insight to interpretations of experimental data, and could possibly lead to new strategies in an envisioned future for the design of nanopores that can control the protonated state of permeant species.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Bostick DL, Brooks CL III (2007) Deprotonation by dehydration: The origin of ammonium sensing in the AmtB channel.

Though the narrow hydrophobic pore (lumen) connecting the inner and outer vestibules of the X-ray structure was seen to accommodate three poorly ordered NH<sub>3</sub> binding sites (named Am2, Am3, and Am4, respectively &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;), the opening from the periplasmic vestibule to the pore was apparently blocked by two stacked Phe sidechains (F107 and F215), rendering the means of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> deprotonation and translocation unclear. The fact that the pore was lined by two His residues (H168 and H318) hydrogen bonded to one another led to the suggestion that NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> can penetrate deep into the pore up to the middle site, Am3, before undergoing His-mediated deprotonation to form NH<sub>3</sub> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. However, no site or putative mechanism for reprotonation of NH<sub>3</sub> to form a cation was found. Nor was any binding site for NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> found in the cytoplasmic vestibule. It was also found very unlikely that water occupies the hydrophobic pore, further supporting the notion that AmtB transports NH<sub>3</sub> instead of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>. Since AmtB passively transports Am along an electrochemical gradient and was not seen to undergo conformational changes upon occupying different permeant species, it was deemed safe &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d; to consider the family of Amts as &#x0201c;channels.&#x0201d;</p><p>The new structural knowledge of AmtB has facilitated computational studies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b020">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d; aimed at understanding aspects of Am transport through the channel.

In the presence of a cation at Am1, the charged form of D160 was seen to be even more stable (by 9.2 pK<sub>a</sub> units). Performing the alchemical mutation, D160N, in agreement with experimental mutational studies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d; gave rise to a loss of binding for NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> at site Am1, suggesting that the presence of D160 stabilizes cation binding via through-space electrostatic interactions. However, the simulations of Luzhkov did not evaluate the structural role of D160 in facilitating cation sequestration using backbone carbonyls in the M4&#x02013;M5 loop as suggested by structural studies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. Such an evaluation would, necessarily, involve long simulations of the mutant channel. Thus, it is probably most accurate to say that D160 plays both an important role in stabilizing cation binding at site Am1 as well as stabilizing the M4&#x02013;M5 loop for recruiting NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> from the bulk, and that its structural and cation-stabilizing roles likely cannot be considered separately.</p><p>Computational studies performed by Lin et al. and Nygaard et al. led to the suggestion of an entirely different role for D160 as a proton acceptor from NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, with either water &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d; or the carbonyl oxygen of A162 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d; as an intermediary, based on qualitative inspection of molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. The simulation studies of Luzhkov et al. and Lin et al. suggested that NH<sub>3</sub> is highly favored over NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> at the first internal binding site, Am2, while Nygaard et al. suggested that NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> must bind to site Am2 <italic>before</italic> becoming deprotonated, as suggested by Khademi et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The available structural data and somewhat disjoint mechanistic proposals based on computational studies lead to questions about the specific details (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> recruitment, deprotonation to form NH<sub>3</sub>, and subsequent NH<sub>3</sub> translocation and reprotonation) of Am transport through AmtB: if NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> loses a proton somewhere between the Am1 and Am2/Am3 binding sites, exactly where and how does the deprotonation occur? What role do the blocking Phe residues (F107 and F215) play? What role does water play in the periplasmic and cytoplasmic vestibules, and can it permeate the channel? Given that once Am exists as NH<sub>3</sub> in the interior of the channel, the driving force for translocation of NH<sub>3</sub> toward the cytoplasmic vestibule to become <italic>re-</italic>protonated is unclear. What drives this uncharged species toward the cytoplasmic vestibule during the conduction event? Why are the internal NH<sub>3</sub> binding sites (Am2, Am3, and Am4) poorly ordered in the X-ray structure of AmtB, and (on a related note) can all three binding sites be occupied simultaneously? Where and by what means does NH<sub>3</sub> become protonated on the cytoplasmic side of the pore?

In addition, this system allowed us to determine ionic densities as a function of the transport (<italic>z-</italic>) axis from which we may derive the free energetics describing Am transport all the way from the bulk phase into the channel interior.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Vestibular NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Recruitment and Binding</title><p>Analysis of our simulated system showed that the large dipole moment (&#x0223c;2,000 Debye&#x02014;see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030022-sg001">Figure S1</xref>A) of the AmtB trimer has an interesting impact on the local ionic concentration at the membrane/electrolyte interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030022-g002">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030022-sg001">S1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030022-sg002">S2</xref>), which comprises a dielectric response to the protein's electric field. While NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> adsorption at the membrane surface was not affected significantly, Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> adsorption was. Overall, the local concentration of cation near the periplasmic vestibule (just beneath the lipid headgroup phosphate plane) was observed to be &#x0223c;16 times greater than that near the cytoplasmic vestibule. On the other hand, Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> was very unlikely to approach either vestibule, and its equilibrium concentration was &#x0223c;3 times smaller on the periplasmic side than on the cytoplasmic side (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030022-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). Hence, without any external electrochemical gradient, we see that the channel is built for recruiting cations from the periplasm at neutral pH on a mesoscopic scale.

Interestingly, the apparent pK<sub>a</sub> is shifted upward by &#x0223c;5 units near the membrane surface and around sites Am1 and Am5. More precisely, using values from <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030022-t001">Table 1</xref>, the shift in pK<sub>a</sub> is &#x0002b;4(&#x000b1;2) units at site Am1 (in agreement with a previous calculation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;) and &#x0002b;5(&#x000b1;3) units at site Am5. This upward shift, disfavoring deprotonation, is not unexpected for several reasons. First, any region that stabilizes or binds NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> will necessarily foster the protonated form of Am. This is true, not only for the binding sites, Am1 and Am5, but also for the membrane surface itself (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030022-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030022-sg002">S2</xref>), which is seen to bind cations strongly&#x02014;a result commonly seen at the membrane/electrolyte interface &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b026">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;.

The above arguments rationalize the upward shift in pK<sub>a</sub> near the membrane surface and stabilization of Am in its protonated form at the Am1 and Am5 binding sites. Note that at some regions in the curve the apparent pK<sub>a</sub> is seen to have values larger than 14, which violates limits implied by the auto-ionization of water.

In addition, it is worth noting that the uncertainty accumulated in the thermodynamic integration calculations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030022-t001">Table 1</xref>) and in shifting the PMF profiles leads to an uncertainty in the pK<sub>a</sub> shift of &#x0223c;3 units. </p><p>In the center of the hydrophobic pore containing sites Am2, Am3, and Am4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030022-g006">Figure 6</xref>B, vertical red bars), we see that the pK<sub>a</sub> of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> becomes negative, again violating limits implied by water auto-ionization.

Based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030022-g004">Figure 4</xref>, the process of bringing NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> from site Am1 to the deprotonation region corresponds to crossing a free high-energy barrier of &#x0223c;15 <italic>RT</italic> units, which supports the experimental observation of very slow Am translocation rates of 10<sup>5</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>8</sup> ns/molecule &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>If we observe the average hydration number of Am as a function of the transport axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030022-g006">Figure 6</xref>D), we can rationalize the extremely unfavorable (15 <italic>RT</italic>) barrier to translocation and drastic drop in apparent pK<sub>a</sub>. In the bulk, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> is hydrated by six water molecules, and at site Am1 (vertical gray bar at <italic>z</italic> &#x0223c; 1.07 nm) it loses two to three water molecules from its hydration shell to form hydrogen bonds with A162 and S219 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030022-g003">Figure 3</xref>), but as the external electrochemical gradient pushes it toward the deprotonation site, its hydrogen bonds are stripped away such that eventually the only available acceptors are one to two water molecules, and the carbonyl oxygens of A162 and F215.</p><p>The transition state for the NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> to NH<sub>3</sub> transformation at the deprotonation site may be most accurately represented (given our classical molecular description) by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030022-g007">Figure 7</xref>, where the F107 phenyl group is seen to allow passage by rotating in response to the presence of the cation. In this configuration, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> is stripped to three hydrogen bonds with one water molecule and the carbonyl groups of A162 and F215, and must release one of its protons in order to favorably continue toward the cytoplasm as NH<sub>3</sub>. Previous works have suggested that the proton is donated to A162 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d; and, eventually, to D160 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. However, at this deprotonation site, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> has access to periplasmic vestibular water, which connects to the bulk in a continuous fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030022-g006">Figures 6</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030022-g007">7</xref>). Thus, it is much more likely to pass its proton directly to water, so that the proton may escape directly to the periplasm in the form of hydronium (cutting out the &#x0201c;middle man&#x0201d;). This conclusion is strongly supported by (1) the fact that water ionizes more easily than a carbonyl group; (2) the fact that at the transition state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030022-g007">Figure 7</xref>) the carboxylate of D160 is persistently engaged in hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl and amide nitrogen of T165, and the amide nitrogens of G163 and G164; and (3) the finding that these strong interactions shift the pK<sub>a</sub> of the D160 sidechain downward by &#x0223c;9 pH units, making its protonation effectively impossible &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;.

In this sense, even though the reaction occurs in a condensed phase, it is much like the reaction that would occur when transferring Am from aqueous solution to a gas phase.

Here, further passage is hindered by the phenyl group of F31. This sidechain, forming the &#x0201c;floor&#x0201d; of the hydrophobic lumen provides an &#x0223c;10 <italic>RT</italic> free-energy barrier (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030022-g004">Figure 4</xref>) for NH<sub>3</sub> reaching the cytoplasmic (de)protonation region at <italic>z</italic> &#x0003d; &#x02212;1.13 &#x000b1; 0.07 nm (see the corresponding green bar in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030022-g006">Figure 6</xref>B&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030022-g006">6</xref>D).

Presumably, larger NH<sub>3</sub> luminal occupancy (i.e., more than 1 NH<sub>3</sub>) would lower the barrier to reprotonation due to mutual destabilization of NH<sub>3</sub> molecules (we discuss this later). The protonation of NH<sub>3</sub> to form NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> at the reprotonation region (green bar in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030022-g006">Figure 6</xref>D) is coupled to a gain in hydration from 0 (coordinating NH<sub>3</sub>) to 2&#x02013;3 (coordinating NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) water molecules and the gain of one hydrogen bond to the hydroxyl oxygen of S263 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030022-g006">Figure 6</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030022-g008">Figure 8</xref>B3).

Given the sequence of events observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030022-g008">Figure 8</xref>A, it appears that once NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> donates a proton to neighboring water and moves slightly farther into the lumen, the F107 side chain guards against hydration while the second phenyl side chain from F215 rotates to allow passage of NH<sub>3</sub>. Together, F107 and F215 act as a &#x0201c;double doorway,&#x0201d; aiding to ensure dehydration of the passing Am species. In a similar manner, at the floor of the lumen, F31 guards against hydration from the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030022-g008">Figure 8</xref>B).</p><p>During 27.5 ns of equilibration and 25 ns of production MD with no intraluminal Am species, neither water nor NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> was seen to spontaneously enter the hydrophobic lumen (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030022-sg004">Figure S4</xref>). During umbrella sampling simulations where NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> was forced to sample the lumen, it was seen to carry along anywhere from zero to three water molecules (compared with six in the bulk, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030022-g006">Figure 6</xref>D). However, as mentioned before, the free-energy barrier for NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> entering the lumen from either the periplasm or cytoplasm is prohibitive (&#x0003e;15 <italic>RT</italic> to reach the deprotonation region and &#x0003e;50 <italic>RT</italic> to reach the NH<sub>3</sub> sites Am2, Am3, or Am4, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030022-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030022-sg003">S3</xref>). On the other hand, NH<sub>3</sub> is quite &#x0201c;happy&#x0201d; to be completely dehydrated as it occupies the lumen (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030022-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030022-g006">6</xref>D). Therefore, we can conclude that the NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ion's ability to deprotonate to form NH<sub>3</sub> imparts Am with the ability to permeate the AmtB channel in a selective fashion. That is, permeation of Am or methylated Am will be greatly preferred over other aqueous inorganic ionic species because deprotonated Am (or methylated Am) can favorably occupy the hydrophobic lumen.</p><p>Based on our calculations, we can expect prohibitive free energy barriers (&#x0003e;50 <italic>RT</italic>) for <italic>permanently</italic> charged species to enter the lumen. Thus, without a doubt, this is the most robust rationale for the AmtB channel's display of selective permeability for Am over all <italic>permanently</italic> charged species (e.g., Family IA and IIA cations such as K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> or Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>), and is the most plausible source of the &#x0201c;Am-sensing&#x0201d; property of this channel &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. With that being the case, the Phe residues, F107, F215, and F31, play a role in selective permeation, not by providing a larger relative stability at the periplasmic/cytoplasmic binding sites (Am1/Am5) for NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> over other cations, but by aiding in the removal of water at the deprotonation region of the transport pathway.</p><p>Whether other ions can competitively inhibit binding, and thus recruitment, of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> to the periplasmic site, Am1, is a different question altogether (aside from selective permeability). However, this appears not to be an issue since experimental studies do not observe significant competitive inhibition of methyl-Am uptake by alkali cations in Amt/MEP/Rh transporters &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;.

With only mild selectivity at site Am1, it appears that the hydrophobic lumen is the most Am-selective feature of the channel.</p><p>The finding that Am sheds its water before entering the hydrophobic lumen as NH<sub>3</sub>, where it remains dehydrated, contrasts with a recent computational study by Nygaard et al., which reported that the interior lumen of the hydrophobic pore is hydrated &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. In that study, two 10-ns simulations, each with different neutral tautomeric states of the intraluminal His pair, H168 and H316, both demonstrated hydration of the lumen all the way up to the periplasmic phenyl &#x0201c;stack&#x0201d; provided by F107 and F215. The water entered the lumen in the form of a highly ordered, hydrogen bonded &#x0201c;water wire,&#x0201d; a very commonly observed arrangement in hydrophobic pores &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;, which entered the pore via the cytoplasmic vestibule &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. This observation led the authors to suggest that proton conduction by single-file water might provide a mechanism for H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> exchange with H168 and H316.</p><p>In contrast to the study of Nygaard, our MD simulations never displayed this hydration event in any one of the three channels in the AmtB trimer, despite 52.5 ns of dynamics (combining both equilibration and production runs). It is possible that a difference in choice of force field (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>) may have been the origin of these contrasting results. However, since the study of Nygaard et al. included only Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> counterions so as to achieve a net neutral system charge (no electrolyte) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;, we find it more probable that the main cause for our different observations is inclusion of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl electrolyte in our simulated system (measured to be 158 &#x000b1; 5 mM in the bulk, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030022-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). We say this because past work has shown that simulated systems utilizing 3-D periodicity with full Ewald sums for treatment of electrostatic interactions and comprising membrane-bound proteins possessing a significant dipole moment (greater than &#x0223c;300 Debye) can display unexpected &#x0201c;water-ordering&#x0201d; artifacts &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. This water-ordering phenomenon is constant in the bulk, can propagate all the way into the pores of membrane-bound channels, and is caused by the infinite array of persistent dipoles (caused by the membrane-bound protein in the central simulation cell) represented by a fully periodic system in 3-D. Normally, the largest dipole component of a membrane-bound protein will fall along the membrane normal (or transport axis). Thus, one way to remove the effect due to the electric field produced by the infinite, 3-D periodic dipolar array is to remove the periodicity in this direction (the membrane normal is usually taken to be the <italic>z</italic>-dimension), and to simulate in a slab (effectively 2-D or <italic>xy</italic>-) geometry &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. There are other ways to avoid this artifact. For example, one can add electrolyte to the system (as we have done) so that it bears the dielectric response to the protein, rather than the water &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. One may also choose to use a cutoff treatment of electrostatic interactions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;, although other artifacts are associated with this method. The addition of counterions alone, though it is important to assure a neutral system charge, does not appear to be enough to avoid the effect &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. Nor does the addition of generous layers of water in bulk in an attempt to screen the effect &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The dipole moment of the AmtB trimer is several times larger (&#x0223c;2,000 Debye, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030022-sg001">Figure S1</xref>A) than the membrane proteins for which this phenomenon was first observed, and thus is an excellent candidate for providing an electric field to which the surrounding simulated system must respond. In our system, we observe that the dipole moment of the electrolyte precisely counteracts the dipole of the protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030022-sg001">Figure S1</xref>A), leaving a net zero dipole moment for the entire system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030022-sg001">Figure S1</xref>B). Without the electrolyte, we can expect the water to bear the majority of the burden of the dielectric response to the protein.</p><p>The next obvious question is: Given that the net force of an electric field on a dipolar molecule is zero, why might this cause water to enter the hydrophobic lumen of AmtB? Recently, much attention has been given to the occupancy of water in hydrophobic spaces provided by macromolecular assemblies, including narrow hydrophobic pores, cavities, and the hydrophobic membrane interior &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. It has been shown that, indeed, electric fields directed parallel to the axis of a narrow hydrophobic pore can make a water-filled state favorable, whereas in the absence of a field, it would be unfavorable &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, electric fields directed along the bilayer normal can cause water to penetrate the hydrophobic portion of the lipid membrane itself and form water-filled pores&#x02014;a process known as electroporation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. In either case, the electric field induces a preferred water orientation, which increases the probability of observing ordered water defects either at the membrane surface (in the case of membrane electroporation) or at the hydrophobic pore entrance (in the case of pore hydration). This appears to increase the probability that water enters the pore. It is also known that hydrophobic pore hydration occurs in an &#x0201c;all-or-none&#x0201d; fashion, well-represented by two-state models &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. Once water enters a hydrophobic pore, we can expect that it will become filled. That is, one would assume, unless there is some feature that blocks full permeation. It would appear that the phenyl groups of F107 and F215 provide such a &#x0201c;blocking&#x0201d; feature.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Free Energy and Dynamics of Multiply NH<sub>3</sub>-Occupied Luminal States</title><p>The three NH<sub>3</sub> binding sites within the hydrophobic lumen proved to be highly disordered in the X-ray structure &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;, leading to uncertainty in understanding whether the sites were occupied alternately with one another during the conductance mechanism, or partially occupied such that at high-bulk Am concentrations they might be fully occupied. According to the PMF for NH<sub>3</sub> at single occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030022-g004">Figure 4</xref>), it appears that immediately after the deprotonation event, NH<sub>3</sub> is most likely to jump across sites Am2 and Am3 to site Am4. There it must either overcome a barrier (&#x0223c;37 kJ/mol or &#x0223c;15 <italic>RT</italic>) to reprotonate and escape back to the periplasm, or overcome a barrier (&#x0223c;25 kJ/mol or &#x0223c;10 <italic>RT</italic>) to reprotonate and escape to the cytoplasm. Multiple occupancy of the lumen will undoubtedly lower these barriers.</p><p>We utilized additional thermodynamic integration calculations (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030022-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>) to draw a state map for the possible NH<sub>3</sub>-occupied states of the lumen, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030022-g009">Figure 9</xref>A. For brevity, we adopt a vector representation for the occupied state of the three-site lumen, (O<sub>2</sub>,O<sub>3</sub>,O<sub>4</sub>), where O<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, and O<sub>4</sub> are binary digits indicating whether Am2, Am3, or Am4, respectively, are occupied (O<sub>i</sub> &#x0003d; 1) or unoccupied (O<sub>i</sub> &#x0003d; 0). Since NH<sub>3</sub> most favorably occupies site Am4 at single occupancy, (i.e., state 001), the map suggests that when a second NH<sub>3</sub> enters, it will most likely occupy site Am2 (i.e., state 101). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030022-g009">Figure 9</xref>A suggests that NH<sub>3</sub> binding at site Am4 when site Am2 is occupied (the reaction 100 &#x02192; 101) is 7 kJ/mol less-favorable than binding at site Am4 when no other site is occupied (the reaction 000 &#x02192; 001). If we assume that the barrier for NH<sub>3</sub> escape from Am4 to the cytoplasmic protonation region remains the same (we will refer to this as the &#x0201c;barrier assumption&#x0201d;) as calculated for single occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030022-g004">Figure 4</xref>), then it would cost less free energy (&#x0223c;18 kJ/mol or 7<italic>RT</italic>) for NH<sub>3</sub> to move on to the cytoplasm from state 101. If NH<sub>3</sub> were to dynamically move to a state where Am3 and Am4 are simultaneously occupied (state 011), we find that NH<sub>3</sub> binding at site Am4 when site Am3 is occupied (010 &#x02192; 011) is 28 kJ/mol less-favorable than binding at site Am4 when no other site is occupied (000 &#x02192; 001). And with the above barrier assumption, the translocation of NH<sub>3</sub> to the deprotonation region from site Am4 would become favorable, requiring &#x0223c;&#x02212;3 kJ/mol or &#x02212;<italic>RT</italic>. Needless to say, at full occupancy (state 111), the same approximation suggests that passage of NH<sub>3</sub> from site Am4 to the deprotonation region would be even more favorable (&#x0223c;&#x02212;10 kJ/mol or &#x02212;4<italic>RT</italic>).</p><p>Thus, our results suggest that doubly-occupied NH<sub>3</sub> dynamics in the lumen can force the escape of NH<sub>3</sub> at site Am4 to the cytoplasmic deprotonation region for successive binding to site Am5 and escape to the cytoplasm. The state most likely preceding the escape of NH<sub>3</sub> to the deprotonation region is one where the lumen is occupied at sites Am3 and Am4 (state 011). We also note, however, that the free energy to attain full occupancy (the reaction 011 &#x02192; 111) is favorable &#x0223c;&#x02212;9 kJ/mol or &#x02212;4 <italic>RT</italic>. In fact, this reaction is more favorable than the escape of NH<sub>3</sub> to the cytoplasm. Therefore, it is also possible for the fully occupied state, 111, to precede escape of NH<sub>3</sub> to the deprotonation region.</p><p>Though, above, we have only discussed the process of NH<sub>3</sub> translocation toward the cytoplasm, our results do not preclude translocation toward the periplasm, which is well-known to occur &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. In fact, at full occupancy (state 111), it becomes more favorable (by &#x0223c;&#x02212;13 kJ/mol or &#x02212;5 <italic>RT</italic>) for NH<sub>3</sub> to escape from site Am2 to the periplasmic deprotonation region (i.e., the reaction 111 &#x02192; 011) than the same reaction at zero occupancy (i.e., the reaction 100 &#x02192; 000). Thus, our results are also consistent with the facilitation of gradient-dependent bidirectional NH<sub>3</sub> transport.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030022-g009">Figure 9</xref>B, we show a brief demonstration of NH<sub>3</sub> dynamics for the fully occupied state of the lumen. Although the channel is fully occupied, it appears that the qualitative trend in binding-site favorability represented by the PMF of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030022-g004">Figure 4</xref> for single occupancy persists. The interactions of NH<sub>3</sub> with the lumen display a strong tendency to force NH<sub>3</sub> toward the cytoplasmic binding site, Am4. At times, the position of Am4 can be transiently occupied by two NH<sub>3</sub> molecules (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030022-g009">Figure 9</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030022-g009">9</xref>C). We can expect slight differences in the free energetics and dynamics of NH<sub>3</sub> in the lumen depending on the tautomeric form of the intraluminal histidine residues &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. The tautomeric configuration represented by our simulations appears to favor translocation toward the cytoplasm, while the study of Nygaard et al. showed that the alternate form for H168 and H318 does not appear to favor translocation in either direction. It is possible that, together, these different forms may be used by the channel to facilitate translocation toward the cytoplasm or toward the periplasm, depending on the electrochemical gradient conditions.</p><p>Thus, our results suggest that a periplasmic electrochemical gradient will push NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> from site Am1 to be deprotonated at the deprotonation region; the hydrophobic NH<sub>3</sub> molecules begin to fill up the lumen, resulting in mutual destabilization or a buildup of &#x0201c;pressure,&#x0201d; which in turn allows NH<sub>3</sub> reprotonation to become favorable. This means that the rate-limiting step of Am permeation is the NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> deprotonation step at the periplasmic end of the channel, representing an &#x0223c;15 <italic>RT</italic> free-energy barrier (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030022-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030022-g004">4</xref>) that must occur at the position of the F107 phenyl ring, before proceeding into the lumen, just underneath the F215 phenyl ring.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results show that the global electrostatic nature of the AmtB channel inhibits anion binding to the periplasmic membrane and plays a large role in the recruitment of cations to the outer vestibule.

At this new site, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> donates hydrogen bonds to D313 and S263, as well as to 3&#x02013;4 water molecules. Additional contributions near the periplasmic binding site, Am1, were found to be due to the backbone carbonyls of the M4&#x02013;M5 loop.

This role persists as NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> binds to site Am1, and as it moves on to be deprotonated.

Nor does it support the hypothesis of structural analyses &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d; that NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> deprotonation is mediated by intraluminal His residues (H168 and H318). Rather, our pK<sub>a</sub> analysis of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> shows that the deprotonation site must coincide with the position of the phenyl group of F107. This phenyl group rotates as NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> passes and is stripped of most of its hydrogen bonds. At this point, only the backbone carbonyl groups of A162 and F215 and a water molecule serve as hydrogen bond acceptors. Given (1) that water ionizes more easily than a carbonyl group, (2) that the carboxylate of D160 is persistently engaged in hydrogen bonds with residues of the M4-M5 loop, and (3) that the apparent pK<sub>a</sub> of D160 is shifted downwardly by &#x0223c;9 pH units due to its stabilized interactions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;, water is the only plausible candidate for accepting a proton from NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> at the deprotonation site. The proton has full access to the periplasmic bulk, and must therefore escape in the form of hydronium. Thus, the Am deprotonation mechanism of AmtB is due to stripping NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> hydration to a critical point, much like the deprotonation event that one would observe in transferring Am from a hydrated state to a gas state.</p><p>Recently, a mutagenesis study showed that the twin luminal His residues (H168 and H318) are essential for substrate conductance &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;. Javelle et al. offered two explanations for this result: (1) these His residues serve as proton acceptors for entering Am such that they may move across the lumen as NH<sub>3</sub>, or (2) efficient conductance might require a &#x0201c;narrow mainly hydrophobic pore with a few precisely oriented hydrogen bond acceptor or donor functions for weak, stabilizing interactions with water/ammonia that still permit rapid diffusion.&#x0201d; Our results suggest that the latter explanation (2) applies.</p><p>The need of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> for hydration, or some other form of hydrogen-bond stabilization, also manifests itself in our PMF analysis as an insurmountable free-energy barrier (&#x0003e;50 <italic>RT</italic>), preventing passage across the phenyl group of F107 and approaching any site within the lumen.

Since Am has the rare ability to deprotonate, it may enter the lumen as NH<sub>3</sub>. This is the origin of the Am-sensing ability of AmtB.

Although, in contrast to other simulations of AmtB &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;, the MD simulations of our work do not show any ordered luminal hydration (i.e., in the form of a water wire), they do not rule out the possibility of a few water molecules &#x0201c;sneaking&#x0201d; into the lumen. Such events would not be expected to inhibit NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> deprotonation (and, thus, AmtB's sensing capability).</p><p>Recent diffraction studies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d; clearly show electron density at the three luminal NH<sub>3</sub> binding sites (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030022-g004">Figure 4</xref>), but are unable to determine whether these sites are occupied by NH<sub>3</sub> or water molecules. The diffraction study of Khademi et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d; could not find density corresponding to these sites for AmtB structures crystallized in the absence of 25mM AmSO<sub>4</sub>. This suggests that these peaks are mostly due to NH<sub>3</sub> rather than water. Upon the introduction of charged species to the hydrophobic lumen, we might expect water to enter. For example, in the very unlikely event that NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> enters the lumen, we show that it can carry water with it (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030022-g006">Figure 6</xref>D). Recently, an X-ray diffraction study of an H168D mutant of AmtB showed electron density inside the lumen that might be attributable to water &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;. It was deemed most likely that this was due to the negative charge of the Asp side chain protruding into the lumen.</p><p>Given that hydration of narrow hydrophobic pores in the absence of an electric field is known to be unfavorable &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;, the absence of ordered luminal hydration is most likely attributable to the presence of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl electrolyte in our simulated system, which, by responding to the macro-dipole of AmtB in the membrane, neutralizes the resulting electric field acting parallel to the transport axis. Similar &#x0201c;neutralizing&#x0201d; electrolytic responses to dipolar membrane proteins have also been observed in other work &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. It appears that the periplasmic phenyl groups of F107 and F215 and the cytoplasmic phenyl group of F31 are major contributors to the maintenance of the dehydrated state of the AmtB lumen. This is most likely the reason why our NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> pK<sub>a</sub> calculations highlight the positions of F107 and F31 as deprotonation &#x0201c;landmarks.&#x0201d;</p><p>Once Am occupies the lumen as NH<sub>3</sub>, in the singly occupied state, Am4 near the cytoplasm is the most stable site. As more hydrophobic NH<sub>3</sub> is added to the lumen by means of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> deprotonation from the cytoplasm, it may favorably become reprotonated from either a doubly occupied state (where Am3 and Am4 are simultaneously occupied) or a triply occupied state. Favorability for reaching the cytoplasmic reprotonation site is thus attained by a buildup of NH<sub>3</sub> pressure in the lumen. In addition, the dynamics of NH<sub>3</sub> within the lumen supports flow toward the floor of the lumen at the cytoplasmic site, Am4. Since, at the floor of the lumen, reprotonation of NH<sub>3</sub> occurs favorably at multiply occupied states, the rate-limiting step for Am permeation must be the deprotonation step at the periplasm, where NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> becomes dehydrated. The free-energy barrier for this step is &#x0223c;15 <italic>RT</italic> based on our PMF calculations.</p><p>Though our study addresses mostly the translocation of Am toward the cytoplasm, the results we present are not inconsistent with the expected capability of bidirectional Am translocation. A previous study has found slight differences in the dynamics of NH<sub>3</sub> in the lumen depending on the tautomeric form of the intraluminal histidine residues &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. It is possible that, together, these different forms may be used by the channel to facilitate translocation toward the cytoplasm or toward the periplasm, depending on the electrochemical gradient.</p><p>Based on our apparent pK<sub>a</sub> calculations, reprotonation of NH<sub>3</sub> at the cytoplasmic end of the lumen was shown to occur upon hydration immediately after passing the phenyl group of F31. No plausible donor other than water exists at the point where NH<sub>3</sub> reaches the reprotonation site. Thus, reprotonation at the cytoplasmic end of the channel must occur in the reverse manner to deprotonation at the periplasmic end. Upon reprotonation, Am binds as NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> to site Am5 before escaping to the cytoplasm. Thus, the role of the newly discovered site, Am5, is apparently to reduce the barrier to reprotonation by promoting hydration directly beneath F31 and by stabilizing NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> such that it does not escape back into the lumen as NH<sub>3</sub>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Setup, equilibration, and production simulations of the AmtB system.</title><p>All MD simulations were performed using the GROMACS package &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;, with the OPLS force field for protein, ions, and NH<sub>3</sub> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;, the OPLS lipid parameters developed by Smondyrev and Berkowitz &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;, and the SPC water model &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;.

All residues were mutated such that a wild-type representation of the protein was obtained. In addition, the missing residues, A1 and P2, were added to each monomer to yield the full protein. All crystallographic water-molecule positions that coincided with the transmembrane portion of the trimer were stripped from the structure except for those deemed by Khademi et al. to be in &#x0201c;special positions.&#x0201d; We also removed NH<sub>3</sub> positions from the interior binding sites (Am2, Am3, and Am4), to be replaced later for other calculations, leaving only the NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> position at site Am1 for each monomer. Hydrogen atoms were then added to the protein, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> molecules, and crystallographic water molecules. All residues were assigned their standard (neutral pH) protonation states, and the tautomeric forms of each His residue were assigned using (geometric) hydrogen-bonding criteria except for the intraluminal H168 and H316 residues, which were shown to share a proton, and were thus assigned the tautomeric form suggested by Khademi et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030022-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d; and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030022-g004">Figure 4</xref>.

Since, for all of our simulations, water was not seen to enter the lumen, it would appear that our choice of tautomeric state is reasonable. It should be noted, however, that any conformational event observed involving these His residues during simulation (including umbrella sampling simulations) can only represent one of a few possibilities, since their protonation states must be permanently assigned. Of course, this is true of any simulation employing conventional force fields.</p><p>The trimeric structure described above was inserted into the equilibrated POPC bilayer, and all overlapping lipid and water molecules in the hydrated bilayer were removed.

In the first series of umbrella simulations, we sampled NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> along <italic>z</italic> from site Am1 (<italic>z</italic> &#x0003d; 1.04 nm), outwardly, into the periplasmic solution (<italic>z</italic> &#x0003d; 2.64 nm) using windows of &#x00394;<italic>z</italic> &#x0003d; 0.04 nm (a total of 41 window simulations).

The initial configuration for these series was generated by removing the three Am1-bound NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ions and three Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> ions from the bulk solution (to maintain net neutral system charge) in the initial structure of the NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> umbrella simulations described above. A single NH<sub>3</sub> molecule was placed at site Am3 (the central luminal site, at <italic>z</italic> &#x0003d; 0.25 nm) within the AmtB monomer.

Again, each simulation within a series was performed consecutively.</p><p>Finally, we sampled NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> translocation at the cytoplasmic end of the channel. The initial structure for these series of simulations was taken from the 27.5-ns equilibration run.

In addition, we note that the NH<sub>3</sub> PMF profile could not be fit exactly to the points determined by thermodynamic integration (blue points with error bars in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030022-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). If, as an upper bound, we estimate the uncertainty to be 4 <italic>RT</italic> in the PMF profile, we obtain an additional uncertainty in the pK<sub>a</sub> profile of 1.7 units. Combining these estimates of uncertainty in the pK<sub>a</sub> calculation, we may give an upper bound in the determined pK<sub>a</sub> profile (of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030022-g006">Figures 6</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030022-sg003">S3</xref>C) of 2.9 units (or &#x0223c;3 units, as mentioned in the text). The difference in the pK<sub>a</sub> obtained when utilizing 1-channel versus 2-channel sampling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030022-sg003">Figure S3</xref>) is obviously much greater than &#x0223c;3 units in the hydrophobic lumen of the channel (&#x0223c;15&#x02013;20 units around <italic>z</italic> &#x0003d; 0.1 nm, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030022-sg003">Figure S3</xref>C); however, in this region, the total pK<sub>a</sub> is about &#x02212;45 units. Thus, regardless of the differences observed in this region, the apparent pK<sub>a</sub> of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> is so low that it would be effectively impossible for Am to exist in its charged form. Despite any differences seen in the results from 1-channel and 2-channel sampling, we come to the same conclusion when determining the position where deprotonation and reprotonation of Am occur along its pathway through the channel (green vertical bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030022-g006">Figures 6</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030022-sg003">S3</xref>C). </p><p>All type-2 calculations were used to complete the occupancy state map in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030022-g009">Figure 9</xref>A (free-energy values shown in blue).
