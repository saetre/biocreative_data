A universal histone variant, H3.3, is incorporated at sites of active transcription throughout the cell cycle. The presence of H3.3 in chromatin indicates histone turnover, which is the energy-dependent removal of preexisting histones and replacement with new histones. H3.3 is also incorporated during decondensation of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> sperm pronucleus, indicating a direct role in chromatin remodeling upon fertilization. Here we present a system to monitor histone turnover and chromatin remodeling during <named-content content-type="genus-species">Caenorhabditis elegans</named-content> development by following the developmental dynamics of H3.3. We generated worm strains expressing green fluorescent protein&#x02013; or yellow fluorescent protein&#x02013;fused histone H3.3 proteins, HIS-71 and HIS-72. We found that H3.3 is retained in mature sperm chromatin, raising the possibility that it transmits epigenetic information via the male germline. Upon fertilization, maternal H3.3 enters both male and female pronuclei and is incorporated into paternal chromatin, apparently before the onset of embryonic transcription, suggesting that H3.3 can be incorporated independent of transcription. In early embryos, H3.3 becomes specifically depleted from primordial germ cells. Strikingly, the X chromosome becomes deficient in H3.3 during gametogenesis, indicating a low level of histone turnover. These results raise the possibility that the asymmetry in histone turnover between the X chromosome and autosomes is established during gametogenesis. H3.3 patterns are similar to patterns of H3K4 methylation in the primordial germ cells and on the X chromosome during gametogenesis, suggesting that histone turnover and modification are coupled processes. Our demonstration of dynamic H3.3 incorporation in nondividing cells provides a mechanistic basis for chromatin changes during germ cell development.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Germ cells carry genetic information from one generation to the next. They are converted to gametes during meiosis, which are then reprogrammed for development in the fertilized egg. Gamete production and developmental reprogramming involve dramatic changes in DNA packaging, but little is understood about how these changes are involved in resetting the developmental program for the whole organism. In spermatogenesis, DNA is stripped and repackaged into highly condensed chromatin. After fertilization, sperm DNA is again repackaged as it dramatically decondenses to fuse with the egg nucleus. These repackaging processes involve the four core histone proteins, which tightly wrap DNA into nucleosome particles. A universal variant form of histone 3, H3.3, is abundant in the germ cells of all plants and animals studied and has been shown to turn over at sites of active transcription in various somatic cells. The authors show that H3.3 displays dynamic turnover throughout germ cell development of the roundworm <named-content content-type="genus-species">Caenorhabditis elegans</named-content>. H3.3 incorporates during the first germline stem cell division, continues through meiosis, and ends up in sperm and eggs. Strikingly, H3.3 becomes depleted from primordial germ cells, and the meiotically silenced X chromosome is deficient in H3.3, which suggests that H3.3 dynamics during meiosis and reprogramming transmit epigenetic information.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Ooi SL, Priess JR, Henikoff S (2006) Histone H3.3 variant dynamics in the germline of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans.</italic> PLoS Genet 2(6): e97.

In mammalian spermatogenesis, S phase histones are replaced by histone variants. The histone variants are then sequentially replaced by transition proteins and protamines, resulting in highly condensed and transcriptionally inert sperm DNA (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020097-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;). Sperm DNA is again remodeled upon fertilization, where it is rapidly decondensed, and protamines are replaced by histones to generate transcriptionally competent chromatin. During spermatogenesis, germ cell chromatin also undergoes other dynamic processes such as meiotic recombination, the formation of the XY body and establishment of genomic imprinting mediated by DNA methylation.</p><p>Histone variants, unlike S phase or replication-coupled (RC) histones, are expressed throughout the cell cycle and are incorporated into nucleosomes in a DNA replication&#x02013;independent (RI) manner. In mammals, certain histone variants are expressed during different stages of gametogenesis; however, their specific functions during germ cell development have remained elusive (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020097-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020097-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;).

Thus, energy-dependent removal of preexisting histones and replacement by RI histones (histone turnover) is a widespread and dynamic process that can be measured by observing the presence of H3.3 in dividing cells. Dynamic incorporation of H3.3 might profoundly alter the chromatin state of the nucleosome by enriching it in post-translational modifications that are associated with active chromatin and depleting it in modifications associated with silent chromatin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020097-b008">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020097-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;.

Germ cells are particularly easy to visualize, because the gonad occupies almost half of the adult body, and successive stages of meiosis appear in a simple, linear sequence along the proximal-distal axis of the gonad. In this study, we generated worm strains expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)- and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-tagged H3.3 and showed that the tagged H3.3 proteins are incorporated into nucleosomes. By observing fluorescently tagged H3.3 in living embryos, larvae and adult worms, we showed that H3.3 is associated with dynamic chromatin remodeling during multiple stages of germ cell development.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> Genome Encodes Two H3.3 and Three H3.3-Like Histone Variants</title><p>In animals, RC forms of histone H3 and the RI form (H3.3) differ at only four amino acids.

The GFP fluorescence associated with individual sperm disappeared very soon after fertilization, and no fluorescence was visible on the paternal chromosomes as the paternal pronucleus formed.

In early embryos, H3.3 is present in gradually decreasing amounts in the germline P lineage (P<sub>0</sub> to P<sub>4</sub>). The P lineage is unusual in that it undergoes stem cell&#x02013;like divisions, and P<sub>0</sub> to P<sub>4</sub> cells are largely transcriptionally quiescent. After the final P lineage cell (P<sub>4</sub>) divides to yield Z2 and Z3 primordial germ cells, H3.3 remains deficient, and this deficiency persists during embryogenesis. We could not detect embryonic incorporation of H3.3 in the P lineage when the transgene was provided only through male sperm, consistent with previous findings that the P lineage appears to be transcriptionally quiescent, based on RNA polymerase II and transcript analysis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020097-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020097-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore, H3.3 in the early P lineage cells must be maternally derived. Because early P lineage cells contain H3.3, the observation that Z2 and Z3 lack H3.3 could mean that chromatin-associated H3.3 is selectively removed, or is simply diluted out by successive cell divisions. The deficiency of H3.3 in Z2 and Z3 cannot be attributed to a lack of transcription entirely, because some transcription evidently occurs in these cells by mid-embryogenesis, and an RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain phosphoserine 2 modification that correlates with transcriptional elongation is present in Z2 and Z3 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020097-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020097-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020097-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>During larval stages and in adult worms, H3.3 is present throughout both oogenesis and spermatogenesis, starting from the mitotic zone before meiosis begins, eventually ending up in mature oocytes and sperm.

Instead, the X chromosomes are deficient in H3.3 compared to the autosomes, suggesting that the X chromosomes have a low histone turnover rate. Taken together with our observation that the two primordial germ cells of early embryos are deficient in H3.3, the asymmetry in histone turnover between the X chromosome and autosomes is most likely established during germ cell proliferation in larval stages.</p><p>Our observations on H3.3 expression in the primordial germ cells and in germ cells undergoing gametogenesis are in striking parallel with previous observations of histone modifications associated with transcriptional activity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020097-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020097-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. First, both H3K4me2 and H3.3 are present at very low levels in Z2 and Z3 during embryogenesis but at high levels in the Z2 and Z3 descendants as these cells proliferate during larval development. Second, in the mitotic region of the adult gonad the X chromosomes of males and hermaphrodites are deficient in both H3K4me2 and H3.3. Third, at the pachytene stage of meiosis the paired X chromosomes of hermaphrodites and the unpaired X of males are also deficient in both H3K4me2 and H3.3. Finally, similar high levels of both H3K4me2 and H3.3 are present on X chromosomes and autosomes during postpachytene stages of oogenesis. Low histone turnover may result from a lack of transcription-coupled chromatin remodeling on the X chromosomes, which are depleted of germline- and spermatogenesis-specific genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020097-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;.

CENP-A&#x02013;containing nucleosomes are thought to provide a foundation for maintaining centromeres epigenetically through mitosis and meiosis, so that CENP-A retention in bull sperm implies a role in epigenetic transmission. Likewise, our discovery that the other universal RI histone 3 variant, H3.3, is also retained in mature sperm, suggests an analogous role in epigenetic transmission that might in the future be explored using the powerful tools available for <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content>.</p><p>Upon fertilization, maternal H3.3 incorporates rapidly into both maternal and paternal pronuclei of <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content>.

The difference between worms, in which both pronuclei incorporate H3.3, and flies and mice in which only the paternal genome is remodeled, might stem from a need to distinguish maternal from paternal genomes in flies and mice, but not in worms. In support of this interpretation, we note that mouse maternal and paternal genomes differ in global DNA methylation and histone modifications in the zygote, which are thought to result in parental imprinting (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020097-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;).</p><p>The <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> genome appears to be transcriptionally quiescent in one-cell embryos, because the elongation form of RNA polymerase II and newly transcribed mRNAs are first detected in somatic blastomeres at the four-cell stage &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020097-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020097-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020097-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, our observation that H3.3 is incorporated into paternal chromatin upon fertilization in one-cell embryos provides additional evidence that H3.3 can be deposited independent of transcription &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020097-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. Because H3.3 is the predominant form of histone 3 available throughout cell cycle, it most likely serves as a chromatin repair protein that is incorporated during chromatin-related events outside of S phase, such as chromatin remodeling upon fertilization and DNA repair.</p><p>In conclusion, our description of histone H3.3 dynamics during multiple stages of germ cell development implicates chromatin remodeling in germline maintenance and transmission. <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> entirely lacks DNA methylation and so provides an ideal model for studying purely histone-based epigenetic processes.
