Glioma is a highly vascular, very aggressive and extremely invasive primary brain tumor. Hypoxia induces changes in glioma and its microenvironment, which leads to increased aggressiveness and resistance to chemotherapy and radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Studies have shown that large areas of hypoxia within glioma correlates inversely with the patient's outcome and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>ADAM17 (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase-17) also called TACE (TNF-alpha converting enzyme) plays a pivotal role in the processing of numerous growth factor proteins, and has emerged as a new therapeutic target in several tumor types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].

Currently, the role of Sp1 in ADAM17 expression and activity is unknown, but it is known the ADAM17 promoter region contains GC-rich sequences highly complementary to the Sp1 DNA-binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].

The cells were harvested at 8, 12, 16 and 20 hours. In parallel with the hypoxic culture, normoxic culture was harvested as well to serve as a control for all assays.</p></sec><sec><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP)</title><p>ChIP assay was performed as follows: U87 (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>) cells on a 10 cm dish were treated with 1% formaldehyde and incubated for 10 min at 37&#x000b0;C, then washed with cold PBS containing protease inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride-PMSF, 1 &#x003bc;g/mL aprotinin and 1 &#x003bc;g/mL pepstatin A). The cells were collected, spun down and added SDS lysis buffer, and then incubated on ice. The DNA was sonicated (5 pulses for 10 s, chilled on ice for 50 s) to shear it into 200-1000 base pairs. Once the sheared DNA was diluted into ChIP buffer a pellet was obtain by centrifugation. The assay requires two negative controls. The first control was transcriptionally inactivated DNA that was used for the PCR reaction, and the second control was transcriptionally active DNA without antibody for immuno-precipitation. The immuno-precipitating Sp1 antibody was added to the DNA and incubated overnight. PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) was done in order to amplify the DNA that was bound to the immunoprecipitated histones. The primers used for amplification were design using OligoPerfect Primer Design Program (Invitrogen) and are as follows: A17 1F 5'-TGGAGCAAATGTGCATTCAG-3', A17 1R 5'-GCATTTGGTTCAGGGTCCTA-3', A17 2F 5'- GTGGGCATCAAGACAAAGGA-3', A17 2R 5'-CTTCCTGGACGCAGACGTA-3', A17 3F 5'-GAGCCTGGCGGTAGAATCTT-3', A17 3R 5'-TACCGACTCCACCTCTCTGG-3'. Once amplified, the PCR product was tested by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel containing 0.01% ethidium bromide. The results were visualized using DualLite Trans-illuminator machine (Fisher). The ChIP assay was performed under normoxic conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Real-time PCR</title><p>Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using real-time PCR with the SYBR Green reporter.

A total volume of 200 &#x003bc;l proteins with buffers were added to the alpha-secretase specific APP (amyloid precursor protein) peptide.

In a 24-well plate, U87 tumor cells were added to high glucose DMEM media, and incubated for two hours in order to create a monolayer of cells. A scratch was made in the middle of the well with a p200 pipette tip. The debris was washed away and new media added to the wells. Under the microscope, the cells were imaged and the initial area of the scratch for the field of view was determined by multiplying the length by the average width of the area devoid of cells. The plate was incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 12 hours, after which the same field of view was imaged and the area devoid of cells was recalculated by the same method. The final area of the scratch wound was divided by the initial area, giving us the % of the initial area covered by migrating cells over the 12 hours culture period.</p></sec><sec><title>siRNA transfection</title><p>A stable transfection of Sp1 siRNA was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen). The transfection reagent and the siRNA were diluted in 100 &#x003bc;L DMEM without serum or antibiotic. Once they were mixed together, they were incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature. For each transfection 6 mL DMEM was added to each tube containing the siRNA-transfection mixture. Clonal selection of neomycin-resistant U87 cells was conducted after transfection. Sp1 down-regulation was verified in transfected U87 clones using Western blot. The cells were maintained in neomycin-containing media, and employed less than 10 passages after confirmation of reduced Sp1 protein expression. Of note, Sp1 down-regulation in U87 cells caused cells to acquire a flat, less bipolar morphology compared to control transfected cells. All Sp1 shRNA-expressing clones shared this morphology whereas control plasmid transfected clones did not, suggesting the effect was due to Sp1 down-regulation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Sp1 binds to the ADAM17 promoter</title><p>Sp1 binds to GC boxes in the promoter region of genes to regulate their expression.

Employing three fragments of the ADAM17 promoter (GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AB034151.1">AB034151.1</ext-link>), results of PCR amplification indicated Sp1 bound to the fragment corresponding to the first 97 bp of the ADAM17 promoter region (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), corresponding to (1-97 of AB034151.1, -901 to -804 of the ADAM17 initiation codon).

Real-time RT-PCR analysis of ADAM17, Sp1 and HIF-1&#x003b1; mRNA was performed on U87 tumor cells. Human TATA-Box protein was used as a normalizing control, and HIF-1&#x003b1; was used as a positive marker for hypoxia. The mRNA samples used for PCR were normoxic control, 8 hours, 12 hours, 16 hours and 20 hours of hypoxia. Sp1 mRNA expression peaked after 12 hours of hypoxic incubation. Significant increases (*P &#x0003c; 0.05) were observed in the mRNA levels of ADAM17, Sp1 and Hif-1&#x003b1; genes under hypoxic compared to normoxic conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). To test the contribution of Sp1 to ADAM17 expression, we established a Sp1-deficient cell-line by transfecting U87 cells with a plasmid encoding for Sp1-targeting siRNA. U87 cells transfected with empty pcDNA3.1+ vector were used as control. Employing these cells in our hypoxic incubation assay, we found that the mRNA expression levels of ADAM17 and Sp1 were significantly (*P &#x0003c; 0.05) lower compared to the results obtained from respective control (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Of note, HIF-1&#x003b1; mRNA levels were also affected by inhibition of Sp1, and were significantly decreased compared to control HIF-1&#x003b1; mRNA expression under hypoxic conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). This is likely due to the fact that Sp1 is a known transcription factor for HIF-1&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. These results suggest that ADAM17 mRNA expression is altered by the Sp1 transcription factor, particularly ADAM17 transcription induced by hypoxia.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Real-time RT-PCR and Western blot for Sp1, ADAM17 and HIF-1&#x003b1; in U87</bold>.

Western blotting revealed an increase ADAM17, Sp1 and HIF-1&#x003b1; protein expression under hypoxic conditions compared to normoxic control. The blots of all three proteins increased under hypoxia, and peaked at 12 hours of hypoxic incubation within the time points where expression was measured (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). When Sp1-deficient cells were used for the experiment, a significant decrease in ADAM17 protein expression levels was observed after 12 hours of culture, both under normoxic and hypoxic conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). These data indicate that under hypoxic conditions ADAM17 and Sp1 protein levels increased significantly but decreased when Sp1 is down-regulated. In addition, ADAM17 protein is decreased in Sp1 deficient cells under normoxic conditions as well. Based on these results, we concluded that the Sp1 transcription factor plays a significant role in controlling ADAM17 protein expression, particularly under hypoxic conditions. As Sp1 and ADAM17 protein expression peaked at 12 hours hypoxia, we employed this time point for our further hypoxic assays.</p></sec><sec><title>Hypoxic-induced alpha-secretase assay in U87 is Sp1 dependent</title><p>Previously, we reported that ADAM17 contributes to hypoxic-induced tumor invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Having established that Sp1 mediates hypoxic-induced ADAM17 expression, we tested whether Sp1 down-regulation would elicit an anti-invasion effect, similar to inhibition of ADAM17. ADAM17 is an alpha-secretase, capable of proteolytic cleavage of APP into its soluble APP-alpha peptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Therefore we tested if the Sp1 transcription factor alters ADAM17 alpha-secretase activity in normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Hypoxic incubation of U87 for 12 hours increased alpha-secretase activity by 43.6% compared to normoxic control (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This agreed with our previous findings that hypoxia induced alpha-secretase activity in U87 cells, primarily via ADAM17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In contrast, when Sp1 was suppressed, alpha-secretase activity under hypoxic incubation was unchanged compared to normoxic conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Notably, Sp1 suppression under normoxic conditions did not reduce alpha-secretase activity, suggesting Sp1 was critical for hypoxic-induced alpha-secretase activity, but not under normoxic conditions. These results suggest that Sp1 is a major contributor in hypoxic-induced alpha-secretase activity, possibly via suppression of hypoxia-induced ADAM17.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of Sp1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) on alpha-secretase activity in U87 tumor cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions</bold>.

Furthermore, Sp1 suppression reduced the invasiveness of U87 cells by 17.3% in normoxic conditions and by 28.9% under hypoxic conditions compared to U87 control cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). These results indicate the Sp1 transcription factor contributes to the invasive phenotype of U87 tumor cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of Sp1 siRNA transfection upon invasiveness of U87 tumor cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions</bold>. <bold>A</bold>.

Hypoxia has been implicated in many aspects of tumor development, angiogenesis and growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. At the cellular level, hypoxia induces the expression and cellular concentration of HIF-1&#x003b1;. High expression of this factor leads to an increase in cell division-tumorigenesis and appears to be a prognostic marker for malignancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>ADAMs comprise a family of proteins that contain both a disintegrin and a Zn-dependent metalloproteinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. These molecules are involved in gene regulation, cell adhesion and proteolysis. The most extensively studied protein belonging to this family is ADAM17 (a.k.a. TACE). ADAM17 sheds a variety of epidermal growth factors receptor (EGFR)-binding ligands, including transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-&#x003b1;), heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF), and amphiregulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In addition, ADAM17 facilitates the release of several integrins from the cell surface, and influences the invasive activity of several cells, including brain tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Sp1 is important to the transcription of many genes that contain GC boxes in their promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Sp1 has been widely perceived as a basal transcription factor since its discovery; however, increasing evidence suggests Sp1 regulates a multiple functions critical to tumorigenesis and progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Knowing that ADAM17 contributes to the invasiveness of tumor cells and that Sp1 binds to its promoter region, it is possible that Sp1 transcription factor may be a new target for anti-invasive therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Previously, we have reported that the increased invasion ability of U87 cells under hypoxic conditions is mediated by elevated ADAM17 expression and protease activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Sp1 protein expression has been reported to increase in tumor cells under hypoxic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. We used the TESS promoter analysis program to determine if the Sp1 transcription factor binds to ADAM17, as the promoter region of ADAM17 contained multiple Sp1 transcription factor binding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Using a DNA-protein binding assay under normoxic conditions we found that Sp1 binds to ADAM17 within the ADAM17 promoter region, -901 to -804 of TSS. As one consensus sequence for human Sp1 is found at bp 3-9 of the ADAM17 promoter, we surmise this is the position of Sp1-binding; however mutational analysis is needed to confirm this is the target site. Sp1 down-regulation reduced expression of ADAM17 under both normal and hypoxic conditions; however, we have not confirmed the Sp1 binding site within the ADAM17 promoter is functional. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that hypoxia can not only alter expression, but enhance the binding activity of Sp1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Thus, although we demonstrate binding of Sp1 to the ADAM17 promoter, further investigation of its transcriptional effect upon ADAM17 is warranted.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that at the transcriptional level, Sp1 plays a critical role in gene expression especially under hypoxic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Our PCR data revealed that hypoxia induced mRNA expression of ADAM17 as well as Sp1. In addition, we observed that our Sp1-deficient cells decreased mRNA expression of ADAM17 under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Using Western blot, we confirmed that hypoxia induced protein expression of ADAM17 and Sp1. However, when Sp1 was down-regulated by an expression plasmid encoding for siRNA, hypoxia failed to induce ADAM17 mRNA and protein expression indicating that Sp1 is required for hypoxic-induction of ADAM17.</p><p>Previously, we have reported that increased ADAM17 expression and protease activity contributes to hypoxic-induced tumor invasion. In this study, we established that Sp1 regulates ADAM17 gene expression. Furthermore, we investigated whether inhibition of Sp1 would elicit an anti-invasion effect similar to inhibition of ADAM17. Here, we used an alpha-secretase assay to determine if Sp1 siRNA influences ADAM17 protease activity. As expected, hypoxia increased alpha-secretase activity in U87 tumor cells. However, when Sp1 was down-regulated, hypoxia did not significantly increase alpha-secretase activity in line with inhibition of hypoxia-induce ADAM17. Of note, Sp1 down-regulation did not decrease alpha-secretase activity under normoxic conditions. This is in agreement with our previous data that ADAM17 does not constitute for the majority of alpha-secretase activity in U87 cells under normoxic conditions, but does account for the majority of hypoxic-induced alpha-secretase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>ADAM17 mediates hypoxic-induced glioma invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. To test if Sp1 contributes to the invasion of tumor cells, we used an <italic>in vitro </italic>invasion assay. Our results indicate that under hypoxic conditions the invasive ability of U87 significantly increased, and this increase was correlated with high ADAM17 expression and proteolytic activity. The invasive ability of U87 cells decreased considerably when Sp1 was suppressed under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Similar to invasion, Sp1 down-regulation resulted in a significant reduction in U87 cell migration both under hypoxic and normoxic conditions.</p><p>Here we demonstrate that Sp1 is critical for hypoxic-induced ADAM17, and that Sp1 contributes to hypoxic induced glioma invasion. However, we have not established the effect of Sp1 upon invasion is solely mediated via ADAM17. In addition to many other genes, HIF-1&#x003b1; contains Sp1 binding sites in its promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In fact, we found Sp1 down-regulation diminished HIF-1&#x003b1; expression. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of Sp1 down-regulation upon cell invasion and migration were more pronounced under hypoxic conditions, suggesting the role of Sp1 is more pronounced in the context of hypoxic-inducible factors. Hypoxic-induced ADAM17 expression is dependent upon Sp1, and ADAM17 significantly contributes to hypoxic-induced glioma invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, it is probable the effect of Sp1 upon hypoxic-induced cell invasion includes factors in addition to ADAM17.</p><p>Our study suggests that Sp1 transcription factor mediates hypoxia-induced ADAM17 expression and proteolytic activity, and contributes to an increase in invasiveness of brain tumor cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. These findings suggest that Sp1 may be a novel target for anti-invasive therapies of brain tumor.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>In our study all authors are in agreement with the content of the manuscript.
