The green embryos are capable of photosynthesis and have been shown to fix carbon crucial to the biosynthesis of seed storage oils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In experiments with cultured rapeseed embryos and siliques, light was found to increase embryo growth-rates, which correlated both with improved carbon sequestration and with its utilization in seed oil synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. These effects were largely negated by inhibition of photosynthesis, and their studies indicated that it is the reductant and/or ATP produced by photosynthesis in green embryos that is important for normal embryo growth and seed development.</p><p>Arabidopsis embryos begin to develop chloroplasts and appear green around 5 days after pollination and the chloroplasts remain present for up to approximately 12 days after pollination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. When seeds are maturing during late embryogenesis (&#x0003e;12 days), the chloroplasts dedifferentiate and lose their chlorophyll, starch, and internal membranes to seed storage reserves, which results in the formation of white embryos in mature Arabidopsis seed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In soybean (<italic>Glycine max</italic>), a small simple plastid called an eoplast has been found in fully mature embryo cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Eoplasts resemble proplastids but are derived from chloroplasts. Thus far, eoplasts have not been observed in mature Arabidopsis embryos, largely because the embryo cells are so densely packed with lipid and protein bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Nevertheless, a basal-state plastid must be maintained in the cells of fully mature Arabidopsis embryos since chloroplasts, amyloplasts, and the various other plastid types re-develop upon seedling germination. The development of these plastids early after germination can be critical for seedling survival since, in addition to photosynthesis and the production of starch, plastids are also involved in the biosynthesis of fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], nucleic acids, and amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Although a good deal is known about the physiological and biochemical functions of chloroplasts during embryo growth and seed production, investigations of chloroplast development during embryogenesis have been largely descriptive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. To identify molecular components involved in plastid development during the youngest phase of the Arabidopsis life cycle, a screen was conducted to identify mutants that specifically influence plastid development in embryos and seedling tissues derived from the embryo, but not in tissues derived from the apical meristem. Mutants were identified that exhibited cotyledon and hypocotyl albinism upon germination due to improper chloroplast development, while photosynthetic tissues derived from the shoot apical meristem were green and appeared to develop normal chloroplasts. This paper describes mutants in a gene that encodes for a plastid-localized elongation factor G (EF-G). One mutant allele from an EMS-(ethyl methanesulfonate) mutagenized population was found to be the result of the same nucleotide substitution responsible for the recently described <italic>s</italic>nowy <italic>co</italic>tyledon <italic>1 </italic>(<italic>sco1</italic>) [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_104952">NM_104952</ext-link>] mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Two alleles with T-DNA insertions directly in this gene resulted in embryo lethality, demonstrating that this EF-G is essential during embryogenesis. Our analysis of the different mutant alleles of <italic>SCO1 </italic>indicate that differentiation of eoplasts to chloroplasts during germination may have different requirements for protein translation than for proplastid to chloroplast differentiation in cells derived from the apical meristem.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Embryo-lethal <italic>sco1 </italic>alleles</title><p>Two alleles of <italic>sco1 </italic>(<italic>sco1-2 </italic>and <italic>sco1-3</italic>) isolated from the Salk T-DNA insert collection have T-DNA inserts at the C-terminal end of the gene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In <italic>sco1-2</italic>, all of the T4 seed tested developed green cotyledons. Genotypic analysis of the viable progeny showed that these plants consisted of a segregating population with a ratio of 1:2 for wild-type to heterozygote for the T-DNA insert in the <italic>SCO1 </italic>gene. No viable progeny were found that were homozygous for the T-DNA insert. Moreover, examination of developing siliques on plants that were heterozygous for the <italic>sco1-2 </italic>T-DNA insert revealed that approximately 25% of the developing ovules were white (88 white ovules out of 360 examined; see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). The 9 d-old white ovules were similar in size to the green ovules, but upon dissection they did not appear to contain a developing embryo. This was presumably due to abortion of the embryo at a very early stage of embryogenesis. Similar results were observed for the <italic>sco1-3 </italic>T-DNA insertion line (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). These findings indicate that null mutants in <italic>SCO1 </italic>are lethal early during embryo development and that the EF-G encoded by <italic>SCO1 </italic>is essential for plant development.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>The <italic>SCO1 </italic>mutational map</bold>. <italic>SCO1 </italic>encodes for a predicted protein with a high degree of similarity to an EF-G containing a chloroplast localization signal (At1g62750).

The red autofluorescence, which is indicative of the presence of chlorophyll, suggested that chloroplast development was not completely blocked in the mutant seedlings despite the visually albino appearance. Also, upon closer examination of some <italic>sco1-1 </italic>seedlings, we often observed patches of green cells, which were typically located near the margin of the cotyledons and in the upper hypocotyl (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref>). The extent of this sectoring phenotype varied from seedling to seedling. In the absence of supplemental sugar, over 80% of the <italic>sco1-1 </italic>seedlings failed to produce true leaves and died (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The mutant seedlings that were able to survive without the supplemental carbon source typically had larger patches of green cells in their cotyledons and/or hypocotyls. These patches of green cells were presumably capable of providing the seedling with photosynthate and other essential plastid-derived components necessary for survival until the first true green leaves could develop from the apical meristem. Similarly, <italic>sco1-1 </italic>seedlings that were able to survive when germinated in soil had large green patches (data not shown). Leaves and other photosynthetic tissues derived from the apical meristem in <italic>sco1-1 </italic>were green and visually indistinguishable from wild-type plants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate the structural development of chloroplasts in the cotyledons, we examined cells by light and transmission electron microscopy in 5-d-old wild-type and <italic>sco1-1 </italic>cotyledons. As expected, cotyledon mesophyll cells of light-grown wild-type seedlings contained numerous well-developed chloroplasts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>). In contrast, chloroplasts were essentially absent from cotyledon mesophyll cells of typical <italic>sco1-1 </italic>seedlings except in the bundle sheath cells that surround the cotyledon vasculature (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>), consistent with the appearance of red autofluorescence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). In thin-sections from 'green-sectored' <italic>sco1-1 </italic>cotyledons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3H</xref>), we observed chloroplast-containing mesophyll cells directly adjacent to cells that are devoid of chloroplasts. The chloroplasts that developed in green <italic>sco1-1 </italic>cells appeared normal and showed characteristics of typical wild-type chloroplasts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3J</xref>).</p><p>Since chloroplast development was altered in <italic>sco1-1 </italic>seedlings, we stained seedlings for starch to determine if amyloplast development was also altered. Starch staining revealed that <italic>sco1-1 </italic>hypocotyls contained starch grains, indicative of the presence of amyloplasts in the endodermis (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3K, L</xref>). Starch grains in <italic>sco1-1 </italic>root columella cells also appeared similar to those in wild type (data not shown). Consistent with the role of amyloplasts in gravity perception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], gravitropism of hypocotyl, root, and inflorescence in <italic>sco1-1 </italic>was found to be similar to wild type (data not shown).

The presence of plastid-specific ribosomal proteins (PSRPs), however, indicates that at least some aspects of the translation mechanism in chloroplasts is unique to plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>As shown here and by Albrecht et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], the nuclear <italic>SCO1 </italic>gene encodes for a protein translation elongation factor G with a chloroplast-targeting signal sequence. Although biochemical activity has not been directly demonstrated for SCO1, similar functionality seems highly likely since the predicted amino acid sequence of SCO1 is over 50% identical to the <italic>E. coli </italic>EF-G <italic>fusA </italic>[GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="X00415">X00415</ext-link>], including conservation of glycine 132, which was changed to an arginine in the <italic>sco1-1 </italic>mutant.</p><p>During the elongation phase of plastid protein biosynthesis, the elongation factor EF-Tu binds to an aminoacyl-tRNA, which is then directed to the A site of the ribosome. The EF-G protein is then required to translocate the newly formed peptidyl-tRNA from the ribosomal A-site to the P-site. Although the <italic>sco1-1 </italic>mutant is viable when provided with sucrose during germination (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), the two alleles we identified with T-DNA insertions in the <italic>SCO1 </italic>coding sequence (<italic>sco1-2 </italic>and <italic>sco1-3</italic>) have an embryo-lethal phenotype (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), indicating that <italic>SCO1 </italic>is an essential gene. The G to A base change in the <italic>sco1-1 </italic>mutant converted a conserved glycine residue to an arginine at position 132, which is between the P-loop and Switch I regions of the conserved GTP-binding domain found in the 70S-ribosome-binding region of elongation factors. Since the activity of EF-G is dependent upon hydrolysis of GTP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], the amino acid change in <italic>sco1-1 </italic>may interfere with GTP hydrolysis activity in the mutant protein, affecting binding to or release from the ribosome. Since <italic>sco1-1 </italic>plants are viable once they produce leaves from the apical meristem, the mutant EF-G produced is likely to retain partial EF-G activity. However, we have not found reports describing a similar mutation in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><p>The <italic>sco1-4 </italic>allele, which contains a T-DNA insertion upstream of the <italic>SCO1 </italic>start site, most likely produces a normal EF-G but at reduced levels compared to wild type (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), which could cause the pale cotyledon phenotype (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). The different cotyledon phenotypes of <italic>sco1-1 </italic>and <italic>sco1-4 </italic>is likely due to differences in the manner in which translation is altered. Previous research has demonstrated that in adult leaf tissues, proper plastid protein translation is absolutely essential for cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], and a similar reduction in protein translation in <italic>sco1-1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] reveals that plastid protein translation is also critical during seedling development.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>sco1 </italic>is critical during late embryogenesis and/or early germination</title><p>The plastid defects seen in <italic>sco1-1 </italic>and <italic>sco1-4 </italic>are most pronounced in seedling cells that were derived from the embryo. A few other published Arabidopsis mutants exhibit seedling-specific abnormal chloroplast development, including <italic>white cotyledon 1 </italic>(<italic>wco1</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and <italic>sig</italic>ma factor 6 (<italic>sig6</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Mutations in <italic>SIG6 </italic>cause similar seedling stage-specific effects on chloroplast development to <italic>sco1-1</italic>, such as albino to pale-green cotyledons and normal leaf development. It was suggested that the <italic>sig6 </italic>mutant is able to produce normal chloroplasts in adult tissues due to redundancy in the role of sigma factors throughout development. In the <italic>wco1 </italic>mutant, the white cotyledon phenotype is highly dependent on light intensity, and the plants show various other defects in addition to the seedling albinism, including a marked reduction of chlorophyll content in adult rosette leaves. The <italic>wco1 </italic>phenotype is thought to result from a disruption of 16 S rRNA maturation, making it one of several mutants that appear to affect 16 S rRNA maturation and disrupt chloroplast development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>Since the eoplast to chloroplast transition is defective in <italic>sco1-1 </italic>and <italic>sco1-4 </italic>mutants, it appears that SCO1 activity is particularly critical during either the transition from chloroplast to eoplast, or when eoplasts redifferentiate into chloroplasts after germination. When we precociously germinated <italic>sco1-1 </italic>embryos before their chloroplasts had converted to eoplasts, green seedlings were obtained, indicating that some aspect of eoplast formation is critical for the <italic>sco1-1 </italic>mutant phenotype to develop. Because all plastid types would be expect to be impaired if eoplasts were abnormal, the presence of starch-containing amyloplasts in <italic>sco1-1 </italic>seedlings suggests that eoplast formation may be relatively normal in the mutant embryos and that the eoplast to chloroplast transition may be more demanding of EF-G activity than for the eoplast to amyloplast transition. Consistent with observations in Albrecht et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], we found that the SCO1 tagged with GFP was targeted to chloroplasts. In addition to this previously determined chloroplast targeting, we found that the SCO1::GFP was also localized to non-photosynthetic plastids such as those in root and petal cells.</p><p>Even in the white <italic>sco1-1 </italic>cotyledons, chloroplasts were observed by chlorophyll fluorescence and microscopy in cells surrounding the vasculature (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). In addition, while some <italic>sco1-1 </italic>seedlings appear almost entirely albino (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), others show a variegated phenotype with sectors of 'wild-type' green cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref>). When green sectors are present, they are mostly located around the cotyledon margin and the cells appear to contain a full complement of chloroplasts. It has been shown that lipid and starch deposition, which are associated with the progression of maturation in cotyledons of developing soybean embryos, begins in the interior cells of the organ and progresses to the periphery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. If maturation of Arabidopsis cotyledons follows a similar gradient, cells along the margin may not fully dedifferentiate their chloroplasts into eoplasts prior to seed maturation. Since we could rescue the <italic>sco1-1 </italic>phenotype by precocious germination, it is possible that the stages of plastid development that appear to be most dependent on SCO1 activity may be bypassed in a subset of cells that happen to arrest prior to full eoplast formation.</p><p>The lethality of the T-DNA insertion alleles (<italic>sco1-2 </italic>and <italic>sco1-3</italic>) is consistent with the hypothesis that SCO1 represents an essential gene in Arabidopsis involved in protein synthesis in plastids. There are at least two other predicted EF-Gs in the Arabidopsis genome, both of which are predicted to encode EF-Gs with mitochondrial-targeting and possibly plastid-targeting sequences. Dual targeting has been observed for other plant transcripts, including at least 17 of the Arabidopsis aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. At1g45332 and At2g45030 are over 98% identical to each other and show 43% identity and 62% similarity to SCO1, respectively, excluding the targeting sequences. If At1g45332 and/or At2g45030 are dual-targeted, it is possible that they may provide EF-G activity in at least some cell and/or plastid types that can aid, or compensate for, the impaired activity of SCO1 in the <italic>sco1-1 </italic>and <italic>sco1-4 </italic>mutants. It is also possible that one or both of these other EF-G genes can contribute to protein synthesis during later stages of plant development, which could allow the <italic>sco1-1 </italic>and <italic>sco1-4 </italic>mutants to develop green leaves. It is also possible that in the absence of normal SCO1 levels, expression of the other EF-Gs may be increased. However, expression analyses of these three EF-Gs in wild-type plants indicates that SCO1 expression greatly exceeds that of the other two EF-Gs in both cotyledons and mature leaves (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). More detailed analysis of expression levels and protein localization for all three EF-Gs during development will help distinguish between the various potential explanations. Given the lethal phenotype of T-DNA inserts in SCO1, however, neither of these other EF-Gs appears fully capable of providing sufficient EF-G function for plastid development in the absence of SCO1 activity during early stages of embryo development.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results presented here show that the EF-G encoded by the <italic>SCO1 </italic>gene in Arabidopsis is essential for plant growth since T-DNA insertions in the gene cause embryo lethality. The stage-specific phenotypes of the <italic>sco1-1 </italic>and <italic>sco1-4 </italic>mutants described here, and for the <italic>wco1 </italic>and <italic>sig6 </italic>mutants, reveal fundamental differences between plastid development in embryo-derived cells and cells derived from the apical meristem. Analysis of other seedling plastid-defective mutants should provide a better understanding of plastid formation during this critical period in plant development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p>The plants used for this study were of the Columbia ecotype of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>.
