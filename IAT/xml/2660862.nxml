The expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) 1A in these DCs is essential for the RA production. However, it remains unclear how the steady-state ALDH1A expression is induced under specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions. Here, we found that bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BM-DCs) generated with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) expressed <italic>Aldh1a2</italic>, an isoform of <italic>Aldh1a</italic>, but that fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand-generated BM-DCs did not. DCs from mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and Peyer's patches (PP) of normal SPF mice expressed ALDH1A2, but not the other known RA-producing enzymes. Employing a flow cytometric method, we detected ALDH activities in 10&#x02013;30% of PP-DCs and MLN-DCs. They were CD11c<sup>high</sup>CD4<sup>&#x02212;/low</sup>CD8&#x003b1;<sup>intermediate</sup>CD11b<sup>&#x02212;/low</sup> F4/80<sup>low/intermediate</sup>CD45RB<sup>low</sup>CD86<sup>high</sup>MHC class II<sup>high</sup>B220<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD103<sup>+</sup>. Equivalent levels of aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (ALDHact) and ALDH1A2 expression were induced synergistically by GM-CSF and IL-4 in splenic DCs <italic>in vitro</italic>. In BM-DCs, however, additional signals via Toll-like receptors or RA receptors were required for inducing the equivalent levels. The generated ALDH1A2<sup>+</sup> DCs triggered T cells to express gut-homing receptors or Foxp3. GM-CSF receptor-deficient or vitamin A-deficient mice exhibited marked reductions in the ALDHact in intestinal DCs and the T cell number in the intestinal lamina propria, whereas IL-4 receptor-mediated signals were dispensable. GM-CSF<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>&#x02212;</sup>F4/80<sup>+</sup> cells existed constitutively in the intestinal tissues. The results suggest that GM-CSF and RA itself are pivotal among multiple microenvironment factors that enable intestinal DCs to produce RA.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>gut</kwd><kwd>homing</kwd><kwd>RALDH</kwd><kwd>regulatory T</kwd><kwd>Th17</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid (RA) plays critical roles in gut immunity. We found that RA is produced by dendritic cells (DCs) in the gut-associated lymphoid organs, Peyer's patches (PP) and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), and imprints gut-homing specificity on T cells upon antigenic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). Indeed, vitamin A-deficient mice exhibited depletion of T cells in the small intestinal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). RA also imprints B cells with gut-homing specificity and contributes to their IgA production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). Recently, it was found that RA enhances the transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x003b2;-dependent differentiation of naive T cells into Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (Treg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>), but suppresses the differentiation of T<sub>h</sub>17 cells that contribute to inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>), and may contribute to oral tolerance. Therefore, RA appears to be a key molecule that controls lymphocyte trafficking and immune responses. However, it remains poorly understood how intestinal DCs acquire the RA-producing capacity.</p><p>The major pathway of RA synthesis depends on two steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). The first step from vitamin A (retinol) to retinaldehyde is catalyzed by a subfamily of alcohol dehydrogenases that are expressed in most cells including DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>) or by the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). The second step from retinaldehyde to RA is catalyzed by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) 1A [retinal dehydrogenase (RALDH)], a subfamily of ALDH. ALDH1A expression is limited to certain cell types and is thus a key to the RA-producing capacity. MLN-DCs and PP-DCs significantly express <italic>Aldh1a</italic> or ALDH1A, whereas DCs in the spleen (SPL) or peripheral lymph nodes (PLN) that drain skin barely express it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). DCs in the lamina propria (LP) of the small intestine also express <italic>Aldh1a</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Here, we obtained a flow cytometric method to estimate aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (ALDHact) in individual DCs by modifying a detection system for hematopoietic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>) and identified the DC subsets with ALDHact<sup>+</sup> in MLN and PP. DCs are likely to start expressing ALDH1A after they immigrated into the gut since DCs are plastic in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>) and can be re-programmed by tissue microenvironment to instruct T cells with other homing specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Thus, the microenvironment of the gut, even without active immunization or pathogenic bacterial infection, might specifically induce ALDH1A expression in DCs. RA itself has been previously implicated to endow swine monocyte-derived DCs with some attributes of gut DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). Here, we found that granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) as well as vitamin A appears to play important roles in the differentiation of ALDH1A-expressing intestinal DCs <italic>in vivo</italic>. The expression of the major ALDH1A isoform, ALDH1A2 (RALDH2), was synergistically and strongly induced in DCs by GM-CSF and IL-4 <italic>in vitro</italic> and was further enhanced by Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands and RA itself, but was only weakly induced by RA alone. The present study also suggests that DCs generated with GM-CSF possess the capacity to produce RA and gradually lose it in culture without GM-CSF.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p>B10.D2 mice were from Japan SLC (Shizuoka, Japan).

However, it has remained unsolved which DC subsets are responsible for the RA production and how they acquire their RA-producing capacity. Here, we identified CD11c<sup>high</sup>CD4<sup>&#x02212;/low</sup>CD8&#x003b1;<sup>intermediate</sup>CD11b<sup>&#x02212;/low</sup>F4/80<sup>low/intermediate</sup>CD45RB<sup>low</sup>CD86<sup>high</sup> MHC class II<sup>high</sup>B220<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD103<sup>+</sup> cells as the DCs expressing the major RA-synthesizing enzyme, ALDH1A2, in MLN and PP of normal SPF mice. Especially, CD8&#x003b1;<sup>intermediate</sup>CD103<sup>high</sup> MLN-DCs highly expressed <italic>Aldh1a2</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://intimm.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dxp003/DC1">Supplementary Figure 1</ext-link> is available at International Immunology Online). MLN-DCs are derived from three sources: the blood, LP and PP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). A subset of the LP-derived DCs was CD11c<sup>high</sup>CD8&#x003b1;<sup>intermediate</sup>CD11b<sup>low</sup>&#x003b1;L<sup>low</sup>&#x003b2;7<sup>high</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>). Since the <italic>Aldh1a2</italic><sup>+</sup> and ALDHact<sup>+</sup> DCs are a minor DC population in PP in normal SPF mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>), ALDH1A2<sup>+</sup> DCs in MLN may be derived largely from LP and slightly from PP. In LP, at least two cell populations, CD103<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>&#x02212;/low</sup> DCs and CD11b<sup>+</sup>F4/80<sup>+</sup> macrophages, appear to be potential RA producers or their precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>), and these DCs but not macrophages may migrate into MLN. Alternatively, ALDH1A2<sup>+</sup> DCs generated in PP might quickly migrate into MLN, or ALDH1A2 expression might be also induced in DCs after migrating into MLN. Recently, it has been shown that a subset of LP-DCs with a macrophage-like character (CD11c<sup>high</sup>CD11b<sup>high</sup>CD86<sup>high</sup>CD103<sup>+</sup>F4/80<sup>moderate</sup>) also expresses <italic>Aldh1a2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>).</p><p>GM-CSF appears to play a physiological role to induce the ALDH1A2 expression in intestinal DCs. GM-CSF<sup>+</sup> cells were detected in the intestinal tissues of normal SPF mice, and many of them were CD11c<sup>&#x02212;</sup>F4/80<sup>+</sup>. Macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>) or eosinophil-like cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>) may contribute to the GM-CSF production in the intestinal tissues. IECs did not produce GM-CSF without exposure to pathogenic bacteria, but may produce it with these stimuli. GM-CSF is also constitutively expressed in BM. However, fresh CD11c<sup>+</sup> BM cells expressed very low levels of <italic>Aldh1a2</italic> (data not shown). CD11c<sup>+</sup> BM cells may be too immature to express high levels of ALDH1A2 upon exposure to GM-CSF. Alternatively, collaborative factors including RA, IL-4 and TLR ligands may not be enough in BM. GM-CSF is also required for maintaining ALDH1A2 expression since GM-CSF-induced <italic>Aldh1a2</italic> expression in BM-DCs decreased when the culture was extended in the absence of GM-CSF (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://intimm.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dxp003/DC1">Supplementary Figure 2</ext-link> is available at International Immunology Online). Peripheral blood monocyte-derived DCs cultured in GM-CSF and IL-4 are likely to express ALDH1A2 as well, but may lose it with an extended culture without GM-CSF. DCs generated with GM-CSF and IL-4 are widely used for research or therapeutic purposes. Our results suggest that these cells express ALDH1A2 immediately after the generation.</p><p>Beta-c deficiency caused marked reductions in the ALDHact in MLN-DCs and the T cell number in LP. Beta-c is a common component of receptors of GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-5, but only GM-CSF induced ALDH1A2 expression in wt DCs. In IL-5 receptor-deficient mice, there were normal numbers of IL-4-, IL-5- or IL-6-producing cells in LP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>), implying that IL-5 signals may not be essential for the T-cell distribution in LP. IL-3 signals can be transduced through an alternative IL-3 receptor &#x003b2; in the absence of Beta-c in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). Therefore, the above-mentioned reductions in Beta-c-deficient mice are likely to be due to the lack of GM-CSF-dependent signals. However, the reductions were not as severe as those observed in vitamin A-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). The GM-CSF-dependent signals might be partly compensated by IL-4, IL-13, TLR ligands or other unknown stimuli. Accordingly, it has been recently shown that IL-4 enhanced the <italic>Aldh1a2</italic> expression in MLN-DCs and that T cells stimulated with MLN-DCs from IL-4R&#x003b1;-deficient mice exhibited lower CCR9 expression than T cells stimulated with wt MLN-DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). Although IL-4/IL-13-dependent signals were dispensable for the ALDH1A2 expression in DCs, they might be produced and contribute to the expression, especially during immune responses in the presence of RA and TLR-mediated signals in the gut.</p><p>Myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) is a central adaptor shared by almost all TLRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>), but the numbers of intra-epithelial lymphocytes and LP lymphocytes are comparable between wt and MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> intestines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>). It remains to be solved if TLR-mediated signals are essential for the ALDH1A2 expression since TIR domain containing adaptor-inducing IFN-&#x003b2;-dependent pathways could be contributing to the signals in these mice. Nonetheless, any combinations of two from GM-CSF, IL-4 and a TLR ligand synergistically induced both <italic>Aldh1a2</italic> expression and ALDHact in BM-DCs. Three of them further strongly induced the expression and activity. Their ALDHact was comparable to that found in ALDHact<sup>high</sup> MLN-DCs. Accordingly, it was recently reported that the <italic>Aldh1a2</italic> expression in CD11c<sup>high</sup>CD11b<sup>high</sup> LP-DCs was enhanced upon TLR5-mediated stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Since ALDH1A2<sup>+</sup> MLN-DCs were mature CD86<sup>high</sup> DCs, maturation of DCs is likely to be required for inducing the high levels of ALDH1A2 expression. Indeed, TLR-mediated signals also induced maturation of BM-DCs in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A and B</xref>). On the other hand, most SPL-DCs became CD86<sup>+</sup> cells after 24 h of culture even without TLR-mediated stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3E</xref>). Accordingly, neither TLR-mediated signals nor IL-4 were required for inducing high levels of ALDHact in SPL-DCs in the presence of GM-CSF. Indeed, depending on the ALDHact, SPL-DCs treated with GM-CSF and/or IL-4 without LPS significantly induced CCR9 expression on T cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://intimm.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dxp003/DC1">Supplementary Figure 2</ext-link> is available at International Immunology Online). However, the increase in &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;7 expression on T cells was moderate even when SPL-DCs were pretreated with both GM-CSF and IL-4. The pretreated SPL-DCs might also provide a factor or signal that interfered with the RA-induced &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;7 expression. Nonetheless, DEAB partly but significantly suppressed the &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;7 expression. The pretreated SPL-DCs also enhanced the differentiation of naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T cells but suppressed that to T<sub>h</sub>17, and these effects were canceled by DEAB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). Accordingly, <italic>in vivo</italic> administration of GM-CSF has been shown to induce anti-inflammatory DCs and Tregs and suppress autoimmune disorders, such as experimental autoimmune thyroiditis, type I diabetes and myasthenia gravis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>). The GM-CSF administration also decreased the severity of Crohn's diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>). These beneficial effects of GM-CSF might involve the ALDH1A-dependent mechanism. Interestingly, GM-CSF is also known as an inflammatory cytokine. It has recently been reported that GM-CSF was critical for IL-6 and IL-23 responses by DCs and thus critical for generation of T<sub>h</sub>17 cells <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>). Frequencies of IL-17-producing cells in the small intestinal LP of Beta-c<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were indeed lower than those of wt mice (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://intimm.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dxp003/DC1">Supplementary Figure 5</ext-link> is available at International Immunology Online), as found in immunized GM-CSF<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Various factors during antigen priming might affect the preferential development of T<sub>h</sub>17 or Treg. TGF-&#x003b2; is another example with dual functions for inducing the development of T<sub>h</sub>17 and Treg. RA itself might also have the dual functions depending on its concentration. A low concentration of RA was suggested to be required for T<sub>h</sub>17 development, although high concentrations of RA suppressed it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). After the T<sub>h</sub>17 development, T<sub>h</sub>17 cells may produce GM-CSF, which may then contribute to a feedback suppression of T<sub>h</sub>17 development by enhancing ALDH1A2 expression and RA production in DCs.</p><p>DEAB only partly inhibited the &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;7 expression induced by wt MLN-DCs as well, and the residual expression was equivalent to the &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;7 expression induced by Beta-c<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MLN-DCs in the presence or absence of DEAB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6B</xref>, right), suggesting that there are RA-dependent and RA-independent pathways to induce &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;7. On the other hand, the CCR9 expression induced by wt MLN-DCs or GM-CSF/IL-4-treated BM-DCs or SPL-DCs was almost completely inhibited by DEAB [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>, top and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6B</xref>, left and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://intimm.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dxp003/DC1">Supplementary Figure 3</ext-link>, left (available at International Immunology Online], indicating that <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of RA in these DCs was essential for the CCR9 expression and that there was little prestored RA pool, if any, in these DCs. Alternatively, the expression of CCR9 might require higher concentrations of RA than that of &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;7 and a low concentration of preformed RA in the DCs might only affect &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;7 expression.</p><p>Since IECs strongly express ALDH1A1 (RALDH1), they may produce RA from dietary vitamin A or blood-derived retinol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>) and may provide it to adjacent DCs. Hammerschmidt <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref>) have recently suggested that a small number of stromal cells in MLN expressed <italic>Aldh1a1</italic>, <italic>Aldh1a2</italic> and <italic>Aldh1a3</italic> and might contribute to imprinting gut-homing specificity on T cells in the presence of DCs . Although RA by itself only poorly induced <italic>Aldh1a2</italic> expression in DCs and moderately enhanced the GM-CSF and/or IL-4-induced expression of <italic>Aldh1a2</italic> in BM-DCs in our culture systems, the RAR antagonist LE540 significantly suppressed the GM-CSF-induced expression of <italic>Aldh1a2</italic> in BM-DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7C and D</xref>), suggesting that the GM-CSF-induced expression of ALDH1A2 may largely depend on an autocrine loop of RA generated from serum retinol in the culture. The stromal cells in MLN and IECs might provide the initial RA to DCs to acquire the GM-CSF responsiveness for the expression of ALDH1A2 in MLN and/or PP <italic>in vivo</italic>. Within the 3-kb region upstream of the murine <italic>Aldh1a2</italic> gene, there are multiple signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)-binding motifs and putative RAR-binding motifs, which may contribute to the synergistic effect by GM-CSF and RA. GM-CSF and RA synergistically induce several other genes in myeloid cells, involving Janus kinase (JAK) 2 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref>). Present results suggest that vitamin A is essential for both ALDH1A2 expression in MLN-DCs and GM-CSF expression in F4/80<sup>+</sup> non-DCs in MLN. It has been reported that RA stimulates BM stromal cells to produce GM-CSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref>). However, it remains to be solved if RA is involved in the induction of CD11c<sup>&#x02212;</sup>GM-CSF<sup>+</sup> cells or their migration to MLN.</p><p>Our previous experiments suggested that some PP-DCs expressed ALDH1A1 in B10.D2 mice that were maintained in a clean conventional animal facility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). In the same strain of mice kept in an SPF animal facility, however, <italic>Aldh1a1</italic> expression was not detected in PP-DCs. We detected low levels of <italic>Aldh1a1</italic> expression in SPL-DCs from BALB/c mice but not in those from B10.D2 mice (data not shown). Animal strains and/or the environment might affect ALDH1A1 expression in DCs. Since GM-CSF, IL-4, TLR ligands or RA did not induce ALDH1A1 expression in DCs, ALDH1A1 and ALDH1A2 differ in their induction mechanisms.</p><p>The present results collectively indicate that multiple factors in the intestinal microenvironment affect the expression of ALDH1A2 in DCs. Although it is still possible that yet-to-be-discovered factors might also contribute to the expression, GM-CSF appears to play a major role, and TLR ligands and RA may play supporting roles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>). In addition, IL-4 and/or IL-13 that can be produced during immune responses in the gut may also contribute to the ALDH1A2 expression. The results may also suggest a possibility that local immune responses involving the production of GM-CSF and/or IL-4 or exposure to TLR ligands might affect ALDH1A2 expression in local DCs even in non-intestinal tissues, although the lack of RA or unknown inhibitory factors might limit the expression. RA regulates not only the homing specificity of lymphocytes but also the differentiation of Treg and T<sub>h</sub>17 and is thus likely to control gut immunity and oral tolerance. Therefore, the induction of ALDH1A2 expression in intestinal DCs is critical for the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses, and it might be a new target for drug discovery.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Fig. 9.</label><caption><p>Proposed model for the mechanism of GM-CSF-mediated induction of RA-producing DCs in the intestinal tissues. GM-CSF plays a critical role to induce the ALDH1A2 expression in DCs. In the intestinal tissues, CD11c<sup>&#x02212;</sup>F4/80<sup>+</sup> cells (i.e. macrophages or granulocytes) produce GM-CSF, which induces the ALDH1A2 expression in DCs. DC maturation signals induced by intestinal stimuli including TLR ligands from intestinal bacterial flora enhance the ALDH1A2 expression. The ALDH1A2<sup>+</sup> DCs produce RA and imprint gut-homing specificity on T cells upon antigenic stimulation. These DCs also promote the differentiation of naive T cells to Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells in the presence of TGF-&#x003b2;. RA is required not only for the GM-CSF-induced expression of ALDH1A2 in DCs but also for the GM-CSF production by CD11c<sup>&#x02212;</sup>F4/80<sup>+</sup> cells or their proper migration. Thus, ALDH1A2<sup>+</sup> DCs as well as ALDH1A1<sup>+</sup> IECs may provide RA to DCs and CD11c<sup>&#x02212;</sup>F4/80<sup>+</sup> cells and enhance the positive feedback loop for RA production in the intestine.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="intimmdxp003f09_4c"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Supplementary data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri"
