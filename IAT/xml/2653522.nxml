For therapeutic purposes, lung cancer is generally divided into small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) or non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Approximately 80% of lung cancer cases are classified as NSCLC, and adenocarcinoma is now the most common form of NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Despite recent advances in chemotherapy, lung adenocarcinoma remains incurable. The effectiveness of chemotherapeutic agents is often limited by the side effects and resistance of drug treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. It is of paramount importance to discover novel agents with less severe side effects and drug-resistance.</p><p>Dihydroartemisinin (DHA), a semi-synthetic derivative of artemisinin, isolated from the traditional Chinese herb <italic>Artemisia annua</italic>, is recommended as a first-line anti-malarial drug with low toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In recent years, certain artemisinin derivatives are shown to inhibit the growth of a limited set of human cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], such as leukemia cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], fibrosarcoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], ovarian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], breast cancer cells and cervical cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Moreover, Jiao Y et al also demonstrated that DHA was the most effective and potent agent in inhibiting cell growth of ovarian cancer cells compared with artemisinin, artesunate, arteether, artemether and arteannuin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Apoptosis, a kind of cell death, causes specific morphological changes and DNA fragmentation that are considered as the major cytopathologic hallmarks of the apoptotic process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Most commonly, two major apoptosis pathways have been identified: the death receptor pathway and the mitochondrial pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Mitochondrial dysfunction, in particular the induction of the inner mitochondrial membrane potential (&#x00394;&#x003a8;<sub>m</sub>) depolarization, has been implicated in the cascade of events involved in the induction of apoptosis during mitochondrial pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Apoptosis signal transduction and execution require the action of the caspases cascade and human caspase-1 to -10 have been described that activation of caspases cascade is involved in chemicals- and agents-induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Caspase-3 has been shown to be a key component involved in the underlying mechanisms of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and the activation of caspase-3 is considered to be the final step in many apoptosis pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Although it has been found that DHA can induce apoptosis in various tumor cells, its molecular mechanisms remain unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. It has been reported that DHA-induced apoptosis might be implicated in the activation of caspases in HL-60 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], but little attention had been paid to the molecular mechanism of DHA-induced tumor cells apoptosis in living cells.</p><p>Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) technique has been widely used to study protein-protein interaction and pattern of endogenous caspase-3 activation in living cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Miura et al constructed a SCAT3 plasmid, a GFPs-based FRET probe, to monitor dynamics of caspase-3 activation in single living cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The SCAT3 consists of a donor (enhanced cyan fluorescent protein, ECFP), an acceptor (Venus, a mutant of yellow fluorescent protein) and a linking sequence containing DEVD, the caspase-3 cleavage substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The activation of caspase-3 leads to the cleavage of the linker, and significantly reduces the efficiency of FRET of SCAT3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>In our study, we treated human lung adenocarcinoma (ASTC-a-1) cells with DHA <italic>in vitro </italic>and evaluated its cytotoxic effects with cell viability, cell morphology, induction of apoptosis, determination of mitochondrial size and monitoring of &#x00394;&#x003a8;<sub>m </sub>changes. In addition to conventional methods, FRET technique and fluorescence emission spectral analysis in living cells were used for the first time to determine DHA-induced caspase-3 activation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of DHA on the anti-proliferation and apoptosis of the ASTC-a-1 cells and to explore its molecular mechanism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Dihydroartemisinin was obtained from Bide Pharmaceutical Corporation (Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China).

All the quantitative analysis of the fluorescence images was performed by Zeiss Rel3.2 image processing software (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). For time-lapse imaging, culture dishes were mounted onto the microscope stage equipped with a temperature-controlled chamber (Zeiss, Jena, Germany).</p><p>According to the FRET technology, acceptor photobleaching in single living cell was used to monitor the effect of DHA on the caspase-3 activation. ASTC-a-1 cells stably expressing SCAT3 were cultured in coverslip of a 35 mm chamber after a treatment of DHA for 48 h. The acceptor photobleaching of SCAT3 was performed with the highest intensity of 514 nm laser on a confocal microscope.

The emission spectra of the SCAT3 were detected in living cells after the addition of DHA and STS by auto microplate reader (infinite M200, Tecan, Austria). In the meantime, we also needed to detect the emission spectra of the empty cells that were not transfected and considered them as the background emission spectra. The step length of the scanning spectra is 2 nm. The excitation wavelength of SCAT3 was 409&#x02013;427 nm and the emission fluorescence channel was 454&#x02013;600 nm band-pass.</p></sec><sec><title>Fluorometric assay for Caspase-3 activity</title><p>For the detection of caspase-3 activity, PBS-washed cell pellets (derive from either the medium or the adherent cells) were resuspended in extract buffer [25 mM HEPES (pH7.4), 0.1% TritonX-l00, 10% glycerol, 5 mM DTT, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml pepstatin, and 10 mg/ml Leupeptin] and vortexed vigorously. 20 &#x003bc;l of extract (corresponding to 10% of the sample) were incubated with the caspase-3 fluorogenic substrates Ac-DEVD-AFC at 100 &#x003bc;M final concentration at room temperature, and caspase-3 activity was measured continuously by monitoring the release of fluorigenic AFC at 37&#x000b0;C.

No toxicity has been reported with oral administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Although it has been reported that artemisinin inhibits cell proliferation in many types of cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], it is still not known whether artemisinin and its derivatives work as growth inhibitors in ASTC-a-1 cells. Endoperoxide function is at least in part responsible for the growth inhibitory activity of artemisinins, since the reduction to an ether bond greatly reduces cytotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Other reports, however, pointed out that the endoperoxide was not absolutely necessary for the effects against tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Our results in this study suggested that DHA effectively exerted cytotoxcity on ASTC-a-1 cells even at a very low dose. Furthermore, the presence of DHA inhibited the growth of ASTC-a-1 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. Hoechst33258 and PI staining as well as flow cytometry analysis showed that DHA significantly induced apoptosis of ASTC-a-1 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The concentration of DHA used in our study was below its clinical dosage, which was usually used for treating of malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>It has been reported that mitochondria play a crucial role in the apoptotic process. Mitochondrial dysfunctions including the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (&#x00394;&#x003a8;<sub>m</sub>), permeability transition, and release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrion into the cytosol are associated with apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Opening of permeability transition pores (PTP) in the mitochondrial inner membrane causes the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) and leads to mitochondrial swelling, membrane depolarization, and release of intramitochondrial solutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. As we known, the mitochondrial transversal section (width) is the most constant dimension of organelle and variations on this parameter reflects an alteration of the morphology of mitochondria. Here, we determined the alteration of mitochondrial morphology and found an obvious dismantling of the mitochondrial network and mitochondrial swelling induced by DHA treatment for indicated times (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, we measured alteration of &#x00394;&#x003a8;<sub>m </sub>in DHA-treated ASTC-a-1 cells. In this study, the loss of &#x00394;&#x003a8;<sub>m </sub>in response to the loss of fluorescence intensity was visualized in DHA-treated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8a</xref>). Interestingly, as observed in some cells, DHA triggered a rapid loss of &#x00394;&#x003a8;<sub>m </sub>within 15 min following a sudden increase within 5 min (data not shown). Santamar&#x000ed;a et al found that the early increase in TMRM<sup>+ </sup>fluorescence after STS addition may be due to a true increase in &#x00394;&#x003a8;<sub>m </sub>or to the apparent increase in mitochondrial volume, while the increase in &#x00394;&#x003a8;<sub>m </sub>was abrogated by oligomycin, an inhibitor of the H<sup>+</sup>-ATP synthase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. They also suggested that H<sup>+</sup>-ATP synthase maintained high &#x00394;&#x003a8;<sub>m </sub>induced by STS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. H<sup>+</sup>-ATP synthase may involve in the rapid increase of fluorescence intensity before loss of &#x00394;&#x003a8;<sub>m </sub>induced by DHA treatment. Moreover, the loss of &#x00394;&#x003a8;<sub>m </sub>in DHA-treated cells was further investigated through flow cytometry analysis (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8d</xref>).</p><p>In some cell lines, caspase-3 plays a direct role in proteolytic cleavage of cellular proteins responsible for progression to apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The activation of caspase-3 induces PARP cleavage, chromosomal DNA break and finally the occurrence of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Incubation of ASTC-a-1 cells with Z-VAD.fmk in addition to DHA significantly reduces the cell growth inhibition effect of DHA compared with DHA alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>), indicating that caspase cascades were involved in the apoptotic cell death induced by DHA. We used FRET acceptor photobleaching and emission spectral analysis techniques to monitor the DHA-induced caspase-3 activation in living cells.</p><p>The results from Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> showed that Z-VAD.fmk attenuated the activation of caspase-3 in DHA-treated ASTC-a-1 cells, demonstrating that caspase-3 activation is a key mechanism of DHA-induced apoptosis which was confirmed by caspase-3 activity and western blotting analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). DHA initiates activation of caspase and in turn leads to apoptotic cell death. Although the mechanism by which DHA activates caspases on ASTC-a-1 cells remains unclear, these results provide a correlation between caspase-3 activity and DHA-induced apoptosis, and deserve to be further pursued.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, DHA was found to have a potent ability in influencing ASTC-a-1 cells behavior. These results show for the first time that DHA can inhibit the proliferation and induce dose- and time-dependent apoptosis via caspase-3-dependent mitochondrial pathway in ASTC-a-1 cells. Furthermore, our data provides evidence of potential implications for the rational application of DHA as a novel potential anticancer drug against human lung adenocarcinoma, although much work is needed before DHA can be fully utilized in clinical treatments.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>SCLC: Small-cell lung cancer; NSCLC: Non-small-cell lung cancer; DHA: Dihydroartemisinin; PI: Propidium iodide; &#x00394;&#x003a8;<sub>m</sub>: Mitochondrial membrane potential; Rho123: Rhodamine123; FRET: Fluorescence resonance energy transfer; ECFP: Enhanced cyan fluorescent protein; Venus: A mutant of yellow fluorescent protein; CCK-8: Cell Counting Kit.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>YYL carried out all experiments, participated in all the statistical analysis and drafted the manuscript.
