By studying the regulation of the concentration-sensitive <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> Hox gene <italic>Ultrabithorax</italic> (<italic>Ubx</italic>), we found that <italic>Ubx</italic> enhancer activities respond to both increases in Ubx levels and genetic background. Large, transient increases in Ubx levels are capable of silencing all enhancer input into <italic>Ubx</italic> transcription, resulting in the complete silencing of this gene. Small increases in Ubx levels, brought about by duplications of the <italic>Ubx</italic> locus, cause sporadic silencing of subsets of <italic>Ubx</italic> enhancers. <italic>Ubx</italic> enhancer silencing can also be induced by outcrossing laboratory stocks to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> strains established from wild flies from around the world. These results suggest that enhancer activities are not rigidly determined, but instead are sensitive to genetic background. Together, these findings suggest that enhancer silencing may be used to maintain gene product levels within the correct range in response to natural genetic variation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Gene expression is generally governed by <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements, also called enhancers. For genes whose expression levels must be tightly controlled, enhancer activities must be tightly regulated. In this work, we show that enhancers that control the expression of the Hox gene <italic>Ultrabithorax</italic> (<italic>Ubx</italic>) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> are regulated by a negative autoregulatory feedback mechanism. Negative autoregulation can be triggered by less than a two-fold increase in <italic>Ubx</italic> levels or by varying the genetic background. Together, these data reveal that enhancer activities are not always hardwired, but instead may be sensitive to genetic and environmental variation and, in some cases, to the amount of gene product they regulate.

A third dimension of gene regulation is quantity, which is especially relevant for genes that must be expressed within a narrow range of levels. One possible solution is that enhancers are precisely tuned to generate the appropriate level of transcription that is required in each cell. However, the precision that this type of mechanism demands seems difficult to achieve and especially vulnerable to genetic, environmental, and developmental noise. An alternative solution is that feedback or other regulatory mechanisms exist that modulate enhancer activities in response to the levels of gene product. Although feedback autoregulation is a well-known motif in transcriptional networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000633-Alon1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, mechanisms that might be used to tune expression levels are not well understood. This problem is particularly challenging for genes that have multiple, partially redundant regulatory inputs.</p><p>We have begun to study this problem in the fruit fly, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, by analyzing the mechanisms that control the expression of the Hox gene <italic>Ultrabithorax</italic> (<italic>Ubx</italic>) in the haltere&#x02013;a dorsal appendage on the third thoracic segment (T3) that helps the fly balance during flight <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000633-Dickinson1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.

These findings suggest that Ubx protein, and not <italic>Ubx</italic> mRNA, is responsible for the induction of silencing.

Taken together, these results allow us to make three important conclusions. First, silencing is occurring at the level of <italic>Ubx</italic> enhancers, not entire <italic>Ubx</italic> alleles, because different <italic>Ubx</italic> enhancer traps respond in different ways. Second, silencing can be triggered by the presence of only one or two additional <italic>Ubx&#x0002b;</italic> loci, suggesting that less than doubling <italic>Ubx</italic> levels is sufficient to silence some enhancers. Third, although all <italic>Ubx</italic> enhancers can be silenced by high Ubx levels, lower Ubx levels result in a range of responses that depend on which enhancer trap, and therefore which subset of <italic>Ubx</italic> enhancers, is being monitored. Thus, we conclude that different <italic>Ubx</italic> enhancers are sensitive to different levels of Ubx protein. We also generated flies to monitor two different enhancer trap insertions into the <italic>Ubx</italic> locus (<italic>Ubx-lacZ<sup>166</sup></italic> and <italic>Ubx-Gal4<sup>lac1</sup></italic>) at the same time. When silencing was triggered by heat shock-induced <italic>Ubx</italic>, we observed silencing of both enhancer traps, but at different frequencies: <italic>Ubx-Gal4<sup>lac1</sup></italic> was silenced to a greater extent than <italic>Ubx-lacZ<sup>166</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000633.s003">Figure S3</xref>). This finding provides additional support for the idea that individual enhancer traps, and thus different subsets of <italic>Ubx</italic> enhancers, respond differently to the same increase in Ubx levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Haltere size and Ubx levels are buffered in response to increased <italic>Ubx&#x0002b;</italic> copy number</title><p>The above results show that epigenetic autoregulatory silencing of <italic>Ubx</italic> enhancers occurs in response to elevated Ubx levels.

The thick black bars correspond to averages and the thinner bars show the standard error of the mean. For each cross, a minimum of 10 haltere discs, from 10 different animals, were scored. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) shows that the differences among the five wild type genotypes (NC2-80, NC2-76, Ber2, Tw2 and Harwich) in &#x00025; silencing were highly significant (t ratio&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;9.4, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.0007) with 83&#x00025; of the variance among lines, and no differences between replicates.

In support of this idea, when <italic>Ubx-Gal4<sup>lac1</sup></italic> was further introgressed into weakly or strongly silencing wild stocks, which effectively increases the genetic complement from the wild strain background, an increase in the severity of silencing was observed when compared to the F1 generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000633-g006">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000633.s005">Figure S5</xref>). We also never observed the complete absence of Ubx protein or haltere-to-wing transformations in any of these outcrosses, arguing that only a subset of enhancer inputs into <italic>Ubx</italic> is silenced in response to genetic variation. Consistently, individual enhancer traps responded differently when crossed to the same wild strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000633.s006">Table S1</xref>).</p><p>Together, these results demonstrate that <italic>Ubx</italic> enhancer silencing is triggered when Ubx is present at higher than normal levels. When Ubx concentration is especially high (when Ubx is ectopically expressed via Gal4 or heat-shock promoters) all enhancer input into <italic>Ubx</italic> can be silenced, resulting in the complete absence of <italic>Ubx</italic> expression and haltere-to-wing transformations. Although such high levels of Ubx are not physiological, we also find that <italic>Ubx</italic> enhancer silencing can be triggered by additional copies of <italic>Ubx&#x0002b;</italic>, which in principle results in less than double the amount of Ubx protein. In this case, we find that the expression of some <italic>Ubx</italic> enhancer traps is clonally silenced (e.g. <italic>Ubx-Gal4<sup>lac1</sup></italic>), while the expression of other enhancer traps (e.g. <italic>Ubx-lacZ<sup>166</sup></italic>) is reduced. Thus, different <italic>Ubx</italic> enhancers are differentially sensitive to negative autoregulation; some are shut off by relatively low Ubx levels, while others require high Ubx levels to be silenced.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Enhancer silencing and natural genetic variation</title><p>Most remarkably, we found that enhancer silencing can occur simply by varying the genetic background.

Extrapolating from these results suggests that there is a lot of previously undetected variability in enhancer activities at the <italic>Ubx</italic> locus in wild files that would not have been detected using traditional assays. Thus, these results challenge the standard view that a given transcriptional enhancer integrates the same inputs and produces the same outputs, regardless of genetic background. Instead, due to natural genetic variation, the activity of a particular enhancer may vary widely between individuals in wild populations. Additionally, our results show that the activity of an enhancer can even vary among the cells within its expression domain (e.g. the haltere) in a single individual. We suggest that plasticity in enhancer activities is essential to compensate for genetic and perhaps environmental variation. Moreover, given that many genes may have multiple, partially redundant enhancers, enhancer silencing may be essential to buffer gene expression levels so that they remain within a narrow, biologically tolerable range. On the other hand, small differences in enhancer activities in flies in the wild may serve as a potential source of phenotypic variation that can be acted upon by natural selection. Since population genetic theory predicts that selection differentials of a small fraction of a percent are seen in natural populations with the effective population size of <italic>Drosophila</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000633-Aquadro1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, it is plausible that this variation is functionally significant, perhaps through a subtle influence of haltere morphology on flight performance.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Genetic variation experiments</title><p>The NC2 stocks were obtained from Greg Gibson (N.C.
