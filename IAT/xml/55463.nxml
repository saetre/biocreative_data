We identified a novel transcription factor, CREB-H, and found that its expression was restricted in the liver among 16 human tissues tested. A region of CREB-H exhibited significant homology to the basic leucine zipper (b-Zip) domain of members of the CREB&#x0002f;ATF family: mammalian LZIP and <italic>Drosophila</italic> BBF-2 that binds to box-B, a <italic>Drosophila</italic> enhancer modulating the fat-body-specific gene expression. CREB-H contained a hydrophobic region representing a putative transmembrane domain, like LZIP. Constructing a variety of CREB-H fusion proteins with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain disclosed that CREB-H functioned as a transcriptional activator and its N-terminal 149 amino acids accounted for the activation ability. Gel mobility sift assays revealed that CREB-H did not bind to the C&#x0002f;EBP, AP-1 and NF-&#x003ba;B elements but specifically bound to CRE and the box-B element. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that like BBF-2, CREB-H activated transcription via the box-B element and that a deletion of the putative transmembrane domain increased the activation of&#x000a0;reporter expression significantly. Furthermore, a fusion protein of GFP and full-length CREB-H was&#x000a0;localized in reticular structures surrounding the nucleus, whereas a fusion protein of GFP and a&#x000a0;deletion mutant lacking the putative transmembrane domain was mainly in the nucleus. These findings suggest that CREB-H plays an important role in&#x000a0;transcriptional regulation of genes specifically expressed in the liver, and that the putative transmembrane domain may be associated with modulation of its function as the transcriptional activator.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes id="N0x95da878.0x9a0b698" notes-type="data_link"><p>DDBJ&#x0002f;EMBL&#x0002f;GenBank accession no.

Several transcription factors regulating the tissue-specific expression are known to be expressed in a tissue-specific manner. For example, MyoD, a basic helix&#x02013;loop&#x02013;helix transcription factor specifically expressed in the muscle, regulates the expression of muscle-specific genes such as muscle creatine kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke332c1">1</xref>), myosin light chain 1&#x0002f;3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke332c2">2</xref>) and troponin C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke332c3">3</xref>) via the&#x000a0;E-box element within their promoters. On the other hand, C&#x0002f;EBP-&#x003b1;, a basic leucine zipper (b-Zip) protein, and HNF1, a POU domain protein, modulate gene expression of albumin, a typical liver-specific constituent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke332c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke332c6">6</xref>) in a synergistic manner. Although these transcription factors are more abundantly expressed in the liver than other organs, their expressions are not restricted to the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke332c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke332c8">8</xref>). Strictly tissue-specific transcription factors like MyoD have not been identified in the liver so far.</p><p> In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, a transcription factor regulating tissue-specific gene expression has been identified in the fat body, which is the functional counterpart of the mammalian liver. The transcription factor activates expression of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) gene via the box-B element in a fat-body-specific manner. Thus, this transcriptional activator was designated box-B binding factor-2 (BBF-2&#x0002f;dCREB-B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke332c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke332c10">10</xref>). BBF-2 belongs to the CREB&#x0002f;ATF family of the b-Zip protein and binds to not only the box-B element but also CRE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke332c9">9</xref>) and the box-B-like element identified within the promoters for mammalian liver-specific genes, ADH and tyrosine aminotransferase. However, mammalian transcription factors binding to the box-B and box-B-like elements have not yet been identified.</p><p> A mammalian member of the CREB&#x0002f;ATF family, which is homologous to BBF-2 and expressed ubiquitously in human tissues, has been identified and designated LZIP (Luman&#x0002f;CREB3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke332c11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke332c13">13</xref>). Although LZIP activates transcription through binding to CRE, it has not been assessed whether LZIP binds to the box-B-like element. Moreover, LZIP has been reported to associate with a liver-specific pathogen, hepatitis C virus (HCV); LZIP interacts with the HCV core protein and potentiates cellular transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke332c13">13</xref>). LZIP contains a hydrophobic region representing a putative transmembrane domain following to the b-Zip domain. A deletion of the putative transmembrane domain of LZIP alters its subcellular localization from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke332c14">14</xref>).</p><p> Here, we show a novel member of the CREB&#x0002f;ATF family, designated CREB-H, with a liver-specific expression. CREB-H contains a region highly related to the b-Zip domains of BBF-2 and LZIP and activates transcription through binding to the box-B element.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Plasmids</p><p>A plasmid, pME-CREB-H, expressing the CREB-H protein was isolated from full-length-enriched cDNA libraries described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke332c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke332c16">16</xref>) and contained 2586 bp of the full-length CREB-H cDNA in an SR&#x003b1;-driven expression vector, pME18S (GenBank accession no.

After induction with 1 mM IPTG for 2 h, bacteria were sonicated in a sonication buffer containing 50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA and 2 mM DDT.

We chose novel genes after homology search against GenBank and investigated expression profiles for individual clones by RT&#x02013;PCR, using total RNA extracted from human tissues. A clone showed the expression restricted in the liver among 16 human tissues tested (data not shown); at cycle 30 of RT&#x02013;PCR a robust band of a PCR product was detected specifically in the liver, whereas at cycle 35 of RT&#x02013;PCR, a faint band was observed in the intestine (data not shown). Next, we determined the entire nucleotide sequence of the clone. To obtain the full-length sequence of the cDNA, we screened a full-length enriched cDNA library and obtained four clones containing the sequence identical to that initially isolated. Among these clones, we selected the two longest cDNAs and determined their nucleotide sequence. These longest clones contained nearly identical sequences whose 5&#x02032; ends differed in 10 bases (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke332f2">2</xref>B). Subsequently, we set primers for PCR, based on the nucleotide sequence of the longest clone, and directly analyzed PCR products amplified from a normal liver cDNA library. Eventually, we compiled all the nucleotide sequences determined and obtained the full-length cDNA sequence for this novel gene. The entire nucleotide sequence of the novel cDNA that we identified indicates a 2.5 kb sequence (GenBank accession no. AB050902) that contains an ORF of 463 amino acid residues and Kozak consensus around the first ATG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke332c24">24</xref>). We designated the novel gene as CREB-H owing to the reason described below.</p><p> Homology search against protein databases revealed that the amino acid sequence of CREB-H contained a region extensively homologous to the b-Zip domain for three transcription factors belonging to the CREB&#x0002f;ATF family: <italic>Drosophila</italic> BBF-2, human LZIP and mouse OASIS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke332f1">1</xref>B). Amino acid similarities of the b-Zip domain between CREB-H and LZIP, OASIS and BBF-2 were 84, 69 and 71&#x00025;, respectively. In addition to the b-Zip domain, we noticed moderate homologies within regions surrounding the b-Zip domain between CREB-H and these transcription factors. On the other hand, as a structural difference that was unique to CREB-H, we noticed another leucine zipper motif in the C-terminal region following the b-Zip domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke332f1">1</xref>A), which consisted of three repeats of the &#x02018;LXNXTXX&#x02019; sequence. Moreover, we found the third feature for CREB-H by analyzing the amino acid sequence of CREB-H with PSORTII program (K.Nakai and P.Horton, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http:&#x0002f;&#x0002f;psort.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp&#x0002f;form2.html">http:&#x0002f;&#x0002f;psort.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp&#x0002f;form2.html</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke332c25">25</xref>); CREB-H also contained a hydrophobic stretch of 17 amino acids between the b-Zip domain and the other leucine zipper, which may potentially constitute a transmembrane domain as found in LZIP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke332f1">1</xref>A and B). As the fourth feature for CREB-H, we perceived a KDEL-like sequence, &#x02018;GDEL&#x02019; (amino acids 458&#x02013;461), which can behave as an ER-retrieval sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke332c26">26</xref>).</p><p> To uncover the exon&#x02013;intron organization of the novel gene that we identified, we searched GenBank genomic sequence database and retrieved the complete sequence of a cosmid (cosmid number, R33590; GenBank accession no. AC005620) which includes the entire CREB-H cDNA sequence. The CREB-H gene consisted of 10 exons spanning within a 19.4 kb region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke332f2">2</xref>A) mapped onto chromosome region 19p13.3 (GenBank accession no. NT&#x0005f;000904).</p></sec><sec><title>Live-specific expression of CREB-H</title><p>In the initial screening experiment with RT&#x02013;PCR, we observed the liver-specific expression of CREB-H using 16 human tissues. To confirm this observation, we performed northern blotting analysis with the 16 human tissues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke332f3">3</xref>). As a probe, we chose a 708 bp fragment in the 5&#x02032; region of the initially isolated CREB-H cDNA, which did not include the b-Zip domain, to avoid cross hybridization with other members of the CREB&#x0002f;ATF family. A 2.5 kb band of the CREB-H mRNA was exclusively detectable in the liver. Though we observed a faint expression of CREB-H in the intestine by extended RT&#x02013;PCR, we detected no hybridized signal from the intestine even after an extensive overexposure (data not shown). This tissue-specific expression of CREB-H substantially differs from those of LZIP and OASIS ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke332c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke332c27">27</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Transcriptional activity of CREB-H fusion proteins with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain</title><p>Some members of the CREB&#x0002f;ATF family activate transcription and others repress expression of their target genes. To determine whether CREB-H is a transcription activator or not, we constructed plasmids expressing GAL4&#x02013;CREB-H fusion proteins and co-transfected with a luciferase-reporter plasmid containing the GAL4 DNA-binding element into COS7 cells. We evaluated expression of these fusion proteins by western blotting and confirmed that they were expressed at similar levels (data not shown). The transfected full-length CREB-H cDNA fused to GAL4 activated the reporter expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke332f4">4</xref>), indicating that the full-length CREB-H cDNA contains a transcriptional activation domain. To determine localization of the activation domain within CREB-H, we constructed a variety of deletion mutants of CREB-H fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and co-transfected with the luciferase-reporter plasmid. GAL4&#x02013;CREB-H fusion constructs lacking the C-terminal regions (designated D1, D2, D3, D4 and D5 in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke332f4">4</xref>) could activate the reporter expression, whereas constructs lacking the N-terminal regions (D6 and D7) lost that ability. The minimum region responsible for the activation ability was localized within D5 (amino acids 1&#x02013;141). In this region, the CREB-H protein contained a proline-rich stretch, consistent with the finding that transcriptional activation domains of many transcription factors contain proline-rich sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke332c28">28</xref>). Interestingly, the deletion mutants lacking the putative transmembrane domain (D2, D3, D4 and D5) showed activation abilities greater than the full-length (FL) and D1 constructs containing the putative transmembrane domain. These results suggest that the putative transmembrane domain may be associated with modulation of the CREB-H function as the transcriptional activator.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA-binding ability of CREB-H</title><p>The CREB&#x0002f;ATF family protein specifically binds to the CRE consensus sequence, TGACGTCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke332c20">20</xref>). To determine whether CREB-H can bind to the CRE sequence, we performed gel-shift assays. We constructed a fusion protein of GST and CREB-H lacking the putative transmembrane domain. The GST&#x02013;CREB-H fusion protein was produced in bacteria and purified by glutathione&#x02013;Sepharose 4B. Using the fusion protein, we examined binding ability of CREB-H to CRE and other major transcription factor-binding elements, including AP1, C&#x0002f;EBP and NF-&#x003ba;B. The GST&#x02013;CREB-H fusion protein formed a complex with the CRE sequence but did not develop any detectable complex with the C&#x0002f;EBP, AP1 and NF-&#x003ba;B elements (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke332f5">5</xref>). BBF-2, which is highly homologous to CREB-H around the b-Zip region, bound to the box-B element previously identified within the promoter for genes specifically expressed in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat-body. We assessed whether CREB-H binds to the box-B element preferentially. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke332f5">5</xref> shows that like BBF-2, CREB-H also bound to the box-B element specifically. The shifted bands with the CRE and the box-B element were competed out by 5- and 50-fold excesses of non-labeled oligonucleotides, respectively. We also constructed a fusion protein with full-length CREB-H and eventually obtained results essentially comparable with those with the mutant CREB-H lacking the putative transmembrane domain (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Transcriptional activity of CREB-H through the box-B element</title><p>BBF-2 can activate transcription of a CAT reporter directly through the box-B element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke332c9">9</xref>). To assess whether CREB-H activates transcription through the box-B element directly, we co-transfected a full-length CREB-H-expressing plasmid and a luciferase-reporter construct containing the box-B element into COS7 cells. The co-transfection of the full-length CREB-H-expressing construct with box-B-containing reporter plasmid activated the reporter expression by 39-fold relative to a control plasmid (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke332f6">6</xref>).</p><p> As mentioned above, the GAL4 fusion construct lacking the&#x000a0;putative transmembrane domain activated the reporter expression significantly when compared to the full-length CREB-H construct (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke332f4">4</xref>), indicating that a deletion of the&#x000a0;putative transmembrane domain of CREB-H enhanced its transcriptional activity in a transient assay <italic>in vitro</italic>. To confirm the results of the GAL4 fusion experiment, we evaluated the effect of the deletion of the putative transmembrane domain using a box-B-containing reporter plasmid. The co-transfection of the CREB-H construct lacking the putative transmembrane domain with the reporter plasmid containing the box-B element activated the luciferase expression by 124-fold (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke332f6">6</xref>), confirming the enhancing effect of the deletion on the transcriptional activation ability of CREB-H.</p></sec><sec><title>Subcellular localization of GFP&#x02013;CREB-H fusion proteins</title><p>To investigate the subcellular localization of CREB-H, we constructed fusion proteins of GFP and of full-length CREB-H or a deletion mutant lacking the transmembrane domain. We transfected the constructs to COS7 cells and investigated the subcellular localization of fluorescent signal of GFP. The cells were stained by DAPI for visualization of the nucleus 24 h after transfection. The signal of the fusion protein of GFP and the full-length construct of CREB-H was detected in reticular structures surrounding the nucleus, which probably corresponded to the ER (CREBH-FL in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke332f7">7</xref>). On the other hand, the fusion protein of GFP and the CREB-H mutant lacking the putative transmembrane domain was detected mainly in the nucleus (CREBH-delTM in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke332f7">7</xref>). In cells transfected with a control vector expressing only GFP, the signal was observed all over the cell, including the nucleus and the cytoplasm (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Identification of a novel transcription factor</title><p>In this study, we have identified a novel gene whose product functioned as a transcriptional activator in transient transfection assays <italic>in vitro</italic>. A homology search disclosed that the novel gene product contained a characteristic region that exhibited extensive similarity to transcription factors belonging to the&#x000a0;CREB&#x0002f;ATF family. An <italic>in vitro</italic> binding analysis with transcription regulatory elements revealed that the novel gene product bound to CRE, consistent with the activity that the novel gene exhibited towards the CREB&#x0002f;ATF family genes. Moreover, we have demonstrated that the novel gene was expressed in a liver-specific manner among the 16 tissues tested. Based on these structural and functional characteristics, we propose that the novel gene encodes a transcription factor belonging to the CREB&#x0002f;ATF family with a liver-specific expression and designated CREB-H (CRE-binding and hepatocyte-specific factor).</p></sec><sec><title>CREB-H and its homologs, BBF-2, LZIP and OASIS</title><p>Although all members of the CREB&#x0002f;ATF family share structural similarity in their b-Zip domains, some members exhibit additional similarity within other regions and can be grouped into several subfamilies. For example, ATF1, CREB and CREM are grouped into an individual subfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke332c29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke332c31">31</xref>). Our results demonstrate that CREB-H exhibits homology in the b-Zip domain especially to LZIP and OASIS and that between CREB-H and these transcription factors, regions surrounding the b-Zip domain also manifest homology to one another. This suggests that they may be classified into the identical subfamily of the CREB&#x0002f;ATF family.</p><p> The b-Zip transcription factor forms a homo- or heterodimer via the leucine zipper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke332c5">5</xref>). The heterodimer formation in a different combination between distinct b-Zip factors results in yielding a distinguishable function in the transcriptional regulation. The affinity of the heterodimer formation depends on the structural similarity of the b-Zip domain. For example, CREB and CREM can form a heterodimer, and their leucine zipper domains display significant similarity to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke332c31">31</xref>). Since CREB-H, LZIP and OASIS showed the extensive similarity in the b-Zip domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke332f1">1</xref>B), they may potentially form heterodimers between them and function cooperatively.</p><p> Though CREB-H, LZIP and OASIS demonstrated the sequence similarity of the b-Zip domain, they also exhibited structural differences outside the b-Zip domain. We noticed another leucine zipper motif in the C-terminal region following the b-Zip domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke332f1">1</xref>A) in CREB-H, which consisted of three repeats of the &#x02018;LXNXTXX&#x02019; sequence. We did not find this feature in LZIP and other members of the CREB&#x0002f;ATF family. As the leucine zipper is frequently present within functional domains associated with protein&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke332c32">32</xref>), the second leucine zipper domain of CREB-H might interact with other proteins. In contrast, LZIP possesses the D&#x0002f;EHXY motif to associate with host cell factor which is known to interact with herpes simplex virus transactivator, VP16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke332c33">33</xref>). CREB-H did not include the D&#x0002f;EHXY motif.</p></sec><sec><title>A model for modulation of the CREB-H function</title><p>ATF6, a member of the CREB&#x0002f;ATF family, contains a transmembrane domain following to the b-Zip domain and is anchored in the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke332c34">34</xref>). The ER stress response caused by exogenous stimuli such as tunicamycin treatment induces proteolysis in the anchored ATF6 protein, resulting in translocation of ATF6 released from the ER into the nucleus. An ATF6 construct lacking the transmembrane domain enhances the activation ability significantly compared to the full-length ATF6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke332c35">35</xref>). LZIP also contains a putative transmembrane domain following the b-Zip domain and exhibits similar translocation from the ER to the nucleus after a deletion of the putative transmembrane domain, although the effect of the deletion on the transcriptional activation of LZIP has not been assessed yet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke332c14">14</xref>). We showed that CREB-H contained a putative transmembrane domain and that a deletion of the putative transmembrane domain of CREB-H enhanced the activation ability in transient assays as shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke332f4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke332f6">6</xref>. Furthermore, we also showed that a fusion protein of GFP and CREB-H was localized in reticular structures surrounding the nucleus and that a deletion of the putative transmembrane domain altered the subcellular localization to the nucleus. Based on these findings, we propose the following model for modulation of the transcriptional activation of CREB-H: first, CREB-H would localize in the ER by anchoring through the putative transmembrane domain; second, a proteolytic reaction between the b-Zip domain and the putative transmembrane domain would proceed and release the anchored CREB-H protein; and third, the released protein should be translocated to the nucleus and involved in the transcriptional activation. Finally, our finding that CREB-H contained the ER-retrieval signal in the C-terminus might support the idea that CREB-H can be localized to the ER in its full-length form.</p></sec><sec><title>CREB-H is a liver-specific transcription activator</title><p>We have shown that CREB-H directly activated the expression of the luciferase reporter gene through the box-B element in transient assays. The box-B element was initially identified within the promoter for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ADH gene and acts as an enhancer specific to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat-body, which is the counterpart of the mammalian liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke332c19">19</xref>). The box-B-like element was also identified within the promoter for the human ADH gene expressed in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke332c9">9</xref>). Though <italic>Drosophila</italic> BBF-2 binds to the box-B-like element within the human ADH promoter, a mammalian factor binding to this element has not yet been identified. Thus, we would nominate CREB-H as the first candidate for a transcription factor binding to the box-B and box-B-like elements with a liver-specific expression. It is likely to assume that CREB-H may regulate the liver-dominant expression of ADH through the box-B-like element and that CREB-H may be involved in regulation of expression of other liver-specific genes via the box-B-like or unknown elements within their promoters.</p><p> Recently, LZIP was reported to interact with the HCV core protein and be involved in cellular transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke332c13">13</xref>). Besides, the HCV core protein can induce hepatocellular carcinoma in transgenic mice, whereas other components of HCV cannot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke332c36">36</xref>). Because of the structural similarity between LZIP and CREB-H, it is predictable that CREB-H potentially interacts with the HCV core protein. Moreover, it may be possible to infer that CREB-H with the liver-specific expression plays a role in pathogenesis of hepatitis C and subsequent hepatocellular carcinoma by interacting with the HCV core protein rather than LZIP with the ubiquitous expression.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gke332f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> (<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagrams of CREB-H, LZIP and OASIS.
