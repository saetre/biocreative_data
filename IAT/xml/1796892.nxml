Extensive studies on some of these neighboring genes, in particular homologous gene pairs, have shown that these genes are often co-expressed in a symmetric manner and regulated by a shared promoter region. Here we report the identification of two non-homologous brain disease-related genes, with one coding for a serine protease inhibitor (<italic>SERPINI1</italic>) and the other for a programmed cell death-related gene (<italic>PDCD10</italic>), being tightly linked together by an asymmetric bidirectional promoter in an evolutionarily conserved fashion. This asymmetric bidirectional promoter, in cooperation with some cis-acting elements, is responsible for the co-regulation of the gene expression pattern as well as the tissue specificity of <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>and <italic>PDCD10</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>While <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>is predominantly expressed in normal brain and down-regulated in brain tumors, <italic>PDCD10 </italic>is ubiquitously expressed in all normal tissues but its gene transcription becomes aberrant in different types of cancers. By measuring the luciferase activity in various cell lysates, their 851-bp intergenic sequence was shown to be capable of driving the reporter gene expression in either direction. A 175-bp fragment from nt 1 to 175 in the vicinity of <italic>PDCD10 </italic>was further determined to function as a minimal bidirectional promoter. A critical regulatory fragment, from nt 176-473 outside the minimal promoter in the intergenic region, was identified to contain a strong repressive element for <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>and an enhancer for <italic>PDCD10</italic>. These cis-acting elements may exist to help coordinate the expression and regulation of the two flanking genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>For all non-homologous genes that have been described to be closely adjacent in the mammalian genomes, the intergenic region of the head-to-head <italic>PDCD10</italic>-<italic>SERPINI1 </italic>gene pair provides an interesting and informative example of a complex regulatory system that governs the expression of both genes not only through an asymmetric bidirectional promoter, but also through fine-tuned regulations with some cis-acting elements.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>In the human genome, there are over 550 genes coding for proteases with another 150 being protease inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. While the majority of protease genes belong to three different classes including serine, metallo- and cysteine proteases, a large portion (~25%) of human protease inhibitor genes belong solely to just one family: the serpin family.</p><p>The serpin family comprises hundreds of structurally homologous proteins that are present in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Its members include inhibitors of serine proteases as well as non-inhibitory members with other biological functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In humans, a total of 35 serpin-coding genes were identified and grouped into 9 subfamilies designated <italic>SERPINA</italic>, <italic>SERPINB</italic>, <italic>SERPINC </italic>and so on till <italic>SERPINI </italic>subfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Each subfamily has its own specific chromosomal localization and well-conserved exon-intron arrangement. For example, nearly all members of the <italic>SERPINA </italic>subfamily are located at chromosome 14q32 and genes coding for the <italic>SERPINB </italic>subfamily are clustered at two distinct chromosomal loci: 6p25 and 18q21 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Even for the last <italic>SERPINI </italic>subfamily, although consists of only two genes with one coding for a brain-associated protease inhibitor <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and another for a pancreas-specific protease inhibitor <italic>SERPINI2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], its two members are closely adjacent at chromosome 3q26 and share a perfectly conserved gene organization pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p><italic>SERPINI1</italic>, also known as neuroserpin or protease inhibitor 12, is an axonally secreted serine protease inhibitor found in the nervous systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. It functions as a selective inhibitor of tissue-type plasminogen activator and is involved in a wide range of neuronal processes including synaptic plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], neuronal migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and axogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Genetic variations of <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>have been reported to render the enzyme conformation locked as an inactive folding intermediate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. These mutant proteins then undergo spontaneous polymerization within neurons and cause a severe progressive neurodegenerative encephalopathy named FENIB (<underline>f</underline>amilial <underline>e</underline>ncephalopathy with <underline>n</underline>euroserpin <underline>i</underline>nclusion <underline>b</underline>odies) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In addition to the mutations at the DNA level, the mRNA expression of <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>was found to be down-regulated or lost in brain tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. These abnormalities, along with our latest findings that its adjacent gene <italic>SERPINI2 </italic>is also down-regulated in cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], prompted us to study the regulatory mechanism of <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>gene in both normal and cancerous brain tissues. Interestingly, when the human genome sequence became available, it came to our attention that a gene termed <italic>PDCD10 </italic>was mapped to lie at less than 1 kb upstream of <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>in a divergent, head-to-head orientation.</p><p><italic>PDCD10 </italic>was originally identified as <italic>TFAR15 </italic>(<underline>TF</underline>-1 cell <underline>a</underline>poptosis <underline>r</underline>elated gene-<underline>15</underline>) for being up-regulated after the induction of apoptosis by serum withdrawal in TF-1 human premyeloid cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. It was later grouped into a collection of genes thought to be involved in many apoptotic responses and thus renamed as <italic>PDCD10 </italic>(<underline>p</underline>rogramme<underline>d</underline>&#x000a0;<underline>c</underline>ell <underline>d</underline>eath <underline>10</underline> gene). <italic>PDCD10 </italic>is highly conserved among different species, with over 99% amino-acid identity among human, dog, mouse and chicken. Although its physiological role remains unclear, a recent study showed that inhibition of the nematode <italic>PDCD10 </italic>ortholog led to embryonic lethality in 40% of the embryos and a dumpy phenotype in postembryonic viable embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Furthermore, <italic>PDCD10 </italic>mutations were identified in families with cerebral cavernous malformation, indicating that this gene may play a role in the development of cerebral vascular morphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>It is known that in prokaryotic and lower eukaryotic genomes, genes are often organized in a proximal pattern to facilitate gene co-expression and functional coupling. Increasing evidence suggests that many genes in mammalian genomes also tend to be in close physical vicinity. Recently, by conducting a genome-wide analysis of the human genome, Trinklein and his colleagues identified a class of head-to-head gene pairs whose transcriptional start sites are separated by less than 1 kb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Since mammalian genomes are far more spacious than prokaryotic genomes, it seems unnecessary for two neighboring genes to be arranged in an adjacent head-to-head pattern unless they share a common regulatory system such as an intergenic bidirectional promoter. It is conceivable that bidirectional promoters of gene pairs may be able to co-regulate the genes in a more efficient manner. For example, for homologous gene pairs such as the pair of collagen type IV &#x003b1;1 and &#x003b1;2 genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and the pair of ATP-binding cassette molecule <italic>ABCG5 </italic>and <italic>ABCG8 </italic>genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], their bidirectional promoters were shown to co-regulate the two genes thus ensuring the co-expressivity of the gene products. For non-homologous genes like <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>and <italic>PDCD10</italic>, however, the need for co-regulation is not as obvious. In addition, compared to all the other genes that are adjacently located to any of known <italic>SERPIN </italic>or <italic>PDCD </italic>genes, only the pair of <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>and <italic>PDCD10 </italic>genes were arranged in a head-to-head orientation and separated by an exceptionally short intergenic region. This close chromosomal proximity of <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>and <italic>PDCD10 </italic>and their divergent configuration are widely preserved in many species, implying that through the evolution there appears to have a need for <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>and <italic>PDCD10 </italic>to be tightly linked together to maintain gene co-regulation or functional association.</p><p>In this study, we present evidence showing that while <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>is predominantly expressed in brain and down-regulated in brain tumors, <italic>PDCD10 </italic>is ubiquitously expressed in all normal tissues but its gene transcription becomes aberrant in different types of cancers. We have also identified a 175-bp regulatory fragment within the intergenic region of <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>and <italic>PDCD10 </italic>that functions as a bidirectional promoter. Moreover, a critical fragment, from nt 176-473 outside the minimal promoter in this intergenic region, was found to possess a strong repressive activity for <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>and enhancing activity for <italic>PDCD10</italic>. These cis-acting elements may exist to coordinate the expression and regulation of the two flanking genes. To the best of our knowledge, of all non-homologous genes that have been reported to be closely adjacent in the human genome, the intergenic region of the head-to-head <italic>PDCD10</italic>-<italic>SERPINI1 </italic>pair at 3q26 exhibits by far the most complex regulatory function that governs the expression of both genes not only through an asymmetric bidirectional promoter, but also through regulations with some other cis-acting elements.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Expression patterns of <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>and <italic>PDCD10 </italic>in normal and cancerous tissues</title><p>In order to explore the distribution patterns of <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>and <italic>PDCD10</italic>, we performed Northern blot analysis on a human multiple tissue expression array of poly A+ RNAs. As illustrated in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, while <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>expression was observed mainly in different parts of brain, hybridization of the same array with the <italic>PDCD10 </italic>probe revealed that it was ubiquitously expressed as a housekeeping gene in all tissues analyzed. Moreover, as <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>and <italic>SERPINI2 </italic>were both reported to be down-regulated during tumor development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], it is rational to doubt that the expression of <italic>PDCD10</italic>, which is located in between the two <italic>SERPINI </italic>genes at chromosome 3q26, may also be altered in some tumors. Results from the semi-quantitative RT-PCR indicate that while <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>expression was negatively correlated with tumor progression, the mRNA level of <italic>PDCD10 </italic>was not much affected in brain tumor cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Furthermore, when we investigated the expression patterns of <italic>PDCD10 </italic>in other normal and cancerous tissues, we found that <italic>PDCD10 </italic>was up-regulated in various cancers including ovarian, stomach, lung, uterus and small intestine cancers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of the distance of the intergenic region between human <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>and <italic>PDCD10 </italic>genes</title><p>After analyzing the distribution of mRNA transcripts for both <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>and <italic>PDCD10 </italic>genes, we then attempted to pinpoint their precise transcriptional start sites in order to determine the length of their intergenic spacer. As revealed by the human genome reference sequence, <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>[accession number EMBL:BC018043] and <italic>PDCD10 </italic>[accession number EMBL:AF022385] were mapped in a head-to-head configuration at 3q26 and separated by less than 1 kb. By performing 5'-RACE on human brain RNA, three transcriptional start sites for <italic>PDCD10 </italic>but only one transcriptional start site for <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>were identified. The closest transcriptional start site that we identified for <italic>PDCD10 </italic>and <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>were at 5 and 15 bp respectively upstream of the sites predicted by NCBI database, thus the shortest intergenic distance was recalculated to be 851 bp (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> &#x00026;&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Characterization of the asymmetric bidirectional promoter activity of the intergenic region</title><p>Following the mapping of the transcriptional start sites, the 851-bp intergenic fragment constituting the putative regulatory region for both <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>and <italic>PDCD10 </italic>genes was analyzed for its transcriptional activities by driving the firefly luciferase reporter gene. The human cell lines utilized for luciferase reporter assays include brain neuroglioma H4, brain glioblastoma U-87 MG, ovarian adenocarcinoma OVTW-59-4, lung adenocarcinoma CL1-5, and cervical adenocarcinoma HeLa cancer cell lines. The rat adrenal gland pheochromocytoma PC-12 cell line was also used for comparison as it had previously been chosen for the study of mouse <italic>Serpini1 </italic>promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The full-length 851-bp fragments in either direction toward <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>or <italic>PDCD10 </italic>were cloned into the reporter vector (pGL3-Basic). By measuring the luciferase activity in various cell lysates after transient transfection, the 851-bp intergenic sequence was shown to be capable of driving the reporter gene expression in either direction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The promoter activities in the direction of <italic>PDCD10 </italic>in all cells tested were approximately 4 to 10-fold higher than those of <italic>SERPINI1</italic>. Moreover, the promoter activities toward the <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>direction were higher in brain tumor H4 and U-87 MG cells than those in other test cells, and they were nearly 3-fold higher than the positive control, the viral SV40 minimal promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). These results indicate that the 851-bp intergenic region is able to function as a bidirectional promoter to control <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>and <italic>PDCD10 </italic>expressions, and some regulatory elements within this region may asymmetrically regulate the transcription of both genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Interspecies comparison of the 851-bp intergenic region and analysis of the putative cis-regulatory elements within this region</title><p>To understand whether the head-to-head configuration of <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>and <italic>PDCD10 </italic>is a unique feature only in human or if it is evolutionary conserved in other mammals, we aligned the homologous regions between these two genes among human, mouse and rat by the Vector NTI program (InforMax, Bethesda, MD, USA). The results revealed that both the gene order and the compact head-to-head arrangement are conserved in different species (data not shown), and that within the intergenic region there is an approximately 400-bp fragment near the vicinity of <italic>PDCD10 </italic>with the highest percent identity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Based on the nucleotide sequence shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, the 851-bp intergenic region has a GC content of 65%, which is much higher than the average of the entire human genome (41%). While no TATA-box is observed in this region, two CAAT boxes (consensus GG<sup>T</sup>/<sub>C</sub>CAATCT) are noted in the most conserved 400-bp fragment with a 100-bp distance from each other. In addition, within this highly conserved fragment, there are one neuron-specific AP-2, one c-Myc and one NF&#x003ba;B binding motives as well as several binding sites for the general transcription factor Sp1 as predicted by MatInspector (Genomatix; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genomatix.de"/>) and TFSEARCH programs (Computational Biology Research Center; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbrc.jp"/>). The presence and conservation of these putative binding motives suggest that some of these transcription factors must possess an important evolutionary significance and some yet-unknown regulatory demands.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of the key regulatory region of the bidirectional promoter by deletion analysis</title><p>To identify the key regulatory DNA sequences responsible for <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>and <italic>PDCD10 </italic>gene expressions, we constructed a series of plasmids containing various intergenic promoter regions derived from the 851-bp sequence. By using the same reporter system addressed in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, the luciferase activities of these constructs were assessed by transient transfection into H4 cells. Due to the neuron-specific expression of the <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>gene, the promoter activity of <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>in neuron cells is higher than those in cells from other tissues. Thus, H4 cells were used as a vehicle for studying the regulatory mechanism of <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>promoter. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, removal of the sequence from nt 1 to 175 completely abolished luciferase activity compared to the full-length 851-bp fragment in the <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>direction, suggesting that this 175-bp fragment is important for the control of <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>gene expression. This fragment alone was also capable of driving the reporter gene expression in the <italic>PDCD10 </italic>direction. Further splitting of this bidirectional promoter region into two parts, i.e. the sequence from nt 1 to 107 or from nt 108 to 175, resulted in a dramatic loss of luciferase activity. Surprisingly, deletion of the fragment of nt 176 to 851 increased more than 3-fold of the luciferase activity relative to that of the 851-bp fragment in the <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>direction but only kept a ~40% remaining of the luciferase activity in the <italic>PDCD10 </italic>direction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). These results strongly indicate that within the fragment of nt 176-851 there likely exist a repressive element that can regulate <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>expression and an enhancer that can modulate <italic>PDCD10 </italic>expression. Based on these findings, we conclude that a 175-bp minimal promoter region from nt 1 to 175 near the vicinity of <italic>PDCD10 </italic>and a regulatory region outside the 175-bp fragment from nt 176 to 851 may coordinately regulate the gene transcriptions of <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>and <italic>PDCD10</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Possible locations of the repressive element for <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>and the enhancer for <italic>PDCD10</italic></title><p>From the experiment described in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, there seems to exist a regulatory fragment from nt 176 to 851 which possesses no promoter activity but appears to contain a repressive element for <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>and an enhancer for <italic>PDCD10</italic>. Thus, we cloned this fragment in two opposite directions into the upstream of the SV40 promoter in a pGL3-Promoter vector, and examined their effects on the SV40 promoter. As expected, the fragment of nt 176-851 in the <italic>PDCD10 </italic>direction was able to increase the SV40 promoter activity for approximately 2.2-fold (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). This observation confirmed the existence of an enhancer for <italic>PDCD10 </italic>as seen in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>. However, there was no increase of the SV40 promoter activity in the direction of <italic>SERPINI1</italic>. This phenomenon was possibly a compromising effect resulted from the coordination between the enhancer and the repressive element within the regulatory region; the extent of such effect may also vary for using different heterologous promoters.</p><p>To further identify the enhancer responsible for <italic>PDCD10</italic>, three intergenic fragments including 1) the nt 176-473 fragment, 2) the nt 474-710 fragment, and 3) the nt 711-851 fragment toward the <italic>PDCD10 </italic>direction were individually cloned into the upstream of the SV40 promoter and assayed for their promoter activity in H4 cells. The results showed that only the nt 473-176 fragment was able to increase the SV40 promoter activity by 6 to 10-fold (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). The same fragment toward the <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>direction had no such effect on the SV40 promoter activity (data not shown). Hence, there is an orientation-dependent enhancer located in the fragment of nt 176-473 and acting on the transcription of <italic>PDCD10</italic>. As for the search of the repressive element for <italic>SERPINI1</italic>, the same fragments but in opposite direction were individually cloned into a modified pGL3-Promoter vector containing a CMV promoter, a stronger promoter than the SV40 and better for repressive activity studies. The assay results demonstrated that only the fragment from nt 176-473 toward the <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>direction possessed a repressive ability which inhibited ~70% of the CMV promoter activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). Nonetheless, the same fragment but in the opposite orientation (toward the <italic>PDCD10 </italic>direction) could only enhance the CMV promoter activity for approximately 2-fold (data not shown). These findings signify that a critical fragment from nt 176-473 outside the minimal promoter possesses a strong repressive activity for <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>and enhancing activity for <italic>PDCD10</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>It has long been suggested that the human serpin genes are evolved from the same ancestor through intra- and interchromosomal duplications to develop into different clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Interestingly, when the human genome sequence was unveiled a few years ago, several non-homologous genes were found to be mapped into the serpin gene clusters. One of these genes, <italic>PDCD10</italic>, not only forms a head-to-head organization with <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>at chromosome 3q26 but also shares a tiny promoter with it. The organization of this divergent gene pair is well preserved in many species throughout the evolution, indicating that <italic>PDCD10 </italic>and <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>need to be tightly together to maintain the gene co-regulation or their functional association. Further sequence analysis on the intergenic region revealed a 400-bp fragment near the vicinity of <italic>PDCD10 </italic>is highly similar among human, mouse and rat, a result strongly indicating that the transcriptional regulation mechanisms of these two genes are evolutionary conserved among different species. Indeed, by performing a series of luciferase assays, a 175-bp fragment from nt 1 to 175 in the vicinity of <italic>PDCD10 </italic>was determined to function as a minimal promoter of both genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The same 175-bp minimal promoter was also observed (data not shown) when we utilized the human intergenic fragment to perform the promoter analysis in rat adrenal gland PC12 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In addition, we detected the existence of an important regulatory fragment from nt 176 to 473 in the vicinity of <italic>PDCD10 </italic>that possesses a repressive activity for <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). These findings are different from a previous study on mouse <italic>Serpini1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] claiming that a 200-bp segment near the transcription initiation site of <italic>Serpini1 </italic>was responsible for promoter activity. There are at least two possible reasons for the discrepancy observed in human and mouse <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>promoter. First, the constructs used for promoter analysis of mouse <italic>Serpini1 </italic>were all derived from 5' deletions of the full-length promoter region. These constructs might have contained the repressive element and/or lost the minimal promoter, and thus have very low promoter activities which could not be differentiated from each other. Secondly, different cell lines chosen might result in different conclusions; particularly the rat adrenal gland cell line PC12 has very low expression of <italic>Serpini1</italic>.</p><p>Trinklein and colleagues have pointed out that divergently transcribed gene pairs whose transcriptional start sites are separated by less than 1 kb represent more than 10% of genes in the whole human genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Such a high proportion indicates that there is a biological importance for those adjacent gene pairs even through a long evolution. Two feasible explanations for the existence of bidirectional promoters in the mammalian genome were recently given by Zhang and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The first explanation is that they are the ancestral sequences survived in evolution. A bidirectional promoter, like the one for <italic>PDCD10 </italic>and <italic>SERPINI1</italic>, with the characteristics of TATA-less, GC-rich and multiple Sp1 sites was thought to be the preserved ancestral sequences. The second explanation is that the genes sharing the bidirectional promoter are functionally related. From the sequence alignment data, we observed that this highly conserved promoter sequence is maintained throughout the evolution. Besides, there are evidences indicating that <italic>PDCD10 </italic>and <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>are both related to brain diseases. Therefore, we suggest that the compact adjacent arrangement for <italic>PDCD10 </italic>and <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>might be due to the possibility that they are involved in the same biological pathway.</p><p>Apart from the <italic>PDCD10</italic>-<italic>SERPINI1 </italic>gene pair at chromosome 3q26, there was another human head-to-head gene pair found to be associated with brain diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. This gene pair, consisting of the parkinsonism-related parkin gene (<italic>PARK2</italic>) and parkin co-regulated gene (<italic>PACRG</italic>) at chromosome 6q25.2-27, has many features in common with the <italic>PDCD10</italic>-<italic>SERPINI1 </italic>pair. Like <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>and <italic>PDCD10</italic>, <italic>PARK2 </italic>and <italic>PACRG </italic>are also non-homologous. <italic>PARK2</italic>, like <italic>SERPINI1</italic>, has its tissue specificity and is mainly expressed in brain, heart, skeletal muscle and kidney. <italic>PACRG </italic>is expressed in all tissues like <italic>PDCD10</italic>. The bidirectional promoter of <italic>PACRG</italic>-<italic>PARK2 </italic>is also TATA-less, GC-rich, and with multiple Sp1 binding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Furthermore, the genetic mutations of <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>and <italic>PARK2 </italic>are able to accelerate the formation of cellular inclusion bodies and to cause the dementia symptom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Therefore, we suggest that brain, being the most sophisticated organ which controls almost all responses of the whole body, may use bidirectional promoters to achieve gene expressions more efficiently, especially in the pathogenesis of its diseases.</p><p>Gene expression and tissue specificity are often regulated by transcriptional activators or repressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. In the case of the <italic>PDCD10</italic>-<italic>SERPINI1 </italic>gene pair, it is apparent that these two genes are not co-expressed genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This phenomenon can be best explained by the existence of a critical fragment, from nt 176 to 473 of the intergenic sequence, which contains an enhancer and a repressive element to coordinately regulate the transcriptions of both genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> &#x00026;&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The intergenic enhancer is orientation-dependent exerting its effect on the promoter of <italic>PDCD10 </italic>in the native context (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). It also works in an orientation-dependent manner with heterologous promoters (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref> &#x00026;&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Previously, a similar orientation-dependent intergenic enhancer had been reported in a mouse gene pair: the divergent <italic>Cryab </italic>(&#x003b1;B-crystallin) and <italic>Hspb2 </italic>(heat shock 27 kDa protein 2) pair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. However, this is the first time that such an enhancer is identified in the human genome. Moreover, the neuron-specificity of <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>and its down-regulation in brain tumorigenesis may be accounted for by a repressive element located in the same critical regulatory fragment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> &#x00026;&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Together these results suggest that the fine coordination between the orientation-dependent cis-control elements may play an important role in the asymmetrical expressions of <italic>PDCD10 </italic>and <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>in different tissues. In addition to the cis-control elements, the possible involvement of certain trans-acting factors in this bidirectional promoter region need to be further elucidated.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Here we present evidence that two non-homologous brain diseases-related genes, <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>and <italic>PDCD10</italic>, are tightly linked in a divergent configuration by a bidirectional promoter in an evolutionarily conserved fashion. Within their tiny intergenic region, a segment from nt 1 to 175 near the vicinity of <italic>PDCD10 </italic>was identified to function as a minimal promoter to efficiently drive the expressions of the two flanking genes. A critical regulatory fragment from nt 176 to 473 was further determined to contain a repressive element for <italic>SERPINI1 </italic>and an enhancer for <italic>PDCD10 </italic>that coordinately regulate the transcriptions of both genes. For all the non-homologous genes that have been described to be closely adjacent in the human genome, the intergenic region of the head-to-head <italic>PDCD10</italic>-<italic>SERPINI1 </italic>gene pair at 3q26 exhibits an interesting and informative example of a complex regulatory system that governs the expression of both genes not only through an asymmetric bidirectional promoter, but also through fine-tuned regulations with some cis-acting elements.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>All culture media, except RPMI 1640 medium, were purchased from Gibco Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA) and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone, Logan, UT, USA).

Various intergenic fragments were cloned upstream of either the SV40 or CMV promoter and of a luciferase reporter gene in the pGL3 vector. All constructs were transiently transfected into human neuroglioma H4 cells and the luciferase activity was measured. The resulting promoter activity was calculated relative to the control SV40 or CMV promoter activity which is artificially set at 100. A) The potential regulatory sequences from nt 176 to 851 of the intergenic region were cloned upstream of the SV40 promoter and their effects on the activity of the SV40 promoter were examined. B) Three intergenic fragments (nt 851-711, nt 710-474 and nt 473-176) in the <italic>PDCD10 </italic>direction were individually cloned upstream of the SV40 promoter to assess their effects on the activity of the SV40 promoter.
