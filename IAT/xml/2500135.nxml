During myoblast differentiation, the promyogenic cell surface receptor Cdo binds to the p38&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; pathway scaffold protein JLP and, via JLP, p38&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; itself. We report that Cdo also interacts with Bnip-2, a protein that binds the small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Cdc42 and a negative regulator of Cdc42, Cdc42 GTPase-activating protein (GAP). Moreover, Bnip-2 and JLP are brought together through mutual interaction with Cdo. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments with myoblasts indicate that the Cdo&#x02013;Bnip-2 interaction stimulates Cdc42 activity, which in turn promotes p38&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; activity and cell differentiation. These results reveal a previously unknown linkage between a cell surface receptor and downstream modulation of Cdc42 activity. Furthermore, interaction with multiple scaffold-type proteins is a distinctive mode of cell surface receptor signaling and provides one mechanism for specificity of p38&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; activation during cell differentiation.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>J.-S.

Members of the myogenic bHLH family (MyoD, Myf5, myogenin, and MRF4) are lineage-specific transcription factors that direct the differentiation process in conjunction with nonskeletal muscle&#x02013;specific transcription factors such as Mef2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pownall et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tapscott, 2005</xref>).

Furthermore, the p38&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; pathway functions as a switch in muscle satellite cells, required initially to phosphorylate unidentified substrates that activate cell cycle entry and subsequently targeting substrates named in the previous paragraph to promote cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jones et al., 2005</xref>). Presumably, these distinct roles of p38&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; signaling require appropriate concentrations of p38&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; to become activated at specific times and subcellular locations. However, the spatiotemporal regulatory mechanisms by which reiteratively used signaling pathways (like p38&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;) achieve such specificity are, in most cases, unclear.</p><p>The Rho family of small GTPases regulates many biological processes, including cytoskeletal dynamics, cell polarity, signal transduction, and transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Van Aelst and D'Souza-Schorey, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Jaffe and Hall, 2005</xref>). They are therefore well positioned to coordinate the changes in both gene expression and cell morphology that characterize cell differentiation. The role in vertebrate myogenesis of one such GTPase, Cdc42, is controversial. The concentration of active GTP-bound Cdc42 is relatively low in proliferating myoblasts and increases severalfold in differentiating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Travaglione et al., 2005</xref>). Studies in which constitutively active and dominant-negative mutants of Cdc42 were expressed in different myoblast cell systems have produced contradictory results but, in general, both mutants interfered with myogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Takano et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gallo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Meriane et al., 2000</xref>), suggesting that major perturbations in Cdc42 activity are not tolerated.</p><p>Like other small GTPases, Cdc42 cycles between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state. The activity cycle is directly regulated by its interaction with stimulatory guanine nucleotide exchange factors and inhibitory GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) and by interaction with additional proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Van Aelst and D'Souza-Schorey, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Jaffe and Hall, 2005</xref>). A candidate regulator of Cdc42 is Bnip-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Low et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2000a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">b</xref>). Bnip-2 is a 314-aa protein that harbors a single recognizable motif, a BCH domain that spans its C-terminal half. Cdc42GAP (also known as p50RhoGAP/ARHGAP1) contains a BCH domain in its noncatalytic N-terminal region, and Bnip-2 and Cdc42GAP interact via their respective BCH domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Low et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2000b</xref>). The Bnip-2 BCH domain also binds Cdc42 itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Low et al., 2000a</xref>). Transient expression of Bnip-2 in several cell types induces cellular elongation and membrane protrusions in a manner dependent on its ability to bind Cdc42 and on cellular Cdc42 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhou et al., 2005</xref>). That Bnip-2 binds Cdc42GAP, a negative regulator of Cdc42, yet has the ability to induce morphological alterations that require Cdc42 binding and Cdc42 activity, suggests that Bnip-2 might function as a scaffold for dynamic regulation of Cdc42 signaling. However, modulation of cellular Cdc42 activity by Bnip-2 has not been demonstrated.</p><p>Cdo is a cell surface receptor of the Ig superfamily that promotes myogenesis in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kang et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cole et al., 2004</xref>).

During myogenesis, the Cdo intracellular region binds to JLP, a scaffold protein for the p38&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; MAPK pathway and, via JLP, p38&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Takaesu et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>Cdo<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> myoblasts are deficient in differentiation-associated p38&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; activity, and their differentiation defect is specifically rescued by expression of activated MKK6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Takaesu et al., 2006</xref>); however, how association of JLP/p38&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; with Cdo leads to activation of p38&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; is unknown. We report in this paper that the Cdo intracellular region binds Bnip-2 and that this interaction regulates Cdc42 activity, thus identifying a novel linkage between a cell surface receptor and regulation of Cdc42. Bnip-2 and JLP do not directly associate but are brought together through mutual interaction with Cdo, and Bnip-2 and Cdc42 stimulate p38&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; activation and myogenic differentiation. Interaction with multiple scaffold-type proteins is an unusual mode of cell surface receptor signaling and provides a mechanism by which p38&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; can be specifically activated to promote cell differentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Cdo interacts with Bnip-2</title><p>A yeast two-hybrid screen that used the Cdo intracellular region as bait previously identified JLP as a Cdo-interacting protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Takaesu et al., 2006</xref>). This screen also identified positive clones encoding Bnip-2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). The intracellular region of another Ig protein, Necl-2, did not interact as efficiently with Bnip-2, nor did Cdo interact as efficiently with a Necl-2 binding protein, Pals-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shingai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Takaesu et al., 2006</xref>). Consistent with their interaction in yeast, Cdo and flag epitope&#x02013;tagged Bnip-2 coimmunoprecipitated when transiently expressed in 293T cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Like Cdo, Bnip-2 is expressed endogenously in C2C12 myoblasts, and Bnip-2 levels increased during a 4-d time course of differentiation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). On SDS-PAGE of C2C12 cell lysates, Bnip-2 migrated as a series of bands (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>) that likely represent alternatively spliced variously phosphorylated isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Low et al., 1999</xref>; unpublished data). To assess whether endogenous Cdo and Bnip-2 interact, C2C12 cells were harvested while proliferating in growth medium (GM) or over a 3-d time course after transfer to differentiation medium (DM). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with Bnip-2 antibodies and probed with Cdo antibodies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Cdo coprecipitated with Bnip-2, with maximal interaction occurring over the first 2 d in DM, which is similar to Cdo's interaction with JLP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Takaesu et al., 2006</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Cdo interacts with Bnip-2.</bold> (A) Yeast transformed with the indicated vectors for Gal4 DNA binding domain (BD) fused to the transmembrane (TM) plus intracellular regions (ICR) of Cdo or Necl-2 and Gal4 activation domain (AD) fused to Bnip-2 or Pals2 were plated on two-hybrid interaction-dependent selective medium.

A construct comprising only the Bnip-2 BCH domain (aa 167&#x02013;314) was as effective as full-length Bnip-2 in coprecipitating Cdo, but a construct lacking this domain failed to do so. Therefore, Bnip-2 binds to Cdo via its BCH domain. Boc is a protein that forms cis complexes with Cdo. Their respective ectodomains have strong sequence similarity but their intracellular regions are unrelated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kang et al., 2002</xref>). Boc also coimmunoprecipitated with Bnip-2, but the interaction appeared less efficient and was only observed with full-length Bnip-2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>).

Note that when transfectants fused with nontransfected cells, many (often most) of the nuclei in the myotube became positive for &#x003b2;-gal activity because the cytoplasmically translated protein diffuses within the myotube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Takaesu et al., 2006</xref>).

This is similar to Cdo's interaction with Bnip-2 and suggests that formation of a Cdo&#x02013;Bnip-2&#x02013;Cdc42 complex promotes Cdc42 activation.

Expression of siRNA against <italic>Cdc42</italic> in C2C12 cells also inhibited differentiation, but these cells acquired a strongly altered morphology (unpublished data). Therefore, to gain information on the role of Cdc42 in myogenesis, we sought to alter Cdc42 activity in a more subtle manner. It was reasoned that the concentration of GTP-bound Cdc42 and, perhaps more importantly, the amount of time Cdc42 proteins spend in the active state could be altered by modulating the amount of Cdc42GAP protein expressed by C2C12 cells. Two GAP proteins for Cdc42, Cdc42GAP and BPGAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shang et al., 2003</xref>), were each stably overexpressed in C2C12 cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>).

Therefore, transient expression of <italic>Bnip-2</italic> siRNA reduced myogenesis, which is similar to stable knockdown of Bnip-2.

Treatment of such cells with SB203580 further reduced the ratio to &#x0223c;10/90, which is similar to that of vector control cells. Therefore, the cells with diminished levels of Cdo or Bnip-2 that express MHC remain dependent on residual p38&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; activity to do so.

Cdo also binds to Bnip-2 and, via Bnip-2, Cdc42. Formation of a Cdo&#x02013;Bnip-2&#x02013;Cdc42 complex promotes or stabilizes activation of Cdc42, which in turn triggers signals culminating in phosphorylation and activation of p38&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; bound to Cdo via JLP. Cdo interacts with itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kang et al., 2003</xref>) and is shown as a dimer. JLP and Bnip-2 are shown as binding to different Cdo proteins of the dimer for convenience and does not preclude the possibility that JLP and Bnip-2 bind the same Cdo protein simultaneously.

Collectively, the results suggest that Cdo/Bnip-2 signaling is neither the sole mechanism by which p38&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; becomes activated during myogenesis nor a general requirement for full p38&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; activation but is likely to be specific for differentiation-mediated signaling.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Many ubiquitous signaling pathways perform cell type&#x02013;specific functions. Furthermore, such pathways can regulate disparate functions in the same cell type. Clearly, this requires that the activation of these pathways occurs at the correct time and subcellular location and with the appropriate magnitude and duration. The mechanisms by which such specificity is achieved are not well understood. We previously reported that during myogenic differentiation, the cell surface receptor Cdo binds the p38&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; pathway scaffold protein JLP and, via JLP, p38&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Takaesu et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>Cdo<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> myoblasts are deficient in both p38&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; activity and differentiation capability, and their ability to differentiate is rescued by expression of the p38&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; activator MKK6(EE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Takaesu et al., 2006</xref>); however, these results did not explain how association of JLP/p38&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; with Cdo leads to activation of p38&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;.</p><p>In this paper, it is demonstrated that Cdo also associates with the Cdc42 binding protein Bnip-2, identifying a novel linkage between a cell surface receptor and downstream modulation of Cdc42 activity. This interaction stimulates Cdc42 and p38&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; activities and regulates myogenic differentiation. Cdo, therefore, appears to promote activation of p38&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; by assembly of multiprotein signaling modules for Cdc42 and p38&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; via direct binding to scaffold proteins for each (i.e., Bnip-2 and JLP, respectively; <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10 G</xref>). JLP and Bnip-2 associate in a Cdo-dependent manner, implying that Cdc42 bound to Cdo via Bnip-2 activates p38&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; bound to Cdo via JLP and that this represents a pool of p38&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; specifically activated during differentiation. We speculate that binding of Bnip-2&#x02013;Cdc42 to Cdo allows Cdc42 to interact with a specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor, promoting nucleotide exchange on Cdc42 and subsequent binding to effector proteins that initiate a kinase cascade resulting in activation of p38&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;. Alternatively, Cdc42 may be activated before association with Cdo, and subsequent interaction between Cdo, Bnip-2, and Cdc42 stabilizes Cdc42 in the active state and brings it into proximity with components of the p38&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; pathway.</p><p>All the described components of this complex are ubiquitously expressed except Cdo, which, though not muscle specific, is highly enriched in muscle precursor cells and differentiating muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mulieri et al., 2000</xref>), suggesting that Cdo itself may provide some level of cell type specificity to this signaling pathway. Cdo is also expressed at high levels in neuronal precursors, and similar results to those reported here have been obtained in experiments on neuronal differentiation of a neural precursor line (unpublished observations). It is also clear, however, that not all p38&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; pathway activity during myoblast differentiation is Cdo- or Bnip-2&#x02013;dependent, as residual pp38&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; is detected in cells depleted for Cdo or Bnip-2, and treatment of such cells with the p38&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; inhibitor SB203580 further inhibits their differentiation. Potential additional mechanisms for activation of p38&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; in differentiating myoblasts include low-level autocrine TNF&#x003b1; signaling and signaling by semaphorin 4C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ko et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Riuzzi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wu et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In addition to binding Cdc42, Bnip-2 binds its negative regulator, Cdc42GAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Low et al., 1999</xref>). However, loss- and gain-of-function experiments in myoblasts indicate that Bnip-2 stimulates Cdc42 activity. These data suggest that Bnip-2 may function as a scaffold for dynamic signaling through Cdc42, modulating the balance or kinetics of its activity cycle. This is the first paper to find an endogenous function for Bnip-2, and we are unaware of another protein with this type of activity for Cdc42. Active cycling of Cdc42 may be required for efficient myogenesis, as the results presented in this paper demonstrate that Cdc42 activity is important for this process, but expression of constitutively active or dominant-negative mutants of Cdc42 each block differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Meriane et al., 2000</xref>). The ability of Cdc42 to trigger p38&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; activation fits well with the known importance of p38&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; in myogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lluis et al., 2006</xref>). However, Cdc42 regulates additional processes that are also likely to be relevant to differentiation, such as the formation of filopodia, which may be required for cell&#x02013;cell interactions in preparation for fusion, and regulation of cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Jaffe and Hall, 2005</xref>). That forced expression of the p38&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; activator MKK6(EE) has a somewhat greater effect on differentiation of control myoblasts than on myoblasts depleted of Bnip-2 is consistent with the notion that promyogenic pathways other than p38&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; lie downstream of Cdc42, but additional work will be required to establish that this is the case.</p><p>Collectively, these results reveal a distinctive mechanism of signaling: the Cdo intracellular region binds to scaffold proteins that in turn bind multiple components of specific pathways. This is different from other Ig/FNIII repeat receptors related to Cdo, such as the Robo proteins, which bind to the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, c-Abl, the Rho family GAPs srGAP and Vilse, the SH2/SH3 adaptor Nck, and the actin regulator Ena/Vasp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dickson and Gilestro, 2006</xref>). Furthermore, Cdo functions in multiple contexts at the extracellular face of the cell surface. In myoblasts, it forms cis complexes with N-cadherin and neogenin, the latter a receptor for the netrin and RGM families of ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kang et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cole et al., 2007</xref>). Additionally, Cdo binds Sonic hedgehog, possibly as a coreceptor with Patched1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tenzen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Martinelli and Fan, 2007</xref>). The mechanism by which binding of JLP and Bnip-2 to Cdo is induced during myogenesis is not clear, but a connection with N-cadherin is likely. Expression in C2C12 cells of a Cdo deletion mutant that is specifically deficient in its ability to bind N-cadherin blocks differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kang et al., 2003</xref>). N-cadherin&#x02013;based adhesion enhances p38&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; activity in C2 myoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lovett et al., 2006</xref>), and preliminary results suggest that Cdo, JLP, and Bnip-2 can be recruited to sites of N-cadherin ligation (unpublished data). Cdo may function to link cadherin-based adhesion to the p38&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; pathway, which promotes the muscle-specific transcriptional program. That Cdc42, a known regulator of actin dynamics, is directly involved in this process provides a mechanism by which such changes in gene expression can be coordinated with the alterations in cell morphology that are also required for cell differentiation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Yeast two-hybrid screen</title><p><italic>Bnip-2</italic> was identified in a previously reported screen in which the transmembrane plus intracellular region of mouse Cdo was used as bait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Takaesu et al., 2006</xref>).
