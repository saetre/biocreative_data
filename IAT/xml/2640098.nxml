The selective advantage conferred by imprinting is not understood but is hypothesised to act on dosage-critical genes. Here, we report a unique model in which the consequences of a single, double, and triple dosage of the imprinted <italic>Dlk1</italic>/<italic>Pref1</italic>, normally repressed on the maternally inherited chromosome, can be assessed in the growing embryo. BAC-transgenic mice were generated that over-express <italic>Dlk1</italic> from endogenous regulators at all sites of embryonic activity. Triple dosage causes lethality associated with major organ abnormalities. Embryos expressing a double dose of <italic>Dlk1</italic>, recapitulating loss of imprinting, are growth enhanced but fail to thrive in early life, despite the early growth advantage. Thus, any benefit conferred by increased embryonic size is offset by postnatal lethality. We propose a negative correlation between gene dosage and survival that fixes an upper limit on growth promotion by <italic>Dlk1</italic>, and we hypothesize that trade-off between growth and lethality might have driven imprinting at this locus.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Genomic imprinting, the process that causes genes to be expressed from one of the two chromosome homologues according to parental origin, is likely to act on genes whose dosage is important for their correct function. To test this, we compared the phenotype of transgenic mice expressing a double and triple dose of the imprinted gene <italic>Dlk1/Pref1</italic> with animals expressing the normal single dose expressed from the paternally inherited chromosome. Our results showed that a triple dose causes severe developmental abnormalities and death before or at birth. Embryos expressing a double dose, recapitulating absence of imprinting, are bigger at birth but then around one-third of them died within the first three days of life. Those that survived had poor early growth performance in the first week of life becoming small and remaining small, thus offsetting any benefit conferred by being born bigger. Therefore, imprinted levels of <italic>Dlk1/Pref1</italic> represent the optimal balance of growth versus lethality. These findings lead to speculation about the evolutionary pressures acting to establish and maintain imprinting at this locus.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Genomic imprinting, the process causing genes to be differentially expressed according to their parental origin acts on a subset of developmentally regulated genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000392-daRocha1">&#x0005b;reviewed in 1&#x0005d;</xref>. Since imprinting results in functional haploidy of target genes, the evolution of such a mechanism must have conferred a significant advantage to its recipients to offset the cost. In addition, the maintenance of this method of gene dosage regulation must confer a continuing selective benefit to the individual. By creating genetic models that mimic the loss of imprinting of genes regulated in this way, we can study phenotype and consider what selective pressures act to maintain gene dosage, and begin to examine what may have driven the acquisition of mono-allelic expression.</p><p><italic>Dlk1</italic>, <italic>Delta-like homologue 1</italic> also known as <italic>Preadipocyte factor 1</italic> (<italic>Pref1</italic>), on mouse chromosome 12 is part of an imprinted gene cluster <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000392-Schmidt1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000392-Takada1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Uniparental disomy mice with two paternal copies and no maternal copy (PatDi(12)/PatDp(dist12)) or mice with two maternal copies and no paternal copy (MatDi(12)/MatDp(dist12)) of chromosome 12, are lethal and show distinct phenotypes.

However since in PatDi(12)/PatDp(dist12) and &#x00394;IG-DMR<sup>MAT</sup> conceptuses multiple paternally expressed coding genes are up-regulated, and multiple maternally expressed non-coding genes are repressed, we are unable to determine if selection is acting to maintain the mono-allelic expression of one or all protein coding genes or to maintain expression of the non-coding RNAs. As <italic>Dlk1</italic> is an ancestral gene at this imprinted locus and it is expressed at high levels in tissues where uniparental disomy conceptuses have the most pronounced abnormalities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000392-daRocha2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, we consider <italic>Dlk1</italic> as a strong candidate for the pathological defects associated with the <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> region. Therefore in this study, we specifically ask if imprinting might be maintained to prevent overdose of <italic>Dlk1</italic> and moreover, if selection to control the dosage of this gene might have driven the evolution of imprinting of the chromosome 12 cluster.</p><p>Manipulating imprinted gene dosage <italic>in vivo</italic> provides a powerful tool to study imprinted gene function and evolution.

Of these, transgenic <italic>Dlk1</italic> expression at sites where the endogenous gene is expressed, was achieved from a 70 kb BAC transgene in three independent lines and the outcome was the same for all three lines. This allowed us to compare the phenotypes of mice expressing a double (transgene hemizygotes) or triple (transgene homozygotes) dose of <italic>Dlk1</italic> with normal animals expressing a single imprinted dose. This transgenic system of regulated <italic>Dlk1</italic> over-dose allowed us to explore the developmental and physiological functions of this gene in comparison with other models, and infer evolutionary scenarios for <italic>Dlk1</italic> imprinting.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Construction of a Transgenic System for the Alteration of <italic>Dlk1/Pref1</italic> Dosage</title><p>BAC transgenes were generated that encompass the entire <italic>Dlk1</italic> gene and endogenous flanking sequences but without other genes in the cluster.

The differences in growth performance are most pronounced within the first week after birth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000392-g007">Figure 7D</xref>), correlating with poor suckling and the increased lethality of these animals. In conclusion, despite an early growth advantage, animals expressing a double dose of <italic>Dlk1</italic> fail to thrive in early life, and thus any benefit conferred by an increased embryonic size is offset by postnatal lethality.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have developed a unique model in which the consequences of a single, double and triple dosage of one imprinted gene, <italic>Dlk1</italic>, can be assessed in the growing embryo. The double dose is reminiscent of the situation where there is no imprinting of this gene. <italic>BAC</italic> and <italic>YAC</italic> transgenes have been widely used in mouse genetics and in imprinting studies as a molecular tool for the localisation of transcriptional or imprinting regulatory elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000392-Ainscough1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000392-John1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000392-Yevtodiyenko2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. We generated transgenes differing in the extent of the sequences upstream of <italic>Dlk1</italic>. The Tg<italic><sup>Dlk1</sup></italic><sup>-31</sup> did not express <italic>Dlk1</italic> in four transgenic lines, regardless of integration site or copy number (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000392.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). In contrast, Tg<italic><sup>Dlk1</sup></italic><sup>-70</sup>, which extends from 49 kb upstream of the <italic>Dlk1</italic> gene, is expressed. We have therefore determined that the majority of embryonic tissue-specific enhancer sequences for <italic>Dlk1</italic> expression are located in the 8 kb to 49 kb interval upstream of the gene. This is consistent with a previous report showing that enhancers for <italic>Dlk1</italic> are absent from 3 kb upstream to 175 kb downstream of the gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000392-Yevtodiyenko2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Minimal transgene expression in the placenta suggests the absence of the specific regulatory sequences for this organ in the 70 kb transgene.</p><p>At E16, we detected growth enhancement in a <italic>Dlk1</italic> dose-dependent manner. TG/TG were more than 20&#x00025; larger than WT/WT littermates, whereas WT/TG were growth-enhanced by 10&#x00025;. At later stages, progressive morbidity and mortality of TG/TG embryos precluded a meaningful comparative assessment of their growth rate. This was not the case for viable WT/TG embryos which clearly maintained an increased growth trajectory from E16 up to birth. This is reciprocal to the 20&#x00025; reduction in weight reported for <italic>Dlk1</italic>-null E19 fetuses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000392-Moon1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. In general, tissue-specific overgrowth correlated with levels of <italic>Dlk1</italic> over-expression, except in the brain. This suggests <italic>Dlk1</italic> acts locally on organ growth, though we cannot rule out an endocrine role <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000392-Mei1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>With the exception of studies on placental specific <italic>Igf2</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000392-Constancia2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000392-Constancia3">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, previous functional analyses of imprinted genes expressed in embryo and placenta have not been able to discern whether growth effects are intrinsic to the embryo or are secondary to placental function. This is because genetic manipulation of imprinted genes often results in altered gene dosage in both embryonic and extra-embryonic tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000392-Charalambous1">&#x0005b;reviewed in 30&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, the WT/TG model reported here generates embryonic <italic>Dlk1</italic> over-expression in the presence of a normal placenta with a normal <italic>Dlk1</italic> dose, and the results indicate that <italic>Dlk1</italic> can modulate embryonic growth independently of the placenta. To complement these studies, it will be important to determine the extent to which placental <italic>Dlk1</italic> expressed in the fetal endothelium and some trophoblast cells of the labyrinthine zone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000392-daRocha2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> also contributes to embryonic growth.</p><p>Importantly, this study shows that <italic>Dlk1</italic> has a dual role on growth. WT/TG neonates are born larger but fail to thrive during the first week of life. The reduced postnatal growth rate is concurrent with reduced food intake in the neonatal period. Maternally repressed imprinted genes are expected to favour growth performance and resource acquisition from embryonic stages to weaning according to the kinship theory which posits that imprinting arose as a consequence of a conflict between males and females over the allocation of maternal resources to the offspring <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000392-Haig1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000392-Wilkins1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. The embryonic overgrowth generated by <italic>Dlk1</italic> double dosage follows the directionality predicted by this theory however the postnatal failure to thrive phenotype is contrary to it. Our model implicates <italic>Dlk1</italic> in reduced postnatal nutrient acquisition. Indeed the results suggest that maternal repression of <italic>Dlk1</italic> may have evolved to increase postnatal nutrient acquisition. Furthermore it has been hypothesized that maternally repressed imprinted genes, such as <italic>Dlk1</italic>, would minimize heating contribution within huddles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000392-Haig2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000392-Haig3">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. NST is not impaired in BAT over-expressing <italic>Dlk1</italic>. In fact, slight over-expression of <italic>Ppar&#x003b3;2</italic> and <italic>Ucp1</italic> may suggest the opposite scenario, whereby a maternally repressed gene may contribute more to the communal heating. Our results are therefore inconsistent with the conflict hypothesis. It is possible that imprinting may have evolved due to more than one type of selective pressure, perhaps different for different domains.</p><p>In TG/TG embryos over-growth occurs at E16 coincident with an increased frequency of embryonic mortality. Embryos expressing this triple dose did not survive past birth. A double dose of <italic>Dlk1</italic> was compatible with embryonic viability but resulted in significant neonatal lethality. We propose a negative correlation between gene dosage and survival that may fix an upper limit on growth promotion by <italic>Dlk1</italic>.</p><p>One hypothesis for the lethality could be that <italic>Dlk1</italic> dosage regulates the balance between proliferation and differentiation resulting in a trade-off between pre-natal size and developmental maturity. Increasing <italic>Dlk1</italic> dosage incrementally shifts the embryo towards increased growth, perhaps at the expense of organ maturation as was suggested for PatDi(12) embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000392-Georgiades1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. The major abnormalities found in the liver, lungs and skeleton of the TG/TG fetuses may be signs of developmental immaturity of these organs. The inability of the lungs to support TG/TG animals surviving to term, as well as pre-natal oedema, is consistent with this. The <italic>Notch</italic> signalling pathway is required for branching morphogenesis and maturation of the lungs, and disruption of this pathway can lead to peri-natal lethality due to lung hypotrophy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000392-Collins1">&#x0005b;reviewed in 35&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000392-Ito1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000392-Dang1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, except for subtle ossification delays in the WT/TG fetuses, no other clear signs of organ immaturity were identified, so we cannot conclude whether this contributes to the neonatal lethality of the hemizygous genotype.</p><p>In order to explore the cause of lethality in the WT/TG neonates more closely, we measured several parameters related to rodent well-being. WT/TG animals were significantly less likely to have milk-filled stomachs on the day of birth. This may be a result of defects in suckling behaviour engendered by many causes, such as appetite or olfactory regulation, or motor function. Starvation may therefore be the cause of death of WT/TG neonates, and reduced feeding in the first week is also a likely cause of the reduced growth rate of surviving transgenic animals during this period. Further analysis of the physiological consequences of this interesting growth trajectory of prenatal growth enhancement followed by postnatal compromised growth is in progress.</p><p>Imprinting of the <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> cluster is important. Disruption of imprinted expression in several models results in lethality therefore there is a clear selective pressure to maintain imprinting at this cluster <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000392-daRocha3">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000392-Sekita1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. The IG-DMR, like other imprinting control regions, controls the dosage of many linked genes. It has been postulated that in imprinted clusters, some genes are the target of dosage regulation while other are merely bystanders whose altered dosage do not have phenotypic consequences and therefore are not targets for selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000392-Hurst1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. We show that <italic>Dlk1</italic> is a dose-dependent regulator of embryonic growth, as well as modulating processes necessary for postnatal survival. WT/TG animals model loss of imprinting of <italic>Dlk1</italic>, and have significantly reduced fitness, suggesting that the maintenance of imprinting of solely <italic>Dlk1</italic> in eutherians by the IG-DMR has been sufficient to selectively retain imprinting control of the entire chromosome 12 cluster. However, the phenotypes of PatDi(12)/PatDp(dist12) and &#x00394;IG-DMR<sup>MAT</sup> embryos are much more severe than that of a <italic>Dlk1</italic> double-dose alone; therefore the dosage of at least one other gene in this cluster requires tight regulation. <italic>Rtl1</italic> is a likely candidate for this as defects have been reported in both knockout and overexpression models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000392-Sekita1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref> and this gene is found only in eutherian mammals that have imprinting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000392-Edwards1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We cannot know the selective pressures surrounding the acquisition of imprinting at chromosome 12 in eutherians however this mechanism must have evolved to regulate dosage-critical genes.

It therefore could have been the target of selection for dosage control by imprinting at this locus.
