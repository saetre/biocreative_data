With the development of microarray technology, transcriptional changes can be examined at the whole-genome level. However, such analysis often lacks information on the hierarchical relationship between components of a given system. Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is an inducible plant defense response involving a cascade of transcriptional events induced by salicylic acid through the transcription cofactor NPR1. To identify additional regulatory nodes in the SAR network, we performed microarray analysis on <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants expressing the NPR1-GR (glucocorticoid receptor) fusion protein. Since nuclear translocation of NPR1-GR requires dexamethasone, we were able to control NPR1-dependent transcription and identify direct transcriptional targets of NPR1. We show that NPR1 directly upregulates the expression of eight <italic>WRKY</italic> transcription factor genes. This large family of 74 transcription factors has been implicated in various defense responses, but no specific WRKY factor has been placed in the SAR network. Identification of NPR1-regulated WRKY factors allowed us to perform in-depth genetic analysis on a small number of WRKY factors and test well-defined phenotypes of single and double mutants associated with NPR1. Among these WRKY factors we found both positive and negative regulators of SAR. This genomics-directed approach unambiguously positioned five WRKY factors in the complex transcriptional regulatory network of SAR. Our work not only discovered new transcription regulatory components in the signaling network of SAR but also demonstrated that functional studies of large gene families have to take into consideration sequence similarity as well as the expression patterns of the candidates.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Many biological processes are controlled by intricate regulatory networks of gene expression. Identifying the regulatory nodes in these networks and understanding the hierarchical relationship between them are vital to our understanding of biological systems. However, this task is frequently hampered by the intrinsic complexity of these processes. Here, the authors used a controlled transcriptional profiling strategy to a plant immune response called systemic acquired resistance to study the transcriptional events one at a time. Systemic acquired resistance is activated through the induction of thousands of genes by the transcriptional regulator protein NPR1. The authors found that downstream of NPR1 are several regulatory nodes comprised of members from a large family of transcriptional factors.

NPR1 likely regulates these secretion-related genes through a novel transcription factor &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition to this unknown transcription factor and the TGAs, WRKY transcription factors have also been implicated in regulating the response against pathogen infection. Many <italic>WRKY</italic> genes are rapidly induced after treatment with elicitors associated with infection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b007">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. Moreover, genes induced during defense responses often contain WRKY transcription factor&#x02013;binding sites, W boxes, in their promoter regions. For example, the promoter of an SA biosynthesis gene is enriched with W boxes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. The expression of <italic>NPR1</italic> itself has been shown to be under the regulation of WRKY factors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. In a transcriptional profiling study, Maleck et al. discovered that W boxes are overrepresented in a cluster of genes sharing the induction pattern of <italic>PR-1,</italic> suggesting a role for WRKY factors in SAR &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. Ectopic expression studies have shed some light on the functions of WRKY genes. Plants overexpressing <italic>WRKY70</italic> have heightened resistance toward two bacterial pathogens &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;.

However, data from overexpression studies need to be interpreted with caution. For example, since ectopically expressing several WRKY genes all resulted in a similar range of phenotypes, it is difficult to conclude functional specificity from these studies.</p><p>Typical of large gene families, phenotypic analysis of loss-of-function WRKY mutants has been hampered by functional redundancy. It has been reported that in a collection of more than 40 <italic>wrky</italic> knockout mutants, phenotypes were rarely observed &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. This difficulty is further exacerbated by the wide range of defense responses in which WRKY factors participate. Therefore, to elucidate the function of specific WRKY genes, it is critical to identify a small number of candidates within a well-defined biological process.</p><p>In this study, we used a genomics-directed approach to identify those <italic>WRKY</italic> genes whose expression is directly regulated by NPR1. The small number of candidate genes allowed more informed construction of double mutants and focused examination of the mutants on NPR1-associated phenotypes.

In our analysis, the confidence value was set to six, and window size was 100. Using <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001 as a cutoff, we found 64 genes differentially expressed between <italic>NPR1-GR</italic> (glucocorticoid receptor; in <italic>npr1&#x02013;3</italic>) and <italic>npr1&#x02013;3</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020123-st001">Table S1</xref>). Among the 64 genes, we found that the expression of <italic>WRKY54, WRKY38, WRKY59, WRKY18, WRKY70, WRKY66,</italic> and <italic>WRKY53</italic> was reproducibly induced in two biological replicates. We also carried out a mixed-model analysis of variance (ANOVA) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d; of the data. Using <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 as a cutoff, <italic>WRKY38, WRKY54, WRKY66,</italic> and <italic>WRKY58</italic> were the top candidates with the most fold changes. We therefore added <italic>WRKY58</italic> to the list. We then confirmed the inducibility of six of these genes, <italic>WRKY18, WRKY38, WRKY53, WRKY54, WRKY58,</italic> and <italic>WRKY70,</italic> in wild-type (WT) plants in response to benzothiadiazole S-methylester (BTH; a functional analog of SA) using reverse transcription followed by quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) (unpublished data) and by additional microarray analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020123-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Induction of these genes was either abolished or markedly reduced in the <italic>npr1&#x02013;1</italic> mutant, confirming that they are transcriptional targets of NPR1. Furthermore, activation of these genes was similarly affected in the <italic>tga2 tga3 tga5 tga6</italic> quadruple mutant, suggesting that TGA transcription factors are also required for their induction (unpublished data). Induction of the other two <italic>WRKY</italic> genes, <italic>WRKY59</italic> and <italic>WRKY66,</italic> also appeared to be abolished in <italic>npr1&#x02013;1</italic> and <italic>tga2 tga3 tga5 tga6,</italic> but the background expression for these genes was too low in WT to calculate the fold induction (unpublished data).</p><p>Several of these <italic>WRKY</italic> genes have been studied previously for their roles in disease resistance and related processes.

However, there has been no concrete genetic evidence to place specific WRKY factors in the SAR signaling network. By focusing on the first transcriptional step downstream of NPR1, we were able to identify a small number of WRKY factors sharing not only sequence homology but also similar expression patterns. Therefore, either individually or in combination, these WRKY factors are promising candidates for transcriptional regulators required for NPR1 function.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>WRKY18 Is a Positive Transcription Factor Required for Full Induction of SAR</title><p>We isolated T-DNA or transposon insertion lines in each of the NPR1-inducible <italic>WRKY</italic> genes, most of which disrupted the expression of their corresponding genes, as assayed by RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020123-st002">Table S2</xref>). The only insertion mutation available for <italic>WRKY38</italic> reduced its expression by 67&#x00025; and is not a knockout mutation.</p><p>We first examined individual <italic>wrky</italic> mutants for effects on BTH-induced resistance. Because mutating a single transcription factor would likely cause only a partial loss of resistance, we applied a moderate concentration of BTH (60 &#x003bc;M) followed by inoculation of a bacterial pathogen, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Pseudomonas syringae</named-content> pv. <italic>maculicola (Psm)</italic> ES4326. All of the <italic>wrky</italic> mutants exhibited near WT-level resistance (unpublished data) except <italic>wrky18,</italic> which was partially impaired in BTH-induced resistance to this pathogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020123-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). We then performed biological induction of SAR using <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. syringae</named-content> pv. <italic>phaseolicola</italic> carrying the <italic>avrB</italic> gene. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020123-g003">Figure 3</xref>B, recognition of avrB led to enhanced resistance to subsequent challenge by <italic>Psm</italic> ES4326 in systemic leaves of WT plants. This induced resistance was absent in <italic>wrky18.</italic> Since the <italic>npr1</italic> mutant is impaired not only in SAR but also in basal resistance, we examined <italic>wrky18</italic> for an enhanced disease symptoms (EDS) phenotype. Indeed, when we inoculated <italic>wrky18</italic> with a low level of <italic>Psm</italic> ES4326 (OD<sub>600</sub> &#x0003d; 0.0001), the EDS phenotype was also evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020123-g003">Figure 3</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020123-g003">3</xref>D). In all three cases, however, the phenotype of <italic>wrky18</italic> was less severe than that of <italic>npr1&#x02013;1,</italic> which is consistent with our hypothesis that WRKY18 is a downstream component of SAR that mediates a subset of NPR1 functions.</p><p>We then performed another microarray experiment to determine the defect in <italic>wrky18</italic> on gene expression during SAR. We treated WT, <italic>wrky18,</italic> and <italic>npr1</italic> plants with 60 &#x003bc;M BTH, and harvested leaf tissue at 0, 8, and 24 h after induction. Three biological replicates were collected for each timepoint/genotype combination. BTH treatment in WT triggered a robust change in the expression of thousands of genes. Using ANOVA, the expression of 6,525 genes was found to be altered in WT following BTH treatment (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) (after multiple testing correction using the method proposed by Benjamini and Hochberg to assess false discovery rate &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;). After applying a two-fold change cutoff to these genes, the list was reduced to 2,280 genes, among which 1,147 were induced and 1,133 were repressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020123-st003">Table S3</xref>). From this list, we applied a two-way ANOVA between WT and <italic>npr1</italic> to identify NPR1-dependent genes. Interestingly, almost all BTH-responsive genes were NPR1 dependent (2,248/2,280; 99&#x00025;) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020123-g004">Figure 4</xref>A), highlighting the crucial role of NPR1 in BTH-mediated transcriptional reprogramming. We used the same analysis to compare WT and <italic>wrky18.</italic> The effect of disrupting <italic>WRKY18</italic> is moderate: the expression of 451 BTH-responsive genes (&#x0223c;19.8&#x00025;) was altered in this mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020123-st004">Table S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020123-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). Furthermore, while differences in gene expression were drastic between WT and <italic>npr1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020123-g004">Figure 4</xref>B), the changes between WT and <italic>wrky18</italic> were mostly in the amplitude, with the degree of induction or repression less dramatic in <italic>wrky18</italic> than in WT (204 and 152 genes, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020123-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). Gene Ontology searches using the DAVID software &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d; revealed six functional categories overrepresented in this WRKY18 cluster (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020123-st005">Table S5</xref>). As expected, the most prominent functional group in the cluster was involved in responding to biotic stimuli (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 1.19 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>). WRKY factors are known to recognize W boxes in the promoters of their target genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. The W box sequence was significantly overrepresented in the promoters of those genes for which the effect of BTH was diminished in <italic>wrky18</italic>: 2.3 copies per gene versus 1.7 copies at background level (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 2.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;115</sup>) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. These data clearly show that WRKY18 plays a positive role in SAR as an auxiliary transcription factor for a subset of NPR1-dependent genes.</p><p>In an effort toward elucidating SAR transcriptional controls further downstream of NPR1, we generated plants carrying the <italic>WRKY18-GR</italic> construct. Upon DEX treatment, <italic>WRKY18-GR</italic> complemented the EDS phenotype of the parental <italic>wrky18</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020123-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Therefore, the GR fusion strategy can be applied again to identify direct transcriptional targets of WRKY18 and to dissect the complex SAR transcriptional network.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>WRKY58 Is a Negative Transcription Factor to Prevent Spurious Induction of SAR</title><p>We also found a negative regulator of defense responses among our collection of <italic>wrky</italic> mutants: <italic>wrky58</italic> displayed several morphological phenotypes, including curly and pointed leaves with rough texture and a smaller rosette size, features that are reminiscent of a mutant with constitutive resistance, <italic>snc1</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. This suggests that the WRKY58 protein may be a negative regulator of disease resistance. Although <italic>wrky58</italic> showed no consistent difference from WT without induction or when resistance was induced by 60 &#x003bc;M BTH, we reasoned that WRKY58 might function at a suboptimal level of the inducer. Indeed, after treatment with a lower concentration of BTH (30 &#x003bc;M), <italic>wrky58</italic> was clearly more resistant to <italic>Psm</italic> ES4326 than WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020123-g005">Figure 5</xref>A).

The <italic>wrky58</italic> mutation had no effect on SA levels (unpublished data), consistent with it being a downstream regulator. The role of WRKY58 may be to provide a safeguard mechanism for preventing spurious activation of defense responses at suboptimal levels of SA or to turn off SAR once the pathogen challenge subsides. The enhanced resistance phenotype in <italic>wrky58</italic> is not due to constitutive expression of <italic>PR</italic> genes (unpublished data), suggesting a new mode of regulating disease resistance for this transcription factor.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>WRKY70 and Its Functional Homologs Play Dual Roles as Negative Regulators of SA Biosynthesis and Positive Regulators of SA-Mediated Gene Expression and Resistance</title><p>NPR1 is not only an essential transducer of the SA signal but also a negative regulator of SA synthesis.

The fact that SA levels can be further induced in <italic>wrky54 wrky70</italic> suggests that during the onset of SAR, a positive regulator, possibly a transcriptional activator, is recruited to initiate SA synthesis. Activated NPR1 then induces WRKY70 and WRKY54 to negatively control SA accumulation.</p><p>Surprisingly, neither <italic>wrky54 wrky70</italic> nor the corresponding single mutants exhibited heightened resistance to <italic>Psm</italic> ES4326 (OD<sub>600</sub> &#x0003d; 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020123-g006">Figure 6</xref>C). At the molecular level, we found that the SAR effector genes <italic>PR-1, PR-2,</italic> and <italic>PR-5</italic> were not constitutively expressed in <italic>wrky54 wrky70</italic> despite the elevated SA levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020123-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). This suggests that WRKY70 and WRKY54 play dual roles in repressing SA biosynthesis and transducing the SA signal. This result is consistent with a recent report showing that in the same loss-of-function <italic>wrky70</italic> mutant, SA-mediated resistance against the fungal pathogen <named-content content-type="genus-species">Erysiphe cichoracearum</named-content> was impaired &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>A positive role for WRKY70 in disease resistance was further supported by characterizing the <italic>wrky53 wrky70</italic> double mutant. In our initial characterization of the single <italic>wrky</italic> mutants, <italic>wrky53</italic> showed a minor deficiency in resistance (unpublished data). Because the expression of <italic>WRKY53</italic> and <italic>WRKY70</italic> was highly correlated after SAR induction (r<sup>2</sup> &#x0003d; 0.945; Spivey et al., unpublished data), we generated the <italic>wrky53 wrky70</italic> double mutant. The double mutant had similar SA content to <italic>wrky70</italic> (unpublished data), yet exhibited an EDS phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020123-g006">Figure 6</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020123-g006">6</xref>E). This result indicates that both WRKY53 and WRKY70 are positive regulators of defense responses, with possibly redundant functions.</p><p>All the double mutant analysis described above was carried out on multiple independent populations with similar results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020123-sg003">Figure S3</xref>), verifying the phenotypes were linked to the mutations under consideration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The WRKY family of transcription factors experienced significant expansion during the evolution of land plants. Genetic redundancy within such a large family of genes makes dissecting the function of individual <italic>WRKY</italic> genes a daunting task. Taking advantage of the fact that many <italic>WRKY</italic> genes are inducible, we focused on one step of a specific signal transduction event and identified eight WRKY factors as important transcriptional regulators of SAR downstream of NPR1. This approach also allowed us to test a well-defined set of phenotypes associated with NPR1 and to assign specific functions to these individual WRKY genes. As a result, we elucidated functions for five of the eight NPR1 direct targets in the model illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020123-g001">Figure 1</xref>B.</p><p>Our data established WRKY18 as a significant positive regulator of SAR. The partial loss of resistance in <italic>wrky18</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020123-g003">Figure 3</xref>) suggests that the endogenous protein performs a subset of functions directed by NPR1. This has been clearly demonstrated by comparing the transcriptomes of <italic>wrky18</italic> and <italic>npr1</italic> with that of WT after induction with 60 &#x003bc;M BTH. The <italic>wrky18</italic> mutation affected the amplitude of gene expression triggered by BTH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020123-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). Because the <italic>WRKY18</italic> transcript levels remain high even beyond the 24-h induction period, this transcription factor may also be required to sustain SAR-related gene expression.</p><p>Recently, it was reported that WRKY18 physically interacts with two negative regulators of defense, WRKY40 and WRKY60 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. It is possible that during SAR, WRKY18 releases the inhibitory effects of WRKY40 and WRKY60 to induce gene expression. Unfortunately, under the experimental conditions used in this recent report, where 10-fold more pathogens were used, the WT plants developed disease symptoms, and the defect caused by <italic>wrky18</italic> on basal resistance was masked. SAR was not tested on <italic>wrky18.</italic> The same authors showed that overexpression of <italic>WRKY18</italic> led to enhanced resistance &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;, consistent with our finding that WRKY18 alone is a positive regulator of defense.</p><p>Activation of SAR is a costly process involving dramatic induction of more than 1,000 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020123-g004">Figure 4</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020123-st003">Table S3</xref>; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;). Therefore, SAR should only be activated when the benefit of resistance outweighs the costs. WRKY58 appears to be a negative regulator that functions at a suboptimal level of BTH to prevent spurious induction of SAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020123-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). The stunted growth of the <italic>wrky58</italic> mutant plants is consistent with this hypothesis.</p><p>Characterization of both <italic>wrky70</italic> and the <italic>wrky54 wrky70</italic> mutants in our study provided new insights into another function of NPR1, namely the ability to curtail excessive SA accumulation. Hyperaccumulation of the <italic>ICS1</italic> transcript and SA observed in these mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020123-g006">Figure 6</xref>) suggests that in WT plants, SA biosynthesis is actively repressed by low levels of WRKY70 and WRKY54. Because WRKY70 and WRKY54 are both NPR1 targets, it is reasonable to hypothesize that they are also involved in shutting down SA biosynthesis once the pathogen challenge subsides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020123-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). The observation that free SA levels in the <italic>wrky54 wrky70</italic> double mutant were further elevated in response to pathogen infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020123-g006">Figure 6</xref>A) suggests that induction of SA biosynthesis involves a positive regulator. However, this regulatory gene is unlikely to be among the NPR1 targets examined in this study since SA biosynthesis occurs prior to activation of NPR1.</p><p>In an earlier study, it was reported that reducing <italic>WRKY70</italic> expression by an antisense construct did not change SA levels &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. It is possible that in addition to <italic>WRKY70,</italic> a related <italic>WRKY</italic> gene required for activating SA biosynthesis was also silenced. This suggests that this unknown positive regulator may be another WRKY factor. The presence of multiple W boxes in the promoter of the SA biosynthesis gene <italic>ICS1</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d; is consistent with this hypothesis.</p><p>Unlike many reported SA-overaccumulating mutants, <italic>wrky54 wrky70</italic> did not exhibit constitutive resistance to pathogens. In fact, this double mutant may have an EDS phenotype (unpublished data). We believe that WRKY70 and WRKY54 play dual roles during SAR: both as negative regulators of SA synthesis and as positive regulators of SA signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020123-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Supporting evidence came from a report where <italic>WRKY70</italic>-overexpressing plants showed constitutive resistance to two bacterial pathogens &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020123-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. If the sole function of WRKY70 were to repress SA biosynthesis, one would expect compromised resistance in plants with elevated <italic>WRKY70</italic> expression. Finally, our characterization of the <italic>wrky53 wrky70</italic> double mutant suggests that WRKY53 also plays a positive role in activating defense responses, as this double mutant showed an EDS phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020123-g001">Figure 1</xref>B).</p><p>In conclusion, our genomics-directed genetic studies of <italic>WRKY</italic> genes led to unambiguous placement of specific WRKY factors in the intricate signaling network induced by SA. With this stepwise approach, we will continue to identify new regulatory nodes up and down this transcription cascade.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plant growth and treatments.</title><p>T-DNA and transposon insertion mutants described in this study were acquired from the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Biological Resource Center (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biosci.ohio-state.edu/pcmb/Facilities/abrc/abrchome.htm">http://www.biosci.ohio-state.edu/pcmb/Facilities/abrc/abrchome.htm</ext-link>) and genotyped with allele-specific PCR.

of the strategy to identify NPR1 direct targets. SA treatment activates components of the SAR pathway upstream or independent of NPR1. Subsequent application of dexamethasone (DEX) triggers nuclear translocation of the NPR1-GR fusion protein to activate existing TGA transcription factors. Direct target genes of NPR1 are transcribed but not translated in the presence of the inhibitor cycloheximide <bold>(</bold>CHX) to prevent transcription of indirect target genes. ER, endoplasmic reticulum&#x02013;resident proteins; TF, transcription factors; PR, pathogenesis-related proteins.</p><p>(B) Mode of action for the NPR1-target WRKY factors. In WT, SA accumulation triggers nuclear localization of NPR1, which directly induces several <italic>WRKY</italic> genes. When SA levels are low, WRKY58 functions to prevent (blocked arrow) spurious activation of SAR (dotted lines). When SA levels are high, signaling through positive WRKY factors overcomes the negative effect of WRKY58 to activate (arrow) downstream gene transcription (solid lines).
