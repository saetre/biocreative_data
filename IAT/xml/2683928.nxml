Such conformational diversity has complicated research into amyloid-associated intracellular dysfunction and neurodegeneration. To this end, recombinant single-chain Fv antibodies (scFvs) are compelling molecular tools that can be selected against specific protein conformations, and expressed inside cells as intrabodies, for investigative and therapeutic purposes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and live-cell fluorescence microscopy, we report that a human scFv selected against the fibrillar form of &#x003b1;-synuclein targets isomorphic conformations of misfolded polyglutamine proteins. When expressed in the cytoplasm of striatal cells, this conformation-specific intrabody co-localizes with intracellular aggregates of misfolded ataxin-3 and a pathological fragment of huntingtin, and enhances the aggregation propensity of both disease-linked polyglutamine proteins. Using this intrabody as a tool for modulating the kinetics of amyloidogenesis, we show that escalating aggregate formation of a pathologic huntingtin fragment is not cytoprotective in striatal cells, but rather heightens oxidative stress and cell death as detected by flow cytometry. Instead, cellular protection is achieved by suppressing aggregation using a previously described intrabody that binds to the amyloidogenic N-terminus of huntingtin. Analogous cytotoxic results are observed following conformational targeting of normal or polyglutamine-expanded human ataxin-3, which partially aggregate through non-polyglutamine domains.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>These findings validate that the rate of aggregation modulates polyglutamine-mediated intracellular dysfunction, and caution that molecules designed to specifically hasten aggregation may be detrimental as therapies for polyglutamine disorders. Moreover, our findings introduce a novel antibody-based tool that, as a consequence of its general specificity for fibrillar conformations and its ability to function intracellularly, offers broad research potential for a variety of human amyloid diseases.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Abnormal aggregation of polypeptides into amyloid-like fibrils is associated with more than 20 known human disorders collectively referred to as protein misfolding or conformational diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005727-Uversky1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Despite little shared sequence homology, amyloid-forming polypeptides show a common propensity to misfold into highly-ordered polymers that are rich in fibrillar &#x003b2;-sheet structure. Distinct amyloidogenic polypeptides are genetically implicated in the progression of human neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, polyglutamine, and prion diseases. Human polyglutamine disorders such as Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) and Huntington's disease (HD) are caused by aberrant codon expansion of CAG trinucleotide tracts within unrelated genes encoding polyglutamine-domain proteins. In HD, expansions beyond 37 consecutive glutamines within the huntingtin protein confer a toxic gain-of-function phenotype related to its intracellular aggregation in neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005727-Bates1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Proteinaceous huntingtin aggregates are diagnostic hallmarks of HD neuropathology and coincide with neurological symptoms in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005727-Gutekunst1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> as well as in transgenic models of the disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005727-Weiss1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. These intracellular aggregates are composed chiefly of polyglutamine-containing amino-terminal fragments of huntingtin that arise by proteolysis. Consequently, the first exon of the human Huntingtin gene (Htt exon1) containing an expanded CAG repeat is sufficient to induce HD-like pathology, including intracellular aggregates and neurodegeneration, in transgenic mice models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005727-Mangiarini1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Likewise, neuronal protein inclusions are clinically observed in MJD and arise through aberrant expansion of the polyglutamine-encoding CAG repeat within the ataxin-3/MJD1/SCA3 locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005727-Paulson1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Following destabilization of native protein folding by expanded polyglutamine domains, the aggregation of mutant huntingtin or ataxin-3 proceeds by nucleated growth polymerization into protein fibrils that structurally resemble amyloid fibrils and react with amyloid-specific histochemical dyes such as Congo Red or thioflavin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005727-Ellisdon1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005727-Scherzinger1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

Amyloid fibrils are thought to be nucleated by monomers or globular oligomers of misfolded protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005727-Poirier1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. In turn, fibrils may co-assemble into much larger insoluble protein aggregates that are resistant to proteolysis. While it is clear that protein misfolding can elicit cellular toxicity, whether fibrillar protein aggregates are themselves toxic remains the subject of intense debate. On one hand, a growing body of evidence supports the &#x0201c;toxic soluble precursor&#x0201d; hypothesis in which end-stage protein fibrils are increasingly considered benign or even cytoprotective <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005727-Ross1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005727-Arrasate1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, these conformation-specific antibodies cannot be readily implemented inside living cells to investigate the conformational toxicity of intracellular amyloidogenic proteins such as huntingtin, &#x003b1;-synuclein, and ataxin-3 in situ. In an alternative approach, recombinant single-chain Fv (scFv) antibodies, which preserve the binding specificities of monoclonal antibodies within the framework of a single small polypeptide, can be selected in vitro and expressed intracellularly as &#x0201c;intrabodies&#x0201d; to probe huntingtin and &#x003b1;-synuclein in living cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005727-Zhou1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005727-Lecerf1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

Here, we demonstrate that one such scFv antibody (scFv-6E) selected against fibrillar &#x003b1;-synuclein targets isomorphic conformations of mutant huntingtin and ataxin-3 and enhances the aggregation propensity of these polyglutamine proteins in striatal cells. Using intrabodies as kinetic tools for controlling amyloidogenesis, we show that accelerating polyglutamine aggregation is not cytoprotective but rather aggravates intracellular dysfunction and cell death. These findings validate the importance of aggregation kinetics in modulating the severity of polyglutamine-mediated neuronal dysfunction.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Fibril-specific scFv-6E intrabody co-localizes with intracellular aggregates of misfolded httex1 and ataxin-3</title><p>Antibody scFv-6E was isolated by panning a synthetic human scFv library against purified &#x003b1;-synuclein amyloid fibrils using a combination of phage display and atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005727-Barkhordarian1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

Therefore, we tested scFv-6E in cellular models of polyglutamine disease using either human ataxin-3 (MJD1/SCA3) or a pathologic huntingtin fragment encoded by the first exon of the Huntingtin gene (Httex1), both of which form filamentous protein aggregates dependent on polyglutamine tract length <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005727-Ellisdon1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005727-Scherzinger1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Through live-cell microscopy, we confirmed that green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged versions of these misfolding-prone proteins formed intracellular aggregates in immortalized rat striatal progenitor cells (ST14A) with similar characteristics as widely documented in the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005727-Colby1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005727-Hazeki1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.

We included in our transfections a nuclear localization signal (NLS)-tagged monomeric red fluorescent protein (NLS-mRFP) to label nuclei. Aside from this general purpose, NLS-mRFP is a convenient marker for monitoring cellular stress in live cells, as its mislocalization to the cytoplasm is indicative of nuclear import collapse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005727-Kodiha1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005727-Stochaj1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.

The coalescence of misfolded httex1-72Q species into intensely fluorescent aggregates resulted in the disappearance of diffuse httex1-72Q-GFP species from the surrounding cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005727-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, arrows), highlighting the rapid precipitous nature of huntingtin aggregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005727-Hazeki1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, GFP-tagged mutant ataxin-3, containing an expanded polyglutamine tract (77Q) associated with MJD, predominately formed cytoplasmic aggregates in transfected ST14A cells over a similar time period whereas non-expanded ataxin-3 (24Q) localized diffusely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005727-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Unlike the case for httex1, ataxin-3 was not excluded from nucleoplasm and therefore nuclear aggregates of GFP-ataxin-3-77Q were occasionally present along with cytoplasmic aggregates. Striking differences in aggregate size and frequency were clearly evident between mutant ataxin-3 and httex1, as inclusions were observed in &#x0223c;70&#x00025; of httex1-72Q transfected cells by 48 hours but in only &#x0223c;20&#x00025; of ataxin-3-77Q transfected cells over a similar time period, with ataxin-3-77Q inclusions appearing much smaller than httex1 inclusions.

At 48 hours post-transfection, we observed 33&#x000b1;2.2&#x00025; more GFP-labeled httex1-72Q aggregates in the cytoplasm of cells co-transfected with scFv-6E intrabody than with vector alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005727-g005">Fig. 5A, B</xref>), in good agreement with our in vitro findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005727-g004">Fig. 4</xref>).

The ability of scFv-6E to target intracellular amyloids offered a unique opportunity to test these models in situ.

Approximately 48 hours post-transfection, ST14A cells were incubated with propidium iodide (PI), a membrane-impermeant dye that labels necrotic cell nuclei following membrane damage, and PI fluorescence was co-sorted against GFP-labeled httex1 fluorescence by flow cytometry.

Accelerating the aggregation of mutant httex1 with scFv-6E intrabody elicited a further increase in PI-staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005727-g007">Fig. 7B, C</xref>), particularly among cells exhibiting large or numerous inclusions as indicated by a prominent forward shift in GFP fluorescence intensity (10<sup>3</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>4</sup> AFU, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005727-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>, see arrows) within these cells. This small but statistically significant (p&#x0003c;0.001) increase in cell death is consistent with the modest increase in httex1-72Q aggregate load (33&#x000b1;2.2&#x00025;) elicited by scFv-6E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005727-g005">Fig. 5A, B</xref>).

Thus, non-pathologic ataxin-3 could be transformed into a toxic protein by stabilizing and accelerating its intrinsic ability to aggregate using scFv-6E. Compared to parallel data collected against mutant httex1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005727-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005727-g007">7C</xref>), these 6E-mediated effects appeared more robust with ataxin-3, likely due to kinetic differences in the amyloidogenic properties of these two polyglutamine proteins. In the absence of intrabody, we noted that ataxin-3 formed fewer aggregates than mutant httex1 in ST14A cells, suggesting that the amyloidogenesis of full-length ataxin-3 occurs with a longer lag-phase inside cells, and thus a greater window of opportunity may exist for scFv-6E intrabody to influence aggregation. Interestingly, oxidative stress was not significantly associated with ataxin-3 aggregation and toxicity as measured using DHE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005727-g008">Fig. 8C</xref>), unlike the case for mutant httex1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005727-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>).

Accumulating evidence from HD and other amyloidogenic disease models has led to the &#x0201c;toxic soluble precursor&#x0201d; hypothesis, which proposes that toxic intermediates formed during amyloidogenesis might be &#x0201c;detoxified&#x0201d; through their polymerization into insoluble amyloid-like fibrils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005727-Ross1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. As a result, visible protein aggregates are increasingly thought to fulfill a protective cellular response. This model is indirectly supported by cytoprotective evidence obtained using small molecules that promote the intracellular aggregation of huntingtin as well as &#x003b1;-synuclein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005727-Bodner1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> via an undetermined mechanism. In this study, we demonstrate a direct enhancement of huntingtin and ataxin-3 aggregation using a fibril-specific scFv antibody (scFv-6E) that discriminates intracellular aggregates in situ. This conformation-specific scFv recognizes a fibrillar epitope also characteristic of &#x003b1;-synuclein, which scFv-6E was originally selected against <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005727-Barkhordarian1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Since little sequence homology exists between &#x003b1;-synuclein, huntingtin, and ataxin-3, we speculate that scFv-6E recognizes a structural epitope common to amyloid morphologies such as the cross &#x003b2;-sheet motif. As a result, conformation-specific scFv antibodies such as 6E have broad research potential for a variety of human amyloid disorders. Using scFv-6E as a kinetic tool for enhancing amyloidogenesis, we show that targeting aggregation of mutant huntingtin in striatal cells is not protective, but rather promotes oxidative stress and cell death. These results are consistent with prior findings demonstrating a role for misfolded huntingtin in eliciting mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005727-Rockabrand1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005727-Firdaus1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. A similar inter-relationship between aggregation and toxicity is observed for both normal and disease-associated ataxin-3, although through a mechanism apparently distinct from oxidative stress.

Instead, we observed that cellular toxicity ultimately correlated with the formation of visible polyglutamine aggregates. Consistent with this observation, blocking aggregate-formation using an intrabody (scFv-C4) that binds within the first 17 amino acid residues of huntingtin potently suppressed httex1-mediated toxicity, analogous to its protective role in other HD models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005727-Lecerf1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005727-Wolfgang1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005727-Murphy1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>.

This group identified a cytoprotective compound called B2 that indiscriminately boosts the size of httex1 and &#x003b1;-synuclein inclusions, perhaps through an inhibitory effect on SIRT2 histone deacetylase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005727-Outeiro1">&#x0005b;68&#x0005d;</xref>. Since compound B2 does not interact directly with huntingtin or &#x003b1;-synuclein, its cytoprotective effects may be pleiotropic and unrelated to inclusion body formation, analogous to the protective role of heat-shock protein Hsp27, which shows indirect activity in modulating huntingtin aggregation but a more fundamental role in antagonizing caspase activation and apoptosis in HD models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005727-Wyttenbach1">&#x0005b;69&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, our fibril-specific scFv-6E antibody directly stimulates httex1 aggregation in solution and co-localizes with ataxin-3 and httex1 inclusions in situ, suggesting that scFv-6E interacts directly with amyloidogenic polypeptides through a conformational epitope produced during fibrillogenesis. It is possible that scFv-6E intrabody, by increasing aggregate load, might expand the protein-recruiting surface area of intracellular aggregates, which in turn could enhance toxicity by sequestering more aggregate-interacting proteins away from their native functions. In this context, compound B2 appears to decrease the net surface area of aggregates by amassing multiple small aggregates into a single large inclusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005727-Bodner1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. This apparent relationship between aggregate size and &#x0201c;toxic surface area&#x0201d; deserves further investigation, especially with regard to intracellular amyloidogenic proteins in compound aggregated states such as inclusion bodies and aggresomes.

Using intrabodies to alter the kinetics of amyloidogenesis, our data illustrates that the overall speed of aggregate formation bears more relevance to the severity of intracellular dysfunction than whether or not inclusions are present at any given time point. Indeed, time-lapse microscopy in a PC12 cell model of HD has revealed that aggregation tends to occur rapidly in cells that die with inclusions and much slower in cells that survive with inclusions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005727-Gong1">&#x0005b;73&#x0005d;</xref>. We conclude that the rate of aggregation likely influences the magnitude of cellular dysfunction elicited by aggregation, such as oxidative stress in the case of mutant httex1. Hence, escalating the formation of httex1 aggregates with a fibril-specific intrabody heightens oxidative stress and results in greater toxicity in ST14A striatal cells. In contrast, suppressing aggregation with an intrabody that shields the amyloidogenic N-terminus of mutant huntingtin in fact reduces oxidative stress and toxicity in these cells. Importantly, oxidative stress complements several prevailing models of HD pathogenesis, including excitoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation, as evidenced by the ability of the mitochondrial poison 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) to mimic striatum-specific HD-like motor defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005727-Alexi1">&#x0005b;75&#x0005d;</xref>.

In total, our findings support the general notion that polyglutamine aggregate-formation contributes to neurodegeneration by sensitizing cells to physiologic or environmental stress. In this regard, blocking or slowing aggregation elicits a strong cytoprotective effect in our study. These implications may hold importance for other protein misfolding diseases such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), tauopathies, and Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and prion disorders.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Expression plasmids</title><p>cDNA encoding scFv-6E (GenBank accession number FJ695518) was amplified by PCR using complementary primers that introduced a 5&#x02032; Kozak initiation sequence for mammalian expression and a 3&#x02032; HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) for biochemical detection.

For scFv binding, purified 6E or &#x003b1;-PLB scFvs were incubated on fibril-coated mica for an additional 10 minutes followed by copious rinsing and drying under N<sub>2</sub> gas. Fibril height measurements were performed at three different sections of mica using Scanning Probe Imaging Processor (SPIP) software (Image Metrology). Approximately 10 to 20 cross-sectional surface heights were measured per fibril using line profiles drawn perpendicular to the fibril axis.

Images were captured 48 hours post-transfection with a SPOT RT Color CCD camera using SPOT Advanced software (Diagnostic Instruments). Camera exposure times were reduced when imaging protein aggregates due to their intense fluorescence. Digital images were overlayed and cropped using Adobe Photoshop. GFP-labeled httex1 or ataxin-3 aggregates were scored in live ST14A cells by counting the number of visual fluorescent aggregates from 5 separate 20&#x000d7;-objective fields, each showing high percentages of transfected cells, in a single well.

Labeled cells were sorted by fluorescence using a BD FACSCalibur Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences) and a minimum of 30,000 events were recorded per sample using BD CellQuest Pro software. GFP and YOPRO-1 were detected with an FL1 detector, mRFP with FL2, and propidium iodide with FL3. Prior to each experiment, the flow cytometer was calibrated against three control groups: (1) unstained ST14A cells to gate autofluorescence, (2) unstained ST14A cells expressing GFP- or mRFP-tagged httex1-25Q alone to identify transfected cells, and (3) stained ST14A cells pre-treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for maximal PI or YOPRO-1 uptake.
