In plant cryptochromes, light activation is proposed to result from photoreduction of a protein-bound flavin chromophore through intramolecular electron transfer. However, although similar in structure to plant cryptochromes, the light-response mechanism of animal cryptochromes remains entirely unknown. To complicate matters further, there is currently a debate on whether mammalian cryptochromes respond to light at all or are instead activated by non&#x02013;light-dependent mechanisms. To resolve these questions, we have expressed both human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> cryptochrome proteins to high levels in living Sf21 insect cells using a baculovirus-derived expression system. Intact cells are irradiated with blue light, and the resulting cryptochrome photoconversion is monitored by fluorescence and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic techniques. We demonstrate that light induces a change in the redox state of flavin bound to the receptor in both human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> cryptochromes. Photoreduction from oxidized flavin and subsequent accumulation of a semiquinone intermediate signaling state occurs by a conserved mechanism that has been previously identified for plant cryptochromes. These results provide the first evidence of how animal-type cryptochromes are activated by light in living cells. Furthermore, human cryptochrome is also shown to undergo this light response. Therefore, human cryptochromes in exposed peripheral and/or visual tissues may have novel light-sensing roles that remain to be elucidated.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Vision in animals is generally associated with light-sensitive rhodopsin pigments located in the eyes.

We expressed recombinant cryptochromes to high levels in living cells, irradiated the cells with blue light, and analyzed the proteins' response to irradiation with electron paramagnetic resonance and fluorescence spectroscopic techniques. Photoreduction of protein-bound oxidized FAD cofactor to its radical form emerged as the primary cryptochrome photoreaction in living cells, and was correlated with a light-sensitive biological response in whole organisms.

The defining characteristic of a cryptochrome-type photoreceptor is therefore a light receptor molecule that is structurally highly similar to DNA photolyases, but has lost DNA repair activity and acquired a novel role in signaling.</p><p>Subsequent to their discovery in plants, cryptochromes were identified in animal (human and mouse) systems by isolation of homologous cDNAs whose encoded proteins were likewise not functional in DNA repair &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. Interestingly, these animal-type cryptochromes were more similar to a type of DNA photolyase that repairs 6&#x02013;4 photoproducts, than to the type I cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD)-repairing DNA photolyases to which the plant cryptochromes are most closely related.

A signaling role for animal-type cryptochromes was first identified in insects, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila melanogaster</named-content> (<named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content>), through isolation of a mutation in the <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> cryptochrome (Dmcry) resulting in failure to properly entrain the peripheral circadian clock &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. The role of Dmcry as a light-sensing input to the circadian clock is now well established, occurring by interaction of Dmcry with known clock proteins such as timeless or period &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, although derived from different evolutionary photolyase ancestors, both plant Atcry1 and Dmcry act as signaling molecules that undergo light-sensitive interactions with partners to initiate signaling reactions. A schematic of the basic structural characteristics and evolutionary relation of cryptochromes and photolyases is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060160-g001">Figure 1</xref>A.</p><fig id="pbio-0060160-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Cryptochromes and DNA Photolyases</title><p>(A) Evolutionary relatedness and domain structure of plant and animal cryptochromes.

In the dark, the flavin chromophore is in its oxidized redox state. Blue light induces conversion to a meta-stable semiquinone redox state that is the activated signaling state. Green light causes further reduction to the fully reduced redox state of flavin, which is inactive in signaling. In the dark, fully reduced flavin reoxidizes to the fully oxidized form and can be reactivated by blue light.

Through a combination of in vitro studies with purified proteins and whole-cell in vivo spectroscopic techniques, it was deduced that protein-bound flavin both in Atcry1 and Atcry2 is reduced by blue light through intraprotein electron transfer resulting in accumulation of a relatively long-lived semiquinone intermediate form which is believed to represent the active signaling state &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b015">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;.

When returned to darkness, plant cryptochromes slowly reoxidize back to the fully oxidized state of the flavin chromophore. In DNA photolyases, a similar light-induced photoreduction, known as photoactivation, can also occur but is relatively unimportant to biological activity since generally the FAD cofactor of DNA photolyase is fully reduced and mostly remains in this redox state independent of light conditions in vivo &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore, plant cryptochromes have apparently transformed a minor photoreaction intrinsic to DNA photolyases to form the basis for a novel function as photoreceptor; a summary of the plant cryptochrome photocycle is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060160-g001">Figure 1</xref>B.</p><p>The mechanism of light activation of animal-type cryptochromes is currently unknown. Although structurally similar to plant cryptochromes, the animal proteins apparently stem from 6&#x02013;4 photolyase-type ancestors and not from CPD photolyases (which are related to plant cryptochromes) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d; and so could have evolved a different photocycle. Nevertheless, purified preparations of Dmcry have been recently shown to undergo a photoreduction reaction similar to plant cryptochromes in vitro, to a relatively stable radical intermediate &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, studies of wavelength sensitivity show little Dmcry activity above 500 nm (green/red) light &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. These characteristics are consistent with the known mechanism of activation of plant cryptochromes. On the other hand, mutation of conserved tryptophan residues that play a role in photoreduction &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d; to redox inactive Phe have not been reported to affect biological activity of either mouse cry &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d; or a recently characterized insect cryptochrome from monarch butterfly (<named-content content-type="genus-species">Danaus plexippus</named-content>) (Dpcry1) and from other insects &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>A further complication arose with the identification of a light-independent function for mammalian cryptochromes. Transgenic mice in which both existing cryptochrome alleles (mcry1 and mcry2) had been knocked out showed a complete absence of rhythmic activity. This led to the conclusion that mammalian cryptochrome functions as a central component of the circadian oscillator &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;. Like insect cryptochromes, mcry1 and mcry2 were shown to interact with known components of the mammalian clock and thereby obtain a novel biological role. However, these interactions were entirely independent of light &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;, and moreover, the clock phenotype of mcry1 and mcry2 occurs in continuous darkness without light interruption over several days. Mammalian cryptochromes are similar to insect cryptochromes and apparently stem from the same 6&#x02013;4 photolyase ancestor. Moreover, they are flavoproteins and show conservation in amino acids required for light activation in photolyases and other cryptochromes. Despite these similarities, the light-independent nature of mammalian cryptochrome response leads to the question of whether these signaling molecules retain the ability to respond to light at all.</p><p>The aim of the present study is to resolve the question of whether and how light activates animal-type cryptochromes. We have employed in vivo spectroscopic techniques including a novel application of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) to detect photoconversion of flavin and accumulation of radical in living whole cells. We have examined both Dmcry and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Homo sapiens</named-content> cryptochrome-1 (Hscry1) as representative light-sensitive and light-insensitive cryptochromes, respectively. These experiments showed that light activation of animal cryptochromes occurs by photoreduction and accumulation of a radical signaling intermediate, similar to plant cryptochromes and unlike photolyases. Furthermore, because Hscry1 undergoes the same photoreactions, mammalian cry is demonstrated to have the capacity to function as a light sensor.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>In plant cryptochromes cry1 and cry2, the dark state of the flavin is in the oxidized form in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060160-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). To determine the nature of the dark state of flavin in animal-type cryptochromes, we measured a classic action spectrum for Dmcry activity in living flies. An action spectrum is a dose-response curve for photoreceptor sensitivity in which the response of an organism is determined at multiple wavelengths of light and at multiple light intensities at each wavelength. In this way, the response will depend on how well the photoreceptor absorbs light at the given wavelength. The wavelength at which peak activity can be observed in the living organism indicates the absorption maximum (in which the light is absorbed at highest efficiency) of the responsible photoreceptor. If performed to sufficient resolution, such action spectra can be compared to the absorption spectrum of a purified pigment or photoreceptor and in this way identify the nature of the photoactive pigment implicated in a given biological response &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>As a possible assay for Dmcry function, we investigated its characteristic property of degradation that followed upon photoreceptor activation. Levels of Dmcry protein decrease rapidly in flies subsequent to blue-light irradiation, likely due to conformational change in the photoreceptor leading to targeting to the proteasome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. This degradation can be quantitatively monitored by western blot analysis with Dmcry antibody. However, in order to be useful for action spectroscopy, the amplitude of the response (decline in Dmcry concentration) must be proportional to the number of photons of light energy absorbed by the photoreceptor, and not simply a delayed response with little direct relation to the light input signal. To test this property, we irradiated living flies for fixed time intervals with blue light (450 nm) and observed decrease in levels of Dmcry protein over time as previously described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060160-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Importantly, when blue-light irradiation was performed at different blue-light intensities, the time required to reach a given decline in Dmcry protein levels was proportional to the given light intensity. For example, to obtain a decrease to 50&#x00025; of the original Dmcry protein concentration requires 6.2 min at irradiance of 200 &#x003bc;mol m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> sec<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, 9.3 min at 150 &#x003bc;mol m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> sec<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, and 12.5 min at 100 &#x003bc;mol m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> sec<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060160-g002">Figure 2</xref>A), respectively. Therefore, Dmcry degradation obeys the Bunsen-Roscoe law of reciprocity, indicating that it is a response to the total number of photons, independent of irradiance time, and so represents an accurate measure of photoreceptor light responsivity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><fig id="pbio-0060160-g002" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Redox State of Animal Cryptochromes and Photoreduction In Vivo</title><p>(A) Time course of Dmcry protein degradation in irradiated flies.

Shorter wavelengths are impractical because of the increasing absorption from cell components and therefore increasing errors. Levels of Dmcry protein were monitored by western blot analysis. Illumination time was varied to provide the different irradiance, as permitted by reciprocity. Shorter or longer wavelengths of light proved to be ineffective at eliciting significant response (unpublished data).

We performed baculovirus-driven expression of Dmcry and Hscry1 cryptochromes in Sf21 insect cells, where photoreceptor protein accumulates to sufficiently high levels for direct application of spectroscopic and biophysical techniques in vivo &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. To verify whether cryptochrome-bound flavin can be directly observed, expressing whole Sf21 cells were harvested and placed intact inside a fluorimeter. Fluorescence emission was measured at 525 nm (characteristic of oxidized flavin) over an excitation range of 400&#x02013;500 nm. Despite the substantial scatter due to measurements of these living intact cells, there was clearly observable signal increase peaking for excitation at 450 nm in cells overexpressing both Dmcry and Hscry1 as compared to uninfected control cells. These results are consistent with oxidized flavin bound to the dark state of the photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060160-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). These data showing increased oxidized flavin in cryptochrome-expressing cells are in agreement with the resting state of Dmcry determined from action spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060160-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Interestingly, mammalian cryptochrome also accumulates in the oxidized form and thereby shows functional similarity to Dmcry and not to DNA photolyases. Similar results have been previously obtained for Atcry1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>To initiate the photochemical reaction, Dmcry- or Hscry1-expressing cells were irradiated with blue light and returned to the fluorimeter at intervals for measurement of excitation spectra. This assay detects change in levels of oxidized flavin in these living cells. For both Dmcry and Hscry1, peak excitation at 450 nm showed a progressive decrease over time that matches the spectra for photoreduction of oxidized flavin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060160-g002">Figure 2</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060160-g002">2</xref>D). This decrease was not due to protein degradation since both Dmcry and Hscry1 protein levels remain stable throughout the time course of illumination in Sf21 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060160-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). Furthermore, flavin reoxidation is observed when illuminated cell cultures are returned to darkness (unpublished data), indicating that no cryptochrome degradation has occurred. Therefore, both tested cryptochromes had undergone a photoreaction in vivo, leading to change in redox state of protein-bound flavin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060160-g002">Figure 2</xref>D).</p><p>A similar reaction, known as photoactivation, occurs in DNA photolyases, wherein the flavin chromophore is converted to the fully reduced form by an electron transfer reaction ultimately fed by an extrinsic reductant. An intraprotein electron transfer pathway from the protein surface to the buried flavin has been derived for this light-driven reaction in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content> DNA photolyase (EcPl) based on crystallographic structural information and on a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and spectroscopy &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b035">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. This pathway comprises a chain of three tryptophan residues (W382&#x02013;W359&#x02013;W306) that are highly conserved throughout the photolyase/cryptochrome family. Recently, a study with purified Atcry1 has demonstrated the functional relevance of this reaction to cryptochrome photoreceptor activity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d; by substitution of redox-inactive phenylalanines for two tryptophan residues, W400 and W324, which are found in the Atcry1 sequence and crystal structure &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d; at the homologous positions to W382 and W306 of EcPl, respectively. These mutant proteins (W400F and W324F) lack the predicted electron donor proximal to the flavin (W400) or exposed to the protein surface (W324). Both proteins were found to have impaired electron transfer activity in vitro and reduced biological activity in living plants. To determine whether flavin photoreduction may occur by a similar pathway of intermolecular electron transfer in animal-type cryptochromes, we have made point mutations in Dmcry of two conserved tryptophan residues. One mutation is distal to the flavin in this pathway (W342F), which corresponds to W306 in EcPl and W328F in Dpcry1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;, respectively. Second, we have introduced a substitution into the middle member of the electron transfer chain of Dmcry, corresponding to W359 of EcPl. The mutant Dmcry proteins were expressed in Sf21 insect cells to high levels and subjected to in vivo fluorescence spectroscopy to follow flavin photoreduction.</p><p>For determination of in vivo photoreduction, cryptochrome-expressing Sf21 cells were irradiated with blue light and returned to the fluorimeter periodically to determine remaining levels of oxidized flavins. Unexpectedly, both wild-type and mutant Dmcry proteins showed similar rates of photoreduction in these living cells at high light intensity (150 &#x003bc;mol m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> sec<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> white light), as did the W400F mutant of Atcry1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060160-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). This result is surprising since purified preparations of Atcry1 W400F protein and of the W328F Dpcry1 (homolog to Dmcry W342F) showed greatly reduced photoreduction in vitro at even higher light intensities, and there was no significant radical accumulation after this time period &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore, the efficiency of cryptochrome photoconversion in vivo is much higher than that of the purified, isolated protein in vitro, perhaps due to a more conducive redox environment and the presence of relevant electron donors/acceptors in vivo. Nevertheless, at lower photon fluence (10 &#x003bc;mol m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> sec<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> blue light), a significant decline in the rate of photoreduction is observed in the phenylalanine mutants of both Dmcry and Atcry1 as compared to wild-type proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060160-g003">Figure 3</xref>B&#x02014;see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060160-sg004">Figure 4</xref>SA and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060160-sg004">4</xref>SB for experiments performed with further reduced photon fluence).

Interestingly, there was detectable amount of a radical present even in the dark in some samples (see trace D), although not in all trials, perhaps due to concentrations below our level of detection.

Saturating illumination (40 &#x003bc;mol m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> sec<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> blue light) leads to accumulation of a radical intermediate form.</p><p>To further characterize these signals, X-band&#x02013;pulsed ENDOR spectroscopy was applied to illuminated whole cells expressing Dmcry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060160-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). The observed spectrum in the expressing cells (trace A) is very similar to that obtained from the purified Dmcry protein (trace B). Both spectra differ from those of neutral flavin radicals as seen in plant cryptochromes and corroborate the assignment to an anionic radical species as given previously for the purified protein &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. Taken together, the in vivo spectroscopic data conclusively indicate that the photocycle for both Dmcry and Hscry1 involves light-dependent flavin reduction and accumulation of the radical state.</p><p>Finally, it is necessary to establish the biological relevance of the observed in vivo photoconversion of animal cryptochromes. In plant cryptochromes, the radical state has been demonstrated to be the biologically active signaling state for both Atcry1 and Atcry2 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. This conclusion resulted from the observation that green light reversed the effect of blue light in the course of cryptochrome activation, due to photoconversion of the active, radical form to the fully reduced, inactive species &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d; (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060160-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). A simple means to determine whether light-induced radical accumulation also has biological relevance for animal cryptochromes in vivo is therefore to measure whether green light (above 525 nm) affects both Dmcry protein accumulation and the kinetics of cryptochrome photoreduction.</p><p>To test this prediction, we performed bichromatic irradiation of flies simultaneously with blue and green light (B&#x0002b;G) and compared the response to that obtained with the identical intensity of blue light by itself (B) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060160-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). Green-light irradiation by itself resulted in no change in Dmcry protein levels (unpublished data). In each of three independent trials, we observed more rapid decline in Dmcry protein levels in blue light (B) as compared to coirradiation with blue and green light (B&#x0002b;G). This antagonistic effect can only be explained by photoconversion of the (green-light absorbing) radical signaling state to an inactive redox form. In the case of Dmcry-expressing cell cultures, an effect of green light on cryptochrome photoreduction was directly monitored. Cell cultures irradiated with blue and green light (B&#x0002b;G) show accelerated photoreduction of Dmcry as compared to blue light (B) alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060160-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). Although the accumulation of fully reduced flavin can not be directly monitored by this technique, these data are consistent with a shift in the overall flavin photoequilibrium subsequent to formation of the radical, and thereby consistent with the effect of green light on biological activity observed in living flies.</p><fig id="pbio-0060160-g005" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Green Light Alters Cryptochrome Photoconversion In Vivo That Correlates with Function</title><p>(A) Living flies dark adapted for 3 d were irradiated with either blue (B) (445 &#x000b1; 10 nm, 10 &#x003bc;mol m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) light or bichromatically with (445 &#x000b1; 10 nm, 10 &#x003bc;mol m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) plus green (G) (550 &#x000b1; 25 nm, 50 &#x003bc;mol m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) light (B&#x0002b;G).

To address this question, we have assayed for a form of activation of Hscry1 in response to light in living flies, where endogenous cryptochrome (Dmcry) is known to undergo light-dependent changes resulting in proteolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060160-g002">Figure 2</xref>).

Expression of the recombinant Hscry1 was verified by western blot analysis in two independent transformed lines (A and B).

Interestingly, as is the case for Dmcry, significant decrease in Hscry1 protein levels were observed shortly after transfer to white light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060160-g006">Figure 6</xref>). These results indicate that Hscry1 undergoes light-dependent proteolysis as does Dmcry in living flies.

This mechanism contrasts with that of DNA photolyases in which flavin is fully reduced for catalytic activity.

The current study extends these prior observations by providing sufficient fine structure to identify oxidized flavin, with peak of activity at 450 nm and defined shoulders around 420 and 480 nm, as the likely responsible photopigment in the visible range.

It is therefore likely that the reported near-UV responsivity of Dmcry in Schneider cells also results from light absorption by a folate (or another, yet unspecified) antenna pigment. In that case, absence of near-UV responsivity in Dmcry extracted from whole flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060160-g002">Figure 2</xref>B) suggests that the second chromophore of animal-type cryptochromes may not be available in the majority of insect cell types. This is in line with older experiments done with DNA photolyases, where a low binding constant of the folate chromophore and a therefore heterogeneous folate concentration was concluded.</p><p>In plant (Atcry1 and Atcry2) cryptochromes, flavin photoreduction leading to a meta-stable neutral radical accumulation can be observed in in vitro experiments. This property of purified plant cryptochrome contrasts published DNA photolyase data, in which oxidized flavin is rapidly converted to the fully reduced redox state (necessary for DNA repair).

Their interpretation focused on the observation that substitution of amino acids necessary for flavin photoreduction in vitro does not abolish biological activity of these proteins in vivo. This apparent discrepancy between the absence of photoreduction in vitro yet significant biological activity in vivo is resolved by the observation that amino acid substitutions abolishing in vitro photoreduction of purified Dmcry does not, in fact, abolish photoreduction activity in vivo.

The same is true for the W400F mutant of Atcry1, which shows normal rates of photoreduction in vivo under high light intensities even though flavin photoreduction in vitro is virtually zero under these conditions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. Cryptochrome photoreduction, therefore, occurs far more efficiently, and by additional alternate pathways, in vivo than is observed for the purified protein in vitro. A similar discrepancy between the light required to activate a purified photoreceptor protein in vitro as compared to activation in vivo has been noted for other photoreceptors, for instance, the class of phototropins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d; in which blue-light&#x02013;dependent autophosphorylation requires a much higher irradiance in vitro to obtain a similar effect than is required in vivo.</p><p>Results from recent studies showing reduced biological activity at lower light intensity in the W342F mutant of Dmcry &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d; are consistent with our observed reduced rates of photoreduction at low photon fluence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060160-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). Although quantitation was not formally performed, a prior study in which function of amino acid substitutions in the Trp triad of Dmcry was analyzed &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d; also showed apparent reduced biological activity in W-F substitution mutants. In this study, the authors proposed that F can function as electron donor similarly to W, which, however, is not observed &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;; nevertheless, their data are entirely consistent with the present work. Finally, observations from point mutations that reduce the rate of radical formation in Apcry1 (C402A) abolish protein function in vivo &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d; are entirely consistent with our assignment of the radical as the signaling state of the receptor &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. A proposed mechanism whereby the anionic radical may be the resting state &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d; is unlikely given that peak activity is not observed at 470 nm either in the present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060160-g002">Figure 2</xref>) or former studies of wavelength sensitivity for this receptor &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The derived photocycle of animal cryptochromes is therefore similar to the reaction mechanism of plant cryptochromes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060160-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Both photocycles involve reduction of flavin leading to cycling between radical (active) and oxidized (inactive) redox forms. Since these different families of cryptochromes evolved independently from unrelated DNA repair enzyme ancestors, there must be a latent property of DNA photolyases that lends itself to development of photoreceptor properties. The likeliest possibility is that the flavin semiquinone form confers some conformational change on the protein, which can be recognized by yet-unidentified signaling partners and thereby be readily adapted to a role in a signaling pathway. In addition to the classic plant and animal-type cryptochromes, a third family of cryptochromes (cryDASH) has been identified in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> and many other organisms &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;. CryDASH cryptochromes are structurally similar to DNA photolyases, but do not efficiently repair DNA. They evolved from a 6&#x02013;4 photolyase ancestor but are apparently unrelated to either the plant (Atcry1 and Atcry2) or animal-type cryptochromes described in this study. Although no information as yet exists on the in vivo redox state and photocycle of cryDASH, the purified proteins are converted by light to the fully reduced flavin in vitro &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d; and retain some single-strand DNA repair activity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;, in this respect appearing more similar to DNA photolyases. It is therefore possible that an additional, entirely unrelated photocycle has evolved for cryDASH-type cryptochromes that is not similar to plant or animal-type cryptochromes.</p><p>Perhaps the most intriguing finding of the present study is that mammalian cryptochromes, in particular Hscry1, are responsive to light in vivo. Mammals are generally large, dense (and also often nocturnal) animals, and it makes sense that a molecule such as cryptochrome, which is an essential component of the circadian clock, should be regulated by other means than by direct absorption of light. In fact, with the exception of an isolated report of cryptochrome effect on pupil dilation in mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;, there has to date been no definite report of light-responsive phenotypes attributed to mammalian cryptochromes at all. Nevertheless, as the present study has shown, Hscry1 can undergo photoconversion in living organisms via a mechanism conserved with that of light-responsive cryptochromes. Hscry1 further undergoes light-dependent proteolysis in living flies, similar to the response mediated by appropriate E3 ubiquitin ligases such as COP1 in the case of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cry2 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060160-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d;, Therefore, the observed light sensitivity of Hscry1 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is likely to result from surface changes leading to fortuitous recognition of the activated form by a fly E3 ligase. Since Hscry1 is widely distributed in many tissue types of humans, it could be activated by light in the retina or in locations close to the surface, providing the basis for novel biological signaling functions that remain to be determined.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Interference filters and light sources.</title><p>As a light source, white light was produced by slide projectors placed before interference filters of 8&#x02013;15-nm half-band width (Schott Glaswerke).
