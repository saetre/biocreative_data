LY294002 also inhibits sperm-induced dephosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, breakdown of cyclin B2 and Mos, and first embryonic cleavage, all of which are events of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent egg activation. In fertilized eggs, an 85-kDa subunit of PI 3-kinase (p85) undergoes a transient translocation to the low-density, detergent-insoluble membranes (membrane microdomains) where Src tyrosine kinase signaling is operating. However, the tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 in fertilized eggs is not as evident as that in H2O2-activated eggs, arguing against the possibility that PI 3-kinase is activated by Src phosphorylation. Nevertheless, sperm-induced activation of PI 3-kinase has been demonstrated by the finding that Akt, a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase, is phosphorylated at threonine-308. The threonine-phosphorylated Akt also localizes to the membrane microdomains of fertilized eggs. Application of bp(V), an inhibitor of PTEN that dephosphorylates PIP3, the enzymatic product of PI 3-kinase, promotes parthenogenetic activation of <italic>Xenopus </italic>eggs.

This phenomenon is termed 'egg activation' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. A trigger of egg activation, which acts inside the fertilized egg after the egg-sperm union, is a transient increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>(Ca<sup>2+ </sup>transient) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. One important consequence of egg activation is that the egg acquires the ability to exclude additional fertilizing sperm (block to polyspermy). In many, but not all species, the block to polyspermy is achieved by an altered membrane potential and/or by the formation of a fertilization envelope. Another important consequence is that the activated egg resumes meiotic cell division. In the case of amphibian and most mammalian species, the meiotic cell cycle of unfertilized eggs pauses at metaphase II, and successful fertilization promotes meiotic resumption and extrusion of the second polar body. These egg activation events are followed by the fusion of maternal and paternal nuclei and the initiation of embryonic cell division that produce an offspring.</p><p>The sperm-induced Ca<sup>2+ </sup>transient, a key event in the initiation of egg activation, is commonly mediated by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), a second messenger that is produced by the phospholipase C (PLC)-catalyzed hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. The molecular mechanism operating between egg-sperm membrane interaction/fusion and the activation of PLC, however, varies among species: in mammals and the newt <italic>Cynops pyrrohogaster</italic>, introduction of the sperm-derived proteins PLC&#x003b6; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and citrate synthase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], respectively, may account for this task. In these cases, egg-sperm membrane fusion, rather than egg-sperm membrane interaction, is crucial for initiating the Ca<sup>2+ </sup>transient. On the other hand, for some sea invertebrates, fish and frogs, there is still a debate over the mechanism by which the egg undergoes a Ca<sup>2+ </sup>transient. That sequential activation of the egg-associated Src tyrosine kinase and PLC&#x003b3; is required for the Ca<sup>2+ </sup>transient in the sea urchin, starfish, fish, and frog [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] suggests that these species employ the membrane interaction machinery. Also, some membrane-associated molecules have been postulated as sperm-interacting and signal-transducing elements in <italic>Xenopus </italic>eggs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Several studies have evaluated the function of PI 3-kinase in the early developmental processes that operate in oocytes or early embryos of various species. In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, PI 3-kinase and Akt are required for insulin-induced, but not progesterone-induced, oocyte maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], although one report has shown a requirement of PI 3-kinase for progesterone-induced oocyte maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. There are also reports that the activation of &#x003b3;-subspecies of PI 3-kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] or application of wortmannin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] induces oocyte maturation. On the other hand, oocyte maturation in the ascidian [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and starfish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] has been shown to require activity of PI 3-kinase. Oocyte-specific deletion of PTEN is shown to cause premature activation of the primordial follicle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], suggesting that a precise level of PIP3 is important for this process.</p><p>Moreover, the importance of PI 3-kinase and/or Akt has been demonstrated in FGF-dependent signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and glucose transport in <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], the first mitotic cell division in the sea urchin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and starfish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], autocrine-mediated survival signaling of mouse two-cell embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], mesoderm induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], gastrulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] in <italic>Xenopus</italic>. Collectively, these studies demonstrate the general importance of PI 3-kinase and its enzymatic products in several aspects of development. However, a study on egg-associated PI 3-kinase and Akt with a focus on fertilization signaling has yet to be done, though Mehlmann et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] found that LY294002 does not inhibit Ca<sup>2+ </sup>transients in fertilized mouse eggs.</p><p>Here, we provide evidence that the sperm-induced Ca<sup>2+ </sup>transient requires the activity of the egg-associated PI 3-kinase in <italic>Xenopus</italic>. Many somatic cell systems utilize PI 3-kinase as a downstream effector of tyrosine kinase signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. In fertilized <italic>Xenopus </italic>eggs, however, tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase is not evident. On the other hand, PI 3-kinase seems to act as an upstream, positive regulator for the Src-PLC&#x003b3; pathway, because the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 inhibits the sperm-induced activation of Src, Ca<sup>2+ </sup>transient, and subsequent egg activation events. Subcellular fractionation studies demonstrate that the 85-kDa subunit of PI 3-kinase undergoes a transient translocation to low-density, detergent-insoluble membranes (membrane microdomains), where Src is present even before fertilization, awaiting a fertilization signal from sperm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Activation of PI 3-kinase in fertilized <italic>Xenopus </italic>eggs is suggested by the finding that Akt becomes phosphorylated at threonine-308 in fertilized eggs. These results highlight for the first time that activity of the egg PI 3-kinase may play an important role in signal transduction for fertilization.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We first examined the effect of LY294002, a potent PI 3-kinase inhibitor, on sperm-induced activation of the Src-PLC&#x003b3; pathway. We microinjected LY294002 into unfertilized <italic>Xenopus </italic>eggs at a final concentration of 10 &#x003bc;M. The injected eggs were inseminated for 5 min, fractionated, and examined for sperm-induced activation and phosphorylation of Src and PLC&#x003b3;, using immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and/or in vitro kinase assays (IVKA). LY294002 inhibited the sperm-induced activation of Src, as judged by the phosphorylation of tyrosine-419 in Src (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, IB: phospho-Src, lanes 1, 2, and 6) and by the kinase activity toward a synthetic peptide substrate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, IVKA: phospho-Cdk1). Tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC&#x003b3; was also inhibited by LY294002 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, IB: phospho-PLC&#x003b3;). As we reported earlier, a Src-specific inhibitor PP2 also had an inhibitory effect (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, lane 3). Neither the inactive analog PP3 (lane 4) nor U73122 (lane 5), a PLC-specific inhibitor, showed such an effect.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Inhibition of early events of <italic>Xenopus </italic>egg fertilization by LY294002, a potent PI 3-kinase inhibitor</bold>.

SDS (0.1%)-solubilized egg membrane fractions (500 &#x003bc;g/lane) abundant in Src and PLC&#x003b3; were analyzed for tyrosine phosphorylation of Src (top panel, IB: phospho-Src), activation of Src (middle panels, IVKA: phospho-Cdk1; IVKA: protein amounts of the immunoprecipitated Src), and tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC&#x003b3; (bottom panel, IB: phospho-PLC&#x003b3;) as described in "Methods".

Therefore, we examined the effect of LY294002 on the downstream events of the Src-PLC&#x003b3; pathway; namely the transient Ca<sup>2+ </sup>release (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), inactivation of components of the cytostatic factor (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), and first cell cleavage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). All of the LY294002-injected eggs exhibited features of an impaired transient Ca<sup>2+ </sup>release, as monitored using the fluorescent signal of fura-2 that was introduced into the eggs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Seven of nine eggs tested showed no transient Ca<sup>2+ </sup>release, and two of nine showed a transient Ca<sup>2+ </sup>release of decreased amplitude (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). LY294002 also had an inhibitory effect on the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent breakdown of the Mos protein kinase and cyclin B2 as well as dephosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). These Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent events are required for cancelling the arrest of the second meiotic cell cycle and for starting embryonic cell division. Actually, eggs injected with 10 &#x003bc;M LY294002 failed to undergo normal first cell cleavage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>).</p><p>We also examined the effect of LY294002 on egg activation, as evaluated by the occurrence of cortical contraction, induced by several artificial egg activators. LY294002 effectively inhibited the egg activation induced by cathepsin B at 5 U/ml (23 of 90 eggs showed cortical contraction). On the other hand, the egg activation induced by A23187 at 2 &#x003bc;M and that by H2O2 at 10 mM were not inhibited; 85 of 90 eggs and 76 of 90 eggs were activated, respectively. These data suggest that egg activation by cathepsin B, which mimics the action of sperm protease and requires the egg Src activity, also requires the activity of PI 3-kinase. It should be noted that we did not employ LY294002 higher than 10 &#x003bc;M, because it required more volume of DMSO solution to be injected that would show a toxic effect on eggs.</p><p>Immunoblotting demonstrated that an 85-kDa subunit of PI 3-kinase, hereafter termed p85; is expressed in unfertilized <italic>Xenopus </italic>eggs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Subcellular fractionation experiments demonstrated that p85 is predominantly present in the detergent-soluble fractions of unfertilized eggs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). However, fertilization promoted a transient accumulation of p85 in low-density, detergent-insoluble membranes (LD-DIM or membrane microdomains) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, IB: p85). The sperm-induced translocation of p85 to membrane microdomains (2 min) occurred as early as the transient translocation of PLC&#x003b3; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, IB: PLC&#x003b3;, 2 min) and preceded the tyrosine phosphorylation of uroplakin III (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, IB: pUPIII, 5 min), both of which are biochemical signs of the activation of Src in fertilized <italic>Xenopus </italic>eggs. These translocation and phosphorylation events were shown to cease in 40-min inseminated egg samples, where dephosphorylation of MAPK is taking place (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, IB: pMAPK, 40 min). Translocation of p85 to the egg membrane microdomains was also seen when eggs were treated with either hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or cathepsin B, which are artificial egg activators involved in the activation of Src (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, IB: p85, lanes 4 and 5). On the other hand, translocation of p85 did not occur when eggs were activated by the Ca<sup>2+ </sup>ionophore A23187 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, IB: p85, lane 3). Under the same experimental conditions, we evaluated the tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. It was shown that only the H2O2 treatment of eggs promoted an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, IB: phospho-p85, lanes 4 and 9). These results suggest that any sperm-induced activation of PI 3-kinase involves the transient translocation of p85 to membrane microdomains, but not increased tyrosine phosphorylation of p85.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Subcellular localization and tyrosine phosphorylation of an 85-kDa subunit of PI 3-kinase before and after fertilization of <italic>Xenopus </italic>eggs</bold>.

Quantitative analysis demonstrated that only a small fraction of Akt localized to membrane microdomains in fertilized eggs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>, IB: Akt). However, the threonine-308-phosphorylated forms of Akt were predominantly present in the membrane microdomains (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>, IB: pThr308-Akt). These results suggest that the sperm-induced functional interaction, and activation, of PI 3-kinase and Akt take place specifically in the egg membrane microdomains. We also examined whether the sperm-induced re-localization of Akt requires the activity of PI 3-kinase. LY294002 was shown to inhibit the sperm-induced appearance of both p85 and Akt in the membrane microdomains (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref>). Like in the case of the threonine-308-phosphorylation described above, PP2 did not affect the re-localization of p85 or Akt (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref>).</p><p>To examine further the involvement of the activity of PI 3-kinase in sperm-induced egg activation, we employed bp(V) [dipotassium bisperoxo (picolinato) oxovanadate (V)], a potent inhibitor of the phosphoinositide phosphatase PTEN that converts PIP3, an enzymatic product of PI 3-kinase, into PIP2. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, bp(V) treatment of unfertilized <italic>Xenopus </italic>eggs induced a cortical contraction, a cytological event of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent egg activation. Importantly, the cortical contraction induced by bp(V) was inhibited by pre-injection of LY294002 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Moreover, bp(V) treatment of eggs also promoted the tyrosine phosphorylation of Src (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). These results demonstrate that artificially elevating the PIP3 level in unfertilized eggs can promote an egg activation-like event as seen in fertilized eggs. Finally, we examined the effect of PIP3 on Src tyrosine kinase activity. An in vitro kinase assay with purified <italic>Xenopus </italic>Src demonstrated that PIP3 was capable of activating the autophosphorylation of Src (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). Inositol phospholipids other than PIP3; namely PI, PIP, and PIP2, did not show such a Src-activating property (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). These results indicate PIP3 to be a specific and direct activator for Src tyrosine kinase in <italic>Xenopus </italic>eggs.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Activation of <italic>Xenopus </italic>unfertilized eggs by bp(V), a potent inhibitor of PTEN</bold>.

The present study has indicated the activity of PI 3-kinase to connect egg-sperm interaction/fusion with the activation of Src, because 1) LY294002 inhibits the sperm-induced activation of Src, suggesting that PI 3-kinase acts as an upstream activator for Src, and 2) tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, a well-known phenomenon in several cellular systems, in which one or more tyrosine kinase is activated, is not stimulated in fertilized eggs. If so, what is the mechanism for Src activation by PI 3-kinase activity? One possibility is, as demonstrated in the present study, the kinase-activating interaction of PIP3 with Src. The Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of the Src protein is capable of binding PIP3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], supporting the possibility that interaction with PIP3 would displace the negative-regulatory intramolecular interaction involving the SH2 domain, leading to the Src kinase's activation.</p><p>In our experimental system, Wortmannin, another potent inhibitor for PI 3-kinase, is not inhibitory to the sperm-induced egg activation in <italic>Xenopus</italic>: in eggs injected with Wortmannin at up to 20 &#x003bc;M, sperm could promote Src activation, p85 translocation, cortical contraction, and most importantly Akt phosphorylation, all of which are events of egg activation (data not shown). There is a possibility that, in <italic>Xenopus </italic>eggs, Wortmannin binds preferentially to molecules other than PI 3-kinase. This idea is supported by the finding of Carnero and Lacal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] that wortmannin is able to induce meiotic maturation in <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocytes at doses slightly higher that those required for complete inhibition of PI 3-kinase. The authors have also suggested that this effect is independent of the ability of Wortmannin to inhibit PI 3-kinase since LY294002 was unable to induce oocyte maturation at concentrations inhibitory to PI 3-kinase, and that the mechanism for wortmannin-induced maturation involves the activation of a maturation-promoting factor and MAPK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>A positive regulatory role for PIP3 in egg activation signaling has been suggested by the finding that bp(V), a potent inhibitor for PTEN phosphoinositide phosphatase, promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of Src and cortical contraction of <italic>Xenopus </italic>eggs. (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A-C</xref>) The results indicate that the elevation of PIP3 levels in eggs is sufficient for promoting Src-dependent signal transduction for egg activation.</p><p>We demonstrated that, in fertilized eggs, Akt was phosphorylated at Thr308. However, we did not detect the phosphorylation of another well-known site, Ser473. This could be because the phosphoSer473-specific antibody employed in this study was not suitable for analysis of the <italic>Xenopus </italic>Akt protein. However, immunoblotting has demonstrated that the phosphoSer473-specific antibody well recognizes Akt protein in immature <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocytes and that the phosphoSer473 signals become decreased in progesterone-treated, fully matured oocytes (unpublished results). Therefore, we suggest that fertilization promotes the phosphorylation of Akt selectively at threonine-308. In mammals, phosphorylation of Akt Thr308 and Ser473 is catalyzed by phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase PDK1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] and mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], respectively. So, we assume that the signaling pathway involving PDK1, not mTOR, operates to promote the phosphorylation and activation of Akt in fertilized eggs.</p><p>Several cellular functions involve the activation of Akt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Of particular interest is the anti-apoptotic function of Akt. Our preliminary experiments have shown that a caspase-like protease is activated in eggs left unfertilized for several hours (unpublished results). The results suggest that fertilization is responsible for suppression of the caspase's activation. Therefore, our future efforts will be directed at examining whether an anti-apoptotic mechanism is really operating in fertilized eggs and, if so, to clarify how and where Akt is involved in this cellular function.</p><p>Several studies have focused on the roles of sperm-associated PI 3-kinase in mammalian species. In human sperm, LY294002 blocks the acrosome reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] and enhances motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], but does not affect egg-sperm interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. More recently, Jungnickel et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] demonstrated that in the mouse, the zona pellucida glycoprotein 3-induced acrosome reaction involves the PIP3-dependent activation of Akt. These results suggest that PI 3-kinase is required for Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signaling in fertilizing sperm. In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, however, no information has yet been available for the role of PI 3-kinase and/or Akt in the acrosome reaction or other fertilization-related functions of sperm.</p><p>Another important question is how PI 3-kinase could be activated after egg-sperm interaction/fusion (without the involvement of tyrosine phosphorylation)? In this connection, the fact that fertilization is accompanied by a transient accumulation of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase and Thr308-phosphorylated form of Akt in the egg membrane microdomains may be important. As we reported earlier, egg membrane microdomains are abundant in cholesterol, the ganglioside GM1, and several signaling molecules, and serve as a platform for egg-sperm interaction and subsequent Src-dependent signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. More recently, we have identified and characterized a membrane microdomain-associated protein, uroplakin III, which might act as a target of sperm-derived protease and as a substrate of the activated Src at fertilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Although the signal transduction pathway connecting uroplakin III and Src is not yet known, the involvement of GTP-binding proteins has been inferred because the application of GTP to the isolated egg membrane microdomains could reconstitute the Src activity in vitro (Iwasaki et al. manuscript in preparation; 53). So, it is tempting to speculate that PI 3-kinase acts as a downstream target of GTP-binding proteins, as demonstrated in the case of &#x003b3;-subspecies of PI 3-kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>], so that GTP- and PIP3-dependent activation of Src is possible.</p><p>The specific activation of PI 3-kinase, however, is not necessarily required for egg activation signaling. Rather, the rapid and transient accumulations of PI 3-kinase at membrane microdomains by itself maybe important. Such a local concentration of PI 3-kinase may contribute to the effective propagation of PIP3-dependent and LY294002-sensitive signals for egg activation. In support of this, PIP2 is known to predominantly localize to membrane microdomains of mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Further study should be directed toward analyzing the mechanism by which membrane microdomains allow the precise localization of these signaling molecules before and after fertilization.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, we show that LY294002 effectively inhibited several early steps of sperm-induced egg activation, including the activation of Src. Although we should keep in mind that the effect of LY294002 could be mediated through other targets than PI 3-kinase, we think that the inhibitory effect of LY294002 is most likely due to the inhibition of PI 3-kinase: because not only several steps of Src-dependent egg activation but also sperm-induced phosphorylation of Akt are inhibited by this inhibitor. PI 3-kinase and Akt become activated and temporarily localize to the egg membrane microdomains where sperm-induced tyrosine kinase machinery operates for successful fertilization. These results highlight for the first time the important role the egg-associated PI 3-kinase plays in signal transduction for <italic>Xenopus </italic>fertilization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals, antibodies, cultured cells and chemicals</title><p>Frogs were purchased from local dealers and maintained as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].
