KdpD requires the signal recognition particle (SRP) for its targeting to the membrane. Deletions within KdpD show that the first 50 residues are required for SRP-driven membrane insertion. A fusion protein of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) with KdpD is found localized at the membrane only when SRP is present. The membrane targeting of GFP was not observed when the first 50 KdpD residues were deleted. A truncated mutant of KdpD containing only the first 25 amino acids fused to GFP lost its ability to specifically interact with SRP, whereas a specific interaction between SRP and the first 48 amino acids of KdpD fused to GFP was confirmed by pull-down experiments. Conclusively, a small amphiphilic region of 27 residues within the amino-terminal domain of KdpD (aa 22&#x02013;48) is recognized by SRP and targets the protein to the membrane. This shows that membrane proteins with a large N-terminal region in the cytoplasm can be membrane-targeted early on to allow co-translational membrane insertion of their distant transmembrane regions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The KdpD protein of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is a membrane component of the KdpD/E sensory system involved in maintaining the intracellular osmolarity. In cases of low K<sup>+</sup> concentrations in the medium, the expression of the high-affinity K<sup>+</sup> pump KdpFABC is induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Epstein and Davis, 1970</xref>). In this signalling cascade, the C-terminal domain of KdpD is phosphorylated most likely at His673 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Voelkner <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>). Subsequently, the phosphoryl group is transferred to Asp52 of the cytoplasmic response regulator KdpE, which in turn acts as a transcriptional activator for <italic>kdpFABC</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Sugiura <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Nakashima <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>). Although the exact mechanism of the K<sup>+</sup> sensing is still unknown, the C-terminal domain of KdpD is by itself functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Rothenb&#x000fc;cher <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p>The biosynthesis of KdpD has been studied in detail. The KdpD protein consists of a large cytoplasmic N-terminal domain, four closely spaced transmembrane regions, and an extended cytoplasmic C-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). The insertion of the transmembrane regions occurs independently of SecA, SecE and YidC, but involves the electrochemical membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Facey and Kuhn, 2003</xref>). As the translocated periplasmic region P1 between the first and second transmembranes is only four residues long, it was extended to 19 residues with an antigenic epitope. The mutant showed the same insertion characteristics for the translocation of the P1 region as the wild-type protein and was Sec- and YidC-independent. It was therefore concluded that short periplasmic loops can translocate without assistance of other known proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Facey and Kuhn, 2003</xref>).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Membrane topology of KdpD. The KdpD protein consists of 894 amino acid residues organized as two hydrophilic domains that are separated by four closely spaced transmembrane regions. The periplasmic loops of KdpD (P1 + P2) contain 4 and 10 residues, respectively.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mmi0068-1471-f1"/></fig><p>In <italic>E. coli,</italic> there are multiple pathways for directing proteins to and across the inner membrane. The twin-arginine translocation system (Tat) targets a small group of cofactor-containing proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane via distinct signal peptides bearing a conserved RR motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Alami <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). The Tat pathway transports only folded proteins post-translationally through the Tat translocon. The majority of secreted <italic>E. coli</italic> proteins are synthesized as preproteins with a cleavable signal peptide at their N-terminus. These preproteins are targeted to the cytoplasmic membrane post-translationally by the molecular chaperone SecB via the cytosolic ATPase SecA which is associated with the SecYEG translocase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Driessen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). The core of the Sec translocon consists of the integral membrane proteins SecY, SecE and SecG, and the peripheral subunit SecA. The Sec translocase mediates the stepwise translocation of secretory proteins across the membrane. In contrast, most cytoplasmic membrane proteins do not contain a cleavable signal peptide and their N-terminal transmembrane segment serves as the membrane targeting signal. Most inner membrane proteins are targeted in a co-translational manner to the SecYEG translocase by the signal recognition particle (SRP) and its receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Herskovits <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>).</p><p>The bacterial SRP consists of a 48 kDa protein Ffh (Fifty-four homologue) and a 4.5S RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Keenan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Luirink and Sinning, 2004</xref>). Together with its receptor FtsY, SRP delivers membrane and secretory proteins to the translocation channel in the plasma membrane. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, Ffh, FtsY and the 4.5S RNA are all essential for viability. Ffh consists of three domains: the N-terminal N domain (&#x003b1;-helical domain), the G domain (nucleotide binding domain) and the C-terminal M domain (methionine-rich, &#x003b1;-helical domain). SRP-binding substrates are bound by the methionine-rich M-domain of Ffh when they leave the ribosomal exit channel. There, a hydrophobic &#x02018;finger loop&#x02019; of Ffh is proposed to interact with an &#x003b1;-helical substrate region, such as an uncleaved signal sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Luirink and Sinning, 2004</xref>). In <italic>E. coli</italic>, usually the first transmembrane region of multi-spanning membrane proteins interacts with SRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Valent <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Beck <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). The substrate specificity of SRP for membrane proteins may reflect the higher affinity of SRP for hydrophobic signal sequences. <italic>In vitro</italic> cross-linking studies have shown that the efficiency of cross-linking to Ffh is correlated with the hydrophobicity of the signal sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Valent <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">1998</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>E. coli</italic> presecretory proteins can be re-routed into the SRP pathway by increasing the hydrophobicity of their signal sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Lee and Bernstein, 2001</xref>).</p><p>In the SRP-mediated targeting pathway, SRP binds to the hydrophobic signal sequence of the nascent chain as it emerges from the translating ribosome. The resulting SRP&#x02013;ribosome nascent chain complex is then targeted to FtsY at the membrane where an interaction involving GTP between SRP and its receptor catalyses the dissociation of the nascent chain from SRP. The nascent membrane proteins are then inserted into the SecYEG complex (for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Keenan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we investigated in detail the initial interactions of the inner membrane protein KdpD with SRP. The membrane insertion of KdpD depends on SRP as we demonstrate with an Ffh- and an FtsY-depletion strain. We also show that a short sequence in the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the KdpD protein binds to SRP. A fusion protein of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) with KdpD is targeted to the membrane when the SRP-binding motif is present, but remains in the cytoplasm when this element is removed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Signal recognition particle is required for the membrane insertion of KdpD</title><p>The sensor kinase protein KdpD inserts into the membrane independently of the Sec translocase and YidC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Facey and Kuhn, 2003</xref>). To investigate the involvement of SRP in the biogenesis of KdpD, we transformed the Ffh-depletion strain WAM121 with the plasmid (pSF51) encoding the wild-type KdpD. In this strain, the <italic>ffh</italic> gene expression is under the control of the arabinose-inducible <italic>araBAD</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">de Gier <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). Ffh is depleted when the cells are grown in the presence of glucose and absence of arabinose. WAM121 cells were grown in the presence of glucose or arabinose, respectively. The cells were induced, labelled with [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine for 1 min, chased for 2 min, immediately converted to spheroplasts and treated with proteinase K. In a recent study, we observed that proteinase K did not cleave the protein in the first periplasmic loop P1, probably because of the short size of the loop (four amino acid residues). Cleavage in the second periplasmic loop P2 (10 amino acid residues) occurred only partially and led to a protease-protected fragment of 47 kDa which was recognized by the KdpD antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Facey and Kuhn, 2003</xref>). The results show that when Ffh was present, the translocation of the second periplasmic loop of KdpD was followed by the generation of the C-terminal 47 kDa proteolytic fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A</xref>, lane 2). In contrast, in Ffh-depleted cells, the formation of the C-terminal fragment was affected (compare lanes 2 and 5). Depletion of Ffh reduced the efficiency of the translocation of the second periplasmic loop of KdpD as indicated by the reduced appearance of the C-terminal fragment. This suggests that SRP is required for membrane insertion of KdpD. Following lysis of the cells with detergent, we confirmed that the smaller fragment was readily digested (lanes 3 and 6). As a control, the cytoplasmic protein GroEL and the outer membrane protein OmpA were analysed in parallel. The OmpA antibody used in this study recognizes the periplasmic domain of OmpA and the degradation of OmpA indicates that the protease is active in the periplasm. Depletion of the Ffh component of SRP largely inhibited KdpD insertion, without affecting the Sec-dependent export of OmpA. Ffh depletion was confirmed by analysing the Ffh content in a cell sample taken before induction with IPTG by immunoblotting using Ffh antiserum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>KdpD depends on SRP for targeting to the membrane. A. To test the requirement of SRP, the Ffh-depletion strain WAM121 was induced with arabinose or tightly repressed in the presence of glucose. <italic>E. coli</italic> strain WAM121 expressing KdpD (pSF51) was grown overnight in LB medium supplemented with arabinose. The cells were washed twice with LB medium, diluted 1:20 into fresh LB medium supplemented with arabinose (Ffh<sup>+</sup>) or glucose (Ffh<sup>-</sup>), and grown to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.4. The cells were then transferred to M9 minimal medium and induced with 1 mM IPTG for 10 min. Cells were labelled with [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine for 1 min and chased with 500 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> cold <sc>l</sc>-methionine for 2 min and subsequently converted to spheroplasts and incubated with (lanes 2 and 5) or without proteinase K (lanes 1 and 4) at a final concentration of 0.5 mg ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> on ice for 1 h. A lysis control was included by adding proteinase K and 2.5% Trition X-100 (lanes 3 and 6). All samples were precipitated with 20% TCA, immunoprecipitated with antisera against KdpD (upper panel), GroEL (middle panel) and OmpA (lower panel), and analysed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by phosphorimaging. B. Immunoblot analysis of Ffh levels in the WAM121 strain expressing KdpD under arabinose (Ffh<sup>+</sup>) and glucose (Ffh<sup>-</sup>) conditions. The samples were separated onto 12.5% SDS-PAGE and immunobloted with anti-Ffh antibody. C. To test the requirement of FtsY, the FtsY-depletion strain IY26 was induced with arabinose or tightly repressed in the presence of glucose. <italic>E. coli</italic> strain IY26 expressing KdpD was grown in LB medium with either arabinose (FtsY<sup>+</sup>) or glucose (FtsY<sup>-</sup>) for 4 h.

In accordance with the effects of depletion of Ffh, depletion of FtsY also inhibits membrane insertion of KdpD (compare lanes 2 and 5). Together, the <italic>in vivo</italic> results show that KdpD requires SRP for efficient membrane insertion. Furthermore, the processing of OmpA was unaltered when Ffh or FtsY were depleted, indicating that the Sec machinery was still functional. Depletion of FtsY was verified by analysing the FtsY level in a cell sample in parallel by immunoblotting with FtsY antiserum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p><p>To test whether GFP fused to KdpD is also targeted by SRP, we analysed the translocation of a truncated KdpD fragment fused after amino acid residue 448 to GFP in the Ffh-depletion strain WAM121. The truncated fragment termed KdpD-N (i.e. coding the amino acids 1&#x02013;448 of KdpD) has been described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Facey and Kuhn, 2003</xref>). To analyse the translocation of this fragment, a short HA-epitope was introduced between helices 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Facey and Kuhn, 2003</xref>). It was previously shown that the first periplasmic loop of KdpD with an HA-epitope tag inserts into the inner membrane independent of YidC and the Sec components like wild-type KdpD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Facey and Kuhn, 2003</xref>). We investigated the effect of Ffh depletion on the translocation of KdpD-N fused to GFP in the strain WAM121. Here, the epitope-tagged KdpD-N(HA)&#x02013;GFP fusion protein was immunoprecipitated with antiserum to HA. As described above, when Ffh was present (cells grown with arabinose), KdpD-N(HA)&#x02013;GFP was readily inserted into the membrane and the exposed HA tag was digested with proteinase K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3A</xref>, lanes 1 and 2). In Ffh-deficient cells (grown with glucose), the insertion of KdpD-N(HA)&#x02013;GFP was inhibited. The protein was not accessible to the externally added proteinase K, indicating that it remains in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3A</xref>, compare lanes 4 and 5). These results are in agreement with the observations from the wild-type KdpD that SRP is required for membrane insertion. The fused GFP protein has no influence on the membrane targeting and insertion of KdpD. Interestingly, we show here that alone the N-terminal domain of KdpD requires SRP. Depletion of Ffh was confirmed by analysing the Ffh level in a cell sample in parallel by immunoblotting with Ffh antiserum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig03" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Protease accessibility of the epitope-tagged KdpD-N(HA)&#x02013;GFP fusion protein in the Ffh-depletion strain WAM121.

Because SRP acts at a very early stage in protein biosynthesis, one would expect the signal sequence to be at the beginning of a nascent chain because of co-translation of the protein binding to SRP. In most bacterial inner membrane proteins, the N-terminal transmembrane segment serves as the membrane targeting signal. However, the first transmembrane segment of KdpD is 400 amino acid residues from the N-terminus of KdpD.

However, 2 h later, almost all the cells expressing N48&#x02013;GFP showed the fusion protein uniformly distributed throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7G</xref>). These results imply that for N48&#x02013;GFP, first the halo formation occurs in which N48&#x02013;GFP is targeted to the inner membrane by the SRP pathway. Within the next 90 min, the protein is distributed back to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7G</xref>), most likely because no hydrophobic transmembrane region is present in the fusion protein, and therefore no insertion into the membrane can take place.

As in <italic>E. coli</italic> nearly all membrane proteins have an N-terminal uncleavable signal peptide, the region that interacts with SRP is most likely the first transmembrane region. This ensures that early after the onset of translation, the nascent protein interacts with SRP and targets the protein co-translationally to the membrane (for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Luirink and Sinning, 2004</xref>). In the sensor protein KdpD, the first transmembrane region starts 401 residues after the initiating methionine preventing an early membrane targeting of the protein. Therefore, an additional signal element might be present at the N-terminus to allow co-translational membrane targeting. Our results show that the residues 22&#x02013;48 of KdpD contain a signal element that is capable to bind to SRP and to target the GFP protein to the membrane.</p><p>GFP and its mutants have become an invaluable marker for monitoring protein localization and gene expression <italic>in vivo</italic> (for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Margolin, 2000</xref>). Using GFP fused to KdpD, we examined where the targeting information of KdpD to the inner membrane is localized. When the 400-residue-long hydrophilic domain with helices 1 and 2 (KdpD-N) was fused to GFP, we found that the fusion protein was found at the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5B</xref>). This suggested that the information for membrane targeting might lie within the first 448 residues of KdpD. Moreover, a deletion of the first 50 amino acid residues of KdpD impaired the insertion of KdpD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5C</xref>) and KdpD-N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5E</xref>) into the membrane. We then fused the first 48 amino acid residues of KdpD to GFP and found that this protein was readily targeted to the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7A and D</xref>). Taken together, these results show that an N-terminal signal element is required for the targeting of KdpD to the inner membrane. Although the most direct explanation of these data is that SRP targets KdpD to the membrane, it is possible that a protein targeted to the membrane by SRP is required for KdpD targeting.</p><p>The results provided here clearly show that SRP (Ffh) and the SRP receptor (FtsY) are involved in the membrane targeting of KdpD. <italic>E. coli</italic> strains that can be manipulated to deplete SRP or its receptor show that KdpD insertion is impaired in the absence of Ffh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A</xref>) or FtsY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2C</xref>). Also, the KdpD deletion mutant lacking the first 50 amino acid residues was incapable of inserting into the membrane as judged by the protease mapping technique (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6</xref>). These observations suggested that the N-terminal signal element of KdpD directly binds to SRP. Indeed, His-SRP was binding to the purified fusion protein N48&#x02013;GFP that contained the signal element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Fig. 11A</xref>). The minimal peptide that supported the binding was N22&#x02013;48 fused to GFP. This peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Fig. 12</xref>) contains five positively charged residues, in which three are closely spaced (aa 22&#x02013;26) and a stretch of 10 hydrophobic residues (aa 27&#x02013;36) followed by another six hydrophobic residues (aa 38&#x02013;43). In general, a highly hydrophobic signal anchor region is the binding element for SRP-mediated co-translational membrane insertion of integral membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">de Gier <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Peterson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). In addition, basic amino acids promote binding of the signal peptide with SRP through electrostatic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Peterson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). The crystal structure of a complex between the <italic>E. coli</italic> Ffh M domain and a fragment of the 4.5S RNA has revealed an unusual RNA&#x02013;protein interface that is thought to constitute the signal peptide binding groove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Batey <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). It has been suggested that this binding site composed of both protein and RNA would accommodate a signal peptide through a combination of hydrophobic interactions and electrostatic contacts. Therefore, the three closely spaced basic residues (Arg and Lys) in the peptide might enhance the SRP binding and compensate the lower hydrophobicity of the KdpD signal element. It would be interesting to exchange the lysyl and arginyl residues in the peptide into neutral amino acid residues to see if the peptide still interacts with SRP. Within this peptide, a Walker A motif was found from residues 30&#x02013;38 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Jung and Altendorf, 1998</xref>). This motif is very similar to the classical ATP binding site of many ATP-requiring enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Walker <italic>et al.</italic>, 1982</xref>). It is conceivable that shortly after its exit from the ribosome, the SRP binds to the motif and delivers the protein to the membrane where it is released. The KdpD protein is then folded and the Walker A motif is subsequently used for an ATP-binding site. The N-terminal KdpD peptide is the first case that a non-transmembrane sequence provides binding to SRP and is capable to target the hydrophilic GFP to the membrane surface. As the SRP-signal peptide from KdpD is soluble, it provides an attractive tool for future SRP binding studies. The Ffh and FtsY dependence of KdpD is a further indication that the N-terminal peptide is functional in membrane targeting.</p><fig id="fig12" position="float"><label>Fig. 12</label><caption><p>The amino acid sequence of the N-terminal signal element that is required for targeting of KdpD to the inner membrane.

We assume that after contacting FtsY, GTP is rapidly hydrolysed and the GFP fusion protein is released from SRP. With no transmembrane regions for anchoring into the membrane, the protein slowly distributes throughout the cytoplasm after some time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7G</xref>). It appears that the cells show a punctuate fluorescence staining which might reflect the formation of protein clusters at the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figs 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig 10A and B</xref>). The N-terminal KdpD peptide is required for SRP-dependent targeting, whereas the transmembrane regions of KdpD are required for insertion into the membrane. The data here are consistent with a co-translational targeting mechanism of KdpD <italic>in vivo</italic>. Usually, SRP binds to signal sequences of nascent polypeptides as they emerge from the ribosome. It has been proposed that the nature of a nascent polypeptide is already sensed in the ribosome, which may influence the binding of SRP near the nascent chain exit site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Gu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Ullers <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Previous studies have shown that the <italic>E. coli</italic> inner membrane protein, Leader peptidase (Lep), is targeted co-translationally by the SRP to the Sec-YidC insertion site in the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">de Gier <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Samuelson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). Photo cross-linking studies have shown that nascent Lep with a length of 40 amino acids and longer could be immunoprecipitated using anti-Ffh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Houben <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">2005</xref>). Data suggest that targeting of Lep with SRP to the Sec-YidC insertion site starts at an early stage during biosynthesis of Lep when the nascent chain is 40 amino acids long. This would be in agreement with our results that SRP binds remarkably early during biogenesis of KdpD.</p><p>As most of the integral membrane proteins use the SecYEG translocase pathway, it was first assumed that the targeting pathways mediated by SRP converge at the translocase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Valent <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). Indeed, experimental evidence exists that show an interaction between SRP and SecYEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Weiche <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Cross-linking studies have demonstrated for a number of proteins a consecutive binding to SRP and Sec (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Valent <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Beck <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). More recently, it was shown that the Sec-independent protein MscL is targeted by SRP, but uses YidC for membrane insertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Facey <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Another example is KdpD, which translocates its two extremely short periplasmic loops in the absence of the Sec translocase and YidC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Facey and Kuhn, 2003</xref>). This underlines that targeting and insertion/translocation are functioning as separate modules and cooperate depending on the actual substrate protein.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains and culture conditions</title><p>Microscopy experiments were performed with <italic>E. coli</italic> MC1061 [<italic>hsdR mcrB araD139</italic> (<italic>araABC-leu</italic>)<italic>7697 lacX74 galU galK rspL thi</italic>] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Meissner <italic>et al.</italic>, 1987</xref>).</p><p>For Ffh depletion, cells of <italic>E. coli</italic> strain WAM121 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">de Gier <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>) were grown overnight in LB medium containing 0.2% (w/v) arabinose, washed in medium lacking arabinose and back-diluted 1:20 in LB medium containing 0.4% (w/v) glucose.

A unique SphI site was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis at the end of the <italic>torA</italic> gene. A &#x0223c;1.4 kb DNA fragment containing the <italic>kdpD-C</italic> gene (i.e. encoding residues of 444&#x02013;894 of KdpD) lacking the translation stop codon was obtained by PCR and cloned as an MluI-SphI fragment into the MluI-SphI-digested plasmid pJDT1/SphI to construct p24C/GFP (the <italic>torA</italic> gene was replaced with the <italic>kdpD-C</italic> gene). Plasmid p24C/GFP containing the <italic>kdpD-C&#x02013;gfp</italic> chimeric gene was cleaved with StuI/HindIII and inserted in StuI-HindIII-digested pBD to generate pBD/GFP encoding KdpD and

pJFBD/GFP, the coding region of KdpD&#x02013;GFP was excised by SmaI-HindIII from pBD/GFP and cloned into the corresponding sites of the plasmid pJF119EH. Plasmid pBD&#x00394;50/GFP was constructed in several steps. PCR amplification with the primer set NcoI-50-KdpD (5&#x02032;-GCATA<underline>CCATGG</underline>CGCAAGGGCTGGATATTGTGGTTG-3&#x02032;), and StuI-KdpD (5&#x02032;-GCAGGC<underline>AGGCCT</underline>TTATCAAAACTCCACTGCG-3&#x02032;) and with pBD as the template produced a &#x0223c;1.6 kb NcoI-StuI fragment. This fragment was subsequently inserted into the NcoI-StuI site of p24C (i.e. encoding residues of 444&#x02013;894 of KdpD). The resulting plasmid was digested with MluI and SphI and ligated to MluI-SphI-digested pBD/GFP to create pBD&#x00394;50/GFP.</p><p>Construction of pSH-N/GFP was done as follows: <italic>gfp</italic> mut3.1 was amplified by PCR from pGFPmut3.1 (Clontech) with the primers GFP-PstI (5&#x02032;-CCGT<underline>CTGCAG</underline>ATGCGTAAAGGAGAAGAACTTTTC-3&#x02032;) and GFP-HindIII (5&#x02032;-CCGGC<underline>AAGCTT</underline>ATTTGTATAGTTCATCCATGC-3&#x02032;). From this PCR product, a 0.72 kb PstI-HindIII fragment carrying the <italic>gfp</italic> mut3.1 gene was isolated and subsequently ligated to PstI-HindIII-digested pBAD33 to create p33/GFP. The plasmid pSF18 encoding KdpD-N (i.e. encoding residues 1&#x02013;448 of KdpD with the HA-epitope) has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Facey and Kuhn, 2003</xref>). In this plasmid, the stop codon (TAG) was changed to GGG (glycine) by site-directed mutagenesis. To construct pSH-N/GFP, the sequence encoding KdpD-N lacking its stop codon was cleaved with XbaI-PstI and cloned into XbaI-PstI-digested p33/GFP. To generate the plasmid pMS-N/GFP, the coding region of KdpD-N(HA)&#x02013;GFP was excised by XbaI-HindIII from pSH-N/GFP and inserted into the corresponding sites of pMS119EH.</p><p>Primers KdpD-N-50 (5&#x02032;-GAATGAATTA<underline>CATATG</underline>GCGCAAGGGCTGGATATTG-3&#x02032;) and KdpD-N-PstI (5&#x02032;-AAAT<underline>CTG CAG</underline>CTATGAAGGCCAGCGTCCATAAAATA-3&#x02032;) were used to amplify a &#x0223c;1.25 kb fragment from the plasmid pSF18 encoding KdpD-N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Facey and Kuhn, 2003</xref>). This fragment was digested with NdeI and PstI and cloned into the corresponding sites of pT7-7, to generate the plasmid pT7-N&#x00394;50(HA). By means of site-directed mutagenesis, the stop codon (TAG) was changed to GGG (glycine). The resulting plasmid pT7-N&#x00394;50(HA)/Gly was cleaved with XbaI-PstI and inserted into XbaI-PstI-digested p33N/GFP to create pSH-N&#x00394;50/GFP encoding KdpD-N&#x00394;50(HA)&#x02013;GFP. To construct pMS-N&#x00394;50/GFP, plasmid pSH-N&#x00394;50/GFP was cleaved with XbaI-HindIII and cloned into the corresponding sites of pMS119EH. Plasmid pBD containing KdpD was cleaved with SmaI-HindIII and the fragment coding for the <italic>kdpD</italic> gene was inserted into SmaI-HindIII-digested pMS119EH to generate pSF51. Plasmids pBAD-N25/GFP and pBAD-N48/GFP were constructed from p33N/GFP encoding KdpD-N and GFP in pBAD33. A second PstI site was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis into p33N/GFP after the first 25 and 48 amino acid residues of KdpD, respectively. The deletion derivatives were made by digesting p33N/GFP/PstI with PstI and re-ligating the appropriate gel-purified fragments creating pBAD-N25/GFP and pBAD-N48/GFP. To generate the plasmids, pSF163 and pSF165, the coding region of N25&#x02013;GFP and N48&#x02013;GFP was excised by XbaI/HindIII from pBAD-N25/GFP and pBAD-N48/GFP and inserted into the corresponding sites of pMS119EH, respectively. N22&#x02013;48/GFP, containing amino acid residues 22&#x02013;48 of KdpD fused to GFP, was constructed as follows: amino acids 2&#x02013;21 were deleted by site-directed mutagenesis in pBAD-N48/GFP. The coding regions of all constructs were verified by sequence analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Fluorescence microscopy</title><p>Strains were grown overnight at 37&#x000b0;C, diluted 1:20 in fresh LB medium, and grown to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.4. IPTG was then added to a final concentration of 1 mM, and 0.2% (w/v) arabinose was added in strains carrying <italic>kdpD</italic> genes under the control of the <italic>araBAD</italic> promoter and operator. The cells were incubated for 30 min to 1 h at 30&#x000b0;C under continuous shaking. Rifampicin (1 mg ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, final concentration) was added, and the cultures were incubated at 30&#x000b0;C for the times indicated under <italic>Results</italic>. It was verified that under these conditions, the expression of the KdpD&#x02013;GFP fusion proteins was inhibited. Cells were either collected by centrifugation, washed twice with LB medium and re-suspended in 2 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 or treated with trichloroacetic acid (TCA) (10%, final concentration) and analysed by Western blotting. A cell suspension (3 &#x003bc;l) was applied to a polylysine-coated cover glass (Sigma-Aldrich) and the cells were examined immediately by Zeiss LSM 510 Meta, confocal fluorescence microscope. Emission was detected with a filter specific for GFP.</p></sec><sec><title>Pulse-chase and immunoprecipitation analyses</title><p>For all experiments, cells were grown to midlogarithmic phase.

For spheroplasting, cells were centrifuged and re-suspended in 500 &#x003bc;l of ice-cold spheroplast buffer [40% (w/v) sucrose, 33 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0]. Lysozyme (5 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, final concentration) and EDTA (1 mM, final concentration) were added for 15 min. Aliquots of the spheroplast suspension were incubated on ice for 1 h either in the presence or absence of proteinase K (0.5 mg ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, final concentration). A lysis control was included by adding 2.5% Triton X-100 and proteinase K for 1 h. After addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.33 mg ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, final concentration), samples were precipitated with TCA (20%, final concentration), re-suspended in 10 mM Tris/2% SDS, pH 8.0 and immunoprecipitated with antibodies against HA, KdpD, OmpA (a periplasmic control), or GroEL (a cytoplasmic control).

Cells were harvested by centrifugation and pellets were re-suspended in 0.05 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 0.25 M NaCl and lysed with a French press. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The filtered extract was applied to IMAC column containing Chelating Sepharose 6B resin (Pharmacia) charged with Ni(II) ions, which had been pre-equilibrated with 0.05 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 2 M NaCl as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Li <italic>et al.</italic> (2001)</xref>.
