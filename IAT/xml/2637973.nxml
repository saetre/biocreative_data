It is essential for maintenance of undifferentiated, pluripotent cell populations, and accomplishes these tasks by binding DNA in multiple heterodimer and homodimer configurations. Very little is known about how formation of these complexes is regulated, or the mechanisms through which Oct4 proteins respond to complex extracellular stimuli which regulate pluripotency. Here, we provide evidence for a phosphorylation-based mechanism which regulates specific Oct4 homodimer conformations. Point mutations of a putative phosphorylation site can specifically abrogate transcriptional activity of a specific homodimer assembly, with little effect on other configurations. Moreover, we performed bioinformatic predictions to identify a subset of Oct4 target genes which may be regulated by this specific assembly, and show that altering Oct4 protein levels affects transcription of Oct4 target genes which are regulated by this assembly but not others. Finally, we identified several signaling pathways which may mediate this phosphorylation and act in combination to regulate Oct4 transcriptional activity and protein stability. These results provide a mechanism for rapid and reversible alteration of Oct4 transactivation potential in response to extracellular signals.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The use of embryonic stem cells as therapeutics requires firm understanding of the mechanisms that control their proliferation and differentiation. To date, much progress has been made towards identifying extrinsic and intrinsic regulators of these processes. Studies have identified transcription factors such as Stat3, Nanog, and Oct4 as being necessary for embryonic stem (ES) cell self-renewal and maintenance of pluripotency. Likewise, it has been shown that signaling pathways and transactivation potentials triggered by extracellular stimuli such as BMPs, LIF, and other factors play major regulatory roles (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004467-Chambers1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004467-Jaenisch1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>).

Several recent studies have shed light on transcriptional networks controlled by factors such as Oct4 (for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004467-Boyer1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004467-Campbell1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>), and begun to address the issue of how extracellular cues are integrated with transcriptional circuits that maintain the pluripotent state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004467-Chen1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Despite these findings, however, it is generally not clear how extrinsic cues are integrated within the cell to control the behavior of cell-intrinsic regulators of ES cell pluripotency such as Oct4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004467-Chambers1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Oct4 is a transcriptional regulator that can either activate or repress target gene expression, depending on the cellular context <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004467-Liu1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004467-Botquin1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

Oct4 expression is necessary for the establishment of the inner cell mass of the blastocyst <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004467-Nichols1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, and proper levels of Oct4 expression are critical for maintenance of pluripotency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004467-Niwa2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Using engineered ES cells, it has been shown that increases or decreases of more than 50&#x00025; of wild-type Oct4 mRNA levels is sufficient to induce differentiation towards embryonic or trophectodermal lineages, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004467-Niwa2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. This pattern is complemented by the phenotypes observed following decreased Nanog expression; ES cells differentiate towards endodermal fates upon Nanog loss-of-function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004467-Mitsui1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that combinatorial functions of multiple proteins contribute to the maintenance of pluripotency of ES cells partially through inhibition of differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004467-Ivanova1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Oct4 has two distinct DNA binding domains which independently bind half-sites of the canonical octamer motif. This flexibility allows Oct4 to form heterodimers with other transcription factors and to form homodimers in several conformations, depending on the configuration of the octamer half-sites within the DNA motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004467-Remenyi1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. It has been shown that two such homodimers assemble using distinct, mutually exclusive interaction faces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004467-Remenyi2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence, a potential phosphorylation event might be able to prevent formation of one of these conformations while leaving the other homodimer (as well as heterodimer formation potential) intact. As all of these Oct4 homodimer and heterodimer conformations bind distinct DNA motifs, a signaling-based mechanism could potentially control the transcription of distinct subsets of Oct4 target genes.</p><p>Through this mechanism, it would be possible for a cell to couple extracellular cues to maintenance of pluripotency through direct regulation of transcription factor activity, and to fine-tune gene expression as the extracellular environment dictates. Here, we provide evidence for such a phosphorylation-based mechanism. Mutation of a potential protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation site has dramatic consequences on Oct4 transactivation potential. Surprisingly, small molecule activators of PKA signaling increase expression of Oct4 protein, which in turn enhances expression of a specific subset of Oct4 target genes. These effects are mediated at least in part via p38 MAP kinase, thereby providing multiple means for rapid control of Oct4 transactivation in response to complex extracellular stimuli throughout early development.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Regulated degradation of Oct4 protein</title><p>Undifferentiated embryonic stem (ES) cells express Oct4 mRNA and protein; this expression is rapidly downregulated during embryoid body formation.

To eliminate the possibility of any undifferentiated cells in the cultures accounting for this observation, DMSO-differentiated cells were treated with the anti-proliferative agent cytosine arabinosidase (Ara-C), starting two days after aggregate plating. Six days after the start of Ara-C treatment, cultures expressed Oct4 mRNA at levels similar to undifferentiated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004467-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) and exhibited morphology characteristic of endodermal cell types (data not shown).</p><fig id="pone-0004467-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004467.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Oct4 protein is regulated via controlled degradation.</title><p>(A) P19 cells were differentiated by aggregate formation in the presence of DMSO (as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) for the indicated number of days, followed by RT-PCR analysis of Oct4 expression.

Following aggregate plating and Ara-C addition, Oct4 protein expression progressively decreased, disappearing by day twelve. As these cultures still express Oct4 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004467-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), we asked whether they are synthesizing new Oct4 protein. We reasoned that if these cultures are synthesizing new Oct4 protein, it must be rapidly degraded, possibly in a proteasome-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004467-Xu1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, twelve day old, DMSO-differentiated, Ara-C treated P19 cultures were incubated with the proteasome inhibitors MG-132 and lactacystin for four hours; this was sufficient to rescue Oct4 protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004467-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting that these cells do indeed synthesize new Oct4 protein.</p><p>We then asked whether undifferentiated P19 cells also exhibit this tight regulation of Oct4 protein levels. Cyclohexamide-induced block of new protein synthesis shows that Oct4 protein has a half-life of approximately 90 minutes in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004467-g001">Figure 1E</xref>), and treatment with 10 &#x000b5;M MG-132 for an hour resulted in a significant increase in Oct4 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004467-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). Hence, turnover of Oct4 protein is a dynamic process, with new protein constantly replenishing older pools as they are degraded. Previous work has shown that precise levels of Oct4 transcript and protein are required for ES cell maintenance; raising or lowering levels within a narrow window is sufficient to induce differentiation or de-differentiation, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004467-Niwa2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Phosphorylation at serine 229 partially controls Oct4 transactivation activity</title><p>One implication of these findings is that Oct4 may be subject to post-translational modifications which alter its activity.

Oct4 contains two distinct DNA binding domains (the POU<sub>H</sub> and POU<sub>S</sub> domains, each of which can bind to half of the DNA octamer motif independently of the other) which are separated by a flexible linker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004467-Pan2">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>; this in turn allows for substantial leeway in arrangement of these domains in relation to each other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004467-Remenyi1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Oct4 can bind to the Octamer motif (<named-content content-type="gene">ATGCAAAT</named-content>) as a monomer (in the Results section, this is referred to as the 6xW reporter) or as a heterodimer with several different proteins.

As described in Tomilin et. al., the key difference between the PORE and MORE sequences is that the two DNA binding domains of Oct4 (the POU<sub>H</sub> and POU<sub>S</sub> domains) which bind the octamer half-site originate from the same protein molecule when bound to the PORE; in contrast, one protein molecule contributes the POU<sub>H</sub> domain while the other homodimer molecule contributes the POU<sub>S</sub> domain when binding to the octamer half-site in the MORE configuration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004467-Tomilin1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Thus, depending on arrangements of the octamer motif, and presence of DNA motifs for additional transcription factors, Oct4 can form heterodimers with multiple partners or homodimers in one of several unique conformations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004467-Remenyi1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

Hence, phosphorylation (or other modifications) of sites on one interaction face could potentially prevent DNA binding by one homodimer configuration, while leaving binding of other configurations intact.</p><p>We found that mutation of serine 229 to aspartic acid, which mimics phosphorylation at this site, does indeed prevent Oct4 transactivation potential of one homodimer conformation but not of other Oct4 complexes. Based on the crystallographic structure of the Oct1 DNA-binding domain (to which the Oct4 domain is highly homologous), S229 is found to be positioned at the interface between the POU-specific domain of one molecule and the POU-homo domain of the other molecule of the homodimer, in direct proximity to the DNA backbone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004467-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004467-Remenyi2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>). Thus, phosphorylation at this site likely causes steric and electrostatic disruption of this specific Oct4 homodimer-DNA configuration (the PORE homodimer), but not of the MORE homodimer configuration or Oct4 heterodimer complexes.</p><p>BLASTing the 15-bp PORE sequence revealed a large cohort of genes potentially regulated by such a mechanism (although osteopontin, the one target gene previously known to be regulated by a PORE sequence, was not identified in this analysis).

Additional predicted gene targets were verified to bind Oct4 <italic>in situ</italic>, and targets were found to be enriched in several developmental and molecular processes by gene ontology analysis. Thus, control of homodimer formation could be a major mechanism for regulating transcription of a diverse sub-set of Oct4 target genes.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Signaling pathways which regulate PORE-dependant transcription</title><p>Signaling pathways which contribute to regulation of Oct4 stability and transactivation have not been identified previously; indeed, this area remains a conspicuous &#x0201c;black box&#x0201d; in our understanding of the circuitry which controls pluripotency. In Oct4, S229 is predicted to be phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA); therefore, we tested the effects of the PKA activator 8-Br-cAMP and found that stimulation resulted in a rapid and transient increase in Oct4 protein levels in P19 cells (although sustained increases were observed in 3T3 cells, e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004467-g004">Figure 4E</xref>), with no effect on Oct4 mRNA levels.

Upon shutting off wild-type Oct4 expression, the effects of these Oct4 point mutations on ES cell proliferation, differentiation potential, and gene expression could be determined. Such experiments would potentially reveal a role for the proposed phosphorylation event in regulating Oct4 activity and provide further insight into how the Oct4 transcriptional network regulates pluripotency.</p><p>Several studies have examined Oct4 genetic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004467-Boyer1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004467-Loh1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> and protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004467-Wang1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> networks. One important outcome of these studies is the observation that Oct4 and its protein binding partners form complex auto-regulatory circuits in which Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog proteins bind to each other's promoters. This auto-feedback system has been proposed as a feature of robustness, i.e. minor perturbations to the system will not produce major effects on gene transcription. Our data support and extend this idea. Despite highly elevated levels of Oct4 protein following treatment with 8-Br-cAMP, no change in transcription of genes controlled by Oct4 heterodimers (i.e. Oct4 itself, FGF4) was observed. This in turn suggests that stoichiometric control of transcription factor levels may provide robustness to this system. Thus, in the case of genes which are not subject to this stoichiometric, multivariate regulation (i.e. FGF12, osteopontin), absolute increases in levels of the single required protein should be sufficient to enhance transcription. Indeed, we found that putative PORE-containing genes were robustly activated following 8-Br-cAMP treatment (albeit with distinct patterns).</p><p>We further demonstrate that the cAMP-responsive enhancement of Oct4 activity is at least partially regulated through the p38 MAP kinase pathway. Previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004467-Robidoux1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004467-Cao1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref> revealed coupling of p38 MAPK signaling to cAMP signaling, which was largely mediated through activation of PKA. We found that specific activation of PKA had moderate effects on Oct4 transactivation; while stimulation of EPAC by itself had little effect on Oct4, simultaneous activation of EPAC and PKA strongly enhanced the effects observed following stimulation of either pathway individually. PKA and p38 MAPK signaling have not generally been explored in regulation of stem cell pluripotency or self-renewal. Our findings that these pathways directly modify Oct4 activity warrant further investigation of these signaling events in control of these processes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell Culture</title><p>P19 cells were cultured in alpha-minimal essential medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA) supplemented with 7.5&#x00025; calf serum and 2.5&#x00025; fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen).

The following primary antibodies were used: Oct4 (BD Transduction Laboratories, 1&#x02236;1000), phospho-p38 MAPK and total p38 MAPK (Cell Signaling), &#x003b2;-Actin clone AC-15 (Sigma Aldrich, 1&#x02236;5000) and GAPDH (Ambion, 1&#x02236;40,000). The next days, blots were washed three times for five minutes each with PBST, incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Pierce), washed again, and exposed with ECL reagent (Amersham). Blots were stripped with Pierce Restore western blot stripping buffer for 30 minutes at room temperature.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation</title><p>Confluent 10 cm plates were fixed with 1&#x00025; PFA at room temperature for 10 minutes, lysed in SDS lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, 10 mM EDTA, 1&#x00025; SDS, Roche Complete protease inhibitors, pH 8.1), scraped and collected into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes, and DNA was sonicated to 200&#x02013;800 bp fragments with a Branson Sonifier 250 set to 30&#x00025; power/90&#x00025; duty, four 10 second pulses. Tubes were kept on ice for &#x0003e;1 min. between pulses. Samples were spun down at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C and diluted 1&#x02236;10 with ChIP dilution buffer (167 mM NaCl, 16.7 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1.2 mM EDTA, 1.1&#x00025; Triton X-100, 0.01&#x00025; SDS). Lysates were pre-cleared with Protein A-agarose beads blocked with 2.5 mg/mL sonicated salmon sperm DNA (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.1&#x00025; bovine serum albumin (BSA, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Small aliquots were removed for input fractions. Protein-DNA complexes were then immunoprecipitated overnight with polyclonal Oct4 antibody (sc-9081, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), a mix of monoclonal Oct4 antibodies (BD Transduction Labs, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Chemicon), or normal serum controls (Pierce) on a rotator at 4&#x000b0;C.</p><p>The next day, complexes were isolated by incubation with Protein A beads (described above) for one hour at 4&#x000b0;C with rotation. Beads were washed sequentially in lo-salt buffer (150 mM NaCL, 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA, 1&#x00025; Triton X-100, 0.1&#x00025; SDS), hi-salt buffer (500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA, 1&#x00025; Triton X-100, 0.1&#x00025; SDS), and LiCl wash buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 1&#x00025; sodium deoxycholic acid, 1&#x00025; NP-40, 0.25 M LiCl), followed by two washes in ice-cold TE, all for five minutes with rotation at 4&#x000b0;C. Chromatin was eluted in elution buffer (1&#x00025; SDS, 0.1 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub>), 2&#x000d7;10 minutes. Cross-links were reversed by addition of 200 &#x000b5;M NaCl and heating for 4 hours at 65&#x000b0;C. Proteins were digested with Proteinase K (American Bioanalytical, Natick MA) and DNA was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. DNA was dissolved in H<sub>2</sub>0 and used for analysis. The following primer sequences were used:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>Nanogup <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-GTCTTTAGATCAGAGGATGCCCC-3&#x02032;</named-content></p></list-item><list-item><p>Nanogdown <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-CTACCCACCCCCTATTCTCCCA-3&#x02032;</named-content></p></list-item><list-item><p>fgf12up <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-AAGCCATCTCCCCAGACAAGAATA-3&#x02032;</named-content></p></list-item><list-item><p>fgf12down <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-GCTGATGGAGCACAATGACTATGA-3&#x02032;</named-content></p></list-item><list-item><p>PDE3Aup <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-ATCAACCAAAGAGGACACAAGGAG-3&#x02032;</named-content></p></list-item><list-item><p>PDE3Adown <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-CCCAAAAACTAAAAGAGCAGAGCG-3&#x02032;</named-content></p></list-item></list><p>Samples were run for 25&#x02013;35 cycles at 60&#x000b0;C annealing with 30 second extensions at 72&#x000b0;C.
