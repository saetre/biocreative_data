These I domains contain a metal ion-dependent adhesion site &#x00028;MIDAS&#x00029; made up of five non-consecutive amino acid residues that coordinate a divalent metal ion that is important for PA-binding. The MIDAS residues of integrin I domains shift depending upon whether the domain exists in a closed &#x00028;ligand-unbound&#x00029; or open &#x00028;ligand-bound&#x00029; conformation. Of relevance to this study, the MIDAS threonine residue coordinates the metal ion only in the open I domain conformation. Previously it was shown that the MIDAS threonine is essential for PA interaction with ANTXR1, a result consistent with the requirement that the I domain of that receptor adopts an open conformation for PA-binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000099-Bradley1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Here we have tested the requirement for the MIDAS threonine of ANTXR2 for PA-binding. We show that the toxin can bind to a mutant receptor lacking the MIDAS threonine and that it can use that mutant receptor to intoxicate cultured cells. These findings suggest that an open-like configuration of the ANTXR2 MIDAS is not essential for the interaction with PA.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="4"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Anthrax toxin is an AB-type toxin, secreted by <italic>B. anthracis</italic> that contributes to bacterial virulence, as well as causing many disease symptoms. The toxin has a single B-moiety, protective antigen (PA), for receptor binding and cytoplasmic delivery of the two catalytic A-moieties, lethal factor (LF) and edema factor (EF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000099-Collier1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The first step of intoxication involves binding of the full-length, 83 kDa form of PA (PA<sub>83</sub>) to either of two cell surface receptors, ANTXR1 (anthrax toxin receptor/tumor endothelial marker 8; ATR/TEM8) or ANTXR2 (capillary morphogenesis gene 2; CMG2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000099-Bradley2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000099-Scobie1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. These receptors share a von Willebrand factor A (VWA) or integrin inserted (I) domain, containing a metal ion dependent adhesion site (MIDAS), which binds PA. The MIDAS is made up of five non-consecutive, metal ion-coordinating, residues, i.e. D50, S52, S54, T118, and D148 in the case of ANTXR2.</p><p>Ligand binding to &#x003b1;-integrin I domains is regulated by a structural change from a &#x0201c;closed&#x0201d; or ligand-unbound conformation to an &#x0201c;open&#x0201d; or ligand-bound conformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000099-Shimaoka1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. These two conformations are associated with changes in divalent metal cation coordinating residues. In the closed conformation, ion coordination is mediated by both MIDAS serines, by the second MIDAS aspartate, and by three water molecules. In the open conformation, the ion is instead coordinated by a carboxylate-containing ligand side-chain, both MIDAS serines, the MIDAS threonine, and two water molecules. By coordinating the metal ion only in the open conformation, the MIDAS threonine residue is thought to increase the electrophilicity of the metal and therefore affinity for ligand, making it critical for the structural transition between the closed and open states of the I domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000099-Li1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The other major structural change that accompanies this transition is a 10&#x000c5; translocation of the I domain C-terminal &#x003b1;-helix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000099-Shimaoka1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The crystal structure of the ANTXR2-PA complex has revealed that PA&#x02013;receptor binding appears to resemble ligand binding to the open conformation of &#x003b1;-integrin I domains. Namely, the ANTXR2-bound divalent cation is directly coordinated by a carboxylate-containing side chain (residue D683) of PA as well as by the MIDAS threonine and serine residues, and water molecules coordinated by the MIDAS aspartate residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000099-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000099-Lacy1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000099-Santelli1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the ANTXR2-PA binding surface which includes residues from the receptor's I domain MIDAS face and residues from PA domains 2 and 4 (&#x0223c;2000&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>) is much larger than that of &#x003b1;-integrin-ligand interactions (&#x0223c;1300 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000099-Lacy1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000099-Santelli1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Previously it was shown that, similar to &#x003b1;-integrin-ligand interactions, the first MIDAS aspartate (D50) and the MIDAS threonine (T118) are critically important for PA binding and intoxication via ANTXR1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000099-Bradley1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Mutation of the first MIDAS aspartate abolishes metal ion binding whereas mutation of the MIDAS threonine, while permitting metal ion binding, prevents the MIDAS from adopting the configuration associated with the open I domain conformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000099-Li1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Given the importance of residue T118 of ANTXR1 it was proposed that an open-like configuration of the I domain of that receptor is essential for PA-binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000099-Bradley1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In this report, we have tested whether the same holds true for ANTXR2 and we show that, unlike in the case of ANTXR1, residue T118 is not essential for the ANTXR2-PA interaction, indicating that the I domain of ANTXR2 does not need to adopt a classical open-like conformation to bind PA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>DNA constructs and cell lines</title><p>Quikchange mutagenesis (Stratagene) performed on the previously described ANTXR2-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fusion construct (CMG2<sup>489</sup>-EGFP) and soluble ANTXR2-mycHis fusion constructs (sCMG2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000099-Scobie1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000099-Wesche1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> to generate D50A and T118A mutations with the oligonucleotide primers 5&#x02032; CTT CGT CCT GGC AAA GTC TGG GAG TG 3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032; CCA GTA GGA GAG GCA TAT ATC CAT G 3&#x02032;, respectively.

Flow cytometric analysis performed with PA, an anti-PA antibody and a fluoresceinated secondary antibody revealed that the T118A mutant receptor was expressed at the cell surface and could bind PA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000099-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). By contrast, the D50A mutant receptor did not bind PA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000099-g002">Fig. 2</xref>).
