The definition of the term "probiotic" has evolved through the years. The latest and most appropriate definition describes probiotics as "live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Beneficial activities of probiotics most likely result from complex interactions of the microorganisms with the intestinal microflora and the gut epithelium of the individual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. A proposed mechanism by which probiotics mediate their effects is the modulation of the innate immune response both to antiinflammatory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and proinflammatory directions. Furthermore, probiotic bacteria have been shown to enhance the adaptive immune response and antibody formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Inhibition of adherence of attaching and effacing organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], modulation of the mucosal barrier function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] as well as inhibition of neutrophil migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] may also be important mechanisms whereby probiotics can impact in intestinal diseases.</p><p>Next to lactic acid bacteria and the probiotic yeast <italic>S. boulardii</italic>, the non-pathogenic <italic>E. coli </italic>strain Nissle 1917 (EcN) of serotype O6:K5:H1 is one of the best characterized probiotics. EcN was originally isolated by the army surgeon Dr. Alfred Nissle in 1917 from the feces of a soldier who did not develop diarrhea during a severe outbreak of shigellosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. A controlled clinical trial published recently implies probiotic EcN being as effective as standard medication with a dose of 1,5 g/day mesalazine in remission maintenance of ulcerative colitis. In this study recurrance rates were 33.9% for mesalazine treatment compared to 36.4% for treatment with EcN (Mutaflor<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Recently, we have demonstrated, that recombinant EcN had no effect on migration, clonal expansion and activation status of specific CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells, neither in healthy mice nor in animals with acute colitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Despite the successful therapeutic applications of EcN, only limited information is available about the beneficial traits contributing to the strains' probiotic character. Several strain specific characteristics have been detected so far including expression of two microcins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], presence of six iron-uptake systems or lack of defined virulence factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Moreover, EcN exhibits a unique semirough lipopolysaccharide phenotype, responsible for its serum sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. All these properties might be advantageous for EcN in competing with other colonic bacteria or adapting to the intestinal situation. However, the mechanisms underlying the probiotic nature, especially at the molecular level, yet have to be elucidated.</p><p>In this study we aimed to analyze the genomic expression program initiated by the interaction of probiotic EcN with human intestinal epithelial cells. Our results demonstrate a transient proinflammatory signaling of human and mouse intestinal epithelial cells illustrated by induced gene expression of MCP-1, MIP-2&#x003b1; and MIP-2&#x003b2; after treatment with EcN.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture conditions</title><p>The human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines Caco-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and Lovo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] were maintained in IMDM cell culture medium (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) containing 10% fetal calf serum (PAA Laboratories, C&#x000f6;lbe, Germany) and 250 &#x003bc;g/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37&#x000b0;C in a cell culture incubator.

Samples were pooled prior to reverse transcription with 200 U Superscript II<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>(Invitrogen) for 45 minutes at 42&#x000b0;C in 20 &#x003bc;l assays containing 1 &#x003bc;l Oligo dT-primers and 10 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs). Conventional PCR was performed with AmpliTaq Gold<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) in 20 &#x003bc;l assays containing 0.25 pmol primers and 0.5 mM dNTP using the following cycling conditions: Activation of Taq polymerase for 10 minutes at 95&#x000b0;C, followed by a first round of 10 cycles each consisting of a 30 second denaturing interval at 95&#x000b0;C, a 90 second annealing step at the respective primer T<sub>m </sub>and a primer extension at 72&#x000b0;C for again 90 seconds. This first amplification step was followed by a second round of 27 cycles, consisting of 15 seconds denaturation, 45 seconds annealing and 90 seconds extension. PCR products were separated in 2% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium-bromide staining.

For biotinylated target synthesis, RNA was labeled using standard protocols supplied by the manufacturer (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, 5 &#x003bc;g total RNA was converted to dsDNA using 100 pmol of a T7T23V primer (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) containing a T7 promoter. The cDNA was then used directly in an <italic>in vitro </italic>transcription reaction in the presence of biotinylated nucleotides. The concentration of biotin-labeled cRNA was determined by UV absorbance. In all cases, 12.5 &#x003bc;g of each biotinylated cRNA preparation were fragmented and placed in a hybridization cocktail containing four biotinylated hybridization controls (BioB, BioC, BioD, and Cre) as recommended by the manufacturer. Samples were hybridized to an identical lot of Affymetrix HG_U133A arrays for 16 hours. After hybridization, the GeneChips were washed, stained with strepavidin-phycoerythrin and read using an Affymetrix GeneChip fluidic station and scanner.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>Analysis of microarray data was performed using Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0, Affymetrix MicroDB 3.0 and the Affymetrix Data Mining Tool 3.0. For normalization all array experiments were scaled to a target intensity of 150, otherwise using the default values of the Microarray Suite. Results were filtered as follows: Genes are considered strongly regulated when their fold change is greater than or equal 2 or less than or equal -2, the statistical parameter for a significant change is less than 0.01 (change p-value for changes called increased) or greater than 0.99 (change p-value for changes called decreased). Additionally, the signal difference of a certain gene should be greater than 100. Genes are considered as weakly regulated when their fold change is greater than or equal 1.5 or less than or equal -1.5, the statistical parameter for a significant change is less than 0.001 or greater than 0.999 and the signal difference of a certain gene should be greater than 40.</p></sec><sec><title>Real-time RT-PCR</title><p>Total RNA preparation and cDNA synthesis were performed as described for RT-PCR. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was done with an ABI PRISM cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using SYBR Green PCR kit from Stratagene and specific primers optimized to amplify 90 &#x02013; 250 bp fragments from the genes under investigation (Tab. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). A threshold was set in the linear part of the amplification curve, and the number of cycles needed to reach it was calculated for every gene. Relative mRNA levels were determined by using included standard curves for each individual gene and further normalization to the housekeeping gene RPS9. Melting curves established the purity of the amplified band.</p></sec><sec><title>Cytokine analysis by CBA</title><p>Quantification of cytokines was performed using the BD<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Cytometric Bead Array Human Chemokine Kit I with antibodies specific for IL-8, RANTES, MIG, MCP-1 and IP-10 (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany).

After coincubation, cells were washed three times with 1 &#x000d7; PBS and fixed with a fixation solution containing 5% formaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer (0.1 M cacodylate, 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.01 M MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.09 M sucrose, pH 6.9), washed with cacodylate buffer and then with TE-buffer (10 mM TRIS, 2 mM EDTA, pH 6.9). Finally, cells were scratched from the wells, pelleted and embedded in 2% aqueous agar before dehydrating with a graded series of acetone (10, 30, 50, 70, 90, 100%) on ice for 30 min at each step. Samples in 100% acetone were allowed to reach room temperature before another change of 100% acetone. They were then subjected to critical-point drying with liquid CO<sub>2 </sub>(CPD 030, BAL-TEC, Schalksm&#x000fc;hle, Germany). The dried cells were covered with a gold film of about 10 nm by sputter coating (SCD040, BAL-TEC) before examination in a field emission scanning electron microscope Zeiss DSM 982 Gemini (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) using the Everhart Thornley SE detector and the inlens detector in a 50:50 ratio at an acceleration voltage of 5 kV.

Due to some genes being repeatedly present on the array, we finally found a total of 126 individual genes to be regulated. They belonged to a wide variety of gene classes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). From the coding sequences that could be assigned to one of these classes, 17% pertained to signaling pathways. The remainder of the genes encoded for molecules involved in protein folding and biosynthesis (10%), transcription and translation (10%), transport (8%), metabolism (6%) as well as energy pathways (5%), immune response (4%) proliferation (3%), differentiation (1%) and apoptosis (1%). A better part of them, like genes coding for hypothetical proteins and unannotated ORFs, could not be allocated to one of the classes and was therefore assigned as others (35%). Selected genes of each class, that showed at least a two fold regulation in one of the two experiments, were summarized in table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>. 9 of these genes were selected for further investigations. They were choosen on the basis of both, prominent changes in their gene expression profiles and their putative biological implication at the outset of our study. Significantly elevated mRNA levels were found for dual-specificity phosphatase 5 (DUSP5), chemoattractant protein-1 ligand 2 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein-2 alpha (MIP-2&#x003b1;), macrophage inflammatory protein-2 beta (MIP-2&#x003b2;), tumor necrosis factor alpha induced protein 3 (TNF&#x003b1;IP3) and ets domain transcription factor ELF3. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), active in angiogenesis, vasculogenesis and endothelial cell growth, was up-regulated as well. Yet another gene, up-regulated by EcN treatment, was human nuclear factor of kappa light chain gene enhancer in B cells inhibitor alpha (NF&#x003ba;BIA), which inhibits the action of NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Downregulation of gene expression was observed for epithelial membrane protein 3 (EMP3). The mRNA expression levels of these genes were validated by real-time RT-PCR. The entire data set of our microarray experiments is accessible as MIAME format online with accession number GSE2232 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Real-time RT-PCR to confirm data obtained with gene expression analysis arrays</title><p>Electron micrographs of the coculture experiments are shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>. Panel A I illustrates untreated Caco-2 cells. Cells coincubated with <italic>E. coli </italic>MG1655, serving as control strain, and EcN are depicted in panels A II and A III, respectively. Array data for MCP-1, MIP-2&#x003b1;, MIP-2&#x003b2;, DUSP5, ELF3 and NF&#x003ba;BIA were verified by real-time RT-PCR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). The strongest up-regulation of mRNA expression, compared to control cells, could be detected for MCP-1. There was a 103 fold increase, compared to an mRNA level elevated only 8 fold after treatment with <italic>E. coli </italic>MG1655. Additionally, gene expression levels of MIP-2&#x003b1;, MIP-2&#x003b2; and DUSP5 were more than 20 fold higher than the controls, when Caco-2 cells were treated with EcN. Array data obtained for TNF&#x003b1;IP3 and VEGF could also be confirmed by real-time RT-PCR, but the increase in mRNA levels was almost identical for Caco-2 cells treated with <italic>E. coli </italic>MG1655 or EcN. Therefore, up-regulation of TNF&#x003b1;IP3 and VEGF could not be considered to be an EcN specific effect. We were not able to verify down-regulation of EMP3 by real-time RT-PCR as indicated by our array data (data not shown). In summary, the regulation pattern of EcN-treated Caco-2 cells compared to treatment with <italic>E. coli </italic>MG1655 after 6 hours coculture suggested a specific EcN-mediated up-regulation of MCP-1, MIP-2&#x003b1;, MIP-2&#x003b2;, DUSP5, NF&#x003ba;BIA and ELF3 expression in human intestinal epithelial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Detection of MCP-1 in Caco-2 coculture supernatants by CBA analysis</title><p>Supernatants from Caco-2 cells cocultured with EcN and <italic>E. coli </italic>MG1655 were analyzed for several cytokines. Compared to untreated Caco-2 cells and cells treated with <italic>E. coli </italic>MG1655, coculture with EcN significantly increased release of MCP-1 protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), indicating an EcN specific up-regulation of this proinflammatory molecule. Additionally, EcN treatment of Caco-2 cells resulted in an increased secretion of IP-10 (interferon gamma-inducible cytokine IP-10; data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>EcN specific up-regulation of MCP-1 and MIP-2&#x003b1; is not a Caco-2 cell specific phenomenon</title><p>To exclude that the EcN specific up-regulation of proinflammatory molecules MCP-1 and MIP-2&#x003b1; was a feature specific for Caco-2 cells, coculture experiments were performed with the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line Lovo. Therefore, confluent Lovo cells were cocultured with EcN or <italic>E. coli </italic>MG1655 for 6 hours, respectively. As already documented for Caco-2 cells, EcN again provoked a strong specific up-regulation of these two proinflammatory molecules. The gene expression level of MCP-1 was 89 fold higher compared to control cells, whereas treatment with <italic>E. coli </italic>MG1655 resulted in a 9 fold increase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). In addition, MIP-2&#x003b1; was 15 fold up-regulated after treatment with EcN in comparison to a 2 fold elevation mediated by <italic>E. coli </italic>MG1655. Results obtained from conventional RT-PCR also revealed an EcN specific induction of MIP-2&#x003b2; (data not shown). Consequently, up-regulation of MCP-1 and MIP-2&#x003b1; after treatment with EcN was not a feature of one cell line but rather a general EcN specific effect on human intestinal epithelial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Gene expression of MCP-1, MIP-2&#x003b1; and MIP-2&#x003b2; is time-dependent</title><p>Subsequently, we measured time kinetics of gene expression of selected proinflammatory molecules. Extended treatment of Caco-2 cells with EcN or <italic>E. coli </italic>MG1655 for another 24 or 48 hours revealed that EcN-mediated gene expression of MCP-1, DUSP5 and NF&#x003ba;BIA peaked after 6 hours and returned to base levels after 24 hours (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). In contrast, expression of MIP-2&#x003b1; and MIP-2&#x003b2; increased further and reached maximum values after 24 hours. However, longer incubation with EcN resulted again in a decreased MIP-2&#x003b1; and MIP-2&#x003b2; gene expression. <italic>E. coli </italic>MG1655 influenced the expression of most of the selected genes just slightly at any time, but revealed a peak for MIP-2&#x003b2; expression after 24 hours, similar to EcN (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), suggesting that the observed time course of regulation of this proinflammatory cytokine was not EcN specific.</p></sec><sec><title>EcN induced expression of MIP-2&#x003b1; and MIP-2&#x003b2; is not dependent on viable bacteria</title><p>We also aimed to elucidate whether the observed EcN specific expression of selected genes was merely a result of contact between bacterial surfaces and Caco-2 cells and additionally, whether the secretion of active bacterial metabolites was required for the EcN specific induction of the selected genes. Hence, Caco-2 cells were either cocultured with inactivated bacteria or conditioned media (CM) as described in Materials and Methods. Our results indicated that culturing of Caco-2 cells with bacteria CM did not lead to an EcN specific regulation of the selected genes in Caco-2 cells (Tab. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Thus, EcN apparently did not secrete active metabolites responsible for specific gene expression. Additionally, for the induction of MCP-1 and NF&#x003ba;BIA gene expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) live bacteria were necessary, as no EcN specific gene expression could be measured after exposure of Caco-2 cells to inactivated bacteria (Tab. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). In contrast, mRNA levels achieved by incubation with formalin killed EcN for MIP-2&#x003b1;, MIP-2&#x003b2;, EMP3, DUSP5 and ELF3 were equivalent to live bacteria. Incubation over 24 h (data not shown) led to a decrease of EcN specific gene expression correlating with the data presented in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>. These results suggested that the effect of EcN on the gene expression profile of Caco-2 cells was not only dependent on one single pathway but a combined action of viable bacteria and membrane bound or secreted factors.</p></sec><sec><title>MCP-1 is up-regulated in small intestine after EcN treatment</title><p>Our results indicate that the EcN mediated expression of proinflammatory molecules was a short- time effect (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). After investigation of the influence of EcN on human cell lines, we next examined the effect of EcN on mouse intestinal epithelial layer. Cima et al. described an efficient method for the differential isolation of intestinal epithelial cells along the villus-crypt axis of the small intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Using a modification of this method, pieces of small intestine were cocultured with EcN or <italic>E. coli </italic>MG1655 for 6 hours to analyze the impact of EcN on mouse primary tissue culture. Several reasons prompted us to use small intestinal tissue for these experiments. Since contact between bacteria and intestinal epithelial cells was a required condition for the impact of EcN, a smooth removal of the mucus layer was necessary. This is ensured for small intestine as it has a thinner mucus layer than the colon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Additionally, the murine small intestine is nearly bacteria-free in contrast to a high bacterial density in the colon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Thus, the use of small intestine for primary tissue culture enabled a specific bacteria-cell interaction in contrast to the colon. In order to maintain an intact cell organization and to prevent any stress that might influence the cellular gene expression profile, small tissue pieces were used. Real-time RT PCR revealed a 23 fold increase of MCP-1 expression after treatment with EcN compared to non-treated tissue (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). In contrast to EcN, coculture with <italic>E. coli </italic>MG1655 yielded an elevated mRNA level of only 4 fold confirming our results obtained from experiments with confluent human cell lines. Summarized, our data obtained from primary mouse tissue culture confirmed the data of cell culture experiments with two human intestinal epithelial cell lines and corroborated the finding that EcN was able to specifically provoke a proinflammatory host response.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results demonstrate that EcN up-regulates gene expression of molecules involved in pro- as well as antiinflammatory processes. A proinflammatory response of intestinal epithelial cells to EcN was mainly demonstrated by the temporary up-regulation of MCP-1 gene expression in confluent human cell lines and in primary mouse tissue culture as well as by an increased secretion of this chemokine. This EcN specific change of MCP-1 gene expression could neither be induced with bacteria conditioned media nor with formalin inactivated organisms suggesting that for EcN mediated MCP-1 gene expression viable bacteria are necessary. MCP-1 is produced by many cells, including epithelial, endothelial and mast cells as well as tumor cells, and shows chemotactic activity for monocytes, basophils, natural killer cells and T lymphocytes during inflammation. Among other things, MCP-1 influences the release of specific enzymes of these target cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. MCP-1 is expressed under many pathological conditions, including asthma and inflammatory bowel diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Infection of human macrophages, which have a central role in innate immune response to bacteria, with non-pathogenic <italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus </italic>GG, results in an enhanced MCP-1 expression and an induction of T helper cell type 1 (Th1) cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Earlier this year, Lan et al. have shown that exposure of primary murine colonic epithelial cells to the same <italic>Lactobacillus </italic>strain also resulted in an exclusive induction of MCP-1 and MIP-2&#x003b1; expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Moreover, it has been reported, that lactobacilli are able to activate myeloid dendritic cells that skew CD4<sup>+ </sup>and CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells to Th1 and Tc1 polarization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Earlier studies have shown that MCP-1 expression also shifts the immune response towards release of Th2 cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and thus can potentially affect antibacterial defenses. Although it seems unexpected at first sight that the probiotic EcN up-regulates MCP-1 mRNA expression and protein secretion, an important role of this proinflammatory molecule might be established in protecting the host from bacterial infection through induction of a strong T cell immune response, thus providing a reasonable explanation for the EcN induced expression of this chemokine. The neutrophil attracting chemokines MIP-2&#x003b1; and MIP-2&#x003b2; represent two additional genes involved in inflammatory processes and are exhibiting a number of immunoregulatory activities. Both of which showed an increased expression in our coculture experiments after 6 hours, reaching peak levels after 24 hours. Subcutaneous injection of MIP-2 into footpads of C3H/HeJ mice elicited an inflammatory response characterized by neutrophil infiltration, suggesting MIP-2 to be an endogenous mediator playing a role in the host response during inflammatory processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The MIP-2 expression of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or IL-1&#x003b2; stimulated intestinal epithelial cells is amplified by butyrate, a metabolite of nonpathogenic, resident bacteria. This is a potential mechanism by which resident bacteria may regulate inflammatory processes in the small intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In contrast to MCP-1, EcN mediated expression of MIP-2&#x003b1; and MIP-2&#x003b2; seemed to be independent on the viability of the probiotic in our experiments, as inactivated bacteria induced gene expression as well. Thus, it appears that EcN can induce a potent proinflammatory cytokine response which is in part dependent on the viability of the bacteria. It can be speculated that the local induction of proinflammatory immune responses within the intestinal immune system characterized by up-regulation of MCP-1, MIP-2&#x003b1; and MIP-2&#x003b2; upon contact with probiotic EcN might reflect being part of the host defense process against pathogenic bacteria through the establishment of a protective immunological barrier. However, further <italic>in vitro </italic>and especially <italic>in vivo </italic>experiments are needed to provide evidence that such mechanisms are part of the repertoire of protective responses exhibited by EcN in the intestine.</p><p>The transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B and the corresponding pathway play an important role in proinflammatory signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Prevention of the NF-&#x003ba;B translocation into the nucleus by the I&#x003ba;B proteins NF&#x003ba;BIA and NF&#x003ba;BIB leads to inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B, followed by suppression of proinflammatory genes. In our experiments up-regulated gene expression of the transcription inhibitor NF&#x003ba;BIA could be observed. It can be assumed that the observed EcN specific chemokine expression is induced via a NF-&#x003ba;B independent pathway. The JNK/AP-1 signaling cascade is a likely candidate, since transcription and secretion of MCP-1 can also be activated through this pathway triggered by TLR4 signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. It is a well-known fact that toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and 5 (TLR5) recognize LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] and bacterial flagellin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], respectively. Both receptors induce among others the transcription of MCP-1, MIP-2&#x003b1; and MIP-2&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Induction of DSS colitis in TLR4<sup>-/- </sup>mice led to an altered neutrophil recruitment due to diminished MIP-2 expression by lamina propria macrophages. Thus, TLR4 participates in the intestinal immune response to luminal bacteria and the development of colitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Since both, EcN and <italic>E. coli </italic>MG1655 possess flagellin and LPS, it can be speculated that an additional component of EcN not yet identified is able to induce MCP-1 gene expression. However, the semirough O6 lipopolysaccharide phenotype of EcN, which is different from O6 LPS of uropathogenic <italic>E. coli </italic>and which is responsible for serum sensitivity of EcN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], might also play a role in this context.</p><p>Even though the proinflammatory activity of EcN, manifested by MCP-1 gene expression and protein secretion, appears surprising at first sight, the genome content of this probiotic strain offers explanations for its proinflammatory properties. Genome comparisons of probiotic EcN and the uropathogenic <italic>E. coli </italic>(UPEC) strain CFT073 as recently published by our laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] and Grozdanov et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] revealed a high degree of homology between these two strains. The existence of about 130 "common virulence factors" in probiotic EcN, as defined by the PRINTS protein fingerprint database, suggests that these proteins cannot be considered as virulence factors per se, but may also contribute to the general fitness of EcN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of our study revealed that EcN specifically upregulated genes in confluent human intestinal epithelial cell culture.
