Pertussis toxin (PT), a virulence factor secreted exclusively by <italic>B. pertussis</italic>, promotes bacterial growth in the airways by suppression and modulation of host immune responses. By comparison of wild type and PT-deficient strains, we examined the role of PT in modulating airway cytokine and chemokine responses affecting neutrophil recruitment during <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infection in mice. We found that, despite early inhibition of neutrophil recruitment by PT, high numbers of neutrophils were recruited to the airways by 4 days post-infection with the wild type strain, but not with the PT-deficient strain, and that this correlated with upregulation of neutrophil-attracting chemokine gene expression. In addition, there was similar upregulation of genes expressing the cytokines IL-17A (IL-17), TNF-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b3;, indicating a mixed Th1/Th17 response. Expression of IL-6, a cytokine involved in Th17 induction, was upregulated earlier than the IL-17 response. We showed that PT, rather than bacterial numbers, was important for induction of these responses. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the IL-17-producing cells were macrophages and neutrophils as well as T cells, and were present predominantly in the airways rather than the lung tissue. Antibody neutralization of IL-17 significantly reduced chemokine gene expression and neutrophil recruitment to the airways, but only modestly increased peak bacterial loads. These data indicate that PT stimulates inflammatory responses by induction of Th1- and Th17-associated cytokines, including IL-17, during <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infection in mice, but a role for IL-17 in protection against the infection remains to be established.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic> is a Gram-negative bacterial pathogen that infects the human respiratory tract and causes an acute disease known as pertussis or whooping cough. The bacteria adhere to ciliated cells and proliferate within the upper and lower respiratory tract, and do not disseminate to other tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Carbonetti1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. A mouse model of respiratory tract infection by this pathogen has been widely used to study the roles of various virulence factors, the associated pathology, and the immune responses elicited by the infection. Although symptomatic disease (cough) and transmission are not observed in the mouse model, several characteristics of the human disease are present, such as bacterial multiplication and clearance, limitation of the infection to the respiratory tract, and increased severity of infection in infant mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Mills1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Pittman1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, systemic effects of the disease observed in humans, such as leukocytosis and hypoglycemia, can be detected in infected mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Pittman1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. These characteristics, as well as the availability of inbred mice and genetically altered immunodeficient strains, make the mouse model useful for the study of host immune responses to <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infection.</p><p><italic>B. pertussis</italic> produces several virulence-associated factors that contribute to the ability of this pathogen to infect the respiratory tract and cause disease. Among these virulence factors are two secreted toxins, pertussis toxin (PT) and adenylate cyclase toxin (ACT), both of which have suppressive and modulatory effects on the immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Carbonetti1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. PT, which is produced exclusively by <italic>B. pertussis</italic>, is a six-subunit exotoxin of AB<sub>5</sub> configuration that ADP-ribosylates the &#x003b1; subunit of G<sub>i</sub> proteins in mammalian cells, thereby inhibiting many cell signaling events through G protein-coupled receptors. By comparing wild type and PT-deficient <italic>B. pertussis</italic> strains in the mouse model, our group has recently shown that PT contributes significantly to bacterial growth in the respiratory tract by effects on host cells of the airways, including inhibitory effects on the protective role of resident airway macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Carbonetti2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Carbonetti3">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Carbonetti4">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. PT also inhibits early neutrophil influx to the airways after infection by suppressing the early production of the neutrophil-attracting chemokines KC, LIX and MIP-2 by airway macrophages and epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Andreasen1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.However, this latter property may not contribute significantly to bacterial growth, at least in na&#x000ef;ve mice, since neutrophil depletion did not increase bacterial loads, possibly because of the inhibitory activities of PT and ACT on neutrophils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Andreasen2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Several studies have shown that PT and ACT also modulate cytokine responses produced by immune cells and during infection in the mouse model. ACT can upregulate major histocompatibility complex class II and costimulatory molecules on dendritic cells, inducing a semi-mature state that induces IL-10 production and decreases proinflammatory cytokine production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Bagley1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Ross1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Skinner1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. However, ACT may also have proinflammatory properties since it can induce cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) production by macrophages in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Perkins1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. PT can inhibit production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;) and IL-6, as well as various chemokines, by mouse macrophages in response to LPS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Andreasen2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Zhang1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Lentschat1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. However, PT can also synergize with LPS to induce proinflammatory cytokine production by dendritic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Ausiello1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore the modulatory activities of these toxins on cytokine production are complex and may depend on several variables, including host cell type and other bacterial factors. How these toxins modulate cytokine immune responses during infection by <italic>B. pertussis</italic> is even less clear.</p><p>Several recent studies on immunomodulation by <italic>B. pertussis</italic> have shown that the host immune response may be skewed towards expansion of a subset of T lymphocytes termed Th17 cells, which produce the cytokine IL-17A (hereafter referred to as IL-17) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Higgins1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, despite earlier studies having indicated that <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infection promotes a Th1 immune response (based largely on IFN-&#x003b3; production) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Mills1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Harrington1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

To determine the extended kinetics of neutrophil recruitment to the airways in response to WT and &#x00394;PT infection, we inoculated mice with 5&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> CFU of either strain (a dose at which &#x00394;PT has a significant infection defect) and performed bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) on groups of mice at several time points post-inoculation to determine the number of neutrophils present in the airways, as well as determining bacterial loads in the respiratory tract. As seen previously, early (day 1) recruitment of neutrophils to the airways was significantly lower (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.002) in response to WT than to &#x00394;PT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007079-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>), but by day 2 post-inoculation, the difference in neutrophil recruitment in response to the two strains was eliminated (<italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.64). On days 4, 7, and 14 post-inoculation, we saw high numbers of airway neutrophils in response to WT infection but not to &#x00394;PT infection, with the numbers still rising at day 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007079-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). This second wave of neutrophil recruitment in response to the WT strain occurred during the peak phase of infection, and lasted at least until day 14 post-inoculation when bacterial numbers were declining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007079-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). As we have seen previously, bacterial loads of the WT strain were at least 10-fold higher than those of &#x00394;PT at these time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007079-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>), and so it is possible that high levels of bacterial factors, including LPS, can overcome the inhibitory effect of PT and stimulate the high level neutrophil recruitment in response to WT at the peak of infection. However, another possibility is that PT has a direct effect on this stimulation by modulating immune responses, thereby inducing a strong neutrophil recruitment in response to infection.</p><fig id="pone-0007079-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007079.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Kinetics of neutrophil recruitment during <italic>B. pertussis</italic> WT and &#x00394;PT infection.</title><p>(A) Numbers of neutrophils in the airways and (B) bacterial loads in the respiratory tract of mice at the indicated times post-infection with 5&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> CFU of WT (closed bars) or &#x00394;PT (open bars) strains. <italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;4 mice/treatment group.

IL-17, in turn, results in the production of chemokines by resident cells of the lung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Linden1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Ferretti1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Linden2">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, leading to a strong neutrophil recruitment to the airways. The Th17 responses are driven, in part, by the production of IL-6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Steinman1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> and are associated with increased release of TNF-&#x003b1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Iwamoto1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. In our studies, there was significantly greater induction of IL-6 gene expression in response to &#x00394;PT than WT on day 1 post-infection. However, this induction of IL-6 was short-lived and not associated with the production of IL-17 or TNF-&#x003b1;. In response to WT infection, however, there was a strong induction of IL-6 by day 2 post-infection, which preceded the induction of IL-17 and TNF-&#x003b1;, consistent with the established role of IL-6 in Th17 induction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Steinman1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. In support of this effect of PT, a recent report demonstrated that PT stimulated the generation of Th17 cells in co-cultured na&#x000ef;ve T cells and dendritic cells in an IL-6-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Chen1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Which target cells and signaling pathways PT might affect in vivo to bring about these influences on immune responses remains to be elucidated.</p><p>Several reports have shown that infection with <italic>B. pertussis</italic> in both humans and mice induces a Th1 response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Mascart1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Zepp1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Barnard1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. However, there are reports indicating that the production of IFN-&#x003b3; inhibits the induction of IL-17 responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Steinman1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Nakae1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref> as well as evidence suggesting that IL-17 can inhibit Th1 responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Nakae1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Nevertheless, a Th1/Th17 response with the production of both Th1 and Th17 cytokines has been described recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Higgins1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Annunziato1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref> and a report by Higgins <italic>et al</italic>. suggested that vaccination of mice with a whole-cell pertussis vaccine leads to the induction of a Th17/Th1 response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Higgins1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. In our studies, IFN-&#x003b3; gene expression was induced strongly in response to the WT strain at the peak of infection, while the induction of IFN-&#x003b3; in response to &#x00394;PT was relatively low, consistent with the notion that <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infection induces a Th1/Th17 response that is promoted by PT. However, while the induction of the Th17 response was long-lived and gene expression remained up-regulated (several fold) even while the infection was being cleared, the Th1 response was only induced during the peak of infection (days 4 and 7) and gene expression of IFN-&#x003b3; was reduced to that of control levels by day 14 post-infection. We also detected an increase in IL-10 gene expression near the peak of infection with WT, but not &#x00394;PT, indicating induction of a complex mixture of T cell subtypes during this infection. Overall our data are consistent with the emerging finding that <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infection modulates the immune response towards a Th1/Th17 response.</p><p>Our flow cytometry analysis revealed the presence of significant numbers of IL-17<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells in WT-infected mice but not in &#x00394;PT-infected mice, consistent with the gene expression data. We were surprised to find that the IL-17<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were predominantly in the airways (BAL) rather than the lung tissue. However, this may be a technical artifact due to the relatively lengthy procedure to isolate lung cells during which cytokines may have been released (although in one attempt at in vitro restimulation of lung cells in the presence of Brefeldin A we did not detect any IL-17<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells &#x02013; data not shown). We were also surprised to find that the IL-17<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells included neutrophils and macrophages as well as T cells. Which of these cells actually secrete the cytokine during infection remains to be determined however, since intracellular staining was used to detect cytokine expression in our analysis.</p><p>Several recent studies suggest that toxins released by <italic>Bordetella</italic> species may induce a Th17 response. Adenylate cyclase toxin (ACT) and the type III secretion system may contribute to induction of a Th17 response to <italic>Bordetella</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Siciliano1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. LPS signaling through TLR4 also contributes to Th17 responses in mixed cell culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Fedele2">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref> or after <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infection and pertussis vaccination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Higgins1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Banus1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. We have also found a role for ACT in promoting a Th17 response to <italic>B. pertussis</italic>, and our data suggest that PT and ACT may have a synergistic effect on the induction of Th1 and Th17 cytokines (Andreasen and Carbonetti, manuscript in preparation). Whether the Th17 response plays a role in protection against primary <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infection is still unclear. Higgins <italic>et al</italic>. showed that a possible role for IL-17 in protective immunity to <italic>B. pertussis</italic> was enhancing bacterial killing by macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Higgins1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. In our studies, intranasal administration of &#x003b1;-IL-17 antibodies only modestly enhanced peak bacterial growth in the airways and did not delay clearance of the infection, although this treatment did inhibit KC gene expression and neutrophil recruitment to the airways in response to <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infection. We have recently shown that neutrophils are not protective against primary <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Andreasen2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> suggesting that if IL-17 is protective against this infection it must act through another mechanism, such as enhancing macrophage activity. Alternatively, other Th17-associated cytokines, such as IL-22 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Aujla1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, may be important or may synergize with IL-17 to control this infection. Clearance of primary <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infection involves T cells, since T cell-deficient mice fail to clear the infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Mills2">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, but the relative contribution of Th1 and Th17 cells and the mechanisms utilized are still unknown.</p><p>Th17 responses have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several chronic immune-mediated pathologies, such as asthma, multiple sclerosis, arthritis and colitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Steinman1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, so it is tempting to speculate that this response may also contribute to the pathology of pertussis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Carbonetti1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, especially the prolonged cough associated with this disease. We have detected significant IL-17 gene expression and high numbers of neutrophils in the lungs of mice 21 days after <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infection (data not shown - we have not yet assayed later time points), and neutrophilia in the airways has been associated with non-specific symptoms such as cough and bronchial hyperactivity and hypersecretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Linden1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, it is plausible that induction of a Th17 response and subsequent recruitment of large numbers of neutrophils to the airways contributes to the prolonged paroxysmal cough associated with <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infection in humans. Until we have a cough model for this infection we will not be able to test this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Bacterial Strains</title><p>The <italic>B. pertussis</italic> strains used for this study were streptomycin- and nalidixic acid-resistant derivatives of Tohama I and were produced as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007079-Carbonetti3">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.
