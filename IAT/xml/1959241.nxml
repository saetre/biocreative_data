Whereas most PI3Ks have a broad tissue distribution, the tyrosine kinase-linked p110&#x003b4; isoform has previously been shown to be enriched in leukocytes. Here we report that p110&#x003b4; is also highly expressed in the nervous system. Inactivation of p110&#x003b4; in mice did not affect gross neuronal development but led to an increased vulnerability of dorsal root ganglia neurons to exhibit growth cone collapse and decreases in axonal extension. Loss of p110&#x003b4; activity also dampened axonal regeneration following peripheral nerve injury in adult mice and impaired functional recovery of locomotion. p110&#x003b4; inactivation resulted in reduced neuronal signaling through the Akt protein kinase, and increased activity of the small GTPase RhoA. Pharmacological inhibition of ROCK, a downstream effector of RhoA, restored axonal extension defects in neurons with inactive p110&#x003b4;, suggesting a key role of RhoA in p110&#x003b4; signaling in neurons. Our data identify p110&#x003b4; as an important signaling component for efficient axonal elongation in the developing and regenerating nervous system.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are a family of lipid kinases which regulate a wide variety of biological responses in different cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000869-Vanhaesebroeck1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

DRGs were dissected from E13.5 mouse embryos and extramesenchymal tissue was removed using a sharpened 0.2 mm tungsten wire. DRGs were then plated on glass coverslips previously coated with poly-L-lysine and laminin (both at 20 &#x000b5;g/ml; Sigma). For primary neuronal cultures, DRGs were incubated in trypsin (1 mg/ml, diluted in HBSS) for 10 min at 37&#x000b0;C, and dissociated using a fire-polished Pasteur pipette. Neurons were either cultured at low density (50 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>) for neurite outgrowth assays on glass coverslips coated as described above, or in laminin-coated 6-well dishes (150 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>) for biochemical analysis. Explants and primary DRG neurons were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C/5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub> for 24 h in DMEM/10&#x00025; FCS/Pen/Strep supplemented with 20 ng/ml NGF (Promega).

Neurons were then labeled with Phalloidin-Alexa488 (1&#x02236;50 in PBST) and anti-&#x003b2;III-tubulin antibody (1&#x02236;800; Covance). For each experiment, the collapsed growth cones were counted and represented as a &#x00025; ratio. Each experiment was performed a minimum of 4 times, and the average &#x00025; collapsed was determined. Standard errors of the mean were determined as the (standard deviation/square root (number of experiments)). For determination of neurite length, neurons were labeled with the anti-&#x003b2;III-tubulin antibody, and the KS300 program (Zeiss) was used to measure neurite length in each treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s3i"><title>SDS-PAGE and Western blotting</title><p>Dissociated neurons were washed twice with ice-cold PBS lysed for 30 min in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris.HCl pH 7.4, 250 mM sucrose, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5&#x00025; NP40, complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mM DTT, 25 mM NaF).
