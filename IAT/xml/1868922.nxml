We sought to reproduce this MPA cancer model in C57BL/6 mice because of their widespread use in genetic engineering. Within this experimental setting, we studied the carcinogenic effects of MPA, the morphologic changes in mammary glands that are induced by MPA and progesterone, and the levels of ER and PR expression in MPA-treated and progesterone-treated mammary glands. Finally, we evaluated whether the differences found between BALB/c and C57BL/6 mouse strains were due to intrinsic differences in epithelial cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The carcinogenic effect of MPA was evaluated in C57BL/6 mice using protocols proven to be carcinogenic in BALB/c mice. In addition, BALB/c and C57BL/6 females were treated with progesterone or MPA for 1 or 2 months, and mammary glands were excised for histologic studies and for immunohistochemical and Western blot evaluation of ER and PR.

The expression of ER-&#x003b1; and PR isoform A in virgin mice was surprisingly much higher in BALB/c than in C57BL/6 mammary glands, and both receptors were downregulated in progestin-treated BALB/c mice (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05). PR isoform B levels were low in virgin control mice and increased after progestin treatment in both strains. ER-&#x003b2; expression followed a similar trend. No differences in hormone levels were found between strains. Surprisingly, the transplantation of the epithelial mammary gland cells of both strains into the cleared fat pads of Swiss (<italic>nu</italic>/<italic>nu</italic>) mice abolished the mammary gland morphologic differences and the ER and PR differences between strains.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>C57BL/6 mammary glands are resistant to MPA-induced carcinogenesis and to hormone action. MPA and progesterone have different effects on mammary glands. Low ER-&#x003b1; and PR-A levels in untreated mammary glands may be associated with a low-risk breast cancer profile. Although we cannot at this time rule out the participation of other, untested factors, our findings implicate the stroma as playing a crucial role in the strain-specific differential hormone receptor expression and hormone responsiveness.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Breast cancer is the most common malignancy diagnosed among women worldwide, and it is the second leading cause of cancer mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. One of the hallmarks of the disease is the expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR), and it is this expression that ultimately drives prognosis and treatment approaches.</p><p>During the past 50 years, the experimental study of breast cancer has been approached utilizing many different <italic>in vivo </italic>as well as <italic>in vitro </italic>models, some of which have been used widely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]: the 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<italic>N</italic>-nitrosourea induced mammary tumors in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]; mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-induced carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]; human breast cancer cell lines growing in cell culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] or as xenografts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]; transgenic and knockout animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]; and, more recently, conditional knockout and inducible transgenic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Genetically engineered mice have been used extensively to model human breast cancer as well as to dissect the molecular pathways of tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and they have contributed much to our understanding of how cancer evolves. Interestingly, most of the genetically modified mice available for the study of breast cancer do not express ER and PR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], leaving few models available in which to address hormone-dependent tumor progression specifically.</p><p>Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) induces ductal mammary carcinomas in BALB/c mice that express ER and PR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. During preliminary studies, conducted to investigate strains that may be susceptible to MPA other than BALB/c, we found C57BL/6 to be resistant to the standard MPA dosage that is used to develop mammary carcinomas. This strain had already been reported to be resistant to mammary tumorigenesis induced by MMTV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], urethane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and &#x003b3; radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Interestingly, however, most of the genetically modified mammary tumor models have been developed in a C57BL/6 or FVB background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], without any previous experimental evidence to indicate that these strains were suitable for the study of mammary tumorigenesis, in terms of susceptibility to the more standard hormonal/chemical approaches.</p><p>With this in mind, we decided to study further the resistance of the C57BL/6 strain to hormonal carcinogenesis, and to advance the characterization of possible underlying differences in hormone responsiveness. In this study we demonstrated that C57BL/6 mammary glands are resistant not only to MPA carcinogenesis but also to hormone-induced mammary gland development. The higher responsiveness of BALB/c mice was associated with higher levels of expression of ER-&#x003b1; and PR isoform A, suggesting that a high ER-&#x003b1; and PR-A profile may be related to breast cancer susceptibility. Finally, we were able to demonstrate that this specific strain difference disappeared when epithelial cells of either strain were transplanted into a different strain background, indicating that host factors, possibly stroma, may be responsible for the differential hormone responsiveness.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Two month-old virgin female BALB/c mice (Instituto de Biolog&#x000ed;a y Medicina Experimental, Buenos Aires, Argentina) and C57BL/6J mice (Instituto de Biolog&#x000ed;a y Medicina Experimental and Academia Nacional de Medicina, Buenos Aires, Argentina) were used for these experiments, and Swiss-<italic>Foxn1</italic><sup><italic>nu</italic></sup><italic>/Foxn1</italic><sup><italic>nu </italic></sup>(<italic>nu</italic>/<italic>nu</italic>) were purchased from La Plata Animal Facilities (Buenos Aires Province, Argentina). The animals were housed in groups of four per cage in an air-conditioned room at 20 &#x000b1; 2&#x000b0;C under a 12-hour light/dark cycle, and given free access to food and tap water. Animal care and manipulation were in agreement with institutional guidelines and with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Athymic nude mice were maintained under the same conditions in a germ-free environment.</p></sec><sec><title>Tumor incidence: long-term experiments</title><sec><title>Experiment 1</title><p>This experiment, conducted in C57BL/6 mice, was performed simultaneously with previously reported experiments in BALB/c mice, applying the same protocol originally used to induce mammary carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. A total of 38, 2-month-old mice, were subcutaneously implanted with 40 mg MPA depot (Medrosterona, Gador Laboratory, Buenos Aires, Argentina) every 2 months (four times) for 1 year; 31 control animals received only vehicle. The animals were evaluated twice weekly to detect the appearance of mammary tumors. This experiment was terminated after 1 year because of the emergence of severe skin ulcerations in MPA-treated C57BL/6 mice and in some of the control animals. It has been reported that aged C57BL/6 mice frequently develop spontaneous ulcerative dermatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Experiment 2</title><p>To minimize the possibility of development of skin lesions, the experiment was repeated with a lower MPA dosage, which also proved to be carcinogenic in BALB/c mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Silastic pellets containing 40 mg MPA (Sigma Co, St Louis, MO, ISA) were implanted subcutaneously in 39 virgin, 2-month-old, C57BL/6 female mice, and replaced 6 months later; an equal number of control animals were implanted with control blank silastic pellets. The mice were evaluated daily, and those that developed skin lesions were isolated to prevent further damage, but continued to be evaluated as part of the experiment. The animals were weighed every week and followed for 14 months. Vaginal smears were obtained from selected mice in control and MPA-treated groups to confirm hormone action. After 6 months, MPA-treated mice started to cycle again and MPA pellets were replaced. Every 2 months two mice from both groups were killed for histologic evaluation of mammary gland hormone responsiveness. At the end of the experiments both control and treated animals were killed and mammary glands fixed in formalin (right 4th gland), prepared for whole mounts (left 4th gland), or frozen for Western blot studies.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Short-term experiments</title><sec><title>Mammary gland and salivary gland morphologic studies</title><p>A total of 24 BALB/c and 24 C57BL/6 virgin females (2-month-old) were implanted subcutaneously with 20 mg MPA, progesterone (Sigma Co.), or control blank silastic pellets (four mice per group). After 4 or 8 weeks the animals were killed, and salivary glands and the 4th right mammary glands were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin. Left mammary glands were processed for whole mounts. This experiment was repeated twice. Control animals were killed at diestrus. The morphologic features and the number of ducts, lateral branches, and lobules of the mammary glands of virgin untreated and progestin-treated mice were evaluated in hematoxylin and eosin stained slides and quantified in 40&#x000d7; fields.</p></sec><sec><title>Whole mount studies</title><p>The mammary glands were excised together with the attached skin, stretched and pinned down to a cork slab, and fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 24 hours. After fixation, the glands were dissected and extensively washed with distilled water, and lipids were removed by immersing in acetone for 2 days, at room temperature. After hydration with decreasing concentrations of ethanol, the tissues were left overnight in water and stained with toluidine blue (0.025% in water) for 40 min followed by thorough washings with distilled water. The staining was adjusted by destaining, if necessary, with methanol for 30 min and 70% ethanol for other 30 min, under microscopic observation. After washing with distilled water the tissues were fixed in ammonium molybdate for 30 min, washed again, dehydrated in ethanol with increasing concentrations, and transferred to xylene overnight before mounting.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Paraffin-embedded sections were reacted with various antibodies using the avidin biotin peroxidase complex technique (Vectastain Elite ABC kit; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Briefly, after dewaxing and hydrating, endogenous peroxidase activity was inhibited using 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>in distilled water. Blocking solution (2% normal goat serum) was used before specific antibody.

The images were then aligned together using the PanaVue Image Assembler Software (PanaVue Co., Quebec City, Quebec, Canada). The resulting image was a high-quality panoramic picture of the lesion that allowed us to select the epithelial areas. Images were quantified using the Northern Eclipse Image Analysis Software (Empix Imaging, North Tonawanda, NY, USA) and expressed as the total epithelial area and the number of structures selected in each histologically defined area.

The incubation continued overnight at 37&#x000b0;C and was then centrifuged for 5 min and the cap removed. The reaction was heated to 95&#x000b0;C for 8 min to inactivate the proteinase K. Samples were purified by means of the DNeasy Tissue System kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA, USA) before PCR. We performed tests of the DNA samples by PCR amplifications with four informative microsatellite markers.</p></sec><sec><title>Microsatellite genotyping</title><p>Epithelial DNA was typed by PCR using a panel of four microsatellites (also known as simple sequence length polymorphisms) polymorphic between C57BL/6 and the outbred Swiss recipient nude females.

An aliquot of 100 ng genomic DNA (5 &#x003bc;l of 20 ng/&#x003bc;l) was amplified in a 25 &#x003bc;l PCR reaction containing 2.5 &#x003bc;l 10&#x000d7; PCR buffer (15 mmol/l MgCl<sub>2</sub>), 0.5 &#x003bc;l 10 mmol/l dNTP, 1 &#x003bc;l of each primer (final concentration 180 &#x003bc;mol/l), 0.1 &#x003bc;l 5 U/&#x003bc;l Taq polymerase, and 14.9 &#x003bc;l sterile water. Hot start PCR (in which crucial reaction components are withheld until reaction temperatures are reached) was performed by means of FastStart Taq polymerase (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Initial denaturation (94&#x000b0;C for 6 min), 35 cycles (45 s at 94&#x000b0;C, 45 s at 55&#x000b0;C, and 30 s at 72&#x000b0;C), and final incubation at 72&#x000b0;C for 7 min were carried out using a Perkin-Elmer Model 9600 DNA thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).

When untreated mammary glands from control virgin mice of both strains, without any treatment and in the same phase of the estrous cycle, were compared, BALB/c untreated mammary glands exhibited more ductal side branching than did C57BL/6 glands (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a,b</xref>, left panels), and only BALB/c mice exhibited a significant increase in MPA-induced ductal branching in mammary glands (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a,b</xref>, middle panels; <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001).

Quantification of these morphologic differences is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>.

Extracts were normalized by protein content. Because mammary glands from virgin mice have less epithelial cells than progestin-treated mice, and on the other hand both stroma and epithelium may express steroid receptors, which may be differentially regulated, we only quantified the ratio between both isoforms in the same blot (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). The PR-A/PR-B ratio was significantly higher in virgin as compared with progestin treated mice of both strains, supporting the immunohistochemical data.

To explore the possibility of pituitary dysfunction as an explanation for the strain differences in hormone responsiveness, we evaluated serum levels of prolactin in control and progestin-treated mice, but we failed to observe any difference between C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice. In addition, prolactin levels were increased in progestin-treated animals of both strains (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001, two-way ANOVA; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref>). Similarly, no differences in progesterone, growth hormone, or IGF-I levels between strains were observed.

Because nude mice lack functional ovaries and consequently have very low E<sub>2 </sub>levels, this hormone had to be supplemented (20 &#x003bc;g) to the MPA or progesterone standard pellets. Therefore, we first evaluated whether the differences between strains were also observed when E<sub>2 </sub>or combined E<sub>2 </sub>and progesterone pellets were used. The differences were significant, even with E<sub>2 </sub>alone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). E<sub>2 </sub>induced duct dilation whereas the combined treatment induced a high proliferative response, with increased branching and lobule-alveolar differentiation. Surprisingly, however, C57BL/6 cells were able to repopulate the cleared fat pads of MPA/E<sub>2</sub>-treated or progesterone/E<sub>2</sub>-treated Swiss <italic>nu</italic>/<italic>nu </italic>mice as efficiently as BALB/c cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). In contrast, BALB/c cells fared better in repopulating BALB/c cleared fat pads than did C57BL/6 cells in C57BL/6 cleared fat pads.</p><p>To confirm that the transplanted cells were those giving rise to the mammary glands and not some pre-existing epithelial cells from the recipient Swiss <italic>nu</italic>/<italic>nu </italic>female, ducts and lobules were excised by laser capture microdissection and genotyped by PCR using four informative microsatellite markers (D7Mit69, D7Mit82, D10Mit233, and D13Mit7). These markers were selected to be polymorphic between C57BL/6 and the recipient <italic>nude </italic>females. The PCR analysis clearly showed that the transplanted epithelial cells excised by laser capture microdissection were C57BL/6 in origin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>).

Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> shows ducts that originated from C57BL/6 or BALB/c cells transplanted in the same <italic>nu</italic>/<italic>nu </italic>mouse; no significant differences in ER-&#x003b1; or PR-A expression were observed. These results indicate that host factors are responsible for the strain differences observed in mammary gland hormone receptor expression and that the level of these receptors is related to the degree of hormone responsiveness.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The C57BL/6 strain is reputed to be relatively resistant to some chemical carcinogenesis protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and relatively susceptible to spontaneous and chemically induced melanomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], radiation-induced leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], and chemically induced urinary bladder carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Regarding mammary tumorigenesis, the C57BL/6 strain is considered to be resistant to MMTV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], urethane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], and &#x003b3; radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>In this study we demonstrated that C57BL/6 female mice were resistant to MPA-induced carcinogenesis, and that this resistance was associated with poor mammary gland responsiveness to the exogenous administration of progestins and/or estrogens. We also observed significantly different levels of ER-&#x003b1; and PR-A in the sensitive and resistant strains, that may be associated with the poor responsiveness described. Surprisingly, C57BL/6 mammary epithelial cells may be as responsive as BALB/c cells and exhibit similar levels of hormone receptors when transplanted into cleared fat pads of a different strain, indicating that host factors rather than the epithelial cells by themselves are responsible for their hormone resistance.</p><p>A hypoplastic phenotype of C57BL/6 mammary glands was reported by Nandi and Bern in 1960 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. In most of their experiments, hormonal treatment was provided by the kidney subcapsular implantation of the pituitary gland, or by the administration of estrogens or combinations of estrogens plus progesterone; the effects of progestins alone, however, have been evaluated in very few studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Our findings demonstrate a differential effect of progestins in BALB/c and C57BL/6 female mice and confirm the observations by Nandi and Bern regarding differences in mammary glands of virgin mice. MPA induced ductal branching whereas progesterone induced lobular differentiation in BALB/c and not in C57BL/6 mice. These observations correlate with the fact that MPA induced mainly ductal carcinomas whereas progesterone generated mainly lobular carcinomas in BALB/c mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. These tumors are different not only in histology but also in ER, PR, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Recent studies indicate that progesterone and MPA trigger different transduction signals in the human breast cancer cell line T47D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] and in human umbilical vein endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Different <italic>in vivo </italic>effects were also reported in previous studies, in which it was observed that MPA induced the synthesis of EGF in salivary glands as an androgen receptor ligand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. This effect was not achieved by progesterone. As we have demonstrated in previous studies, salivary gland EGF does participate in MPA-induced mammary gland carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Because C57BL/6 mammary glands responded poorly to both MPA and progesterone, it seemed unlikely that the differences in the two strains were related to differences in salivary gland responsiveness. This was supported by the fact that no histologic differences with respect to MPA-induced development of convoluted granular ducts of the salivary glands, the source of EGF, were found across strains. MPA has been used as an anabolic agent in oncology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] and, as we have shown in previous studies, it exerts an anabolic effect in BALB/c female mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In the present study we demonstrated a similar effect in C57BL/6 mice, showing that this is a strain-independent mechanism.</p><p>We have also explored the possibility of impaired pituitary function, which plays a very important role in determining the hypoplastic mammary gland phenotype in ER knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], and is associated with low prolactin levels. However, in our study, prolactin levels were similar in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice and in progestin-treated animals of both strains. The same was true for progesterone, growth hormone, and IGF-I serum levels.</p><p>Taken together, all of the described results appeared to point to strain differences intrinsic to the mammary gland. To explore this possibility, we sought to determine the presence and functionality of mammary steroid receptors in both strains. To evaluate PR A, we used C-19 and C-20 antibodies (Santa Cruz) that recognize this isoform in human tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>] and mouse tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. We observed significantly lower levels of ER-&#x003b1; and PR-A in virgin C57BL/6 adult female mice, as compared with BALB/c. The only PR isoform that we found to be highly expressed in BALB/c virgin mice was PR-A, as was previously described by Auperlee and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. PR-A and ER-&#x003b1; were significantly downregulated in both BALB/c MPA-treated and progesterone-treated mice, and it is interesting to note that ER-&#x003b1; expression usually paralleled that of PR-A. ER-&#x003b2; and PR-B exhibited similar kinetics; their expression was low in control mice and it increased in progestin-treated BALB/c mice. Aupperlee and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] reported similar results in their studies of PR-B expression in pregnant BALB/c mice.</p><p>These results, when extrapolated to humans, suggest that individual levels of ER-&#x003b1; and PR-A in the mammary glands could predict hormone responsiveness and cancer risk. It has been reported that low levels of ER-&#x003b1; expression are observed in women of low risk groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. As proof of principle, Frech and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>] developed transgenic mice that overexpress ER-&#x003b1; in a C57BL/6 background, in which the number of ER-&#x003b1; positive cells in transfected glands was similar to that in the virgin BALB/c mice we report on here. Curiously, ductal hyperplasias were reported in the transgenic mice even in the absence of estrogens. As a consequence of ER-&#x003b1; overexpression, increased PR levels were also observed.</p><p>The expression of ER and PR is regulated by endocrine factors and by extracellular matrix components such as collagen IV or laminin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. To explore a role for the stroma in the strain difference in hormone responsiveness, we used transplanted epithelial cells into the cleared fat pad of Swiss nude mice. The fact that both C57BL/6 and BALB/c epithelial cells responded very similarly in a different strain background suggests that the mammary gland fat pad from the host may be regulating the epithelial hormone responsiveness. At this moment we cannot, however, rule out the participation in the process of other host factors related to the microenvironment, which may be also be playing an active role. Experiments are currently underway in our laboratory to test this alternative hypothesis. Similar data were reported by Naylor and Ormandy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Those investigators recombined epithelial cells from 129 strain, which is similar to BALB/c, with C57BL/6 stroma, and observed a poorly side-branched C57BL/6 pattern. A major challenge will be to identify the stromal factors responsible for maintaining high ER and PR-A levels in BALB/c mice.</p><p>Different studies have been designed to explain BALB/c susceptibility to mammary carcinogenesis. The frequency of mammary tumors differs among strains of <italic>Trp53</italic><sup>+/- </sup>mice, with mammary tumors occurring only on a BALB/c genetic background and showing a high frequency of loss of heterozygosity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. Interestingly, progesterone is necessary and favors aneuploidy in this model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. In the irradiation model, the increased genomic instability of BALB/c mice has been ascribed to two polymorphisms in the coding region of <italic>Prkdc </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]; this is the gene that encodes the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit, which is known to be involved in DNA double-stranded break repair. Because it has been shown that the stroma may be a target in radiation-induced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>] and in chemical-induced carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>], other players important in parenchymal-stromal interactions related with hormone receptor expression may be involved in all models.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study we demonstrated impaired hormone responsiveness in C57BL/6 mammary epithelial cells that is reflected in responses to both physiologic and neoplastic stimuli, making the strain resistant to hormonal carcinogenesis. This was associated with low levels of ER-&#x003b1; and PR-A. Further exploring the phenomenon, we demonstrated that this is not due to intrinsic impairments in the epithelial cells and that host factors, probably related to the mammary microenvironment, may account for the defective hormonal behavior. The comparative study of C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice may help us to understand the genetic basis of resistance and susceptibility to hormone-induced mammary carcinogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ANOVA = analysis of variance; E<sub>2 </sub>= 17&#x003b2;-estradiol; EGF = epidermal grwoth factor; ER = estrogen receptor; IGF = insulin-like growth factor; MPA = medroxyprogesterone acetate; MMTV = murine mammary tumor virus; NIDDK = National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases; PBST = phosphate-buffered saline-Tween; PCR = polymerase chain reaction; PR = progesterone receptor;</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>GMG and SV carried out all the immunohistochemical and morphologic studies.
