Consequently, phage-encoded ssDNA-binding proteins (SSBs) are essential proteins during phage &#x003c6;29-like DNA replication. In the present work we analyze the helix-destabilizing activity of the SSBs of &#x003c6;29 and the related phages Nf and GA-1, their ability to eliminate non-productive binding of &#x003c6;29 DNA polymerase to ssDNA and their stimulatory effect on replication by &#x003c6;29 DNA polymerase in primed M13 ssDNA replication, a situation that resembles type II replicative intermediates that occur during &#x003c6;29-like DNA replication. Significant differences have been appreciated in the functional behavior of the three SSBs. First, the GA-1 SSB is able to display helix-destabilizing activity and to stimulate dNTP incorporation by &#x003c6;29 DNA polymerase in the M13 DNA replication assay, even at SSB concentrations at which the &#x003c6;29 and Nf SSBs do not show any effect. On the other hand, the &#x003c6;29 SSB is the only one of the three SSBs able to increase the replication rate of &#x003c6;29 DNA polymerase in primed M13 ssDNA replication. From the fact that the &#x003c6;29 SSB, but not the Nf SSB, stimulates the replication rate of Nf DNA polymerase we conclude that the different behaviors of the SSBs on stimulation of the replication rate of &#x003c6;29 and Nf DNA polymerases is most likely due to formation of different nucleoprotein complexes of the SSBs with the ssDNA rather than to a specific interaction between the SSB and the corresponding DNA polymerase. A model that correlates the thermodynamic parameters that define SSB&#x02013;ssDNA nucleoprotein complex formation with the functional stimulatory effect of the SSB on &#x003c6;29-like DNA replication has been proposed.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes id="N0x8c1b3b0.0x9973518" notes-type="data_link"><p>DDBJ&#x0002f;EMBL&#x0002f;GenBank accession nos AJ244025, AJ244026</p></notes></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Non-specific DNA&#x02013;protein interactions are involved in many fundamental processes <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c1">1</xref>). Single-stranded DNA-binding proteins (SSBs) destabilize double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and bind without sequence specificity, but selectively and cooperatively, to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) conferring a regular structure to it, which is recognized and exploited by a variety of enzymes involved in DNA replication, repair and recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c2">2</xref>). Several cases have been reported of SSBs that stimulate their cognate DNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c12">12</xref>). This modulation may be explained by the ability of the SSB to bind to ssDNA, melting out double-stranded regions by contiguous cooperative binding, but also by direct protein&#x02013;protein interactions with proteins of the same replication system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c17">17</xref>).</p><p>The bacteriophage &#x003c6;29 genome consists of a linear dsDNA, 19 285 bp long, with a terminal protein (TP) covalently linked to each 5&#x02032;-end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c19">19</xref>). Replication of the viral genome starts at either DNA end non-simultaneously by a protein priming mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c19">19</xref>) and, after sliding back (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c20">20</xref>) and a transition step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c21">21</xref>), proceeds by strand displacement towards the other end. Two kinds of replicative intermediates (RI) have been observed during &#x003c6;29 DNA replication by electron microscopy both <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c22">22</xref>) and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c23">23</xref>). As &#x003c6;29 DNA polymerase elongates the initiation product from both DNA ends, the non-template strand is displaced by the DNA polymerase as ssDNA, giving rise to type I RI. When two growing chains, running from opposite ends, collide and separate, two type II RI are generated, where strand displacement is no longer required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c19">19</xref>).</p><p>&#x003c6;29 protein p5 is the SSB protein active during &#x003c6;29 DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c25">25</xref>). It protects ssDNA against nuclease degradation and greatly stimulates dNTP incorporation during &#x003c6;29 DNA replication <italic>in vitro</italic> at incubation times where replication in its absence levels off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c24">24</xref>). The &#x003c6;29 SSB does not affect either initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c24">24</xref>) or the transition stage between TP-primed initiation and normal DNA elongation (I.Gasc&#x000f3;n, unpublished results) during &#x003c6;29 DNA replication but it has been described as having helix-destabilizing activity. It has been proposed that cooperative binding of the &#x003c6;29 SSB to the displaced ssDNA could reduce the energy demand required for the unwinding process coupled to DNA polymerization and this could account for a stimulatory effect on type I RI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c26">26</xref>).</p><p>&#x003c6;29-related phage contain linear dsDNA and TP and genome replication proceeds as in &#x003c6;29 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c19">19</xref>). The &#x003c6;29-like genus of the family Podoviridae has been classified into three evolutionary branches, both by early (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c27">27</xref>) and recent studies based on comparisons of nucleotide and amino acid sequences of selected DNA regions and proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c28">28</xref>). Thus, one branch consists of phages BS32, &#x003c6;15, &#x003c6;29 and PZA; the second branch is composed of phage B103, M2 and Nf; the third branch has phage GA-1 as its sole member (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c28">28</xref>).</p><p>In the present work, the SSBs of phage &#x003c6;29, Nf and GA-1, which constitute a representative example of each of the three branches, have been purified and functionally characterized. The helix-destabilizing activity and the ability of the three SSBs to eliminate non-productive binding of &#x003c6;29 DNA polymerase to ssDNA have been analyzed. Furthermore, the stimulatory effect of the three SSBs on &#x003c6;29 DNA polymerase in primed M13 ssDNA replication, a situation that resembles type II RI that occur during viral DNA replication, has also been studied. Significant differences have been appreciated in their functional behavior. We propose the existence of a correlation between the thermodynamic parameters that define each SSB&#x02013;ssDNA nucleoprotein complex and the differential stimulatory effect of the SSBs in the two types of RI generated during viral DNA replication of this family of phages.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Nucleotides and DNA</title><p>Oligonucleotides for sequencing were obtained from Boehringer Ingelheim. &#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;dATP (3000 Ci&#x0002f;mmol) and &#x0005b;&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;ATP (3000 Ci&#x0002f;mmol) were obtained from Amersham International plc.

This substrate was incubated with increasing amounts of either SSB or the corresponding buffer, as indicated in Materials and Methods, and the reaction products analyzed by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In agreement with previous results, the &#x003c6;29 SSB was able to displace the labeled oligonucleotide from M13 ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c26">26</xref>; see also Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd328f2">2</xref>). The Nf and GA-1 SSBs were also able to efficiently displace the labeled oligonucleotide from M13 ssDNA in a protein concentration-dependent fashion, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd328f2">2</xref>. However, a smaller amount of the GA-1 SSB than of the &#x003c6;29 and Nf SSBs was required to obtain a similar unwinding extent (10 versus 40&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M).

SSB binding to ssDNA could avoid or even eliminate non-productive binding of the viral DNA polymerase to ssDNA, directing it to the replication origins and thus increasing effective re-usage of the DNA template. To test this possibility, we analyzed the ability of the &#x003c6;29, Nf and GA-1 SSBs to eliminate non-productive binding of &#x003c6;29 DNA polymerase to ssDNA. Thus, we incubated &#x003c6;29 DNA polymerase with a 5&#x02032;-labeled oligonucleotide that can be degraded by the 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; exonucleolytic activity of &#x003c6;29 DNA polymerase. When the enzyme was preincubated with M13 ssDNA, all DNA polymerases were trapped and no exonucleolytic degradation of the oligonucleotide could be detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd328f3">3</xref>). Increasing amounts of each SSB or the corresponding buffer were added to the preincubation mixture containing &#x003c6;29 DNA polymerase bound to M13 ssDNA and then the oligonucleotide was added, as indicated in Materials and Methods. As can be observed in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd328f3">3</xref>, addition of increasing amounts of &#x003c6;29 SSB to the preincubation mixture enabled &#x003c6;29 DNA polymerase to degrade the oligonucleotide up to the initial levels. This degradation was not due to any nuclease activity present in the &#x003c6;29 SSB preparation. When increasing amounts of the Nf and GA-1 SSBs were added, there was also an increase in oligonucleotide degradation, although degradation levels were lower than those obtained in the absence of M13 ssDNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd328f3">3</xref>). Addition of higher amounts of the Nf or GA-1 SSBs to the preincubation mixture exceeding those required to saturate all the ssDNA present resulted in the same oligonucleotide degradation level (not shown). Addition of a protein that does not bind ssDNA, like BSA, instead of the SSBs, did not produce an increase in degradation of the oligonucleotide (data not shown). Therefore, it can be concluded that the oligonucleotide degradation increase upon SSB addition is due to its ability to bind ssDNA, releasing the titration of &#x003c6;29 DNA polymerase by the ssDNA. In any case, some specificity between the DNA polymerase and its own SSB cannot be ruled out at present, as indicated by the different oligonucleotide degradation levels by &#x003c6;29 DNA polymerase upon addition of the &#x003c6;29 or Nf and GA-1 SSBs.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of the &#x003c6;29, Nf and GA-1 SSBs on primed M13 ssDNA replication by &#x003c6;29 DNA polymerase</title><p>To determine the effect of the three SSBs on &#x003c6;29 DNA polymerase in a type II RI replication-like situation in which strand displacement is not required, we carried out a replication assay with primed M13 ssDNA as template. After incubation with increasing amounts of each SSB, &#x003c6;29 DNA polymerase was added to the preincubation mixture and reactions proceeded as indicated in Materials and Methods. In all three cases, the stimulation of dNTP incorporation by &#x003c6;29 DNA polymerase as well as the increase in its replication rate were measured. Stimulation of dNTP incorporation was determined by counting the C&#x000e8;renkov radiation of the newly synthesized DNA, while the replication rate was calculated from the length of the DNA synthesized at different reaction times, estimated after densitometric scanning of alkaline agarose gels in the presence of size markers. The intensity of the radioactive bands was not relevant in the replication rate calculations.</p><p>The functional behavior displayed by the three SSBs in this replication assay was very different, as can be observed in the corresponding agarose gels (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd328f4">4</xref>A, B and C for the &#x003c6;29, Nf and GA-1 SSBs, respectively). Graphs that represent the length of the synthesized DNA versus time at different SSB concentrations, together with tables of the corresponding replication rates are also shown (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd328f5">5</xref>A, B and C for the &#x003c6;29, Nf and GA-1 SSBs, respectively). On the one hand, it has to be highlighted that the GA-1 SSB was able to stimulate dNTP incorporation by &#x003c6;29 DNA polymerase even at the lowest SSB concentration assayed (3.25 &#x000b5;M), conditions under which the other two SSBs were unable to produce any stimulation of dNTP incorporation by the DNA polymerase (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd328f4">4</xref>). On the other hand, as can be observed in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd328f4">4</xref>A, the &#x003c6;29 SSB was able to increase the replication rate of &#x003c6;29 DNA polymerase, even at concentrations of SSB that produced hardly any stimulation of dNTP incorporation (3.5 and 7 &#x000b5;M; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd328f5">5</xref>A). Addition of a concentration of SSB enough to cover all the ssDNA (28 &#x000b5;M) produced a 20-fold increase in dNTP incorporation and a 2-fold increase in the replication rate, calculated under conditions in which no strand displacement occurs. The increase in dNTP incorporation that is not due to stimulation of the replication rate is probably due to prevention of non-productive binding of &#x003c6;29 DNA polymerase to ssDNA (see the ssDNA degradation experiment above). Neither the Nf nor GA-1 SSB was able to stimulate the replication rate of &#x003c6;29 DNA polymerase, even at the highest concentrations assayed (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd328f4">4</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd328f5">5</xref>B for the Nf SSB, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd328f4">4</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd328f5">5</xref>C for the GA-1 SSB), enough to produce a 10-fold increase in dNTP incorporation due to the increase in the number of &#x003c6;29 DNA polymerase molecules.</p><p>The specific stimulation of the replication rate of &#x003c6;29 DNA polymerase by its own SSB could be due either to a specific stimulatory interaction between the two proteins or else to differences in the nucleoprotein complex formed by each SSB with ssDNA.</p></sec><sec><title>The &#x003c6;29 SSB but not Nf SSB stimulates the replication rate of Nf DNA polymerase</title><p>As already shown, the &#x003c6;29 SSB is the only SSB that stimulates the replication rate of &#x003c6;29 DNA polymerase in primed M13 ssDNA replication. To determine if there is specific stimulation of the replication rate of the DNA polymerase by its cognate SSB, we studied the effect of the &#x003c6;29 and Nf SSBs on the replication rate of Nf DNA polymerase. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd328f6">6</xref> shows the effect of the &#x003c6;29 and Nf SSBs on the replication rate of &#x003c6;29 and Nf DNA polymerases in primed M13 ssDNA replication. Graphs of the length of the synthesized DNA versus time and tables with the corresponding replication rates are also displayed. In the absence of the SSB, the replication rate of both DNA polymerases was 1400 nt&#x0002f;min. The replication rates of &#x003c6;29 DNA polymerase in the presence of the Nf and &#x003c6;29 SSBs were 1500 and 2700 nt&#x0002f;min, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd328f6">6</xref>A). The replication rates of Nf DNA polymerase in the presence of the Nf and &#x003c6;29 SSBs were 1500 and 2400 nt&#x0002f;min, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd328f6">6</xref>B). These results indicate that there is not specific stimulation of the replication rate of the viral DNA polymerase by its own SSB. In contrast, the differential stimulatory effect of each SSB on the replication rate of the DNA polymerases could be modulated by the thermodynamic parameters that define the nucleoprotein complex formed by each SSB with the ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c43">43</xref>), as discussed below.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Since the first SSB was isolated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c44">44</xref>), there has been great interest in elucidating the mechanism of action of these proteins. SSBs constitute essential components of the DNA replication machinery of &#x003c6;29-related phages, as viral DNA replication takes place with the generation of large amounts of ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c19">19</xref>). The genome of &#x003c6;29-related phages consists of a linear dsDNA with a TP covalently linked to each 5&#x02032;-end and replicates via a protein-primed initiation step catalyzed by the viral DNA polymerase, followed by elongation of the initiation product. As the DNA polymerase elongates the initiation product from both DNA ends, the non-template strand is displaced by the DNA polymerase as ssDNA, giving rise to type I RI (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd328f7">7</xref>). When two growing chains, running from opposite ends, collide and separate, two type II RI are generated. The viral SSB forms a nucleoprotein complex with the displaced DNA strand in the type I RI, which has to dissociate ahead of the DNA polymerase in the type II RI (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd328f7">7</xref>). The thermodynamic parameters that define this nucleoprotein complex are: <italic>K</italic>, the intrinsic binding constant, which represents the affinity of a single protein monomer for an isolated binding site on the nucleic acid lattice; &#x003c9;, the cooperativity parameter, which specifies the relative affinity of an incoming ligand for a contiguous as opposed to an isolated binding site; <italic>K</italic><sub>eff</sub>, the effective binding constant, which is the product of <italic>K</italic> and &#x003c9;; <italic>n</italic>, the nucleotide binding site size, which is the number of nucleotides covered by a protein monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c46">46</xref>).</p><p>The &#x003c6;29 SSB does not display any stimulatory effect in the early replication steps, but greatly stimulates &#x003c6;29 DNA replication at incubation times where replication in its absence levels off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c24">24</xref>). To further elucidate the SSB mechanism of action in the &#x003c6;29-like replication system, a comparative functional characterization of the SSBs of &#x003c6;29 and of the related phages Nf and GA-1 has been carried out. Functional characterization of the three SSBs has focused on their stimulatory effect in primed M13 ssDNA replication, a situation that resembles type II RI that occur during &#x003c6;29-like DNA replication, as well as on their helix-destabilizing activity and ability to eliminate non-productive binding of DNA polymerase to ssDNA. In the present study, we provide evidence that binding of the SSB to ssDNA not only prevents non-productive binding of the viral DNA polymerase to ssDNA, as demonstrated by the increase in dNTP incorporation in primed M13 ssDNA replication assays, but can also release DNA polymerase molecules that are already titrated by the ssDNA, as shown in the oligonucleotide degradation assay. This effect would be of particular importance in &#x003c6;29-like DNA replication systems, where large amounts of ssDNA are generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c18">18</xref>) and SSB binding to ssDNA could favor efficient re-usage of templates.</p><p>Additionally, significant differences in the functional behavior of the three SSBs have been appreciated. First, the GA-1 SSB is able to display helix-destabilizing activity as well as to stimulate dNTP incorporation by &#x003c6;29 DNA polymerase in the M13 DNA replication assay, even at SSB concentrations at which the &#x003c6;29 and Nf SSBs do not show these effects (3.25&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M). This correlates with the different behaviors of the three SSBs in gel retardation assays and fluorescence measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c43">43</xref>): a smaller concentration of the GA-1 SSB than of the other two SSBs is required to saturate a similar amount of ssDNA, due to the higher global affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>eff</sub>) for ssDNA and larger binding site size (<italic>n</italic>) of the former.</p><p>Another significant difference in the functional behavior of the three SSBs is that the &#x003c6;29 SSB, but not the Nf or GA-1 SSB, increases the replication rate of &#x003c6;29 DNA polymerase in primed M13 DNA replication, even at very low protein concentrations that produce hardly any stimulation of dNTP incorporation (3.5&#x02013;7 &#x000b5;M). The stimulation of the replication rate of the DNA polymerase at protein concentrations not high enough to stimulate dNTP incorporation could be due to the formation of patches of &#x003c6;29 SSB that straighten the ssDNA in front of the DNA polymerase, favoring its advance. At &#x003c6;29 SSB concentrations high enough to saturate the ssDNA present in the assay (28 &#x000b5;M) the increase in dNTP incorporation by the DNA polymerase is due both to the increase in the replication rate as well as to the prevention of non-productive binding of DNA polymerase molecules to the ssDNA. Several SSBs have been reported to stimulate their cognate DNA polymerases during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c17">17</xref>). In systems where a direct interaction between the SSB and the DNA polymerase has not been detected, the stimulatory effect has been proposed to be due to the ability of the SSB to melt hairpin structures that block progression of the DNA polymerase. However, the Nf and GA-1 SSBs, which also bind ssDNA and melt secondary structures, as demonstrated by their helix-destabilizing ability, do not stimulate the replication rate of &#x003c6;29 DNA polymerase. Furthermore, stimulation of the replication rate of Nf DNA polymerase by &#x003c6;29 SSB but not by its own SSB rules out the hypothesis of a specific interaction between the DNA polymerase and its own SSB and strengthens the importance of the kind of nucleoprotein complex formed by each SSB with ssDNA. Based on our results, we raise the hypothesis that the highly dynamic dissociation of the &#x003c6;29 SSB&#x02013;ssDNA nucleoprotein complex ahead of the DNA polymerase could be responsible for specific stimulation of the replication rate of the DNA polymerase by the &#x003c6;29 SSB in type II RI-like DNA replication (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd328f7">7</xref>). In fact, the &#x003c6;29 SSB displays a lower <italic>K</italic> than the Nf and GA-1 SSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c43">43</xref>).</p><p>This functional comparative study of three related SSBs that participate in the same replication process has allowed us to suggest the existence of a correlation between the binding parameters that define the SSB&#x02013;ssDNA nucleoprotein complex and the different steps of viral DNA replication. Thus, cooperative binding of the SSB to the displaced ssDNA in type I RI would likely be governed by the global affinity of the protein for ssDNA (<italic>K</italic><sub>eff</sub>), while a low intrinsic binding constant (<italic>K</italic>) of the SSB&#x02013;ssDNA nucleoprotein complex ahead of the DNA polymerase would probably favor its advance in type II RI (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd328f7">7</xref>). Therefore, nucleoprotein complex formation with type I RI would be more easily accomplished by the GA-1 SSB due to its higher <italic>K</italic><sub>eff</sub> and <italic>n</italic>, while SSB&#x02013;ssDNA complex dissociation by the advancing DNA polymerase in type II RI would be more favorable in the case of the &#x003c6;29 SSB due to its lower <italic>K</italic>. In fact, the three SSBs display very different stimulatory effects on &#x003c6;29 TP&#x02013;DNA amplification <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c43">43</xref>). Thus, at a protein concentration of 3 &#x000b5;M, the GA-1 SSB stimulates dNTP incorporation by &#x003c6;29 DNA polymerase 12-fold, while the &#x003c6;29 and Nf SSBs produce 1.8- and 1.1-fold stimulation of dNTP incorporation, respectively. Furthermore, stimulation of dNTP incorporation under the test conditions reached a plateau at a protein concentration of 6 &#x000b5;M (25-fold stimulation) in the case of the GA-1 SSB and 14 &#x000b5;M in the case of the &#x003c6;29 SSB (15- to 20-fold stimulation), while at 15 &#x000b5;M Nf SSB concentration only a 7.2-fold stimulation was obtained.</p><p>Amino acid sequence comparisons of different SSBs show little detectable similarity. However, resolution of the crystal structures of very different SSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c53">53</xref>) suggests that these proteins have striking similarities at the structural level, with their DNA-binding domain composed of an OB (oligonucleotide&#x0002f;oligosaccharide binding) fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd328c54">54</xref>). Our work shows that the &#x003c6;29, Nf and GA-1 SSBs share a high degree of amino acid sequence similarity, but in spite of this, they have differential stimulatory effects in the same replication system. This is probably due to the different structural complexes they form with ssDNA and supports the idea that it is both the protein structure and the thermodynamic parameters that define the ssDNA&#x02013;SSB nucleoprotein complex, rather than amino acid sequence similarities, that have to be taken into account to understand the function of an SSB.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd328f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Sequence alignment of the &#x003c6;29, Nf and GA-1 SSBs.
