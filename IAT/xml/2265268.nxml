Neddylation is shown to facilitate E3 complex assembly; while un-neddylated cullins are bound by CAND1 that prevents recruitment of the substrates.

We show that SAP130 can interact with a variety of cullin proteins. It forms tertiary complexes with fully assembled CRL E3 complexes such as SCF<sup>Skp2</sup>, Elongin B/C -Cul2- VHL and Cul4-DDB complex by binding to both N-terminal and C-terminal domain of cullins.

The association of SAP130 with various cullin member proteins such as Cul1, Cul2 and Cul4A is modulated by CAND1 and CSN. As an established component of transcription and RNA processing complexes, we hypothesis that SAP130 may link CRL mediated ubiquitination to gene expression.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL) family of E3 enzymes participates in diverse cellular and physiological processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Each CRL complex contains a cullin family member that serves as a scaffold to assemble a functional E3 complex. The C-terminal globular domain of cullin interacts with the small RING protein Rbx1 (Roc1 or Hrt1) forming the catalytic core, while the substrate-recognizing module assembles at the N-terminal cullin repeats domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In SCF (Skp1-Cullin1-F-box protein) complexes, the substrate-recognizing module consisting of Skp1 and an F-box protein such as Skp2 interacts specifically with Cul1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Similarly, Elongin B/C-VHL complex interacts with Cul2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], the BTB domain substrate adaptor binds to Cul3, while DDB1 serves as a Cul4 adaptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. DDB1 belongs to a family of proteins with significant sequence homology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] that includes SAP130/SF3b-3, a component of transcription and RNA splicing complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and CPSF160, cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The latter two proteins have not been reported to have functions involving the ubiquitin system.</p><p>Human cells express seven different cullins, most of which if not all can be modified by an ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8 (or Rub1) on a conserved lysine residue near the C-terminus of the cullin subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Nedd8 conjugation to cullins (neddylation) is catalyzed by Nedd8-specific E1 and E2 enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], while its removal (de-neddylation) is mediated by COP9 signalosome (CSN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The de-neddylated (or un-neddylated) cullins are specifically bound by CAND1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Neddylation is shown to facilitate polyubiquitination by CRLs, while de-neddylation is necessary to maintain the stability of CRL components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. It was recently shown that Skp1-Skp2 complex triggers dissociation of CAND1 from Cul1 and, when charged with substrate p27, induces Cul1 neddylation by inhibiting CSN mediated de-neddylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This study shows that the substrate-binding module with the charged substrate can drive cullin neddylation.</p><p>CSN is a functionally pleiotropic complex composed of eight subunits designated CSN1 to CSN8, each having unique roles and specific functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In addition to the de-neddylase activity that involves CSN2 and CSN5/JAB1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], CSN also interacts and recruits de-ubiquitin enzymes and protein kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Deletions of CSN cause drastic alterations in the gene expression profile and early lethality of multi-cellular model organisms such as <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, Drosophila, and mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>We have shown previously that CSN1 central and C-terminal regions are necessary for CSN complex integrity in both plant and animal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The N-terminal domain (NTD) of CSN1 is not involved in complex assembly but carries an activity that inhibits AP-1 dependent transcription in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, deletion of CSN1-NTD causes early lethality despite that the mutant (<italic>fus6/C231</italic>) can assemble a CSN complex (CSN<sup>S1-C231</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. To understand the functions associated with CSN1-NTD, we initiated a search for proteins interacting with this domain. We report here identification of SAP130/SF3b3, a member of DDB1 family proteins and an established component of transcription complex and RNA processing complex. Our data show that SAP130 is a general cullin binding protein that normally associates with neddylated form of endogenous cullins <italic>in vivo</italic>. The preference of SAP130 for neddylated cullins is dependent on CAND1, a protein that specifically binds un-neddylated cullins. SAP130 predominantly binds C-terminal domain of cullin and forms tertiary complex with fully assembled CRLs.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>SAP130/SF3b3 is a CSN1-NTD binding protein</title><p>To isolate CSN1-NTD interacting proteins, we took a biochemical approach previously described by Lyapina <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].

SAP130 is a component of SF3b complex, which is an integral part of 17S U2 snRNP particle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. SAP130, but not other SF3b subunits, is also a stoichiometric component of GCN5-containing transcription complexes such as STAGA and TFTC complexes [TATA binding protein (TBP)-free TAF<sub>II </sub>complexes] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Ddx15 (hPrp43 or mDEAH9) and CF Im68 are involved in RNA processing, while ERp44 plays a key role in thiol-mediated retention in ER.</p><p>We are particularly interested in SAP130 because it is highly homologous to DDB1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], a known component of Cul4-based ubiquitin ligase complex that is tightly regulated by the CSN complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. To verify interaction of SAP130 with CSN1, SAP130-myc was transiently expressed with representative CSN subunits in HeLa cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Flag-CSN1, CSN1N (1&#x02013;196 aa) and Flag-CSN5, but not Flag-CSN2, readily co-precipitated SAP130-myc. Immunoprecipitation of endogenous CSN1 from nuclear extract weakly but consistently pulled down endogenous SAP130 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). In addition, recombinant GST-CSN1, but not GST itself, could pull down <italic>in vitro </italic>translated SAP130 from the lysate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). Similarly, another member of DDB1 family, CPSF160 can also co-immunoprecipitate CSN subunits when transiently expressed in cultured cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>). Therefore, all three members of the DDB1 family in humans can interact with CSN.</p></sec><sec><title>Preferential association of SAP130 with neddylated cullins is dependent on CAND1</title><p>Given that DDB1 functions as a component of Cul4A ubiquitin ligase complex, we investigated possible interaction of SAP130 with cullins. Transiently expressed SAP130 co-immunoprecipitated endogenous Cul1, Cul2, Cul4 and SAP155, a known component of SF3b complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). We noticed that SAP130 appeared to pull-down only the slower migrating cullin band that normally corresponds to neddylated form of cullins. To definitively verify this, SAP130 was <italic>in vitro </italic>translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) supplemented with recombinant GST-Nedd8, GST-ubiquitin or GST proteins. In this system, GST-Nedd8 can be conjugated to endogenous Cul2 in the lysate generating Cul2<sup>GST-Nedd8 </sup>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, lanes 1 and 5). Both anti-Cul2 and anti-GST blots showed that SAP130 specifically co-immunoprecipitated Cul2<sup>GST-Nedd8 </sup>and Cul2<sup>Nedd8</sup>, but not un-neddylated Cul2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, lanes 4 and 5). This result explicitly demonstrates that SAP130 preferentially associates with neddylated Cul2 in the lysate. Taken together the data in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, SAP130 most likely interacts with other neddylated cullins such as Cul1 and Cul4. The observation that Cul3 was not co-immunoprecipitated by SAP130 as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> was probably due to the fact that neddylated Cul3 could not be detected in the total cell extract by the anti-Cul3 antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). It should be mentioned that because neddylated cullins tend to be unstable, the experiments shown above were carried out in the presence of proteasome inhibitor MG132 (see Methods).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>SAP130 interacts with Nedd8 modified cullins</bold>.

As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, GST-Nedd8, similar to GST itself, was not bound by SAP130, indicating that SAP130 did not have specific affinity to un-conjugated Nedd8.</p><p>It has been shown that CAND1 (also known as TIP120A) specifically binds un-neddylated cullins forming stable CAND1-cullin complexes in the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. To determine whether the level of CAND1 may affect the selective association of SAP130 with neddylated cullins, we knocked down CAND1 level in HeLa cells by siRNA. Reduction of CAND1 amount did not affect the steady state neddylation level of Cul2, however SAP130 no longer exhibited neddylation preference as it co-immunoprecipitated both neddylated and un-neddylated Cul2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). Concomitant with the loss of neddylation preference was an increase in the amount of Cul2 that was associated with SAP130 (Lanes 3 and 4). This data suggests that CAND1 inhibited SAP130-Cul2 interaction and that CAND1 was necessary for preferential association of SAP130 with neddylated Cul2 in the cells. Although the precise mechanism is not understood, it seems possible that CAND1 sequesters un-neddylated cullins from SAP130. Regardless, this data showed that neddylation is not necessary for SAP130 to bind cullins and that SAP130 has no intrinsic specificity for Nedd8.</p></sec><sec><title>SAP130 forms tertiary complexes with CRLs and associates with ubiquitin E3 activity</title><p>Next we asked whether SAP130 could form tertiary complex with the substrate-binding components of CRLs. The Cul2 substrate receptor HA-VHL and Flag-SAP130 were expressed in HEK293 cells. VHL and SAP130 clearly co-immunoprecipitated each other (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, lanes 2 and 5) supporting the idea that SAP130 can form a tertiary complex with the Cul2-VHL E3 complex. Noticeably, while VHL pulled down both neddylated and un-neddylated Cul2, SAP130 pulled down predominantly the neddylated Cul2. In addition, SAP130 also co-precipitated endogenous Skp1 and Skp2, as well as Cul4 adaptor DDB1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) and a transiently expressed DDB2 (data not shown). These results suggest that in contrast to CAND1, SAP130 is able to form tertiary complexes with different CRL E3s including SCF, Cul2-VHL and Cul4-DDB1 complexes.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>SAP130 forms tertiary complexes with CRL substrate adaptors and is associated with E3 activity</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>HEK293 cells were transfected with HA-VHL or Flag-SAP130.

CAND1 only interacted with full-length Cul1 but none of the truncations, while CSN8 could associate with both the N-terminal and C-terminal Cul1 deletions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>).

To understand how endogenous Cul1 may differ from ectopically expressed HA-Cul1 in neddylation dynamics, we compared the changes in the neddylation level in response to CSN inactivation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). We previously reported that the de-neddylation activity of CSN could be blocked by anti-CSN2 antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Specifically, incubation of the cell extract with anti-CSN2 antibody blocks the de-neddylation reaction but not the cellular neddylation activity, causing neddylated cullins to accumulate. HeLa cell extracts containing over-expressed HA-Cul1 or vector were incubated with anti-CSN2 antibody or a pre-immune serum. While endogenous Cul1 became completely neddylated by anti-CSN2 treatment (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>, lanes 2 and 4), the neddylation level of HA-Cul1 did not change (lane 4). This result suggests that the neddylation reaction on HA-Cul1 was slower or deficient compared to endogenous Cul1. Under the identical condition when de-neddylation was blocked, HA-Cul1 failed to be fully neddylated like endogenous Cul1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>, lane 4), suggesting that overexpressed HA-Cul1 is a poor neddylation substrates <italic>in vivo</italic>. We reasoned that HA-Cul1 overexpression system is unsuitable to study the neddylation and de-neddylation dynamics. However, this system is still valid for defining the Cul1 domains involved in SAP130 binding. In fact, SAP130 interaction with cullins does not require neddylation as shown earlier.</p><p>To extend the observations on SAP130-Cul1 interaction, we carried out a similar experiment on Cul2 truncations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). HA-Cul2C261 (484&#x02013;745 aa) containing the WH-a and WH-b domains and the Nedd8 attachment site (K689) can be effectively neddylated, as indicated by the Nedd8 blot after HA-precipitation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, lane 4). As predicted, both the full-length Cul2 and the N483 fragment could pull-down Elongin B, while C261 could not (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). This result is consistent with our understanding that the N-terminal region of Cul2 is necessary and sufficient for binding to Elongin B/C-VHL substrate-binding module. As in Cul1 binding experiment, CAND1 was associated only with full-length Cul2 but not with any of the terminal deletions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, bottom panel).</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>SAP130 binds to Cul2 CTD</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>HA-Cul2 and its truncations HA-Cul2N483 and HA-Cul2C261 were transiently transfected in HEK293 cells.

In a similar experiment, CSN1 was found to bind HA-Cul2 and all of the truncation mutants tested (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>, bottom panel) suggesting that CSN1 or the CSN complex has more than one contact site in Cul2 as in Cul1. These results show that SAP130 predominantly binds the C-terminal domain (CTD) of cullins, but it can also weakly interact with the N-terminal domain; while CSN1 binds to both N- and C-terminal regions of cullins.</p></sec><sec><title>CSN regulates SAP130-cullin interaction</title><p>To investigate the role of CSN1 in SAP130-Cul2 interaction, recombinant GST-CSN1 or GST protein was incubated with <italic>in vitro </italic>translated HA-SAP130 in RRL.

Notably, the amounts of Cul2<sup>GST-Nedd8 </sup>that co-precipitated with SAP130 clearly declined when the lysate was supplemented with increasing amounts of GST-CSN1, but not GST (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). This result indicated that excess CSN1 protein could interfere with the interaction between SAP130 and Cul2.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>CSN1 inhibits SAP130-Cul2 interaction and SAP130 associated E3 activity</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold><italic>In vitro </italic>translated HA-SAP130 in RRL was incubated with GST-Nedd8 (1 &#x003bc;g) and GST-CSN1 (0.5 &#x003bc;g or 1.0 &#x003bc;g) or GST (1.0 &#x003bc;g).

Flag-SAP130 immunocomplex was subsequently isolated and used for the <italic>in vitro </italic>E3 activity assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). SAP130 associated polyubiquitination activity was detectably reduced upon addition of excess GST-CSN1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, lanes 5, 6) and was dramatically reduced upon addition of CSN complex (lanes 7, 8). The observation that SAP130 associated E3 activity was sensitivity to CSN complex further reinforced the notion that the polyubiquitin chains produced by the SAP130 immunocomplex were mediated by CRLs rather than non-specifically bound E3s. We also found that Cul2 neddylation was reduced upon addition of CSN deneddylase as expected (Bottom panel, lanes 7, 8), but remained unchanged when supplemented with GST-CSN1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, bottom panel). Since CSN1 can inhibit SAP130-Cul2 interaction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>), we suggest that CSN1 affects SAP130 associated E3 activity by preventing SAP130-CRL interaction. Taken together, our data indicate that CSN complex negatively regulates SAP130 associated polyubiquitination activity by both cullin de-neddylation and blocking the recruitment of CRL E3 complexes.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>CRL ubiquitin E3 ligases are essential ubiquitination machineries in eukaryotes that are involved in a wide array of fundamental processes from genome stability to cell cycle control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Nedd8 attachment and removal from the cullin subunit represents an important mechanism by which CRL functions are regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. While the enzymes mediating cullin neddylation and de-neddylation have been identified, the regulatory mechanism and the functional consequences of this modification remain obscure. To this end, we have identified SAP130 as a new type of cullin binding protein that interacts with multiple cullins predominantly <italic>via </italic>cullin C-terminal domain. Under normal conditions when CAND1 was present at physiological levels, SAP130 preferred neddylated cullins and associated with fully assembled CRL E3 ligases. SAP130 immunocomplex exhibited a polyubiquitination activity that could be inhibited by excess amount of CSN complex or CSN1 protein.</p><p>The role of SAP130 in cullin neddylation pathway remains elusive. Ectopic expression or moderate knock-down of SAP130 in cultured cells did not cause obvious changes in cullin neddylation level (data not shown). We found that neddylation is not an essential signal for SAP130-cullin association, as SAP130 can bind unneddylated cullins when Cul1 or Cul2 were overexpressed in cultured cells or when CAND1 level was knocked down. This result suggests that CAND1 is the key factor that limits SAP130-cullin interaction and renders preferential association of SAP130 with neddylated cullins <italic>in vivo</italic>. Along this line, our data showed that CSN de-neddylase negatively regulates SAP130 associated ubiquitination activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).</p><p>SAP130 does not appear to discriminate between different cullins. This cullin binding capability distinguishes it from conventional CRL adaptors such as Skp1, Elongin B/C and BTB proteins, which exhibit specificity to different cullins by binding to the N-terminal cullin repeats. Nonetheless, since SAP130 weakly associates with the N-terminal region of Cul1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>), it may act as a substrate adaptor like DDB1 under certain circumstances. It is also possible that SAP130 acts as a general CRL adaptor to assist substrate ubiquitination by binding to cullin C-terminal domain. Along these lines, it is interesting to note that COMMD1, a NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitor, was found to promote ubiquitination of NF-&#x003ba;B by binding to the C-terminal domain of Cul2 in the Elongin B/C-Cul2-SOCS1 E3 complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. COMMD1 regulates the stability of RelA-chromatin complex and the recruitment of Rel-A to the E3 complex in response to stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>Bornstein <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] showed that increased availability of the Cul1 substrate binding components Skp1-Skp2 along with its substrate could trigger Cul1 neddylation. This process is accomplished by a sequential step that involves the dissociation of CAND1 from Cul1 and inactivation of CSN mediated de-neddylation. This finding together with our studies raises the question of whether SAP130 may play an active role in facilitating substrate dependent cullins neddylation, particularly during the gene expression processes.</p><p>SAP130 is a known component of RNA processing and transcription complexes. The SF3b complex, which contains SAP130 or SF3b-3, is involved in binding to the intron's branch point of the pre-mRNA during the early step of pre-spliceosome assembly. However, SAP130 is the only subunit of SF3b that does not cross-link to RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Similarly, though a component of STAGA/TFTC complexes which bind damaged DNA template and contain histone acetyltransferase activity (HAT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], SAP130 is neither required for the DNA binding nor the HAT activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. To date, the specific role of SAP130 in these complexes is yet unknown.</p><p>Increasing evidence show that transcription and co-transcriptional RNA processing are dependent on the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the neddylation pathway. In our recent study on <italic>Csn8 </italic>knockout mice, we found that deletion of Csn8 abolished CSN-mediated deneddylation of cullins such as Cul1, Cul2, and Cul4A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. However the upset in Cul1 neddylation level did not compromise degradation of SCF substrates, but caused dramatic transcription defects in a subset of genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Many CRL components such as F-box proteins, Elongin B/C and VHL have also been implicated in transcription control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Our finding that SAP130 associates with cullins raises a tantalizing hypothesis that SAP130 links CRL ubiquitination complexes and the gene expression machinery in a process regulated by CSN. It remains to be elucidated in the future whether SAP130 plays a role in CRL mediated substrate ubiquitination, particularly at the vicinity of RNA processing and transcription complexes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Cullin-RING ubiquitin E3 ligases are critical ubiquitination machineries in eukaryotes. In this study, we identified SAP130 as a new cullin binding protein that is likely involved in the Nedd8 pathway. SAP130 interacts with neddylated cullins in vivo in a manner dependent on CAND1 level. SAP130 forms tertiary complexes with active cullin-RING E3 ligases and is associated with polyubiquitination activity that could be modulated by CSN.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines, growth conditions, transfection and siRNA</title><p>NIH3T3, HeLa and HEK 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's (D-MEM) medium with high glucose and supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat inactivated fetal bovine serum in a 37&#x000b0;C humidified incubator containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.
