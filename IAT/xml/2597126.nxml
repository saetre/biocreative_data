In platelets ILK associates with &#x003b2;1- and &#x003b2;3-containing integrins, which are of paramount importance for the function of platelets. Upon stimulation of platelets this association with the integrins is increased and ILK kinase activity is up-regulated, suggesting that ILK may be important for the coordination of platelet responses. In this study a conditional knockout mouse model was developed to examine the role of ILK in platelets. The ILK-deficient mice showed an increased bleeding time and volume, and despite normal ultrastructure the function of ILK-deficient platelets was decreased significantly. This included reduced aggregation, fibrinogen binding, and thrombus formation under arterial flow conditions. Furthermore, although early collagen stimulated signaling such as PLC&#x003b3;2 phosphorylation and calcium mobilization were unaffected in ILK-deficient platelets, a selective defect in &#x003b1;-granule, but not dense-granule, secretion was observed. These results indicate that as well as involvement in the control of integrin affinity, ILK is required for &#x003b1;-granule secretion and therefore may play a central role in the regulation of platelet function.</p></abstract><contract-sponsor id="CS200" xlink:href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/">Wellcome Trust</contract-sponsor></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) was originally identified and cloned in 1996 as the result of a 2-hybrid screen for &#x003b2;1-integrin&#x02013;interacting proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref></sup> and is present in many tissues including heart, placenta, liver, kidney, pancreas,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref></sup> and platelets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref></sup> Originally recognized for its ability to regulate integrin-mediated signal transduction, ILK has subsequently been shown to be involved in normal cardiac function,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref></sup> cardiac-hypertrophy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref></sup> hepatocyte differentiation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref></sup> dendrite formation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref></sup> bone development,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref></sup> and several types of cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref></sup></p><p>The structural characterization of this 59-kDa cytosolic protein implicates ILK in the coordination of cell signaling through its potential to interact directly and indirectly with receptors, cytoso-lic-signaling proteins, and cytoskeletal proteins across its 3 structurally conserved domains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref></sup> The C terminus of ILK contains a serine-threonine kinase domain that binds to &#x003b2;1- and &#x003b2;3-containing integrins, parvin, paxillin (Hic5), kindlin (UNC-112 or MIG2) and PDK1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref></sup> Adjacent to this is a pleckstrin homology domain that binds to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref></sup> The binding of PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> is thought to regulate kinase activity and facilitates interaction with &#x003b1;-parvin, which supports the formation of focal adhesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref></sup> At the N terminus of this molecule 4 ankyrin repeats bind to both ILK-associated phosphatase (ILKAP) and particularly interesting new cystine-histidine protein (PINCH).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref></sup> These interactions with integrins, intercellular signaling complexes and matrix proteins link the structural frameworks of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the cytoskeleton and allow the transmission of bidirectional signals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref></sup></p><p>Debate has surrounded whether the cellular role of ILK involves kinase activity.

Upon injury they become exposed to subendothelial matrix proteins, particularly collagens, to which they initially adhere via the GPIb-V-IX complex and plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF). This interaction with collagen is stabilized via direct interactions between platelet collagen receptor glycoprotein VI (GPVI) and integrin &#x003b1;2&#x003b2;1. The binding of collagen to GPVI and receptor clustering results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the FcR &#x003b3;-chain and triggers a signaling pathway that leads to PLC&#x003b3;2 phosphorylation and calcium mobilization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref></sup> At sites of injury platelets are also exposed to thrombin generated due to the activation of the coagulation pathways, resulting in platelet signaling through the protease-activated receptors, PAR1 (PAR3 in mouse), and PAR4.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref></sup> Both signaling pathways result in cell spreading, positive feedback signaling, and signaling to other platelets. The latter occurs via secretion of thrombotic factors and inside-out integrin signaling, through which the affinity of integrins &#x003b1;2&#x003b2;1 and &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 become increased. The bivalent binding of fibrinogen to integrin &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 supports platelet-platelet adhesion and hence thrombus formation. The resulting thrombus is stabilized by the increasing affinity of &#x003b1;2&#x003b2;1 for collagen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref></sup></p><p>Platelets depend upon integrins for their role in hemostasis, as demonstrated by conditions where expression is reduced, such as Glanzmann thrombocytopenia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref></sup> Through inside-out and outside-in signaling the integrins mediate a variety of cellular processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref></sup> and are important in transduction pathways linking extracellular adhesive proteins (such as VWF, fibrinogen, and collagen), with intracellular signaling molecules (such as focal adhesion kinase [FAK] and paxillin) and cytoskeletal components (including talin, filamin, and &#x003b1;-actinin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref></sup>).</p><p>In this study a conditional ILK-deficient mouse model was used to examine the role of ILK in the regulation of platelet function, signaling, and thrombus formation under arterial flow conditions.

To begin to assess why ILK-deficient platelets showed reduced function, integrin &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 surface exposure and affinity regulation were investigated. ILK depletion reduced slightly &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 surface exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A) despite normal levels of &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 expression (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).

Platelet &#x003b1;- and dense-granule secretion by ILK-deficient platelets were therefore examined. Despite normal levels of P-selectin protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B) and normal platelet ultrastructure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>E), a dramatic reduction in agonist-induced &#x003b1;-granule secretion in the ILK KO platelets was revealed by examining P-selectin surface exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A) and PF4 release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). This defect was seen even at high concentrations of agonists and suggests a central role for ILK in platelet activation. Dense granule secretion, however, was maintained at both high and low concentrations of agonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C,D). Taken together these results suggest that this is not a general disruption of the structural changes that occur upon platelet activation and that &#x003b1;-granule secretion is specifically effected by ILK depletion. Differential secretion of &#x003b1;- and dense-granules from platelets via the actin cytoskeleton has been recently reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref></sup> It is possible, therefore, that ILK plays a critical role in aspects unique to &#x003b1;-granule secretion.</p><p>The presence of fibrinogen (present in &#x003b1;-granules and plasma) did not rescue the reduction in aggregation observed in washed platelets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E,F).

However, the increased lag time observed in the PRP and washed samples containing ILK-deficient platelets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C-F) may be due to reduced &#x003b1;-granule secretion and further activation resulting from this.</p><p>The importance of ILK in thrombus generation in whole blood was investigated by studying thrombus formation on immobilized collagen under arterial flow conditions.

The depth of thrombi formed, however, was reduced in the blood of ILK-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). This reduced thrombus growth is consistent with the reduced platelet &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 activation observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). The moderately increased bleeding in ILK-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>) indicates the physiological importance of ILK for normal platelet function.</p><p>Since ILK appeared to possess a central role in the platelet activation process, it was important to establish that cell signaling was triggered following exposure to agonists. The phosphorylation of PLC&#x003b3;2 and the mobilization of calcium from internal stores following stimulation of the collagen receptor GPVI are events up-stream of granule secretion and integrin activation. Upon stimulation with collagen (or CRP) both events appear unaffected by ILK depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>), indicating that early collagen signaling events are not dependent on the presence of ILK and that the apparent defect in platelet signaling lies further downstream.</p><p>The changes to platelet signaling and function described here, as a result of ILK deficiency, may be as a direct result of loss of ILK kinase activity or ILK protein-protein interactions (or a combination of both of these). In other cells ILK has been shown to form associations with a complex of molecules, components of which include PINCH and parvin, that together with ILK regulate integrin signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref></sup> and have been shown to be necessary for the formation of focal adhesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref></sup> Through these and other interactions ILK is implicated in many processes including cytoskeletal arrangement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref></sup> cell adhesion, migration, survival, and proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref></sup> Further work will be required to establish the basis of the defects observed in ILK-deficient mice, and whether these result from disruption of protein complex formation and/or kinase activity.</p><p>Our data provide compelling evidence that ILK has a role in the regulation of platelet function and suggests a dual role for ILK in the regulation of platelet function through the control of &#x003b1;-granule secretion and the affinity modulation of &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment.
