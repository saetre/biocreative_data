It is characterized by chronic inflammation primarily in the small airways and lung parenchyma, with increased numbers of macrophages, neutrophils and T lymphocytes in comparison to healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. T helper (Th) lymphocytes can be classified into two types depending on the secreted cytokines. Th1 cells are mainly involved in cell-mediated inflammatory reactions and in development of chronic inflammatory conditions, whereas Th2 cells enhance antibody production by B cells and are prominent in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. A bias towards a Th1 cell profile has been hypothesized in COPD, with Th1/T cytotoxic 1 (Tc1) pattern and increased Th1 cytokine levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Th1 cells secrete IL-2, IL-12, and IFN-&#x003b3;, which has been shown to regulate Th mediated immune and allergic responses by inducing Th1 differentiation. IFN-&#x003b3; secretion from natural killer (NK) cells and monocytes/macrophages is likely to be important in early host defence against infection, whereas T lymphocytes become the major source of IFN-&#x003b3; in the adaptive immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>IFN-&#x003b3;-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) is induced by IFN-&#x003b3; in many types of cells including monocytes and lung epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. IP-10, also named CXCL10, is a potent chemokine for activated T lymphocytes and regulates cell proliferation, apoptosis and adhesion molecule expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that physical interactions between cells grown in co-cultures induce IP-10 secretion; between endothelial cells (EnC)/monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], EnC/alloantigen-primed T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], EnC/PBMCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], leucocytes/synoviocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] as well as human bronchial epithelial cell (BEAS-2B)/eosinophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The increased IP-10 secretion in BEAS-2B/eosinophil co-cultures was regulated by p38 MAPK and NF-kappaB activities of BEAS-2B cells, at least partly via intercellular contact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>IP-10 binds to a G protein coupled receptor CXCR3 that is preferentially expressed on Th1 type cells, causing chemotaxis of these cells towards this chemokine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. CXCR3 is also expressed by many cell types including lung epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and it has been shown to be involved in epithelial cell movement via p38 MAPK and PI3K dependent signalling pathways in human airway epithelial cells (HAEC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, HAEC have also been shown to release IP-10 as well as express CXCR3, suggesting the potential for autocrine signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>IFN-&#x003b3;-inducing cytokine IL-12 is produced by many cell types including monocytes/macrophages, and neutrophils. The major actions of IL-12 are on T cells, resulting in induction of Th1 differentiation, proliferation, IFN-&#x003b3; production and increased cytotoxic activity. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] Th1 cytokine phenotype has been demonstrated in peripheral blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and in lung portions removed surgically from patients with COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Furthermore, increased IL-12 levels have been shown in patients with COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Relative expression levels of IFN-&#x003b3; in COPD patients are variable, with previous studies having shown an increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], decrease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] or no change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] in IFN-&#x003b3; secretion in COPD patients compared with controls. Enhanced IP-10 secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] as well as expression of the IP-10 receptor CXCR3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] have been demonstrated in COPD. As shown by Saetta et al. (2002), most of the CXCR3 positive cells in peripheral airways in patients with COPD were CD8+ positive T cells and produced IFN-&#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>The present study focuses on the regulation of the IP-10 secretion. The aim was to investigate the pathways of IP-10 secretion in a in vitro system including the cell types most likely involved in the IP-10 secretion in the lung tissue of COPD patients. Although several studies have demonstrated an increased IP-10 secretion via intercellular contact, little is known of the regulation of the Th1 IFN-&#x003b3;/IL-12 pathway upon intercellular interaction between lung epithelial cells and leucocytes. Since increased activity of the IFN-&#x003b3;/IL-12 pathway as well as increased levels of IP-10 in COPD is most likely due to a complex interaction between lung epithelial cells and white blood cells, we decided to investigate the role of the IFN-&#x003b3;/IL-12 pathway on IP-10 secretion upon the interaction of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with two human lung epithelial cell lines, A549 (alveolar epithelial cell line), Calu-3 (bronchial epithelial cell line) in addition to primary normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Maintenance of human epithelial cell lines</title><p>Cells from a human bronchial epithelial cell line (Calu-3) and from a human alveolar epithelial cell line (A549) were used for the present studies.

Usage of human blood for the present studies was approved by the local ethical committee, and the informed consent of all participating subjects was obtained. The venous blood was collected into 50 ml centrifuge tubes each containing 5 ml of Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) (Sigma-Aldrich) with 2.7% (w/v) Hepes (Sigma-Aldrich). The blood sample was diluted 1:1 with modified Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (PBS) without calcium chloride and magnesium chloride (Sigma-Aldrich). PBMCs were isolated with density centrifugation with ACCUSPIN&#x02122; System-HISTOPAQUE-1077 tubes (Sigma-Aldrich) at 400 g for 35 minutes at room temperature. Following centrifugation the layer containing the PBMCs (according the manufacturer's instructions) was collected, resuspended in PBS and centrifuged at 200 g for 10 minutes at room temperature. The supernatant was discarded and PBMC-rich pellet was resuspended in cell media (See above in <italic>Maintenance of Human Epithelial Cell Lines</italic>) with 1% FCS. A differential cell count was performed using a Beckman-Coulter Act5diff haematology analyzer to determine total cell number and the purity of the cell preparation. This method typically yields a cell suspension containing 80&#x02013;95% of lymphocytes and 5&#x02013;20% monocytes.

Since monocytes attach to the plastic whereas lymphocytes stay in suspension, the supernatant was collected after 1 hour and centrifuged at 200 g for 5 minutes. A differential cell count was performed using a Beckman-Coulter Act5diff haematology analyzer to determine total cell number and the purity of the cell preparation.

A differential cell count was performed using a Beckman-Coulter Act5diff haematology analyzer to determine total cell number and the purity of the cell preparation.

The epithelial cell lines were grown into 80% confluency before the experiments whereas the PBMCs were cultured at the density of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml. The cultures were performed in 48 well clusters with 0.5 ml cell media (500 000 PBMCs/well) with or without A549, Calu-3 and NHBEs. The epithelial cell lines and PBMCs were cultured either alone or in co-culture in 48 well clusters for 18 hours in cell media (see above) with 1% FCS before the ELISA assay.

Increased levels of both IP-10 and CXCR3 have been shown in patients with COPD, and subsequently this chemokine has been suggested to be involved in the inflammatory process underlying COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>The aim of the present studies was to examine the effects of lung epithelial cells/PBMCs interaction on IP-10 secretion. We used PBMCs from both non-smoking and smoking volunteers since COPD is a smoking related disease. However, no differences were found in IP-10 secretion from PBMCs between non-smokers and smokers (results not shown). This is likely due to the fact that all volunteers used in the present study are healthy. However, at the present studies we characterize the complex interaction between PBMCs and lung epithelial cells on the regulation of IP-10 secretion by IFN-&#x003b3;/IL-12 pathways. No basal secretion of IP-10 was observed in either cell type cultured alone, however, a significant increase of basal IP-10 secretion was observed in PBMC/lung epithelial cell co-cultures. The IP-10 secretion was found to be due to a specific interaction between monocytes and lung epithelial cells via cell-cell contact (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8a</xref>), since no basal IP-10 secretion was detected in PBMC/lung epithelial cell transwell co-cultures. Surprisingly, no IP-10 secretion was observed in monocyte/lung epithelial cell co-cultures in the absence of lymphocytes. Since addition of recombinant IFN-&#x003b3; could restore the elevated IP-10 secretion in monocyte/lung epithelial cell co-cultures, the significance of the lymphocytes in co-cultures is most likely to the source of endogenous IFN-&#x003b3; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8b</xref>). A similar mechanism might also be involved in EnC/PBMC co-cultures studied by Raju et al. (2003) demonstrating that the basal secretion of IP-10 from EnC/PBMC co-cultures is IFN-&#x003b3; dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Therefore, it is likely that the increased amounts of leucocytes in lung tissue in COPD patients interact with several cell types including lung epithelial cells as well as endothelial cells in a similar manner increasing IP-10 secretion.</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>In summary, basal IP-10 secretion is induced by monocyte-epithelial cell interactions, with a presence of lymphocytes, most likely to provide a source of IFN-&#x003b3;.

Addition of recombinant IFN-&#x003b3; induces strong IP-10 secretion in co-cultures even in absence of lymphocytes.

Nevertheless, antibodies against IFN-&#x003b3; blocked the IP-10 secretion from co-cultures, suggesting that low levels of endogenous IFN-&#x003b3;, undetectable with ELISA, are present in co-cultures The detection range for the IFN-&#x003b3; ELISA is from ~0.015&#x02013;1 ng/ml. The lowest detectable concentration would not be able to stimulate IP-10 secretion in PBMC cultures, since we did not detect any IP-10 secretion with 0.1 ng/ml IFN-&#x003b3; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). However, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, addition of 0.1 ng/ml IFN-&#x003b3; strongly augments basal IP-10 secretion in Calu-3/PBMC co-cultures, which did not secrete any detectable levels of endogenous IFN-&#x003b3;, suggesting that even a very low concentration of endogenous IFN-&#x003b3; can induce strong IP-10 secretion when there are direct cellular interactions between monocyte and lung epithelial cells. The increasing concentrations (0.1&#x02013;10 ng/ml) of IFN-&#x003b3; resulted in a dose dependent increase in IP-10 secretion in co-cultures (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><p>As previously described, IP-10 is specifically secreted by the monocytes in PBMCs. Interestingly, monocytes cultured in the conditioned media from either epithelial cell line, together with recombinant IFN-&#x003b3;, induce significant increase in IP-10 secretion. These results suggest that a secreted factor from epithelial cell lines is at least partially responsible for the IFN-&#x003b3; mediated IP-10 secretion in co-cultures. A recent study by Boulday et al. (2006) reported that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) augments the IFN-&#x003b3; mediated secretion of IP-10 in endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Interestingly, Koyama <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] show that A549 epithelial cells constitutively express high levels of VEGF and that this is augmented by IFN-&#x003b3;. Whilst our studies confirm the high constitutive VEGF secretion (data not shown) neither human recombinant VEGF nor VEGF inhibitors had any effects on IP-10 secretion from monocytes. These data suggest that there are distinct soluble factors governing the IP-10 response in endothelial versus epithelial cells. The secreted factor from lung epithelial cells might be a growth factor, interleukin or interferon, since previous studies have shown an inducible expression of IP-10 in a wide variety of tissues and cells under the influence of stimuli including interferons, interleukins, lipopolysaccharide, tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;, platelet derived growth factor, and hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>IL-12 is a classic IFN-&#x003b3; inducing cytokine, which induced secretion of endogenous IFN-&#x003b3; in A549/PBMC co-cultures due to a specific interaction between lymphocytes and A549 cells IL-12 also induced an increase in IP-10 secretion in A549/PBMC co-cultures, potentially partly due to endogenous IFN-&#x003b3; signalling. The IL-12 mediated induction of IFN-&#x003b3; and IP-10 secretion in A549/PBMC co-cultures is via intercellular contact as this was only observed in co-cultures and not in transwells or conditioned media studies. Interestingly, IFN-&#x003b3; antibody pre-treatment only partially inhibited IL-12 mediated IP-10 induction, suggesting that there may be both IFN-&#x003b3; dependent and independent IP-10 induction pathways.</p><p>In contrast to A549/PBMC co-cultures, IL-12 significantly increased IP-10 secretion in Calu-3/PBMC co-cultures in the absence of any detectable increase in IFN-&#x003b3; levels (Compare Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8d</xref>). Moreover, the IL-12 mediated IP-10 secretion was shown to be IFN-&#x003b3; independent, since it could not be inhibited by the IFN-&#x003b3; ab in Calu-3/PBMC co-cultures. This IL-12 mediated IP-10 secretion is likely to be mediated at least in part via a secreted factor from Calu-3 cells as it is maintained in conditioned media and transwell studies.</p><p>To further probe the signalling pathways involved in modulating IP-10 expression in the epithelial cell/PBMC co-cultures, we investigated the pharmacological effect of a number of signal transduction pathway inhibitors on this model. Present studies suggest that there are at least two pathways by which IP-10 can be induced which are either IFN-&#x003b3; dependent or IL-12 dependent.</p><p>IFN-&#x003b3; dependent IP-10 expression was sensitive to PI3K inhibitors and independent of signalling via IKK-2, p38 or PDE4. Interestingly, whilst corticosterioids are frequently prescribed for lung inflammation, they again did not modulate IFN-&#x003b3; induced IP-10 expression in this system. As IFN-&#x003b3; signals via a JAK-STAT1 pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], resistance to these inhibitors would be expected, but the role of PI3K is very exciting. The PI3 kinase inhibitor PIK-93 used in the present studies targets several PI3 kinases and has high potency for the class I PI3 kinases p110&#x003b1; as well as p110&#x003b3;. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] The development of subtype specific inhibitors will help identify which subtype of PI3 kinase is responsible for the increased IP-10 expression in co-cultures. Consistent with these results, it has been reported that the non-selective PI3K inhibitor wortmanin can also inhibit IFN-g mediated IP-10 production from endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. These studies suggest that the development of PI3K inhibitors may represent a novel anti-inflammatory treatment for COPD, as they will inhibit a pathway not modulated by current therapies.</p><p>In contrast, IL-12 mediated IP-10 induction was sensitive to each of the inhibitors tested, except antibodies to IFN-&#x003b3;. This provides further evidence therefore, that there are at least two pathways for IP-10 induction, with the latter being dependent upon the classical inflammatory pathways, NF&#x003ba;B and p38 MAP kinase, as well as cAMP. Moreover, the IL-12 signalling cascade has previously been shown to be sensitive to dexamethasone, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and the present studies show that the IL-12 mediated induction of IP-10 in co-cultures is modulated by corticosteroids, which may contribute to the efficacy of these agents in treatment of respiratory inflammation.</p><p>The differences in IL-12 mediated IP-10 secretion between Calu-3/PBMC and A549/PBMC co-cultures were also evident in the inhibitor studies. Inhibition of IP-10 secretion in A549/PBMC co-cultures was only effectively inhibited by PI3K inhibitors and partially inhibited by dexamethasone. As these co-cultures were shown to endogenously express IFN-&#x003b3; (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), this would suggest that most of the drive to induce IP-10 was due to the IFN-&#x003b3; JAK-STAT1 pathway, in addition to some residual signalling via a steroid sensitive pathway. In contrast, all inhibitors used in the present study strongly inhibited IP-10 secretion in Calu-3/PBMC co-cultures, suggesting IFN-&#x003b3; signalling is not required for induction of IP-10. These differences might reflect the differences in bronchiolar vs alveolar lung epithelial tissue, which would have to be taken into account in design of novel inhibitors blocking the abnormally high IP-10 secretion in lung tissue of COPD patients.</p><p>In addition to the human lung epithelial cell lines, we also used the primary human epithelial cultures for the key experiments. In contrast to A549 and Calu-3, NHBEs cultured alone secrete IP-10 if pretreated with IFN-&#x003b3;. Consistent with this result Sauty et al. reported that pre-treatment with IFN-&#x003b3; induces IP-10 secretion in NHBEs but not in A549 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, in agreement with the results from A549/PBMCs and Calu-3/PBMCs co-cultures, significantly increased IFN-&#x003b3; mediated IP-10 secretion was observed from NHBE/PBMC co-cultures compared with NHBEs or PBMCs cultured alone. This demonstrates a significant increase in IFN-&#x003b3; mediated IP-10 secretion in PBMCs co-cultured with all lung epithelial cell lines as well as the primary bronchial epithelial cells used in the present study. These results indicate that PBMC-lung epithelial cell interactions are strongly promoting IP-10 secretion in response to IFN-&#x003b3;, thereby attracting more lymphocytes to lung tissue and support the use of the A549 and CALU-3 cell lines as a model of the primary cell system. As example, application of cigarette smoke extract in the leucocyte-lung epithelial cell co-cultures or to the conditioned media is likely to provide an interesting additional in vitro model for COPD.</p><p>Since IP-10 is a potent chemoattractant for T cells, the suppression of the increased IP-10 levels in lung tissue of COPD patients may reduce the lung inflammation characteristic of this disease. Increasing IP-10 levels will cause a positive feedback loop attracting more T cells to the peripheral airways, in turn increasing IFN-&#x003b3; secretion. Establishing a method to inhibit this positive feedback loop may be profitable in suppressing the inflammatory process underlying COPD. Barnes et al. (2004) suggests that T cell inhibitory strategies, such as the use of immunosuppressant's, might be effective in COPD, although side effects, such as increasing the risk of bacterial infection, is of particular concern. Inhibition of IFN-&#x003b3; signaling may provide another approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. As shown in the present study, basal IP-10 secretion in co-cultures is blocked with all inhibitors used, representing both current and experimental therapies for respiratory disease. However, in the presence of IFN-&#x003b3; which is secreted by T cells in peripheral airways IP-10 secretion is only inhibited by inhibitors of PI3K. This in vitro model may represent the environment in the peripheral airways of COPD patients which contain a large number of Th1 T cells, and suggest that IP-10 mediated inflammation is not being addressed with current respiratory therapies such as corticosteroids in these patients. However, this pathway was modulated by non-isozyme selective PI3K inhibitors in this model. A number of Pharmaceutical companies are developing PI3K inhibitors and these results complement an emerging body of data that suggest they may also have utility in treating the inflammation associated with COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>IP-10 secretion is a potent chemokine for CD8 T cells and its expression is induced when circulating monocytes, T cells and epithelium are in close proximity. Moreover, expression of this chemokine is induced by signaling molecules such as IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-12 known to be expressed in COPD. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that therapies targeted at decreasing the levels of IP-10 in peripheral airways of COPD patients may have therapeutic benefit in the management of this disease. In the present studies we demonstrate a complex interaction between monocytes, lymphocytes and lung epithelial cells resulting in IP-10 secretion via multiple pathways. Furthermore, inhibition studies supported the suggestion that different intracellular pathways are responsible for IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-12 mediated IP-10 secretion. These results may provide novel strategies for investigating means by which to modulate IP-10 mediated secretion and chemotactic effects on T cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CM - Conditioned media; </p><p>COPD - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; </p><p>EnC - Endothelial cells; </p><p>IP-10 - IFN-&#x003b3;-inducible protein 10</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>All experiments performed in this study are supported by Pfizer Ltd.
