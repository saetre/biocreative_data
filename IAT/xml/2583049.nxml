PKC&#x003b4; is robustly expressed in human platelets and undergoes transient tyrosine phosphorylation upon stimulation by thrombin or the collagen receptor, GPVI, which becomes sustained in the presence of the pan-PKC inhibitor, Ro 31-8220. In mouse platelets, however, PKC&#x003b4; undergoes sustained tyrosine phosphorylation upon activation. In contrast the related isoform, PKC&#x003b5;, is expressed at high levels in mouse but not human platelets. There is a marked inhibition in aggregation and dense granule secretion to low concentrations of GPVI agonists in mouse platelets lacking PKC&#x003b5; in contrast to a minor inhibition in response to G protein-coupled receptor agonists. This reduction is mediated by inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of the FcR&#x003b3;-chain and downstream proteins, an effect also observed in wild-type mouse platelets in the presence of a PKC inhibitor.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These results demonstrate a reciprocal relationship in levels of the novel PKC isoforms &#x003b4; and &#x003b5; in human and mouse platelets and a selective role for PKC&#x003b5; in signalling through GPVI.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The major receptors which induce platelet activation signal by different mechanisms although many converge on the activation of the protein kinase C (PKC) family of serine/threonine kinases. For example, thrombin signals through heterotrimeric Gq proteins leading to activation of phospholipase C (PLC)&#x003b2; isoforms, while the collagen receptor GPVI activates a distinct isoform, PLC&#x003b3;2, through an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-dependent pathway, involving sequential activation of Src, Syk and Tec family tyrosine kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003793-Watson1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. PLC&#x003b2; and &#x003b3; isoforms hydrolyse phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to generate the second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) and 1,2-diacylglycerol which mobilise Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> from intracellular stores and activate classical and novel isoforms of PKC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003793-Nishizuka1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

The classical PKC isoforms (&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, &#x003b3;), contain domains conferring regulation to diacylglycerol and Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and require both for full activation. The novel isoforms (&#x003b4;, &#x003b5;, &#x003b8;, &#x003b7;) are Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-independent whereas the atypical isoforms &#x003b9; &#x002dc;/&#x003bb; and &#x003b6; are not directly regulated by diacylglycerol or Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. Initial evidence for the involvement of the novel PKC isoforms in platelet activation came from studies monitoring tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins following stimulation of human platelets. PKC&#x003b4; is tyrosine phosphorylated at two distinct sites, Tyr311 and 565, in response to activation of GPVI and PAR receptors, but not by the major platelet integrin, &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003793-Moussazadeh1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003793-Crosby1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003793-Hall1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003793-Murugappan1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. This provides a potential mechanism for both direct regulation of PKC&#x003b4; activity and in initiating downstream signalling through recruitment of SH2 domain containing proteins.

This reduction in response to GPVI was associated with a marked decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation induced by the agonist, illustrated by measurement of phosphorylation in whole cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003793-g006">Fig 6B</xref>). The FcR&#x003b3;-chain runs as a distinct band in the whole cell lysate and, importantly, its phosphorylation can be seen to be reduced revealing that inhibition occurs at a proximal stage in the signalling cascade.

In comparison, aggregation and secretion induced through the PAR4 receptor are only marginally inhibited, consistent with a minor role for this PKC isoform in supporting activation alongside other PKC isoforms. The selective defect in GPVI signalling in PKC&#x003b5;-deficient platelets contrasts sharply with that of PKC&#x003b4;, as platelets from mice deficient in the latter show increased filopodia formation on CRP and increased aggregation to collagen in suspension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003793-Pula1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. This demonstrates unique functions for the two novel PKC isoforms downstream of GPVI in mouse platelets. The defect in GPVI signalling seen in the PKC&#x003b5;-null mouse platelets is not due to a change in the level of expression of GPVI or &#x003b1;2&#x003b2;1. The observation that aggregation to ADP was not altered in mouse platelets argues against a role for a change in expression of integrin &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3, a result confirmed by flow cytometry.</p><p>The reduction in response to GPVI can be accounted for by a decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation at a proximal stage of its signalling cascade, as phosphorylation of the FcR&#x003b3;-chain and Syk are reduced. A mechanism to explain this has been described in mast cells, where, in response to activation of the Fc&#x003b5;RI receptor, PKC phosphorylates the FcR&#x003b3;-chain on threonine-60, two residues downstream of the conserved C-terminal tyrosine residue which is phosphorylated in the ITAM, leading to Syk association <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003793-Germano1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Expression of a mutated form of the FcR&#x003b3;-chain with threonine-60 replaced by alanine led to reduced association and activation of Syk and subsequent inhibition of degranulation in response to IgE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003793-Swann1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. The authors speculate that phosphorylation of the ITAM by a novel PKC isoform increases binding of Syk to the ITAM and enhances activation, illustrated by the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk and downstream proteins. We speculate that this increase in binding of Syk to the FcR&#x003b3;-chain protects the ITAM moiety from dephosphorylation leading to a net increase in tyrosine phosphorylation. In mast cells, PKC&#x003b4; is responsible for the phosphorylation. However, although PKC&#x003b4; is expressed robustly in human platelets, it is at low levels in mouse platelets. PKC&#x003b5; is present in mouse platelets and, as for PKC&#x003b4;, its recombinant form does mediate phosphorylation of the FcR&#x003b3;-chain ITAM <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003793-Germano1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the FcR&#x003b3;-chain, Syk and downstream proteins is also reduced in the presence of a pan-PKC inhibitor in mouse platelets, confirming that the reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation of FcR&#x003b3;-chain is mediated by the loss of a PKC isoform. Interestingly, a similar result is not seen in human platelets, which, although consistent with the low levels of PKC&#x003b5;, is surprising given the presence of PKC&#x003b4;. This may reflect a further difference between mouse and human platelets in the role of novel PKC isoforms.</p><p>Our inability to detect expression of PKC&#x003b5; in human platelets was not expected as there are several reports describing its presence. However, Buensuceso <italic>et al.</italic> were also unable to detect expression of PKC&#x003b5; in human platelets although both positive and negative studies used the same source of antibodies as used in the present one <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003793-Crosby1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003793-Crosby2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003793-Buensuceso1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003793-Murugappan2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Our attempt to address this through concentration of PKC&#x003b5; by immunoprecipitation was unsuccessful. Whilst the explanation for this discrepancy is not known, and may reflect differences in batches of antibodies, the cumulative reports illustrate that PKC&#x003b5; is either absent in human platelets or present at a very low level.</p><p>The present study demonstrates that the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC&#x003b4; seen in human platelets is down-regulated through a PKC-dependent pathway. The molecular basis of this is not known, although it could be dependent upon the direct or indirect regulation of a protein tyrosine phosphatase. For example the SHP-1 tyrosine phosphatase interacts with PKC&#x003b1; and is phosphorylated on a consensus PKC phosphorylation site following human platelet activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003793-Jones1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Phosphorylation of SHP-1 negatively regulates its activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, but the <italic>in vivo</italic> consequences of phosphorylation may be more complex, with the potential to regulate substrate specificity and localisation. Interestingly, in mouse platelets tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC&#x003b4; is sustained, further emphasising the species-specific functions and regulation of PKC isoforms. PAR4 has been reported to stimulate sustained tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC&#x003b4; in human platelets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003793-Murugappan1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, and this is the major signalling receptor for thrombin in mouse platelets. Thus, the difference in kinetics may reflect differential expression and roles of PAR1 and PAR4 in human and mouse platelets.</p><p>Although frequently used as a marker of PKC&#x003b4; activation, the functional significance of its tyrosine phosphorylation is unclear. It has been reported to increase the kinase activity of PKC&#x003b4; in human platelets but is not required for membrane association <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003793-Hall1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. This study shows that blockade of Src kinases, and hence phosphorylation of PKC&#x003b4;, does not alter pleckstrin phosphorylation in thrombin-stimulated platelets, arguing against direct regulation of enzymatic activity, with the caveat that PKC&#x003b4; may not play a major role in regulating pleckstrin phosphorylation. The lack of Src kinase blockade on pleckstrin phosphorylation is consistent with the fact that Src kinases play a minimal role in thrombin-induced platelet aggregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003793-Briddon1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, again questioning the significance of PKC&#x003b4; tyrosine phosphoryation in this signalling pathway. The significance of tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC&#x003b4; downstream of GPVI remains to be established.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study has provided further evidence for specific regulation and functions of PKC isoforms by focussing on the two novel PKCs, PKC&#x003b4; and PKC&#x003b5;, and in particular has shown that PKC&#x003b5; plays a critical role in potentiating the proximal events in the GPVI signalling pathway. Further, it has also demonstrated differences in expression and phosphorylation of the two isoforms in mouse and human platelets further revealing species-specific functions of individual isoforms.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Peter Parker for generously providing reagents.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
