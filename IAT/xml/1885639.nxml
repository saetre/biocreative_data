Accumulated work has shown that the biological activities of APE1 are sensitive to oxidative stress; however, whether APE1 functions can be regulated by nitrosative stress remains unknown. In this investigation, we found that S-nitrosoglutathion (GSNO), a nitric oxide donor and also an S-nitrosating agent, effectively stimulated nuclear export of APE1 in a CRM1-independent manner. This nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation was dependent on S-nitrosation modification of APE1, as simultaneous mutation of S-nitrosation target sites Cys93 and Cys310 completely abrogated the cytoplasmic redistribution. The translocation process was reversal and specific, as it could be reversed by reductive reagents, but could not be mimicked by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. In structure, the region aa.64&#x02013;80 and the beta-strand aa.311&#x02013;316 in proximity to Cys93 and Cys310 were important for GSNO-induced APE1 relocalization. In addition, a defect of importin-mediated nuclear import pathway was found in the NO-insulted cells, and p50 and HDAC2 were identified as APE1 nuclear export inhibitory proteins. Together, this study may provide a novel molecular mechanism, which links nitrosative stress to APE1-associated physiological and pathological processes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1/redox effector factor-1 (APE1/Ref-1) is a bifunctional oxidative-stress-responsive protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4 B5">1&#x02013;5</xref>). On one hand, it acts as an apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease, during the second step of the DNA base excision repair pathway, which is responsible for the repair of cellular oxidative DNA damages. On the other hand, it plays a crucial role, as a coactivator for various transcription factors in controlling gene expression by redox-dependent mechanism. Therefore, the regulation of APE1 function is a very important issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7">5&#x02013;7</xref>). The cellular function of APE1 is coordinately controlled at several levels. Firstly, the expression of APE1 can be upregulated by a variety of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ROS-generating systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10">8&#x02013;10</xref>). Secondly, APE1 can be modified by phosphorylation, acetylation, and redox modification, which are important for the regulation of its DNA-binding, transcriptional regulation, and DNA repair functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13 B14">11&#x02013;14</xref>). Lastly, the APE1 subcellular distribution varies according to different cell types and environment stresses. (1) The expression pattern of APE1 is mainly nuclear, but cytoplasmic staining has also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17">15&#x02013;17</xref>). The latter is usually observed in highly metabolically active or proliferative cells, which may experience an increased oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). (2) Generally, stimuli that induce APE1 expression are also able to promote its intracellular movement. Various redox-related stimuli can induce the translocation of APE1 from cytoplasm to nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18 B19 B20">18&#x02013;20</xref>). The nuclear import process may be dependent on an N-terminal nuclear import sequence (NLS) that mediates the importin-dependent nuclear import of APE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). (3) In B-lymphocyte, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> stimulation can induce a relocalization of APE1 into mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Recently, a low abundance of mitochondrial-localized APE1 was found as the N-terminal 33 residues-truncated form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Although various subcellular localizations and intracellular trafficking of APE1 have been reported, little is known about how these phenomena are regulated. Particularly, the mechanism of the redox regulated localization change remains open.</p><p>Nitric oxide (NO) is a reactive free radical that plays a central role in diverse signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24 B25 B26 B27">24&#x02013;27</xref>). Apart from the well-known cGMP-dependent signaling pathway of NO, there is also a cGMP-independent pathway that involves protein S-nitrosation. S-nitrosation is a ubiquitous redox-related modification of cysteine thiols by nitric oxide, which transduces the bioactivity of NO. S-nitrosation has been implicated in regulation of gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), and protein nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). APE1 contains a redox-active domain and three redox-sensitive cysteine residues, and its subcellular localization seems redox-sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). However, whether APE1 can be modified by NO-elicited S-nitrosation and whether its subcellular distribution can be regulated by this redox modification have not been reported.</p><p>In this study, we reported that APE1 can inducibly translocate from nucleus to cytoplasm in response to nitric oxide stimulation in a CRM1-independent manner. This nuclear export process of APE1 is reversible and dependent on the S-nitrosation of its Cys93 and Cys310 sites. In structure, two antiparallel beta-strands close to Cys93 and Cys310 were identified to be required for NO-mediated export of APE1. In addition, it was found that the importin-mediated nuclear import pathway was repressed in NO-insulted cells, which may prevent cytosolic APE1 from re-transporting into the nucleus. Thus, we for the first time reveal a molecular event that coordinates S-nitrosation modification and nuclear-cytosolic shuttling of APE1. Since the disruption of APE1 subcellular localization may result in a defect in intra-nuclear DNA repair and transcriptional regulation functions, this finding may establish a novel role of APE1 in NO-related physiological and pathological processes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Reagents and plasmids</title><p>Leptomycin B (LMB), 1, 4-dithiothreitol (DTT), N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), cycloheximide (CHX) and other reagents, which were not specified, were purchased from Sigma.

APE1 expressions in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were examined by immunoblotting analysis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A, GSNO stimulation resulted in a significant decrease of nuclear distribution of APE1 in a time-dependent manner. At the same course, the cytosolic APE1 contents were markedly enhanced. As a control, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> did not result in significant change in nuclear or cytosolic APE1 content (data not shown). These observations suggest a possibility that GSNO could stimulate nuclear-to-cytoplasmic translocation of APE1 in HepG2 cells. To further confirm this phenomenon, HA-APE1 expression vector was transiently transfected into HEK293 cells together with GFP-fused XRCC1, another DNA-repair-related protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), and the subcellular distribution of APE1 was analyzed by immunofluorescence with anti-HA antibody. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, the transfected APE1 was absolutely localized in the nucleus in the untreated cells. However, treatment of cells with 1&#x02009;mM GSNO for 4&#x02009;h resulted in a clear translocation of APE1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In contrast, the intra-nuclear localization of GFP-XRCC1 could not be affected by GSNO at all. A similar phenomenon was also observed in COS-7 cells (data not shown). Thus, it is suggested that GSNO selectively induced cytosolic translocation of APE1 but not all the nuclear proteins. To determine whether the GSNO-induced nuclear exclusion of APE1 was time or dose dependent, we stimulated the cells with 1&#x02009;mM GSNO for different time. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C shows, consistent with the endogenous APE1 in HepG2 cells, transfected APE1 time-dependently translocated into the cytosol in response to GSNO stimulation. About 60% of transfected APE1 was completely expelled to the cytoplasm within 4&#x02009;h. It was also observed that GSNO induced nuclear export of APE1 in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment with up to 1&#x02009;mM GSNO exerted the most significant effect on APE1 translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D). To know whether GSNO-induced intracellular redistribution of APE1 was attributed to the synthesis of new proteins, CHX, a protein synthesis inhibitor, was used. It turned out that CHX could not prevent GSNO-induced APE1 nuclear export (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). </p><p>Most proteins that undergo nucleocytoplasmic trafficking depend on the nuclear export receptor CRM1 for nuclear export. It was speculated in a recent report that APE1 probably bore a CRM1-dependent nuclear export sequence (NES) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). To test whether GSNO-induced nuclear export of APE1 was associated with the CRM1 pathway, HEK293 cells transfected with HA-APE1 were pre-incubated with LMB, a CRM1-specific inhibitor, and then stimulated with GSNO. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B showed that LMB failed to prevent GSNO-induced nuclear export of APE1. As a parallel control, LMB treatment markedly induced nuclear accumulation of transfected GFP-I&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C), whose nuclear export is dependent on CRM1 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). Therefore, this result indicated that the nuclear export of APE1 induced by GSNO may be not via a classical CRM1-dependent pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>S-nitrosation of APE1&#x02009;at cysteines 93 and 310 controlled its nuclear-cytosolic shuttling</title><p>S-nitrosation, as a post-translational modification, has been implicated in nitric-oxide-elicited multiple cellular effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). To investigate the possibility that GSNO-induced nuclear export of APE1 is regulated by nitrosation modification, we first examined whether transfected HA-APE1 could be S-nitrosated using the biotin-switch assay, in which all the S-nitrosated cysteines can be specifically identified on Western blots after replacing -SNO with a more stable biotin group by chemical reduction with ascorbate, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, treatment of HEK293 cells with 1&#x02009;mM GSNO for 4&#x02009;h significantly induced HA-APE1 S-nitrosation. In contrast, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment did not induce such modification (data not shown), indicating the specificity of this method. To further confirm this modification, the cells were stimulated with GSNO for 4&#x02009;h, followed by DTT or NAC for another 2&#x02009;h. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, the S-nitrosated form of APE1 was totally eliminated. Since both DTT and NAC have been reported to denitrosylate target proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>), these observations suggested that S-nitrosation of APE1 was a reversible process. Furthermore, we did observe that the endogenous APE1 could be effectively S-nitrosated in multiple cell types including HepG2, Eahy926, SH-SY5Y and RAW264.7 cells (unpublished data). </p><p>In the next series of experiments, we sought to identify the specific sites of APE1 S-nitrosation. APE1 contains seven cysteine amino acid residues, three of which, including Cys65, Cys93 and Cys310, are redox-sensitive. The Cys65 and Cys93 residues are located within the redox-active domain, and Cys65 has been speculated to be the redox-active site in the regulation of transcription factor activity. The Cys310 residue resides in the endonuclease domain, and its oxidative modification has been implicated in regulation of the DNA-repair function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). For this reason, we hypothesize that the three redox-sensitive cysteines were the potential targets of APE1 S-nitrosation. We first developed three single-point mutants APE1(C65S), APE1(C93S) and APE1(C310S), and used the biotin-switch method to test for their nitrosation. As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, D and E, mutation of a single residue of the three cysteines to serine could not eliminate GSNO-induced APE1 S-nitrosation in transfected HEK293 cells. Consistently, PNRI-299, an APE1 Cys65 site blocker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), could not affect APE1 nitrosation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). These data suggested that there may be more than one cysteine to be S-nitrosated. To test this hypothesis, we simultaneously mutated the Cys93 and Cys310 to serines. Interestingly, simultaneous mutation of Cys93 and Cys310 (the mutant was named &#x0201c;2CS&#x0201d;) completely prevented GSNO-induced APE1 nitrosation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>F), although mutation of either one had no discernible effect. To further confirm the result, we subsequently examined whether mutation of all the three cysteines could affect the nitrosation of APE1. As expected, similar to the APE1 (2CS), the triple mutant APE1 (3CS) was refractory to NO-elicited nitrosation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>F). Taken together, these results indicated that both Cys93 and Cys310 of APE1 were S-nitrosated targets in vivo.</p><p>To explore the possibility that S-nitrosation modification may determine the nuclear export of APE1, we examined the effects of DTT and NAC on GSNO-induced APE1 nuclear-cytosolic translocation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, both DTT and NAC could effectively reverse the GSNO-induced nuclear export of APE1, which was consistent with their effects on APE1 S-nitrosation, suggesting that the nuclear export of APE1 may be an S-nitrosation-dependent reversible process. To exclude the possibility that GSNO-exerted regulatory effect on APE1 translocation was attributed to the outcome of unspecific oxidative stress, HEK293 cells expressing HA-APE1 were exposed to 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;M or 1&#x02009;mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> didn't cause marked nuclear export of APE1 as GSNO did (the data obtained with 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;M H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was not shown). This observation indicated that the cytosolic translocation of APE1 was attributed to its S-nitrosation rather than other oxidative modifications. To finally establish the causal relationship of APE1 S-nitrosation and its nuclear export, we examined the subcellular distributions of APE1 cysteine mutants in the presence of GSNO. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, mutation of Cys65 did not prevent, but instead slightly enhanced the GSNO-induced APE1 nuclear export. Mutation of either Cys93 or Cys310 could partially repress APE1 redistribution in response to GSNO stimulation. However, significantly, the S-nitrosation-deficient APE1 mutants, APE1 (2CS) and APE1 (3CS), remained in the nucleus irrespective of the presence of GSNO. Collectively, these observations clearly indicate that S-nitrosation of APE1 determined its nuclear export. </p></sec><sec><title>Two beta-strands in close proximity to Cys93 and Cys310 of APE1 were important for NO-induced conditional nuclear export</title><p>Except a flexible N-terminal 35-residues portion, APE1 forms a tight globular structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). In order to explain how NO-elicited nitrosation controlled nuclear export of APE1, we hypothesized that APE1 may undergo a conformational change upon S-nitrosation modification, which may lead to the exposure of a masked internal region that facilitates its nuclear export. For this consideration, we developed a series of N- and C-terminal-truncated APE1 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B), which were expected to unmask internal &#x02018;NES&#x02019;. All these mutants were expressed in HEK293 cells as C-terminal Myc fusion. Their proper expressions in HEK293 cells were confirmed by immunoblotting (supplementary Figure 1A), and their subcellular localizations were examined by immunofluorescence with anti-Myc antibody. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A shows, deletion of the N-terminal 43 residues of APE1, which contains the known NLS, effectively prevented APE1 from residing in the nucleus. Further deletion of N-terminal 123 residues led to complete nuclear exclusion of APE1. Interestingly, the mutants with their N-terminal 180, 206 and 249 aa deleted demonstrated a marked mitochondrial localization. The immunofluorescence images of these mutants were overlapped with the co-transfected Mito-GFP, a mitochondrial indicator (data not shown). Although Chattopadhyay <italic>et al</italic>. identified the mitochondrial-localized APE1 as an N-terminal 33 residues-truncated form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), the MTS of APE1 has not been mapped yet. Our work implied that the MTS is located in the C-terminal 69 amino residues of APE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). Interestingly, the MTS appears to be hidden by the N-terminal sequence of APE1 and, therefore, inaccessible to the protein surface, although the significance of the masked MTS is not known. Subsequently, to obtain the more direct information about the putative NES, the cellular localization of C-terminal-truncated mutants were investigated. Consistent with the full-length APE1, deletion of the C-terminal 13 aa did not alter the intra-nuclear distribution of APE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). However, surprisingly, further truncation up to N-terminal 122 aa resulted in a significant cytoplasmic distribution in addition to its nuclear localization. Interestingly, the cytosolic proportion of APE1 increased with the deletion of more C-terminal aa residues. Notably, the mutant APE1(1-80) containing N-terminal 80 aa residues showed the least nuclear staining. However, once the region containing the 64-80 aa residues was deleted, it was relocalized in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). Since the N-terminal 20 amino acids portion of APE1 contains NLS, these results indicated that the region (aa 64-80) might serve as an &#x02018;NES&#x02019; when it is sufficiently unmasked. Interestingly, treatment with LMB did not result in nuclear accumulation of APE1(1-80) (data not shown), suggesting that the &#x02018;NES&#x02019; may function in a CRM1-independent manner. In the next experiment, to evaluate the importance of the sequence (aa 64-80) in nitric-oxide-caused APE1 cytosolic translocation, we developed a mutant APE1(&#x00394;64-80), in which the potential NES region was deleted. Immunofluorescence experiment showed that this mutant completely lost the responsibility to GSNO-induced nuclear export (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). It should be pointed out that the APE1(&#x00394;64-80) mutant could slightly interfere with cell viability, while all of the other APE1 mutants we used did not show any discernible effects (supplementary Figure 1B). In some sense, this observation perhaps supported the functionality of the aa.64-80 region. </p><p>Is there the possibility that S-nitrosation of APE1 leads to the exposure of &#x0201c;NES&#x0201d;? Analysis of APE1 ternary structure revealed that the putative NES is composed of a part of beta-strand (B1) and a part of alpha-helix (H1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Interestingly, Cys93 is adjacent to B1, whereas Cys310 is linked to another B1-associated beta-strand (aa 311-316, referred to B2). In structure, B1 and B2 form an antiparellel beta-fold residing between Cys93 and Cys310 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D). To evaluate the importance of B2, we examined the intracellular localization of APE1(1-305) in the presence of GSNO. APE1(1-305) was chosen because it included neither Cys310 nor B2. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C showed that APE1(1-305) was rather insensitive to GSNO-induced nuclear export. Considering that APE1(C310S), the C310-inactive APE1 mutant, can still translocate to the cytosol in response to GSNO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B), we concluded that B2 was another region that may facilitate GSNO-induced export of APE1 from nucleus. Thus, both the &#x02018;NES&#x02019; and B2 beta-strand were critical for NO-elicited APE1 cytosolic translocation, and the S-nitrosation of Cys93 and Cys310 may result in a conformational change that facilitates the two beta-strands to function.</p></sec><sec><title>Nitric-oxide-repressed classical importin-dependent nuclear import pathway</title><p>The above experiments clearly indicated that S-nitrosation determined the nuclear export of APE1. However, even if APE1 could be effectively exported into the cytosol by GSNO, it is still likely to be reimported into the nucleus via the classical nuclear import pathway. In fact, we did observe a complete nuclear exclusion of APE1 in response to GSNO stimulation. It has been reported that the classical NLS nuclear import pathway could be impaired by certain stresses such as UV irradiation, heat shock and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). To address the issue whether nitric oxide was able to suppress the nuclear import of APE1, the subcellular distribution of APE1(1-64), which contains NLS but excludes most of its C-terminal portion, was examined in the presence of GSNO. Immunofluorescence experiment revealed that APE1(1-64) was dominantly localized in the nuclei of untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). However, once cells were challenged with 1&#x02009;mM GSNO for 4&#x02009;h, APE1(1-64) significantly accumulated in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A), suggesting that nitrosative stress may disrupt the nuclear import function of this mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Since nuclear import of APE1 involves a functional interaction between APE1 NLS and nuclear import receptor importin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), we next determined whether the impaired nuclear import of APE1(1-64) was due to the defect of importin transport system. Simian virus 40 NLS is an established substrate for the importin receptor; fusion of this NLS to double GFPs could target the latter into the nucleus via importin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). For this reason, we examined whether the nuclear import of SV40(NLS)-GFP-GFP could be repressed by nitric oxide. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, SV40(NLS)-GFP-GFP was predominantly localized in the nucleus after 40&#x02009;h transfection. However, when the cells were stimulated with 1&#x02009;mM GSNO for 4&#x02009;h, a markedly enhanced cytosolic fluorescence was observed. By comparison, GSNO treatment could hardly affect the nuclear localization of M9-GFP-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B), whose nuclear import is independent of the importin pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Thus, these observations indicated that the nuclear import efficiency of the classical NLS substrates was substantially decreased in the NO-insulted cells.</p><p>To exclude the possibility that the defect of importin nuclear import pathway could be totally responsible for GSNO-induced cytosolic translocation of APE1, APE1(43-318), which excludes NLS region but contains the intact APE1 globular structure, was employed. Indirect immunofluorescence showed a diffuse whole-cell distribution for this mutant, with a predominantly cytosolic staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C), indicating that a small proportion of APE1 molecules could diffuse into the nucleus in an NLS-independent manner. Surprisingly, the intra-nuclear APE1(43-318) could be totally exported into cytoplasm in the presence of GSNO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C). This result, together with previous observations that the NLS-containing APE1 mutants (2CS, 3CS, 1-305, and &#x00394;64-80) were refractory to GSNO-induced cytosolic translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A), and the fact that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, a functional importin inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>), cannot promote nuclear export of APE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A), strongly indicated that repression of nuclear import of APE1 was not sufficient for GSNO-induced nuclear export of APE1. Its contribution may lie in preventing cytosolic APE1 from retransporting into the nucleus.</p></sec><sec><title>HDAC2 and p50 antagonized GSNO-induced nuclear export of APE1</title><p>The above studies on the APE1 translocation were mainly based on APE1-overexpressed cell systems, in which the expression level of APE1 should be much higher than those of other proteins in cells. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate whether certain proteins could interfere with GSNO-induced APE1 nuclear export at physiologically comparable expression levels. For this consideration, the GSNO-induced APE1 nuclear export was reexamined by cotransfection of HA-APE1 with several established APE1-binding proteins, respectively. It was shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref> that, among the tested APE1-binding proteins, only p50 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>) and HDAC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), when overexpressed, respectively, could partially prevent GSNO-induced APE1 nuclear export. Other proteins including p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>), thioredoxin (Trx) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) and XRCC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>) had little effect. These data suggested that the nitric-oxide-regulated APE1 nuclear export may be a complicated and cellular-context-dependent process. </p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Post-translational protein modification is a crucial mechanism to regulate protein function in eukaryotic cells. Similar to other post-translational modifications, protein S-nitrosation exerts pleiotropic effects on its target proteins, ranging from altered protein stabilization to changed activity or function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Recently, Hara et al. reported that S-nitrosation mediated nuclear translocation of GAPDH. In the current investigation, we revealed that S-nitrosation mediated nuclear export of APE1. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that S-nitrosation modification is able to control protein nuclear export, although other post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>), ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>), sumoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>), acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>), and thiol modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>) have already been involved in such processes. For APE1, to date, the potential phosphorylation sites, acetylation sites, and granzyme A-cleavage sites have been well established, and the modification of these sites have been known to change APE1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>). However, the potential S-nitrosation sites of APE1 and the effect of this modification on APE1 have not been reported. Our finding also provided the first evidence that nitrosative stress regulated APE1 by subcellular translocation through S-nitrosation mechanism.</p><p>Strikingly, this inducible cytosolic translocation of APE1 is an NO-related phenomenon. Firstly, the nuclear export of APE1 was not sensitive to other oxidative stresses such as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A), which may cause a higher oxidative form of APE1, although the possibility has not been excluded that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> may act in a similar manner as NO in the regulation of APE1 trafficking in other unexamined cell types. In addition, GSNO selectively induced cytosolic translocation of APE1, but not other DNA-repair-related proteins such as XRCC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B) and thymine DNA glycosylase (data not shown). It should be pointed out that, although the APE1 nuclear export is specific to NO, the endogenous APE1 appears to show different sensitivities to NO-induced nuclear export among different cell types. Of note, the endogenous APE1 in human endothelial cells is strongly refractory to NO-induced nuclear export, although it can still be effectively S-nitrosated under the same circumstances (unpublished data).</p><p>Although the precise mechanism by which S-nitrosation controls nuclear export of APE1 is not clear, two anti-parallel beta-strands close to Cys93 and Cys310 were found to be critical for the nitrosation-mediated cytosolic translocation of APE1. Previous study revealed that phosphorylation of MK2 can result in intra-molecular de-masking of an NES and, therefore, mediate its nuclear export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). Therefore, the conformational change and &#x02018;NES&#x02019; exposure of APE1 caused by S-nitrosation modification can be expected in this study. We demonstrated that one of the beta-strands (B1) was functional, as the exposure of B1-containing sequence through C-terminal truncation could mediate protein cytosolic localization even in the presence of N-terminal NLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). The direct evidence about whether the C-terminal B2 strand is another NO-responsive &#x0201c;NES&#x0201d; has not been proved. However, either deletion of B2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C) or fusion of GFP to APE1&#x02009;at the B2 end (unpublished data) strongly repressed NO-stimulated nuclear export, suggesting that a proper conformational change of B2 may contribute to the NO-induced cytosolic translocation of APE1. B1 and B2 may cooperate with each other in mediating APE1 nuclear export. Alternately, they functioned independently, providing that the inter-strand interaction was disrupted as a result of APE1 S-nitrosation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). In addition, it should be emphasized that the nuclear export efficiency of APE1 was high, as a 4-h GSNO treatment almost led to a complete nuclear exclusion of APE1. This phenomenon may be attributed to NO-caused impaired nuclear import of APE1 that helped in preventing the already exported APE1 from reimporting into nucleus. Different from the APE1-overexpressed cell system, the nuclear-cytosolic shuttling of APE1 may be interfered by some of its binding proteins at normal physiological conditions. It is possible that the protein&#x02013;protein interactions can repress export of APE1 from nucleus to cytosol. HDAC2 and p50 proteins may act as such intra-nuclear gatekeepers for their ability to antagonize NO-induced APE1 trafficking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). The differential intra-nuclear levels of APE1-binding proteins may partly contribute to the cell-type-specific phenomena in APE1 nuclear export. Therefore, the NO-caused APE1 cytosolic translocation may be a complicated process, simultaneously involved in S-nitrosation of Cys93 and Cys310 leading to &#x0201c;NES&#x0201d; exposure, interaction of APE1 with other nuclear proteins and defect in importin nuclear import pathway. </p><p>In summary, we have reported here that nitric oxide controlled the nuclear export of APE1 through S-nitrosation of Cysteines 93 and 310, which described a novel link between the nitrosative stress and DNA repair/transcriptional regulation system. It has been reported that redox modification of Cys310 of APE1 can repress its AP endonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Thus, it is reasonable to expect that NO may exert influence on APE1 DNA repair function through nitrosation of this site. Unraveling the detailed mechanism by which S-nitrosation of APE1 controlled its nuclear export (such as whether a vehicle protein is required for the translocation) and revealing whether S-nitrosation of APE1 can affect its other biological functions present an exciting and relevant challenge for future research. Since NO and APE1 are connected to tumorigenesis and neurodegenerative diseases, the present findings will reasonably improve our understanding of how nitrosative stress leads to DNA damaging at the DNA-repair level and have the potential to yield therapeutic strategies to fight these diseases.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We particularly thank Drs.

APE1 carries an importin-dependent NLS at the N-terminal end (not shown). Two antiparellel beta-strands (B1 and B2) in close proximity to C93 and C310 are masked in the internal structure. In rested cells, APE1 resides in the nucleus due to the existence of NLS. Upon nitrosative stress, S-nitrosation of C93 and C310 contributes to unmasking of the B1 and/or B2 by changing conformation, which may facilitate the nuclear export of APE1 in a CRM1-independet manner (perhaps mediated by an unknown transport protein). At the same time, importin-dependent nuclear import pathway is repressed by NO insult, which may prevent the already exported cytosolic APE1 from re-import into the nucleus. However, once the intracellular environment becomes reductive (e.g. the increased reducing molecules such as DTT), both NO-elicited S-nitrosation of APE1 and NO-caused repression of importin can be abrogated; thus, the inducible nuclear export of APE1 by NO could be prevented or reversed.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkl1163f8"/></fig></sec></back></article>
