It was recently reported that the mammalian glucocorticoid receptor failed to activate transcription when transiently expressed in swi1-, swi2- or swi3- yeast strains. We report here that two highly related human cDNAs, hSNF2 alpha and -beta, encode amino acid sequences homologous to both the yeast SWI2/SNF2 and the Drosophila brahma. Similar to their yeast and Drosophila counterparts, both human cDNAs contain helicase motifs, a bromodomain, a highly charged C-terminal sequence and an N-terminal sequence rich in proline, glutamine and glycine. Tissue distribution of the mRNAs varied slightly. Transcriptional activation by the estrogen receptor and the retinoic acid receptor was enhanced by co-expression of either hSNF2 cDNA. No enhancement was observed for promoters which do not respond to nuclear receptors. We suggest that global transcriptional coactivators equivalent to the yeast SWI/SNF complex exist in mammalian cells.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00034-0044-a" xlink:role="1818"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00034-0044-b" xlink:role="1818"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00034-0041.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1815"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00034-0042.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1816"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00034-0043.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1817"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00034-0044.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1818"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00034-0045.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1819"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00034-0046.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1820"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
