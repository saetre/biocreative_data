Mutations in ABCG5 or ABCG8, comprising the sitosterolemia locus, <italic>STSL</italic>, are now known to cause this disease. Three in-bred strains of rats, WKY, SHR and SHRSP, are known to be sitosterolemic, hypertensive and they carry a missense 'mutation' in a conserved residue of Abcg5, Gly583Cys.

This disease has been mapped to a single locus, <italic>STSL</italic>, on human chromosome 2p21 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Mutations in both alleles of one of two genes, ABCG5 or ABCG8, that comprise this locus, are now known to cause this disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. No phytosterolemic patient with a single mutant ABCG5 allele and a mutant ABCG8 allele has been reported, suggesting these genes are not only linked physically, but their protein products may act as obligate heterodimers. ABCG5 and ABCG8 encode for sterolin-1 and sterolin-2 respectively. These genes are expressed in the liver, gall bladder and intestine and are implicated in determining biliary sterol excretion and selectivity of sterol absorption at the apical surfaces of the enterocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Studies in mice deficient for Abcg5 or Abcg8, as well as one that over-expresses these genes, have confirmed that sterolins may be the major determinants of biliary sterol secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Their role in preventing non-cholesterol sterol absorption in the intestine remains to be clarified.</p><p>Prior to the identification of the gene defects in sitosterolemia, the presence of sitosterolemia had been reported in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), although the molecular basis of this phenotype had not been investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Sitosterolemia, hemolysis (a feature also present in human sitosterolemia) and an increased mortality when fed certain plant oils (enriched in plant sterols) have also been reported in SHR and SHRSP rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The SHR, SHRSP and their 'parental' strain, WKY rats have now been shown to carry a homozygous G1757T alteration in Abcg5 that results in a Gly583Cys change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. All of these rat strains are also sitosterolemic. However, all of these rats are highly in-bred and have been maintained by brother-sister matings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. These rats are likely to carry a number of mutated genes as part of their genetic burden. At least 4 'mutated' loci are known to be part of this burden; Cd36 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], Srebp-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], Kat-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and Abcg5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Although the Gly583Cys affects a highly conserved residue (conserved from Fugu to Man) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], given the known genetic burden in the SHR line, it remains possible that genetic alterations at other loci may be responsible for the sitosterolemia. Support for this possibility has recently come from a quantitative trait genetic mapping study for sitosterolemia involving two mouse strains, C57Bl/6J and CASA/Rk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Although the plasma sitosterol level was genetically determined in these mouse strains, loci that accounted for this did not map to the murine <italic>STSL </italic>and thus other unidentified genes were hypothesized to be involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>We report here genetic and biochemical analyses of F2 rats from a SHR &#x000d7; SD cross to test the hypothesis that the Gly583Cys is responsible for the sitosterolemia. In addition, since hypertension is a known phenotype of the SHR and since feeding diets rich in plant sterols seem to decrease their life-span, we also investigated the possibility that this genetic change may also be important in playing a role in hypertension.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Segregation analyses of plasma cholesterol and plant sterols</title><p>To ensure there were no significant differences in growth curves of the F2 animals by Abcg5 genotype, body weights were measured serially and analyzed only after the genotypes had been determined at the end of the 14 weeks (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The genetic status at the <italic>STSL </italic>locus did not affect growth parameters. Blood from 14-week old F2 animals fed a chow diet was obtained after a 4 h fast and analyzed for cholesterol, as well as plant sterols, determined by GC analyses (see Methods). All sterol analyses were performed independent of the genotype analyses. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> shows the distribution of cholesterol (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) and sitosterol (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) in these animals. The distribution of cholesterol was slightly skewed to the right, with a mean cholesterol value of 59.5 mg/dl. The distribution of sitosterol was significantly right-skewed and suggested a bi-modal pattern.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Growth Curves of F2 mice. </bold>The body weights of male (top set of lines) and female (bottom set of lines) F2 rats were monitored with time. At 17 weeks, most of the male F2 animals were sacrificed, or were used to determine intestinal absorption (see Fig. 5). At 17 weeks, female F2 rats were placed on a more defined plant sterol diet and their drinking water substituted with 1% NaCl. No differences in body weight gains between any of the Abcg5 genotypes (wild-type, WT; heterozygous, HET and homozygous mutant, HMZ) were observed.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2156-6-40-1"/></fig><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Sterol distribution in F2 rats at 14 weeks age. </bold>Blood for sterol analyses by GC was drawn at 14 weeks age (see Methods).

Two investigators, each blinded to each other's results performed the genotype and sterol analyses separately. There were no significant differences in plasma cholesterol values between any of the genotypes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). All but two data points (highlighted in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) showed a robust segregation of homozygous inheritance of mutant alleles with elevated plant sterol levels. The two exceptions were a WT rat with an elevated plant sterol and a homozygous mutant rat that exhibited low levels of sitosterol. Unfortunately, the plant sterol levels were made available only after all of these animals had been sacrificed and it was not possible to re-sample the blood to re-confirm the plasma values, although archived DNA allowed us to confirm the genotypes. Thus an error in sample mis-identification could not be confirmed.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Plasma sterols as a function of Abcg5 genotypes. </bold>Cholesterol (panel A) and sitosterol (panel B) were segregated in all F2 animals by Abcg5 Gly583Cys.

It is also interesting to note that a small number of the heterozygous animals had plasma sitosterol, campesterol and total plant sterol values as high as those from rats homozygous for the Abcg5 mutation. All of these measurements were obtained on animals fed a chow diet and a diet challenge to distinguish between these various genotypes was not performed.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Segregation analyses of other plant sterols by genotype. </bold> Segregation of campesterol (panel A), its metabolite, campestanol (panel B), the metabolite of sitosterol, sitostanol (panel C), or total plant sterols (panel D) are as shown.

Although we attempted lymph duct cannulation in 30 animals, we obtained data in only 3 WT, 4 HET and 4 HMZ animals due to either a high mortality or unacceptable lymph flow. Lymphatic flow rates in successfully cannulated rats are shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>. There were no differences by genotype. Following a bolus delivery of radioactive cholesterol and triolein (see Methods), no differences were observed between WT, HET or HMZ rats for recovery of radioactivity in the lymph for either triglyceride or cholesterol (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A and B</xref>), suggesting that these pathways were relatively normal. Lymphatic recovery for absorption of sitosterol was not performed.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Intestinal lipid absorption in F2 rats. </bold>Male F2 rats had their lymph ducts cannulated as described (see Methods) and had lymph flow quantitiated to ensure adequate and stable flow (panel A).

There were no differences in the amounts of cholesterol present in the bile from any of the three genotypes (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). However, significantly more sitosterol was present in the bile of mutant rats compared to either HET or WT rats (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>), suggesting that the excretory pathways are functional and not affected by this mutation. Thus the increased plasma plant sterol levels were reflected by the increased biliary secretion.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Biliary cholesterol and sitosterol concentrations. </bold>Female F2 rats, on a defined sitosterol diet (see text) had their bile ducts cannulated and bile collected under gravity and analyzed for cholesterol (panel A) or sitosterol (panel B). No differences in the cholesterol content of bile were noted between any of the genotypes. Note that the concentration of cholesterol is approximately 50-fold more than sitosterol. Interestingly, the sitosterol concentration in the F2 HMZ rats was increased significantly by ~ 50% relative to WT and HET rats (panel B).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2156-6-40-6"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Effect of Abcg5 mutation on blood pressure</title><p>We used the tail-cuff measurement technique to monitor systolic blood pressure in these rats on a chow diet, with time.

Additionally, female rats at 17 weeks were placed on a defined sitosterol diet and fed 1% NaCl drinking water (see bar, panel B).

No differences in blood pressure were seen in any of the genotypes, nor was there a progressive increase in overall blood pressures recorded.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Sitosterolemia is a rare autosomal recessive inherited metabolic disorder of man that results in the accumulation on non-cholesterol sterols from the diet and is associated with premature coronary heart disease, hemolytic anemia and the formation of tendon and tuberous xanthomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The genetic defect(s) has now been mapped and identified. Mutations in one of two genes organized in tandem on human chromosome 2p21, ABCG5 or ABCG8, cause this defect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. As part of the literature survey, we observed that elevations of plant sterols had been reported in rats commonly used for hypertension and stroke research, WKY, SHR and SHRSP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Interestingly, a number of studies had reported previously that alteration in diets not only increased the hemolysis associated with the presence of sitosterol in these rats, but had a dramatic effect on life-expectancy as well as led to an increase in hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Thus SHRSP rats fed canola or soy-bean oils supplemented with phytosterols led to a significantly shortened life-span relative to oils low in plant sterols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Other investigators have reported the association of hypertension in these rat strains when fed diets supplemented with sitosterol, suggesting that hypertension may be modified by plant sterol accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Examination of SHR, SHRSP and WKY rats showed that these rats carried a homozygous missense in Abcg5, Gly583Cys, affecting a residue that shows conservation from Fugu to Man, despite the relative conservative change with respect to the amino acids involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. At present, there are no control strains for WKY, SHR or SHRSP, since these strains have been maintained by brother-sister matings for &#x0003e;80 generations. Additionally, some of these strains have been maintained by different investigators for several generations raising the possibility that there may also be sub-strain variations between different colonies. Although these strains have been used extensively in genetic analyses of hypertension and a number of loci mapped for this trait, none of these loci map to the rat <italic>STSL </italic>locus on chromosome 6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In a literature search of genetic changes reported for these strains, we were able to compile at least 3 other loci that are mutated in the SHR strain (Cd36, Srebp-1 and Kat-2), suggesting the possibility that the missense 'mutation' identified in Abcg5 is not causative for sitosterolemia (which is also moderate in comparison to levels seen in patients with sitosterolemia who have levels frequently &#x0003e;15 mg/dl), but associated as a result of the in-breeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Additionally, a murine QTL study of plasma sitosterol levels showed that plant sterol levels were strongly influenced genetically, but mapping studies showed that this trait did not map to the murine <italic>STSL </italic>on chromosome 17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], raising the possibility that other loci/factors may be involved. Finally, in a study involving the GH and Norwegian Brown rat strains (neither of which are sitosterolemic), a QTL for hypertension was mapped to the region encompassing the rat STSL. However, we sequenced the rat <italic>STSL </italic>in both of these strains and did not identify any differences, suggesting that variations at the <italic>STSL </italic>in the rat may not be contributing to the hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. We therefore undertook this study to test the hypothesis that the Gly583Cys was causative for sitosterolemia. We also measured blood pressure to test the hypothesis that this mutation was responsible for contributing to an elevation in blood pressure in these affected strains.</p><p>Segregation analyses in a large F2 population (SHR &#x000d7; SD) showed that homozygosity for Gly583Cys segregated with elevated plasma plant sterol levels in all but two animals. Of these latter animals, we could not verify that the samples had been inadvertently mis-labeled, as we could not repeat plasma analysis as the animals had been sacrificed before the plant sterol analyses were available. If we exclude these animals, all animals that are homozygous for the Gly583Cys are also sitosterolemic on a rodent chow diet, proving that this genetic change was responsible for the elevation in dietary non-cholesterol sterols.</p><p>We also tracked blood pressures, using tail cuff measurements, in all weaned animals for up to 4 months. No differences in blood pressures by genotype were observed in these F2 animals. In a sub-study, at ~ 4 months, female rats were switched to a more defined diet that had a higher level of plant sterols (300 mg/kg compared to ~ 130 mg/kg in most rodent chow preparations). This was done as normal rodent chow is known to lead to variable sterol absorption. Additionally, the rats were given drinking water supplemented with 1% NaCl to increase any manifestation of hypertension. Despite these interventions, rats homozygous for the Gly583Cys change did not show any significant increases in hypertension, relative to wild-type or heterozygous animals. Thus, in our study, we could not demonstrate an increase in blood pressures, contrary to other published data. There are several explanations for this discrepant finding. Firstly, our animals are F2 animals and since a number of loci are implicated in the hypertension phenotype, these should segregate independently of the <italic>STSL </italic>locus (except for one QTL for hypertension identified in the GH &#x000d7; BN experiment, but not reported for crosses involving SHR). Secondly, the levels of plant sterols we employed in our dietary studies are considerably less than used by others. In almost all of the studies reported where the exact amount of plant sterols were reported, these have been almost 10-fold or more higher than those used in our current study. Our justification for not using such large quantities is that it is unlikely such intakes reflect amounts that would be normally consumed and thus may not be 'physiological'. Thirdly, the blood pressure measurements were undertaken in animals fed plain drinking water and in all of the reported studies where hypertension was monitored, supplementation with a high salt intake (in water, diet or both) has been used. Finally, the majority of studies using higher plant sterols also used increase plant oils as well and the effect of these on altering the phenotype is not easy to discern.</p><p>We are aware of the limitations of the tail-cuff technique for blood pressure determinations and subtle, but significant differences, in blood pressure may have been masked by the use of this technique. Our data indicate that variations at the <italic>STSL </italic>locus may not be responsible for major effects in contributing to blood pressure. Any subtle effects will need to be explored in rat strains that are congenic for Gly583Cys on either the SHR or SD backgrounds.</p><p>Although the Gly583Cys change affects an amino acid residue that is conserved from Fugu to Man in Abcg5, this amino acid substitution is a relatively conservative change, with no both amino acids being aliphatic and small. To delineate possible mechanisms by which this genetic change altered dietary sterol trafficking, we compared intestinal absorption for cholesterol and triglyceride, using lymphatic duct cannulation studies. These showed that neither cholesterol absorption, nor triglyceride absorption (digestion, uptake, re-synthesis and secretion) were affected by this change. Note that patients with sitosterolemia, mutated in Abcg8, have been reported to manifest hyper-absorption of cholesterol, as well as plant sterols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Unfortunately, sitosterol absorption was not determined at the same time, as these studies were performed by a core (PT, University of Cincinnati) not routinely using sitosterol. Biliary excretion of cholesterol and sitosterol was unaffected by the Gly583Cys alterations, although the homozygous mutant F2 rats showed increased amounts of plant sterols in their bile. Thus, although not definitive, this mutation may cause an increase in the intestinal absorption of non-cholesterol sterols, leading to increased plasma concentrations. Despite an increase in biliary secretion, a small net retention may result, accounting for the sitosterolemia. In this context, it should be pointed out that the levels of sitosterolemia observed in these rats are considerably lower than those seen in patients with sitosterolemia. Future experiments, using congenic mice and lymph duct cannulation will allow us to examine this hypothesis and delineate pathophysiology of this missense mutation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We report here segregation analyses that prove that the Gly583Cys alteration identified in WKY, SHR and SHRSP strains is causative for sitosterolemia, that this alteration may not be a significant contributor to the hypertension phenotype, and that it may be causing sitosterolemia by primarily increasing intestinal absorption on non-cholesterol sterols. Our study also highlights the need to develop lines congenic for the missense mutation on an SD background and the wild-type residue on the SHR background to allow for the study of Abcg5 function on its role in the diet-induced decrease in longevity in these hypertensive strains.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animal breeding and husbandry</title><p>The Animal Care and Use Committee of Medical University of South Carolina approved all animal protocols. Inbred SHR (SHR/NCrlBR) rats and outbred CD<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>(SD) IGS BR rats were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (CRL, Wilmington, MA). Animals were housed 2&#x02013;3 rats/cage in a temperature-controlled room (22 &#x000b1; 2&#x000b0;C) with a 12-hour light/dark cycle and fed Teklad Sterilized Rodent Diet (W) 8656 (Harlan, Madison, WI) with free access to water. To produce F1 progeny, (1 male and 1 female) SHR and (1 male and 1 female) SD were cross-mated and the F1 resultant progeny randomly mated (4 breeding pairs) to produce 103 F2 progeny. All F2 animals were fed standard rodent chow and had free access to water. At 17 weeks of age, female rats were fed a high sitosterol diet (sitosterol, 300 mg/kg and cholesterol, 150 mg/kg, Harlan Teklad diet) and their drinking water supplemented with 1% Sodium chloride for 6 weeks. Males were shipped to University of Cincinnati (PT lab) for lymph duct cannulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Blood pressure and body weight measurements</title><p>Blood pressure (BP) was measured in the warmed, conscious, restrained state by using the photoelectric oscillometric tail-cuff method using a Natsume KN-210 machine (Natsume Seisakusho Co.

At each time point, at least 10 readings were obtained for each rat and the average of the readings taken. Body weights were recorded after each BP measurement. All data were accumulated independent of the genotype data.</p></sec><sec><title>Genotyping</title><p>Blood samples were drawn at 14 weeks of age from all rats.

Total plant sterols included campestanol, campesterol, sitostanol and sitosterol. Campestanol and sitostanol are 5-dihydro derivatives of campesterol and sitosterol. Sterol analyses and genotype analyses were performed independently and only after completion of both were results linked.</p></sec><sec><title>Intestinal absorption</title><p>The intestinal lymph duct was cannulated using a clear vinyl tubing (o.d., 0.8 mm) according to the method of Bollman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The second soft silicone tubing (o.d., 1.6 mm) was installed in the stomach through the fundus into the duodenum and secured with a purse-string suture. A purse-string suture (6-0 silk) and cyanoacrylate glue were used to secure the duodenal infusion tube. The gastroduodenal and lymph duct tubes were externalized through the right flank of the rat to allow easy access for infusion and collection. The skin, abdominal musculature and peritoneal layers were closed in a single layer (4-0 silk). The rats were kept in restraining cages at an ambient temperature of 30&#x000b0;C and allowed to recover from the anesthesia. The next morning, a lipid emulsion containing 6 &#x003bc;mol of <sup>3</sup>H-triolein, 0.78 &#x003bc;mol of <sup>14</sup>C-cholesterol, 0.87 &#x003bc;mol of egg phosphatidylcholine, and 5.7 &#x003bc;mol of sodium taurocholate (19 mM) in 1.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 6.4) was infused at 1.5 ml/h for 6 h. Lymph was collected 1 h before the lipid infusion (fasting) and then hourly for 6 h. The volume of collected lymph was measured by weighting.
