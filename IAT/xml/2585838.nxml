Although implied, the role of the major vertebrate DSB repair pathway, nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), in CSR has been controversial. By somatic gene targeting of DNA ligase IV (Lig4; a key component of NHEJ) in a B cell line (CH12F3) capable of highly efficient CSR in vitro, we found that NHEJ is required for efficient CSR. Disruption of the Lig4 gene in CH12F3 cells severely inhibits the initial rate of CSR and causes a late cell proliferation defect under cytokine stimulation. However, unlike V(D)J recombination, which absolutely requires NHEJ, CSR accumulates to a substantial level in Lig4-null cells. The data revealed a fast-acting NHEJ and a slow-acting alterative end joining of switch region breaks during CSR.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are considered by many to be the most severe form of DNA damage, and are repaired by either homologous recombination or nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). NHEJ is the primary DSB repair pathway in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). A characteristic feature of NHEJ is the lack of long stretches of homology at the site of joining (junction), although a few base pairs of microhomology (nucleotides that can be assigned to either of the two DNA ends) are seen at 10&#x02013;40% of junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). The core components of the NHEJ pathway have been well characterized over the last decade. These include DNA end-binding complex Ku70&#x02013;Ku80, DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs), Artemis, and the ligase complex x-ray cross complementation (XRCC) 4&#x02013;DNA ligase IV (Lig4). Several accessory factors, including an XRCC4-like factor (known as XLF or Cernunnos) and polymerases &#x003bc; and &#x003bb;, were identified in the following years. However, when NHEJ is disrupted by mutations to its core components, many forms of DSBs can still be joined, suggesting the existence of an alternative route for end joining.</p><p>During lymphocyte development, physiological DSBs arise as critical intermediates in V(D)J and class switch recombination (CSR). V(D)J recombination is a site-specific DNA recombination that assembles the antigen-binding domain of Ig and T cell receptor genes. The RAG protein complex recognizes recombination signal sequences (RSS) next to the V, D, or J coding segments and cleaves the DNA at the RSS-coding sequence junction. A concerted cleavage of a pair of RSS generates four DNA ends that are joined to form a coding joint and a signal joint, respectively. CSR changes the constant domain of the Ig heavy chain, which allows a B cell to switch from expressing IgM to another isotype (IgG, IgA, or IgE). CSR is directed by kilobase-long repetitive switch regions (S&#x003bc;, S&#x003b3;, S&#x003b1;, and S<italic>&#x003b5;</italic>) lying upstream of each constant region and requires activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID). The preponderant experimental evidence is consistent with a cut-and-paste mechanism in a way similar to that of V(D)J recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). First, the deleted region is circularized before its disposal. Second, DSBs were detected in switching B cells by ligation-mediated PCR. Third, phosphorylated histone H2AX (a marker for chromosomal breaks) foci were detected in switching B cells at the IgH locus in an AID-dependent manner. Finally, switch junctions show little or no homology, consistent with direct joining of switch region breaks through NHEJ. Although the exact mechanism for switch region breaks remains unclear, the current view is that AID catalyzes cytidine deamination (converts cytidines to uracils) in the switch regions, followed by the repair of uracils that ultimately results in DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to V(D)J recombination, which absolutely requires NHEJ, direct testing of the role of NHEJ in CSR has met with considerable challenge. One obvious obstacle is that NHEJ-deficient animals cannot generate mature lymphocytes necessary for a CSR assay because the V(D)J recombination defect blocks T and B cell development. To circumvent the developmental block on B cells, <italic>Ku</italic>- or <italic>DNA-PKcs</italic>&#x02013;deficient mice have been crossed with mice harboring preassembled Ig heavy and light chain genes to generate monoclonal NHEJ-deficient B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). By this method, CSR was found completely abolished in the absence of Ku70 or Ku80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). However, this conclusion must be interpreted with caution, because Ku may have non-NHEJ&#x02013;related functions (e.g., telomere maintenance) and <italic>Ku</italic> deficiency causes defective cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). As for <italic>DNA-PKcs</italic>, controversial results were obtained between a point mutation that inactivates <italic>DNA-PKcs</italic> and a complete deletion of the gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). Although catalytically inactive DNA-PKcs allows normal CSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>), deletion of the <italic>DNA-PKcs</italic> gene inhibited CSR to all isotypes except IgG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). A caveat of this approach is that there are no T cells in the B cell&#x02013;reconstituted mice. As a result, these mice have greatly reduced B cell numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>) and the B cells are inactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). The importance of T cell regulation was demonstrated by a later study showing restored CSR in <italic>DNA-PKcs</italic>&#x02013;null mice upon T cell transplantation from a B cell&#x02013;deficient host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to <italic>Ku</italic> and <italic>DNA-PKcs</italic>, <italic>XRCC4</italic> and <italic>Lig4</italic> have no identified function outside NHEJ and their inactivation results in the most severe form of NHEJ deficiency. Therefore, <italic>XRCC4</italic> and <italic>Lig4</italic> are the most suitable and specific targets for abolishing NHEJ. However, the B cell reconstitution strategy is not feasible for <italic>XRCC4</italic> or <italic>Lig4</italic> because deletion of either gene in mice results in embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). Although p53 deficiency can extend the life of <italic>XRCC4</italic> and <italic>Lig4</italic> knockout mice, they all succumb to pro&#x02013;B cell lymphomas shortly after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Recently, two independent studies used conditional knockout methods to delete <italic>XRCC4</italic> in mature B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). Both studies found that CSR was reduced but not abolished in the absence of <italic>XRCC4</italic>. It is known that <italic>XRCC4</italic>-deficient cells have a very low level of Lig4. However, it was also reported that even a very low level of Lig4 is still sufficient for NHEJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>).</p><p>To unequivocally determine the role of NHEJ in CSR while avoiding the complications associated with some of the animal models, we disrupted the <italic>Lig4</italic> gene in a B cell line (CH12F3) capable of highly efficient cytokine-induced CSR in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Like its parental line CH12.LX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>), CH12F3 has a mostly stable diploid genome and is thus suitable for gene targeting. We chose to disrupt the <italic>Lig4</italic> gene not only because of its central role in NHEJ but also because it is dispensable for somatic cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). We found that deletion of <italic>Lig4</italic> in CH12F3 cells mildly reduced CSR after 3 d of cytokine stimulation, which is qualitatively and quantitatively similar to what was observed with <italic>XRCC4</italic>-deficient B cells, as well as the <italic>Lig4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> p53<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). However, we also found a proliferation defect of <italic>Lig4</italic>-null CH12F3 cells in the presence of cytokine stimulation. This led us to another important finding that the initial rate of CSR is severely inhibited in <italic>Lig4</italic>-null cells. Thus, the initially observed mild reduction appears to be an underestimation of a marked CSR defect, which is masked by an enrichment of switched cells. These observations reveal the kinetics of a fast-acting NHEJ and a slow-acting alternative end joining during CSR.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Gene targeting of the <italic>Lig4</italic> gene in CH12F3 cells</title><p><italic>Lig4</italic> is essential for mouse embryo development but dispensable for somatic cell growth. To determine the role of <italic>Lig4</italic> in CSR, we disrupted the <italic>Lig4</italic> gene on both alleles in CH12F3 cells. Mouse Lig4 has a total of 911 amino acids. The entire coding sequence is located within the second exon. We replaced 78% of the <italic>Lig4</italic> coding region with a floxed puromycin marker (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). The deleted region encodes amino acids 220&#x02013;911, which contain the catalytic domain and the two BRCT motifs.

One of these was randomly selected for gene targeting of the second allele. First, the puromycin marker was excised by the Cre-LoxP reaction (designated L4 &#x0002b;/&#x00394;). Then, the same targeting vector was used again to disrupt the second allele. One correctly targeted clone (designated L4 P/&#x00394;) was obtained from a total of 34 puromycin-resistant clones (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p>Because NHEJ deficiency is known to result in cellular hypersensitivity to DSB-inducing agents such as ionizing radiation and bleomycin, we tested the <italic>Lig4</italic>-null CH12F3 cells for this property.

Then, L4 &#x00394;/&#x00394; cells were infected with recombinant retroviruses expressing the mouse <italic>Lig4</italic> or control virus made from the empty vector.

As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>, <italic>Lig4</italic> virus&#x02013;transduced cells had restored normal levels of CSR, but the cells transduced with the control virus did not.</p></sec><sec><title>Altered kinetics of CSR in <italic>Lig4</italic>-null cells</title><p>Because CSR is regulated by cell division, we analyzed the effect of <italic>Lig4</italic> deletion on cell proliferation. <italic>Lig4</italic>-null CH12F3 cells propagated normally without cytokine stimulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, left). However, slower propagation of <italic>Lig4</italic>-null cells was detected at 48 and 72 h in the presence of cytokines (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, right). To distinguish whether this was caused by a reduced proliferation rate or increased cell death, we stained the cells with CFSE and monitored cell divisions through the passive dilution of CFSE. Although the CFSE fluorescence profiles of <italic>Lig4</italic>-heterozygous and <italic>Lig4</italic>-null cells completely overlap in the absence of cytokines (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>, left column), a shift toward brighter CFSE was observed for <italic>Lig4</italic>-null cells in the presence of cytokines at 48 and 72 h (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>, right column), indicating reduced proliferation. We next analyzed cell death using FITC-conjugated annexin V and propidium iodide (PI), which stain early apoptotic and dead cells, respectively. No significant difference in apoptosis or cell death was observed for the two genotypes in the absence of cytokines (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). However, an increase of apoptosis or cell death was observed in <italic>Lig4</italic>-null culture in the presence of cytokines at 48 and 72 h (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>).

Two possible mechanisms could account for the reduction of CSR in the absence of Lig4. One possibility is that Lig4 affects cell proliferation in a way unrelated to NHEJ, which in turn affects CSR. The other explanation is that Lig4 is essential for efficient repair of switch region breaks. Without Lig4, accumulation of switch region breaks cause cell-cycle arrest, which is manifested as a cell proliferation defect. If the former were true, CSR level between the two genotypes (L4 &#x0002b;/&#x00394; vs. P/&#x00394;) should be similar at 24 h, as cell proliferation is apparently the same (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, right). However, if the latter were true, CSR difference between the two genotypes (L4 &#x0002b;/&#x00394; vs. P/&#x00394;) should be more significant at the beginning before the elimination of CSR-failed cells (and the enrichment of switched cells).</p><p>To distinguish these two possibilities, a time course of CSR was performed. A representative experiment is shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref> (left). Although the numerical value of CSR varies slightly in different experiments, the relative ratio of CSR between the two genotypes (L4 &#x0002b;/&#x00394; vs. P/&#x00394;) is consistent. At 24, 48, and 72 h, CSR of the <italic>Lig4</italic>-null cell was at 13, 29, and 48%, respectively, of that of the <italic>Lig4</italic>-heterozygous cell (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>, right). Continued subculturing (&#x0003e;7 d) of <italic>Lig4</italic>-null cells in the presence of cytokines eventually led to &#x0223c;80&#x02013;90% of the wild-type CSR level (unpublished data). CH12F3 cells grow rapidly in culture with an estimated doubling time of &#x0223c;8&#x02013;10 h. Seeding at a very low density is necessary to achieve maximum levels of CSR without subculturing. However, this condition is less optimal for accurately measuring the initial rate of CSR. Therefore, we also seeded the cells at 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml (early log phase) and measured CSR after 24 h. Again, a marked reduction of CSR in <italic>Lig4</italic>-null cells was observed (15% of wild-type level; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>, right) despite a comparable rate of cell proliferation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>, left). Thus, the optimal rate of CSR requires Lig4 regardless of stimulation conditions.</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Lig4 affects the rate of CSR.</bold> (A, left) A representative time course of CSR between <italic>Lig4</italic>-heterozygous and <italic>Lig4</italic>-null cells.

The small endpoint reduction observed initially is likely an underestimation of a marked CSR defect, which is probably masked by an enrichment of IgA cells that have managed to repair their switch region breaks through alternative end joining. Nevertheless, in the absence of NHEJ, alternative end joining can effectively repair switch region breaks, albeit at a substantially slower rate.</p></sec><sec><title>Switch junction sequences</title><p>Numerous studies have shown increased use of microhomology at the junctions in NHEJ-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). To determine whether switch junctions in <italic>Lig4</italic>-null cells are microhomology mediated, we cloned and sequenced S&#x003bc;&#x02013;S&#x003b1; junctions from stimulated <italic>Lig4</italic>-heterozygous and <italic>Lig4</italic>-null cells. Because S&#x003b1; is highly homologous to S&#x003bc;, we chose to PCR amplify switch junctions from individual cell clones. Cloning individual switch junctions instead of amplifying from a pool of cells helps to eliminate false junctions produced by template switching of stalled PCR intermediates, as well as the bias against large amplicons. In addition, the distinctive size of each PCR product was used to reference the authenticity of the sequenced junction. We found that 27% of the junctions from <italic>Lig4</italic>-heterozygous cells were direct joins, but there were none for the <italic>Lig4</italic>-null cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>).

The mild endpoint reduction of CSR in <italic>Lig4</italic>-null CH12F3 cells is in agreement with two recent studies using a conditional knockout of <italic>XRCC4</italic> in mature B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). However, our study differs from those two regarding cell proliferation under cytokine stimulation. We found a reduced proliferation of <italic>Lig4</italic>-null cells at the late stage of stimulation, which was not obvious in the two <italic>XRCC4</italic> studies. Our observation would argue for a dominant role of NHEJ in CSR, whereas others would argue for the robustness of the alternative end joining. It should be noted that in one of the studies, deletion of XRCC4 is incomplete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). In the other study, cell proliferation was measured on a <italic>p53</italic>-deficient background, which lacks the proper cell-cycle checkpoint control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>).</p><p>Although alternative NHEJ can efficiently join linearized plasmids, it clearly cannot replace NHEJ for V(D)J recombination or cellular resistance to ionizing radiation. One speculation has been that alternative end joining is not optimized for repair chromosomal breaks, which is not applicable in this case. Another view is that DSBs are repaired in a manner reflecting how they are generated. It is widely believed that the strict dependence of V(D)J recombination on NHEJ stems from the active guidance of the RAG proteins in the postcleavage complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). Indeed, fusion of the RAG proteins to the I-Sce I endonuclease can direct I-Sce I breaks solely to NHEJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). On the other hand, certain <italic>RAG</italic> mutations can significantly alleviate the dependence of V(D)J recombination on NHEJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). Therefore, the flexibility of using alternative end joining in CSR might originate from the complete accessibility of AID-initiated breaks. Interestingly, a single I-Sce I break engineered at an acceptor switch region can efficiently support CSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>), strongly suggesting that CSR does not require the type of synaptic complex presumed to exist in V(D)J recombination.</p><p>Alternative end joining was found to excessively use microhomology. Because all switch regions are abundant in conserved pentamer sequences (e.g., GAGCT and GGG<underline>G/C</underline>T; underlining indicates one nucleotide position), these short sequences could potentially serve as homology blocks and promote the utilization of alternative end joining. Indeed, there was a marked shift toward microhomology-mediated joining in <italic>Lig4</italic>-null cells. The most remarkable observation was that there was no direct join in the absence of <italic>Lig4</italic>. This is in complete agreement with what has been observed for S&#x003bc;&#x02013;S&#x003b3; junctions in <italic>XRCC4</italic>-deficient mouse B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>) and in human patients harboring hypomorphic <italic>Lig4</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>).</p><p>Mammalian cells have three ATP-dependent DNA ligases (Lig1, 3, and 4). As a dedicated DSB repair enzyme, The Lig4 complex (XLF&#x02013;XRCC4&#x02013;Lig4) has a remarkable flexibility of joining blunt, compatible, and incompatible ends, and even ligating across a gap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). In contrast, Lig1 and Lig3 are considered as nick ligases. However, recent studies have shown that Lig3 is also capable of intermolecular ligation of blunt and short compatible ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). Although the exact architecture of alternative end joining remains unclear, biochemical evidence has suggested the XRCC1&#x02013;Lig3 complex as a primary candidate for the ligation step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). Disruption of <italic>Lig3</italic> or <italic>XRCC1</italic> in mice causes embryonic lethality, thereby limiting their genetic characterizations in alternative end joining. However, Lig3 deficiency might not be cellularly lethal given that XRCC1-deficient cells are viable. In this regard, somatic gene targeting of <italic>Lig3</italic> might be a suitable way of dissecting the role of alternative end joining in CSR, as well as DSB repair in general in mammalian cells.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Cell culture and CSR assay.</title><p>CH12F3 cells were obtained from T.
