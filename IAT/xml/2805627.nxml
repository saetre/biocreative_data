The targeted mutation of <italic>Runx2 </italic>or <italic>Osterix</italic>, transcription regulators highly expressed in osteoblast progenitors, result in the lack of mature osteoblasts, demonstrating that these factors are essential for osteoblastogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Several studies have shown that cell fate commitment within the osteoblast lineage requires sequential, stage-specific, <italic>Ihh </italic>and canonical Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling to promote osteoblastic, and also to block chondrogenic, differentiation programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Another recent report shows that the inhibitory effect of <italic>Sox9 </italic>on osteoblastic and chondrocyte maturation via repression of <italic>Runx2 </italic>function is an essential mechanism for osteochondroprogenitor cell fate determination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Most bones are formed by endochondral ossification in which mesenchymal condensations differentiate into chondrocytes, forming a cartilaginous template prefiguring the future skeletal elements.

In our microarray screening aiming to identify novel molecular pathways in chondrocyte differentiation, we identified a novel gene encoding a transmembrane protein, which is predominantly expressed in osteoblasts during mouse development.

Knockdown of <italic>obif </italic>suppresses osteoblastic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells. We also present data demonstrating that the extracellular domains of both mouse and human obif proteins augment osteoblastic differentiation-induction activity, suggesting that obif acts in a ligand-like manner. Together, our results suggest that <italic>obif </italic>is involved in the differentiation of osteoblasts through intercellular interaction during development.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification and intracellular localization of obif protein</title><p>With the aim of identifying novel molecules involved in chondrocyte differentiation, we performed a microarray screening using a mouse chondroprogenitor cell line, ATDC5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). We extracted total RNA at day 0 (the confluence stage), day 9 (the cartilage nodule formation stage), and day 37 (the cellular hypertrophy and calcification stage). With the gene expression profile analysis, we identified 131 probe sets that showed more than a three-fold change in expression level at day 9 or day 37 relative to day 0. From among these genes, we selected 25 genes that have not as yet been known to be associated with chondrogenesis and osteoblastogenesis, and further investigated their expression patterns. We found one gene that shows an expression pattern predominantly in the skeletal systems of mouse embryos and up-regulation upon differentiation in ATDC5 cells. On the basis of our functional assay, we named this gene <italic>obif </italic>(<italic>osteoblast induction factor</italic>) (GenBank TPA <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="#BC025600">#BC025600</ext-link>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) which is the same gene with <italic>transmembrane protein 119 </italic>(<italic>tmem119</italic>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Identification of a novel plasma membrane protein, obif, and its subcellular localization</bold>.

Whole cell lysates of MC3T3-obif, MC3T3-cont, ATDC5-obif, ATDC5-cont, and NIH3T3-obif were electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblots were probed with anti-FLAG M2 antibody or anti-obif antibody.

Subcellular fractions of ST2 cells expressing exogenous mouse obif were analyzed by Western blotting. Immunoblots were probed with an anti-obif antibody to localize obif (top) and with an antibody against &#x003b2;-actin, an abundant cytoplasmic protein (bottom).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-213X-9-70-1"/></fig><p>The deduced amino acid sequence of mouse <italic>obif </italic>contains a signal sequence, a single transmembrane domain, and a glutamic acid-rich region. This gene is conserved among species from chicken to human (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). We also isolated a human <italic>OBIF </italic>cDNA from commercially available human fetal brain RNA by RT-PCR. The genomes of zebra fish and <italic>Xenopus tropicalis </italic>also contain sequences that are homologous to mouse <italic>obif </italic>(data not shown). We then examined the subcellular localization of obif. Using a retrovirus vector, we overexpressed a FLAG-tagged obif in various cell lines. To confirm the obif expression, we performed Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG M2 antibody and the antibody that we raised against obif (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). With both of these antibodies, we detected a strong band of approximately 37 kD, a weak band of approximately 44 kD, and broad bands of 50 - 75 kD in all cell lines in which obif was overexpressed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Using the on-line predictor method NetOGlyc 3.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], we found several potential O-glycosylation sites between the signal sequence and transmembrane domain of obif (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). This observation strongly suggests that obif is a type Ia transmembrane protein in which the N-terminal region is frequently modified post-transcriptionally. Next, we examined the intracellular localization of obif using MC3T3-E1 cells stably overexpressing mouse obif (MC3T3-obif) or human OBIF (MC3T3-OBIF) by immunostaining (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E-H</xref>). Obif/OBIF are mainly localized to the plasma membrane. This observation is coincident with the result of Western blot analysis on the subcellular fractionated samples (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1I</xref>), in which the microsomal fraction contained an abundant amount of obif compared with the cytoplasmic fraction.</p></sec><sec><title>Obif transcript is expressed in osteoblast-lineage cells</title><p>Early mouse embryos were examined for <italic>obif </italic>transcript expression by whole mount <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).

In the forelimb bud, <italic>obif </italic>is expressed in a broad region at E9.5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). At E10.5 and E11.5, the signal is down-regulated in the proximal region where mesenchymal cells condense and differentiate into chondrocytes, as evidenced by the onset of <italic>Sox9 </italic>expression (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C, D, G</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2H</xref>). At E12.5 and E13.5, while <italic>Sox9 </italic>shows a prominent signal in future digit regions, the expression of <italic>obif </italic>is most abundant in the interdigital mesenchyme (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E, F, I</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2J</xref>). As in developing limb buds, <italic>obif </italic>expression is complementary to that of <italic>Sox9 </italic>in other tissues (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D, H, K-P</xref>). For instance, <italic>obif </italic>is expressed in cells between the condensations that form the future ribs at E11.5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>) and in the osteogenic mesenchyme surrounding Meckel's cartilage at E12.5 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2K-M</xref>). However, we could not detect <italic>obif </italic>transcripts in the chondrocyte-lineage cells such as the cartilage condensation and Meckel's cartilage where <italic>Sox9 </italic>is expressed (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C-P</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the <italic>obif </italic>transcript expression at later embryonic stages, we performed section <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization with several markers pertaining to endochondral ossification (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2Q-Y</xref>). <italic>Collagen1</italic>(<italic>Col.1</italic>) and <italic>osteocalcin (ocn) </italic>are markers for mature osteoblasts. <italic>Osteopontin </italic>(<italic>opn</italic>) is a marker for both terminally differentiated chondrocytes and osteoblasts, and <italic>collagen 10 </italic>(<italic>col.10</italic>) is a marker for hypertrophic chondrocytes. Interestingly, the expression of <italic>obif </italic>was observed in the osteoblasts. In E14.5 humerus, <italic>obif </italic>transcripts were detected in the perichondrium of the hypertrophic chondrocyte region where <italic>collagen1 </italic>is expressed, but were absent from more centrally located chondrocytic cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2Q</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2R</xref>). At E15.5, when <italic>ocn </italic>is not yet significantly expressed, <italic>obif </italic>is detected both in the prospective bone collar region marked with <italic>collagen1 </italic>and in the developing bone trabeculae marked with <italic>opn </italic>(Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2S-V</xref>). At E17.5, <italic>obif </italic>expression overlaps with <italic>ocn </italic>but not with <italic>collagen10 </italic>(Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2W-Y</xref>).</p><p>Next, we examined the expression of <italic>obif </italic>and <italic>Runx2 </italic>in various tissues of 4 week-old mice by Northern blot analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2Z</xref>). A 2.1 kb band was detected in the tissues containing osteoblasts (calvaria, long bones) and other tissues such as the brain and lung. The calvaria band was significantly stronger as compared with that of the brain or lung. High levels of <italic>obif </italic>expression at embryonic stages followed by decreased expression of <italic>obif </italic>at early postnatal stages suggest that <italic>obif </italic>works in both embryonic skeletal development and postnatal differentiation. During postnatal development, expression in calvaria and long bones decreases whereas <italic>Runx2 </italic>expression is comparably maintained (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2AA</xref>), suggesting that <italic>obif </italic>does not have an important role in mature adult tissues.</p></sec><sec><title>Obif expression is up-regulated during osteoblastic differentiation in cell line models</title><p>Several cell lines derived from mesenchymal tissues have been widely used to recapitulate <italic>in vivo </italic>cellular differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. We used preosteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells, myogenic C2C12 cells, and stromal ST2 cells as osteoblast differentiation models, and chondrogenic ATDC5 cells as a chondrocyte differentiation model. Initially, the endogenous <italic>obif </italic>in these cells was examined in comparison with <italic>Runx2 </italic>by Northern blot analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2BB</xref>). In undifferentiated MC3T3-E1 cells only a faint signal was detected, however, upon induction by ascorbic acid (AA) and &#x003b2;-glycerophosphate (BGP), <italic>obif </italic>transcripts dramatically increased (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2BB</xref>: lanes 1 and 2). Similarly, although ATDC5 cells express almost no <italic>obif </italic>transcript in an undifferentiated state, <italic>obif </italic>expression is markedly up-regulated during differentiation induced by ITS (insulin/transferrin/sodium selenite) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2BB</xref>: lanes 3 and 4). NIH3T3 cells express a low amount of <italic>obif </italic>and <italic>Runx2 </italic>transcripts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2BB</xref>: lane 5). In C2C12 cells, <italic>obif </italic>expression increased during osteoblastic differentiation induced by BMP2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2BB</xref>: lanes 6-8). In ST2 cells, <italic>obif </italic>expression increased during differentiation induced by ascorbic acid or Wnt 3a (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2BB</xref>: lanes 9 and 10, and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2CC</xref>: lanes 1-4).</p></sec><sec><title>Endogenous obif protein is expressed in osteoblast-lineage cells</title><p>In order to investigate the localization of endogenous obif protein, we immunostained sections of embryonic forelimb and humerus using the anti-obif antibody (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A-E</xref>).

The infection efficiency was monitored by GFP expression (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2A, D, G</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2J</xref>). Obif expression was confirmed by immunocytochemistry (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2I</xref>) and Western blot analysis using anti-obif antibody (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). These results show that cultured cells can be infected efficiently (&#x0003e;95%) with retroviruses. These infected cells express GFP and/or obif protein even after extensive passaging. For gene knockdown, we made retroviruses expressing short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) against <italic>obif</italic>. First, we designed three different siRNAs (siRNA-1, siRNA-2, and siRNA-3) and examined their knockdown effects (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). MC3T3-obif cells and ATDC5-obif cells were transfected with siRNA-1, siRNA-2, siRNA-3, or control siRNA and analyzed by Western blotting. Non-transfected MC3T3-obif cells and ATDC5-obif cells were also electrophoresed. All of the siRNAs against <italic>obif </italic>showed strong knockdown effects (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Next, we made retroviral constructs overlapping the effective siRNA sequences, a control shRNA (sh-cont), sh292 which sequence overlaps siRNA-1 and siRNA-2 sequences, and sh301 which sequence overlaps siRNA-3 sequence. When infected, MC3T3-obif cells with sh292 retroviruses showed a strong knockdown effect and those with sh301 retroviruses showed a comparatively weak knockdown effect (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Using these retroviruses, we established cells stably expressing these shRNAs and performed knockdown studies.</p><p>Initially, we examined the effect of <italic>obif </italic>overexpression on cell growth (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>).

The same effects of exogenous obif were observed in other cell lines, ATDC5, ST2, and C2C12 (data not shown).

We first examined an early stage osteoblastic marker, ALP activity. The retrovirally infected cells were cultured in osteoblast differentiation media and harvested at the indicated time points (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). While ALP activity increased in a time-dependent manner both in MC3T3-obif and -cont cells, MC3T3-obif cells showed a significantly higher ALP activity than the MC3T3-cont cells at all points examined (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). In contrast, the reduction of <italic>obif </italic>expression caused a significant decrease of ALP activity at all time points examined (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). Second, we cultured MC3T3-E1 cells in the differentiation-induction medium until mineralized nodules could be observed. Mineralization was visualized by Alizarin Red staining and quantified by a biochemical assay for calcium. A significantly higher degree of mineralization was obtained in MC3T3-obif cells than in MC3T3-cont cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E-H</xref>). A quantitative analysis of calcium by extraction of the calcified mineral also showed a higher calcium content in MC3T3-obif cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4M</xref>). In contrast, decreased mineralization was observed in MC3T3-sh292 cells and MC3T3-sh301 cells as compared with MC3T3-sh-cont cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4I-L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4N</xref>). In addition, we examined the effect of human <italic>OBIF </italic>on mineralization and confirmed that it also promoted mineralization (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>).</p><p>Aiming to investigate the effect of <italic>obif </italic>at the molecular level, we examined the expression of osteoblast lineage-associated genes by Northern blot analysis (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A-D</xref>). In <italic>obif </italic>overexpression experiments, the mRNA levels of the osteoblastic differentiation markers increased in MC3T3-obif cells compared with those in MC3T3-cont cells. In particular, the elevations of <italic>bsp </italic>and <italic>ocn </italic>mRNA levels were prominent (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). In knockdown experiments, <italic>obif </italic>transcripts were almost completely abolished in MC3T3-sh292 cells and partially ablated in MC3T3-sh301 cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B-D</xref>). As early and essential osteoblastic markers, we first examined <italic>Runx2 </italic>and <italic>Osx </italic>mRNA levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). At day 14, <italic>Osx </italic>transcripts decreased in <italic>obif </italic>knocked down cells whereas <italic>Runx2 </italic>transcripts were not influenced by <italic>obif </italic>levels. At day 28, <italic>Runx2 </italic>was down-regulated in MC3T3-sh292 cells while we could detect only faint evidence of <italic>obif </italic>mRNA.

This seems due to <italic>obif </italic>up-regulation by cells surrounding the cartilage nodules during ATDC5 differentiation.</p><p>Osteoblastogenesis is a multistep process temporally controlled by transcription factors and secreted growth factors. The centerpiece of the transcriptional control of osteoblast differentiation is the <italic>Runx2</italic>-dependent pathway. <italic>Runx2</italic>-deficient mice have a cartilaginous skeleton without any osteoblasts, as osteoblast differentiation is arrested as early as E12.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. <italic>Osterix</italic>, a zinc finger-containing protein that is known to be downstream of <italic>Runx2</italic>, is expressed in osteoblast progenitors, and mice without <italic>Osterix </italic>also lack mature osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Although other transcription factors, Dlx5/6, Msx1/2, AP-1 families, twist, and ATF4, have been reported to be involved in osteoblastic differentiation, exact roles of these factors and their relationship with Runx2 remain to be elucidated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. A recent report suggests that <italic>obif (tmem119) </italic>is one of the molecules downstream of <italic>Runx2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Our results are consistent with this report. However, <italic>obif </italic>expression is observed as early as <italic>Runx2 </italic>expression in developing limb buds and during the differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells. Therefore, the genetic and cell biological relationships between <italic>obif </italic>and <italic>Runx2 </italic>will need future studies, including analysis of <italic>obif </italic>and <italic>Runx2 </italic>mutant mice.</p><p>In mouse embryos, cells expressing <italic>obif </italic>are observed in the periosteum, bone collars, and trabecular bones. The expression pattern of <italic>obif </italic>suggests that <italic>obif </italic>functions in osteoblastic development. In the multiple cell line models we used, endogenous <italic>obif </italic>is markedly upregulated during osteoblastic differentiation. These expression patterns strongly suggest that <italic>obif </italic>functions in osteoblastogenesis. In committed preosteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells, <italic>obif </italic>exerts critical roles both in ALP induction and in matrix mineralization. In <italic>obif </italic>overexpression and knockdown experiments, cell proliferation is mildly affected but the effect of <italic>obif </italic>expression levels on differentiation is more significant. Thus we propose that obif may play a role in both proliferation and differentiation, but the primary effect of <italic>obif </italic>is on differentiation. When <italic>obif </italic>is knocked down in MC3T3-E1 cells, mRNA levels of <italic>Osx </italic>and <italic>ocn </italic>decrease proportionally to the <italic>obif </italic>transcripts, although <italic>Runx2 </italic>is not significantly affected. And in a similar experiment using primary calvarial cells, the level of <italic>ocn </italic>transcript decreases in cells in which obif was knocked down. These results suggest that obif protein is involved in the late differentiation of osteoblast-lineage cells.</p><p>Partial proteins including the ECD of both human and mouse obif stimulated osteoblastic differentiation in MC3T3-E1 cells as well as the full-length obif protein. These results suggest that the ECD is sufficient to stimulate osteoblastic differentiation, and the physiological function of obif is mediated by cell-cell or cell-matrix interaction as a ligand. The binding activity of AP-obif (ECD) to bone tissues and differentiating MC3T3-E1 cells supports the hypothesis that an <italic>obif </italic>receptor-like molecule exists in bone tissues and that <italic>obif </italic>functions as a ligand. Further investigation of the functional mechanisms of <italic>obif </italic>may shed light on a new signaling mechanism in osteoblast and chondrocyte differentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have isolated and functionally characterized a novel plasma membrane protein, obif. <italic>Obif </italic>is highly expressed in early and late stage osteoblasts of developing mouse embryos, and its transcripts increase during osteoblastic differentiation in several skeletal cell lines.
