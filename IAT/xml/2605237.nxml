Although the mechanisms responsible for dysregulated IFN-I production in SLE remain unclear, autoantibody-mediated uptake of endogenous nucleic acids is thought to play a role. 2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane (TMPD; also known as pristane) induces a lupus-like disease in mice characterized by immune complex nephritis with autoantibodies to DNA and ribonucleoproteins. We recently reported that TMPD also causes increased ISG expression and that the development of the lupus is completely dependent on IFN-I signaling (Nacionales, D.C., K.M. Kelly-Scumpia, P.Y. Lee, J.S. Weinstein, R. Lyons, E. Sobel, M. Satoh, and W.H. Reeves. 2007. <italic>Arthritis Rheum.</italic> 56:3770&#x02013;3783). We show that TMPD elicits IFN-I production, monocyte recruitment, and autoantibody production exclusively through a Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7&#x02013; and myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)&#x02013;dependent pathway. In vitro studies revealed that TMPD augments the effect of TLR7 ligands but does not directly activate TLR7 itself. The effects of TMPD were amplified by the Y-linked autoimmune acceleration cluster, which carries a duplication of the <italic>TLR7</italic> gene. In contrast, deficiency of Fc&#x003b3; receptors (Fc&#x003b3;Rs) did not affect the production of IFN-I. Collectively, the data demonstrate that TMPD-stimulated IFN-I production requires TLR7/MyD88 signaling and is independent of autoantibody-mediated uptake of ribonucleoproteins by Fc&#x003b3;Rs.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: ago2, argonaute 2; ANA, antinuclear antibody; clo-lip, clodronate-containing liposomes; ds, double stranded; IC, immune complex; IFN-I, type I IFN; IPS-1, IFN-b promoter stimulator 1; IRF, IFN regulatory factor; ISG, IFN-stimulated gene; MCP, monocyte chemoattractant protein; Mda5, melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5; MFI, mean fluorescence intensity; Mx1, myxoma response protein 1; MyD88, myeloid differentiation factor 88; PDC, plasmacytoid DC; PEC, peritoneal exudate cell; RIG-I, retinoic acid&#x02013;inducible gene I; RT-PCR, real-time quantitative PCR; SLE, systemic lupus erythematosus; snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein; ss, single stranded; TBK-1, TANK-binding kinase 1; TLR, Toll-like receptor; TMPD, 2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane; TRIF, Toll/IL-1 receptor domain&#x02013;containing adaptor inducing IFN-b; Yaa, Y-linked autoimmune accelerating.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by the production of antibodies against an array of self-antigens such as double-stranded (ds) DNA and components of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), including the Sm/RNP antigens (U1, U2, U4-6, and U5 snRNPs), Ro/SS-A antigens (Y RNAs), and other antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). Recent evidence strongly suggests that type I IFNs (IFN-Is), a family of antiviral cytokines, are integral to the pathogenesis of SLE. Elevated serum levels of IFN-I and overexpression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in the peripheral blood of SLE patients have been demonstrated by several groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). This &#x0201c;IFN signature&#x0201d; is associated with more active disease and the presence of autoantibodies against dsDNA and the Sm/RNP and Ro/SS-A antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>).</p><p>The etiology of excess IFN-I in SLE is incompletely understood. Research on innate immunity has led to the identification of several pathways mediating IFN-I production in mammalian cells. Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3, a sensor for viral dsRNA, and TLR4, the receptor for LPS, both stimulate IFN-I secretion through Toll/IL-1 receptor domain&#x02013;containing adaptor inducing IFN-&#x003b2; (TRIF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). In contrast, TLR7/8 and TLR9 mediate IFN-I production via myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) in response to single-stranded (ss) RNA and unmethylated CpG DNA, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). In addition, cytoplasmic receptors that recognize intracellular nucleic acids and induce IFN-I have been described recently. Retinoic acid&#x02013;inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) recognize cytoplasmic RNA and trigger IFN-I by activating IFN-&#x003b2; promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1; also known as MAVS, VISA, and CARDIF) and IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). Cytoplasmic DNA binds to a newly described cytoplasmic sensor and triggers IFN-I production via a pathway requiring TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK-1) and IRF3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>).</p><p>It has been hypothesized that nucleic acids from dying cells may act as ligands for TLR7/8 and TLR9 to trigger IFN-I production in SLE. Immune complexes (ICs) formed by autoantibodies to DNA and snRNPs help to transport these &#x0201c;endogenous ligands&#x0201d; to endosomes where TLR7, 8, and 9 are normally found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Activation of these TLRs then induces the production of IFN-I by plasmacytoid DCs (PDCs). This hypothesis is supported by numerous in vitro studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). However, therapeutic administration of recombinant IFN-&#x003b1; can directly trigger the production of anti-dsDNA antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>), and in several mouse model of lupus, IFN-I production is required for the induction of autoantibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>), suggesting that IFN-I dysregulation may occur upstream of autoantibody development. Therefore, it remains controversial whether nucleic acid&#x02013;containing ICs in SLE initiate IFN-I production or act to perpetuate a positive feedback loop of IFN production initiated by another factor, such as a viral infection.</p><p>Experimental lupus induced by the hydrocarbon oil 2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane (TMPD; also known as pristane) displays many key immunological and clinical features of human SLE, including the presence of the IFN signature and lupus autoantibodies such as anti-dsDNA, -Sm, and -RNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). Importantly, IFN-I play an essential role in this model, as the development of glomerulonephritis and production of autoantibodies (anti-Sm/RNP, -dsDNA, and -Su) are abolished in IFN-I receptor&#x02013;deficient (IFNAR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). Unexpectedly, a population of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> immature monocytes that accumulates in the peritoneal cavity after TMPD treatment, rather than DCs, is the major source of the excess IFN-I seen in this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). The persistent influx of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes and production of IFN-I occur within 2 wk of TMPD treatment, long before the appearance of autoantibodies against snRNPs and dsDNA (3&#x02013;5 mo), indicating that the initial wave of IFN-I production may be independent of the presence of RNA-containing ICs. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the mechanism of IFN-I production in TMPD-induced lupus.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>TMPD-induced IFN-I production requires MyD88</title><p>To identify the mechanism of IFN-I induction by TMPD, we first analyzed the effect of TMPD on mice with deficiency of the adaptor molecules TRIF or MyD88. TRIF is required to trigger IFN-I production by TLR3 and TLR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>), whereas MyD88 mediates TLR7/8 and TLR9 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). We have previously shown that within 2 wk of TMPD treatment, an accumulation of IFN-I&#x02013;producing CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes can be detected in the peritoneal cavity in wild-type mice concurrent with increased IFN-I production and ISG expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Compared with wild-type mice, the total number of peritoneal exudate cells (PECs) was significantly reduced in MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice after TMPD treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Both Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes and granulocytes (defined as CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>Ly6G<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>Ly6C<sup>mid</sup>) were decreased by &#x0003e;90% (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). Importantly, we found that IFN-I induction by TMPD was completely dependent on MyD88, because elevated expression of the ISGs <italic>myxoma response protein 1</italic> (<italic>Mx1</italic>) and <italic>IRF7</italic> in PECs was abolished in MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, as also seen in IFNAR-deficient mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). The levels of the IFN-inducible chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1; also known as CCL2) in the peritoneal lavage fluid were also reduced in the absence of MyD88 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). In contrast, TRIF deficiency did not affect the accumulation of PEC populations or the increased expression of ISGs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A&#x02013;D</xref>). Although we were unable to detect significant changes in serum IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; levels by ELISA, IFN-I secretion was required for the response to TMPD, as the up-regulation of ISGs and recruitment of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes were abolished in IFNAR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A&#x02013;D</xref>).

These observations support the role of TLR7 as the primary mediator of IFN-I production in the TMPD lupus model. Interestingly, consistent with the increased number of peritoneal granulocytes in TMPD-treated TLR7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>), the neutrophil chemoattractant <italic>CXCL5</italic> was up-regulated in the absence of TLR7, whereas the expression of other inflammatory mediators was comparable between the groups (Table S1).</p><p>Several studies have demonstrated that self-RNA present in ICs may act as an endogenous TLR7 ligand causing the production of IFN-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). Fc&#x003b3;Rs have been reported to play an essential role in this process by enhancing the internalization of ICs, thereby allowing RNA to interact with TLR7 in endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). Deficiency of either TLR7 or Fc&#x003b3;R &#x003b3; chain, an integral component of Fc&#x003b3;RI and Fc&#x003b3;RIII, renders mouse DCs unable to produce IFN-I in response to lupus ICs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). Because TMPD induces IFN-I production long before the onset of lupus autoantibodies and ICs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>), we examined the potential role of Fc&#x003b3;R in the IFN-I response to TMPD. Surface expression of Fc&#x003b3;RI (CD64) and Fc&#x003b3;RII/III (CD32/CD16) in TMPD-induced PECs was prominent on Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>).

More than half of SLE patients display increased expression of ISGs, often in association with active disease and autoantibodies against snRNPs and DNA, as well as renal involvement and endothelial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>). However, the exact cause of IFN-I dysregulation in lupus remains controversial, and it is unclear whether IFN-I overproduction promotes autoantibody production or vice versa.</p><p>The TMPD model of lupus recapitulates many features of human SLE, including glomerulonephritis, arthritis, and autoantibodies against dsDNA and snRNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). Moreover, like SLE, TMPD-induced lupus is more severe in females than males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). We recently found that TMPD-treated mice exhibit the IFN signature and that their lupus is dependent on IFN-I signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). The major IFN-I&#x02013;producing cells in TMPD lupus are Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes rather than PDCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). In this study, we show that TMPD triggers IFN-I production via the TLR7&#x02013;MyD88 pathway. Our data also exclude a major role of other pathways of IFN-I production, including TLR9, TLR3&#x02013;TLR4&#x02013;TRIF, RIG-I&#x02013;Mda5&#x02013;IPS-1, and DAI&#x02013;TBK1. Although there was a strict requirement for TLR7 and MyD88, expression of ISGs and recruitment of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes in response to TMPD was unexpectedly independent of Fc&#x003b3;Rs.</p><p>The innate sensors TLR7 and TLR9 have been implicated in SLE because of their ability to recognize endogenous nucleic acids and trigger IFN-I production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>). Mammalian nucleic acids are generally weak TLR ligands because of their inability to reach the endosomal compartment where TLR7 and TLR9 are localized. When they form ICs with lupus autoantibodies (anti-Sm/RNP or anti-dsDNA), endogenous nucleic acids may be delivered more efficiently to endosomes because of uptake by Fc&#x003b3;Rs, stimulating IFN-I production by PDCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>). This model for IFN-I induction in human SLE is supported by numerous in vitro studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>). Although Fc&#x003b3;RIIa mediates the activation of human PDCs, ICs trigger IFN-I production by mouse PDCs in a TLR7- and Fc&#x003b3;RI/III-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>).</p><p>However, it is not known whether the development of antiribonucleoprotein autoantibodies is a cause of IFN-I dysregulation or a consequence of it. Therapeutic use of IFN-&#x003b1; can induce many features of SLE, including anti-dsDNA antibodies, suggesting that IFN-I dysregulation occurs upstream of IC formation. Consistent with that view, IFN-I up-regulation in the TMPD model occurs within the first 2 wk of treatment, more than 2 mo before the onset of lupus autoantibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Fc&#x003b3;RI and Fc&#x003b3;RIII were not required for the IFN-I response to TMPD because it was unaffected in &#x003b3; chain&#x02013;deficient mice. Moreover, a previous study also showed that the absence of Fc&#x003b3;RI/III or Fc&#x003b3;RIIb does not affect anti-Sm/RNP autoantibody production in TMPD-treated mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>). Although IC formation and Fc&#x003b3;Rs are not required to initiate IFN-I production, we cannot exclude the possibility that they amplify IFN-I secretion and accelerate disease progression subsequent to the development of autoantibodies.</p><p>A pathogenic role of TLR7 has been described in several mouse models of SLE.

The connection between TLR7 and the generation of RNA-associated autoantibodies is further illustrated by the recent demonstration of a duplication of the TLR7 gene in Yaa mice. The presence of the Yaa cluster was sufficient to induce production of RNA-associated autoantibodies in C57BL/6 Fc&#x003b3;IIB<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and C57BL6.Sle1 mice, two autoimmune strains that normally lack these antibody specificities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). TLR7, and not the other 16 genes affected by the Yaa mutation, is responsible for the autoimmune pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). However, increased IFN-I production has not been reported in these models. Our findings indicate that TLR7 also plays an essential role in TMPD lupus. Similar to the MRL-<italic>lpr</italic> model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>), TLR7 is required for the generation of anti-nRNP/Sm autoantibodies in TMPD-treated mice. Importantly, the IFN signature in TMPD-treated mice, which is established within 2 wk of treatment (long before the appearance of anti-nRNP autoantibodies), was abolished in the absence of TLR7. In contrast, the effects of TMPD were amplified in the presence of the Yaa locus. Therefore, this study provides evidence for direct in vivo involvement of TLR7 in the induction of IFN-I, even in the absence of autoantibodies and ICs.</p><p>We have previously shown that Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes are a major source of IFN-I in the TMPD model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Depletion of monocytes but not DCs reduced IFN-I production and ISG expression. In this study, we found that Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes also express higher levels of TLR7 and display a greater response in vitro to R848 than to other TLR ligands. Although TLR7 is normally found on monocytes and macrophages, its expression on peritoneal Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes in TMPD-treated mice was several fold higher than on splenic or bone marrow monocytes. In contrast, DCs in the peritoneal exudate displayed lower levels of TLR7 and more prominent TLR3 and TLR9 expression. The high expression level of TLR7 by Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes may be of critical importance in the pathogenesis of TMPD lupus, as a recent study demonstrated that increased gene dosage of TLR7 is sufficient to trigger anti-RNA antibodies and glomerulonephritis in C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). Interestingly, the recruitment of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes to the peritoneum seems to be partially dependent on IFN-I, as seen in TLR7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, and IFNAR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. TLR7 signaling also induces the expression of several IFN-stimulated chemokines (<italic>CCL2</italic>, <italic>CCL7</italic>, and <italic>CCL12</italic>), suggesting that the mechanism may involve enhanced production of monocyte chemoattractants, creating an amplification loop of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocyte recruitment and IFN-I production. The recruitment of DCs and granulocytes, on the other hand, was not dependent on IFN-I or TLR7.</p><p>The mechanism linking TMPD to the activation of TLR7 has been partially elucidated by our studies. The hydrocarbon structure of TMPD is distinct from known TLR7 ligands, including ssRNA, R848, loxoribine, and other guanosine analogues. Indeed, our in vitro studies showed that TMPD did not activate TLR7 directly but instead augmented the inflammatory response to TLR7 ligands such as R848. The ability of hydrocarbon oils to enhance TLR7 stimulation in vitro seems related to their ability to induce lupus-like disease in vivo. Unlike TMPD, squalene and medicinal mineral oil were ineffective in augmenting the response to R848. Mice treated with squalene and mineral oil do not display the IFN signature and few develop lupus autoantibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>). TMPD appears to enhance activation via the TLR7 pathway in at least two ways: (a) by augmenting the recruitment of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes, which express high levels of TLR7, and (b) by enhancing the intrinsic responsiveness of TLR7 to its ligands. Additional studies will be needed to elucidate whether TMPD causes increased uptake of apoptotic/necrotic material, enhancing the recognition of TLR7 ligands, or if TMPD interacts with components of the TLR7 signaling pathway, augmenting the response to receptor&#x02013;ligand interactions.</p><p>Although the underlying mechanisms are distinct, the pathological consequences of excess TLR7 activation are shared by TMPD-induced lupus and the Yaa model. An important unanswered question that encompasses both models is the nature of the exogenous or endogenous ligands responsible for activating the TLR7 pathway. It is possible that chronic TMPD-stimulated inflammation provides a persistent source of autoantigens from apoptotic cells and that endogenous TLR7 ligands such as the U1 RNA component of the Sm/RNP antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref>) trigger the first wave of IFN-I production. Downstream signaling events may elicit further IFN-I production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref>) and <italic>TLR7</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">60</xref>), culminating in a positive feedback cycle that promotes autoimmunity by persistently activating TLR7. It remains to be verified experimentally whether or not RNA-associated autoantigens from apoptotic cells are key mediators of Yaa- and TMPD-induced lupus in vivo.</p><p>It is noteworthy that besides activating IFN-I production via TLR7, TMPD also induced the recruitment of granulocytes via an MyD88-dependent but TLR7-independent pathway. The number of peritoneal granulocytes actually increased in the absence of IFN-I production, as seen in TLR7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and IFNAR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. MyD88 is used in the signaling pathways of other cytokines (IL-1 and IL-18) and TLRs (except TLR3), which are potential mediators of granulocyte recruitment in this model.</p><p>Finally, our findings may shed light on other pathology induced by TMPD. The development of plasmacytomas after i.p. injection of TMPD in BALB/cAnPt mice was first described more than three decades ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">61</xref>). Subsequently TMPD was used to enhance monoclonal antibody production by hybridomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">62</xref>). How TMPD elicits these effects is incompletely understood, although IL-6 has been implicated. Interestingly, although TLR7 can trigger B cell activation and antibody production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>), IFN-I plays an important role in antibody class switching and promotes plasma cell differentiation in the presence of IL-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">63</xref>). Whether TLR7 activation and IFN-I production are involved in the pathogenesis of plasmacytomas and enhancement of antibody production by hybridomas warrants further investigation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Mice.</title><p>MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, TRIF<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, TLR7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, TLR9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, and IFNAR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (backcrossed &#x0003e;7 generations to the C57BL/6 background), and IPS-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, TNF<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, TNF<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>TBK1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (on a mixed 129Sv/B6 background) have all been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">64</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">66</xref>).
