We report that eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2) recognizes TAR. TAR and the AUG initiation codon domain, located well downstream from TAR, both contribute to the affinity of HIV-1 mRNA for eIF2. The affinity of TAR for eIF2 was insensitive to lower stem mutations that modify sequence and structure or to sequence changes throughout the remainder that leave the TAR secondary structure intact. Hence, eIF2 recognizes structure rather than sequence in TAR. The affinity for eIF2 was severely reduced by a 3 nt change that converts the single A bulge into a 7 nt internal loop. T1 footprinting showed that eIF2 protects nucleotides in the loop as well as in the strand opposite the A bulge. Thus, eIF2 recognizes the TAR loop and lower part of the sub-apical stem. Though not contiguous, these regions are brought into proximity in TAR by a bend in the helical structure induced by the UCU bulge; binding of eIF2 opens up the bulge context and apical stem. The ability to bind eIF2 suggests a function for TAR in HIV-1 mRNA translation. Indeed, the 3 nt change that reduces the affinity of TAR for eIF2 impairs the ability of reporter mRNA to compete in translation. Interaction of TAR with eIF2 thus allows HIV-1 mRNA to compete more effectively during protein synthesis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>TAR (<italic>trans</italic>-activator response region) is a 59 nt hairpin loop structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c1">1</xref>) found at the 5&#x02032;-end of all classes of mRNA encoded by the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), the etiological agent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c3">3</xref>). This <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequence contains a binding site for the viral Tat protein that <italic>trans</italic>-activates HIV-1 gene expression during early transcriptional elongation of the viral RNA (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c5">5</xref>). A number of cellular proteins also interact directly with TAR, including the RNA-activated protein kinase, PKR, which phosphorylates the &#x003b1;-subunit of eukaryotic translation initation factor 2 (eIF2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c6">6</xref>), the PKR homolog TRBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c8">8</xref>), a sequence-specific, single-stranded DNA-binding protein Pur-&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c9">9</xref>), RNA polymerase II and TRP-185 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c11">11</xref>), a human chromosome 12-associated 83 kDa protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c12">12</xref>) and nuclear protein p140 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c13">13</xref>). Currently, it is believed that the major role of TAR is to act as an RNA enhancer that controls HIV-1 transcription at initiation and elongation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c14">14</xref>). A post-transcriptional role for binding of Tat to TAR has also been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c17">17</xref>). Indeed, TAR has the ability to activate PKR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c20">20</xref>), thus causing translational down-regulation through phosphorylation and inactivation of eIF2. Other post-transcriptional functions, if any, remain to be elucidated.</p><p>During initiation of translation, eIF2 forms a ternary complex with Met-tRNA<sub>f</sub> and GTP that must bind to the 40S ribosomal subunit before binding of mRNA can occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c21">21</xref>). eIF2 also interacts directly with mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c33">33</xref>) through its &#x003b2;-chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c32">32</xref>). eIF2 protects specific sequences in mRNA that overlap with the ribosome binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c34">34</xref>), consistent with the view that eIF2 guides the 40S ribosomal subunit to its binding site in mRNA. Indeed, eIF2 promotes selection of 5&#x02032;-proximal translation initiation sites by ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c35">35</xref>). Genetic evidence that eIF2 recognizes the initiation codon is provided by mutations in yeast eIF2, particularly in a zinc finger motif of the &#x003b2;-chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c37">37</xref>), that permit utilization of an altered initiation codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c39">39</xref>). The interaction between mRNA and eIF2 is relevant for translational control: the affinity of an mRNA for eIF2 correlates tightly with its ability to compete in translation while competition between different mRNAs is relieved by an excess of eIF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c27">27</xref>).</p><p>Here we show that eIF2 recognizes and binds to the 5&#x02032;-terminal TAR structure in HIV-1 mRNA. TAR and the AUG initiation codon context each contribute to the affinity of the viral mRNA for this initiation factor. eIF2 recognizes the TAR loop and the lower part of the sub-apical stem. Though not contiguous, these regions are brought into proximity in TAR by a bend in the helical structure induced by the UCU bulge; binding of eIF2 opens up the bulge context. The finding that TAR serves to bind an initiation factor suggests a direct function for this RNA structure in the translation of all classes of HIV-1 mRNA. Indeed, a mutation that reduces the affinity of TAR for eIF2 impairs the ability of reporter mRNA to compete in translation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>HIV-1 RNA transcripts</title><p>pSVTAR59LUC was created by integration of an oligonucleotide consisting of HIV-1 TAR sequence 1&#x02013;59 into the <italic>Sma</italic>I site of pBEH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c40">40</xref>) and the <italic>Xba</italic>I&#x02013;<italic>Kpn</italic>I fragment from the firefly luciferase (LUC) gene into the respective sites of the same vector.

We have shown that this mRNA fragment binds with high affinity to eIF2 (Ben-Asouli <italic>et al</italic>., unpublished results). The 5&#x02032;-terminal HIV-1<sub>415</sub> and HIV-1<sub>1333</sub>&#x000a0;mRNA fragments, which contain both TAR and the AUG initiation codon at position 350, exhibited a significantly higher affinity for eIF2 than HIV-1<sub>77</sub> or HIV-1<sub>311</sub>, both of which contain TAR yet lack the AUG initiation codon, or than HIV-1<sub>311&#x02013;612</sub>, which contains the AUG initiation codon context yet lacks TAR.

These results were reproducible. The properties of the HIV-1 <italic>gag</italic> mRNA fragments, summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd196f2">2</xref>C, show that TAR and the AUG initiation codon domain, which is well removed from TAR, each contribute to the binding affinity for eIF2. We conclude that the binding site for eIF2 in HIV-1 <italic>gag</italic> mRNA is composite.</p><p>This is borne out by study of the RNA constructs in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd196f3">3</xref>, consisting of 77 nt as in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd196f1">1</xref>C (TAR), the same sequence abutted to a 46 nt sequence containing the AUG initiation codon context of luciferase mRNA (TAR&#x02013;LUC) or the latter sequence alone (LUC) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd196f3">3</xref>C). At low concentrations, TAR and LUC RNA each competed less effectively with labeled TAR transcript for eIF2 than did the fusion construct TAR&#x02013;LUC RNA that carries both TAR and the AUG initiation codon domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd196f3">3</xref>A, quantitated in B).</p></sec><sec><title>Base pairing in the lower stem of TAR is not critical for binding of eIF2</title><p>In the experiment in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd196f4">4</xref>, we studied RNA in which the 5&#x02032;-terminal 59 nt of TAR extend for another 21 nt into the HIV-1 5&#x02032;-UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c43">43</xref>).

The effect of these mutations on affinity for eIF2 was analyzed by mobility shift, through the ability of the unlabeled mutant RNAs to compete with labeled TAR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd196f4">4</xref>A and B). The mutations had little, if any, effect on the affinity of TAR for eIF2, since the ability to compete for eIF2 did not differ significantly between wild-type TAR and the mutant forms.

In contrast, mutant forms M6 and M7, in which the primary sequence was changed extensively but the secondary structure was maintained, competed for eIF2 with an affinity comparable to wild-type TAR.

As for double-stranded RNA, activation of PKR by TAR became less effective at high RNA concentrations.

To this end, BMV RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c45">45</xref>) was translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of increasing amounts of luciferase mRNA carrying TAR or TAR M5 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd196f6">6</xref>). Although BMV RNA efficiently directed translation of the 20 kDa coat protein and a 35 kDa protein, wild-type TAR-containing mRNA was able to compete effectively with BMV RNA, as seen from a progressive decrease in the translation of both proteins in response to increasing concentrations of TAR&#x02013;LUC mRNA. In contrast, TAR M5-containing luciferase mRNA was reproducibly a far weaker competitor (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd196f6">6</xref>A and B). Whereas TAR&#x02013;LUC mRNA inhibited BMV RNA translation by 3- to 4-fold, TAR M5&#x02013;LUC mRNA did not reduce it significantly.</p><p>Interaction of the TAR structure with eIF2, which is impaired by the M5 mutation, is thus important for the translation efficiency of TAR-containing mRNA.</p></sec><sec><title>T1 footprint of eIF2 in TAR</title><p>To delineate the eIF2-binding site within TAR, T1 footprinting was performed on the native TAR&#x02013;eIF2 complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd196f7">7</xref>A and B). Binding of eIF2 protected both nucleotides in the loop (UGGG) from T1 attack and in the lower part of the second stem (G), opposite those altered by the M5 mutation, and enhanced the sensitivity to T1 of nucleotides in the apical stem and bulge region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd196f7">7</xref>C and D). Based on footprint analysis, eIF2 recognizes the TAR loop. Binding of eIF2 opens up the UCU bulge context.</p><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd196f7">7</xref>A also shows somewhat enhanced cleavage at positions 32&#x02013;33 when eIF2 is present, although the increase is weak when compared to that of bands moving at positions 35&#x02013;43. Likewise, binding of eIF2 may extend to residues beyond G<sub>57</sub> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd196f7">7</xref>A and B) and thereby could affect the conformation of residues 32&#x02013;33 on the opposite side of the stem. Clearly, such binding is weaker than that at the loop.</p><p>From Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd196f7">7</xref>D it can be seen that the nucleotides in TAR that are recognized by eIF2, as judged by protection from nuclease attack (green) or by the M5 mutation (cyan), are brought into proximity by a bend in the helical structure induced by the UCU bulge. On the other hand, nucleotides sensitized to nuclease attack upon binding of eIF2 (magenta) face away from this region.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Our results show that eIF2 recognizes and binds to the 5&#x02032;-terminal TAR structure in HIV-1 mRNA. TAR and the AUG initiation codon domain, which is located well downstream from TAR, each contribute to the affinity of the viral mRNA for this initiation factor. Thus, the binding site for eIF2 in HIV-1 mRNA is composite. The finding that TAR serves to bind an initiation factor suggests a direct function for this RNA structure in the translation of all classes of HIV-1 mRNA. Indeed, a mutation in TAR that reduces its affinity for eIF2 also impairs the ability of reporter mRNA to compete in translation. This shows that the interaction of TAR with eIF2 is important for the translation efficiency of HIV-1 mRNA.</p><p>The affinity of TAR for eIF2 is insensitive to mutations that modify sequence and base pairing in its lower stem or to extensive sequence changes throughout the remainder of TAR that do not affect secondary structure. Hence, eIF2 recognizes structure rather than sequence in TAR. In contrast, the affinity for eIF2 was severely reduced by a 3 nt change (the M5 mutation) that causes the single A bulge to be extended into a 7 nt internal loop, composed of 4 nt on one side and 3 nt on the other. This mutation affects a structural feature that is essential for recognition by eIF2. Binding of eIF2 protected nucleotides in the TAR loop as well as near the A bulge, in the strand opposite to that altered by the M5 mutation. Though not contiguous, these regions in TAR are brought into proximity by a bend in the helical structure induced by the UCU bulge (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd196f7">7</xref>D). Binding of eIF2 induces changes in the conformation of the UCU bulge and its context as well as in the apical stem.</p><p>Both within HIV-1 <italic>gag</italic> mRNA, in which the initiating AUG is located 291 nt downstream from TAR, and within TAR&#x02013;LUC RNA, in which TAR is fused directly to the AUG initiation codon context of luciferase, affinity for eIF2 is contributed by both TAR and the AUG initiation codon domain (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd196f2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd196f3">3</xref>). In HIV-1 <italic>gag</italic> mRNA, chemical probing supports folding of this RNA such that the AUG initiation codon is brought into close proximity with the TAR domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c46">46</xref>). This analysis provides independent support for our conclusion that TAR and the AUG initiation codon domain create a composite binding site for eIF2 in HIV-1 mRNA. A role for the context of the AUG initiation codon is indicated by the finding that deletion of the dimerization domain just upstream of the AUG initiation codon, in HIV-1<sub>415</sub><sub>&#x00394;</sub>, resulted in a discernibly lower affinity for eIF2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd196f2">2</xref>B).</p><p>HIV-1 mRNA causes activation of PKR through its TAR domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c20">20</xref>), resulting in inhibition of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c18">18</xref>). This ability is sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c19">19</xref>) to mutations in the lower stem of TAR that disrupt base pairing, TAR 3 and 3R (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd196f4">4</xref>). In contrast, these mutations had little, if any, effect on binding of eIF2. Indeed, footprinting data in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd196f7">7</xref> reinforce the conclusion that the region affected by these mutations is not involved in the interaction of TAR with eIF2. Apparently, intact base pairing in the lower stem is not essential for binding of TAR to eIF2. Conversely, affinity for eIF2 was severely affected by the M5 mutation yet ability to activate PKR was also reduced, supporting the interpretation that eIF2 and PKR recognize distinct, yet overlapping, regions in the TAR structure. Possibly, interaction of eIF2 and PKR with contiguous regions in TAR may facilitate phosphorylation of eIF2 by this kinase. In this context, it is of note that the Tat protein, which also binds to the upper part of TAR, can be phosphorylated by PKR and competes with eIF2 as a substrate for this kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c47">47</xref>).</p><p>Mutations TAR 3 and TAR 3R create a novel, internal 8 nt loop, but this did not influence the affinity of TAR for eIF2. In contrast, the 7 nt internal loop generated by the M5 mutation had a major negative effect on ability of TAR to bind eIF2. This shows that it is not the internal loop in M5 as such but its specific location in TAR that interferes with the binding of eIF2. Recognition by eIF2 thus shows specificity. Only 3 nt were changed in M5 RNA; in contrast, far more extensive sequence changes introduced in the M6 and M7 RNAs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd196f5">5</xref>D), including all three positions affected in M5 and, for M7, nucleotides within the loop, did not reduce binding affinity for eIF2. Unlike for M5, however, the nucleotide substitutions in M6 and M7 did not perturb secondary structure. These results show that it is not the primary sequence of TAR <italic>per se</italic> that is recognized by eIF2, but its structure. The ability of eIF2 to protect the UGGG sequence in the TAR loop from T1 attack, together with the undiminished affinity for eIF2 of M7 TAR RNA in which three of these nucleotides as well as the protected G<sub>57</sub> have been altered, again shows that for recognition of TAR, eIF2 is flexible in terms of primary nucleotide sequence.</p><p>eIF2 interacts directly with mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c33">33</xref>), where it protects specific sequences that overlap with the ribosome-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c34">34</xref>). The affinity of an mRNA for eIF2 correlates tightly with its ability to compete in translation while competition between different mRNAs is relieved by an excess of eIF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c27">27</xref>). The mRNA-binding activity of eIF2 locates to the &#x003b2;-subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c32">32</xref>). Involvement of the AUG initiation codon context for recognition of mRNA by eIF2 is supported by biochemical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c35">35</xref>) and genetic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c39">39</xref>) but the structural complexity and length of mRNA molecules have impeded a more direct analysis of the eIF2-binding domain in mRNA. The present results with TAR, whose structure has been resolved by nuclear magnetic resonance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c48">48</xref>) and crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c49">49</xref>), offer the first detailed analysis of structural features in an mRNA that are important for recognition by eIF2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd196f7">7</xref>D).</p><p>The translation efficiency of luciferase reporter mRNA carrying a 5&#x02032;-terminal TAR structure was strongly impaired by the M5 mutation, which affects the affinity of TAR for eIF2. This was seen from a drastic reduction in the ability of the mRNA containing mutant TAR to compete with BMV RNA in translation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd196f6">6</xref>). Interaction of TAR with eIF2 thus allows HIV-1 mRNA to compete more effectively during protein synthesis.</p><p>The role of TAR in regulating the translation of HIV-1 mRNA is, however, more complex. Binding of eIF2 to the loop and bulge domains of TAR enhances the ability of the downstream mRNA to compete in translation. On the other hand, by activating PKR through its lower stem, TAR exerts a negative effect on translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c43">43</xref>); simultaneous interaction of TAR with PKR and eIF2 could even facilitate phosphorylation of eIF2 and thus promote its inactivation. As shown by the data in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd196f6">6</xref>, nonetheless, during translation in the reticulocyte lysate, the affinity of TAR for eIF2 contributes positively to translation efficiency.</p><p>Comparison of the modes of interaction of initiation factor eIF2 and of the transcription regulatory protein Tat with TAR is instructive. Tat binds at the UCU bulge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c14">14</xref>) and forms an equimolar complex with TAR through electrostatic interaction of the basic Arg repeat of Tat with negatively charged phosphates surrounding the bulge; binding is further stabilized by hydrogen bonding in the major groove of the RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c51">51</xref>). The bulge induces a bend in the RNA helix that distorts the local structure (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd196f7">7</xref>D) and widens the major groove of the RNA to expose hydrogen bonding contacts that are important for binding of Tat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c52">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c55">55</xref>). Binding of mRNA by eIF2 similarly involves basic domains; in this case, three runs of seven Lys residues, as well as a zinc finger motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c36">36</xref>). Like eIF2, Tat induces a conformational change in TAR that repositions the functional groups on the bases and the phosphate backbone that are critical for recognition. Tat causes the UCU residues in the bulge, which are loosely stacked into the helix in free RNA, to unstack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c56">56</xref>), while a triple base interaction may be formed between the U<sub>36</sub>A<sub>40</sub>-U<sub>51</sub> base pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c57">57</xref>). Upon binding of Tat, the major groove, which is open and accessible in free TAR, undergoes a transition to a more tightly packed structure that is&#x000a0;folded around Arg side chains emanating from the Tat protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c58">58</xref>).</p><p>As seen above, binding of eIF2 to TAR also induces structural changes in the UCU bulge and its context as well as in the apical stem. However, major differences are seen between the binding of eIF2 and that of Tat. eIF2 recognizes nucleotides in the TAR loop, in addition to those in the stem region near the single A bulge affected by the M5 mutation, but does not bind directly to the UCU bulge. While Tat does not bind to the loop, interaction of Tat with cyclin T confers a requirement for sequences in the loop that are not recognized by Tat alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd196c59">59</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd196f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Complex formation between HIV-1 TAR and eIF2.
