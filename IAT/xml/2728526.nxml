In presynaptic neurons, synaptic vesicles facilitate uptake of neurotransmitters and dock at the active zone of the plasma membrane. In response to calcium signaling, vesicles rapidly fuse with the plasma membrane and release neurotransmitters by exocytosis. The vesicles are recycled by subsequent endocytosis. These events are orchestrated by multiple protein complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. For example, one class of proteins is attached to the synaptic vesicle membrane, and is involved in calcium sensing (SYT1 and SV2a), membrane fusion (VAMP1), and vesicle recycling (SCAMP5). Another group of proteins is bound with scaffold proteins or directly anchored at the active zone and functions in vesicle docking (SYN1 and RIMs), priming (RIMs) and fusion (SNAP25 and STXBP1). In addition to these proteins, RAB3 proteins (RAB3A and RAB3C) function as molecular linkers between synaptic vesicles and the active zone by cycling between vesicle-associated and dissociated forms and interacting with multiple effectors, such as RIMs and SYN1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>To ensure precisely controlled synaptic communication, members of protein complexes in presynaptic neurons have highly coordinated expression and protein localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Spatial and temporal expression patterns of several presynaptic genes have been reported in detail. For instance, in mammalian brain, <italic>Rab3A </italic>is expressed throughout all brain regions, including cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum and thalamus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In the mouse, detectable levels of <italic>Rab3A</italic>, <italic>Syp </italic>and <italic>Sv2a </italic>mRNAs are reported from embryonic day 9.5 or 10.5, an early neurogenesis stage in which progenitors gradually undergo cell cycle withdrawal and neuronal differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. During neuronal maturation and synapse formation, <italic>Rab3A </italic>expression dramatically increases and the protein becomes localized to the presynaptic terminal of neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In contrast to the increased expression during neuronal development, neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's disease and schizophrenia are marked by decreased levels of RAB3A, SYT1, and SNAP25, coupled with the loss of functional synapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. It is clear that both gene expression and protein distribution in presynaptic neurons are tightly regulated during neuronal development, differentiation and maintenance. However, <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mechanisms mediating the neuronal expression of presynaptic genes still remain unknown.</p><p>Comparative genomics has taken advantage of the increasing number of whole genome sequences available for many model organisms in order to identify unknown regulatory elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. For example, 353 of 868 multi-species conserved elements (MCEs) examined by <italic>in vivo </italic>enhancer assay using mouse transgenesis were associated with tissue-specific expression of the reporter gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Furthermore, investigations of the promoter regions of co-expressed genes have led to discovery of significant clusters of transcription factor binding sites, that is, <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory modules (CRMs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Although these common CRMs are statistically over-represented in regulatory elements of co-expressed genes, their arrangement and activity may vary greatly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Therefore, co-expressed genes defined from large-scale expression studies provide excellent means to study common tissue-specific regulatory modules.</p><p>To elucidate the common CRMs regulating neuronal-specific expression of presynaptic genes, we first defined a cluster of nine presynaptic genes that were highly and specifically expressed in neuronal tissues. Unbiased <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>screens of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sites for <italic>Rab3A</italic>, one of the nine genes, revealed regulatory roles for all MCEs in the vicinity of this gene. We thus identified motifs of 16 transcription factors that were enriched in intergenic MCEs of the nine presynaptic genes in comparison to ubiquitously expressed genes. Identified CRMs were then used to develop a novel metric to rank MCEs according to their potential for mediating neuronal-specific expression. By experimentally validating the high-scoring as well as the low-scoring MCEs, we confirmed that this CRM-based scoring metric accurately identified neuronal-specific regulatory elements.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Gene selection for neuronal-restricted expression</title><p>In our previous work, we performed comparative sequence analysis of presynaptic genes encoding proteins mainly present in the presynaptic nerve terminal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. To select genes with neuronal-restricted expression, we used SymAtlas to examine the expression profiles of these genes obtained by microarray analysis in 54 mouse non-redundant tissues and at 7 developmental stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Expression profiles for 107 presynaptic genes, represented by 161 oligonucleotide gene probes with a consistent expression pattern, were available. A hierarchical k-means clustering of the 107 gene expression patterns revealed three distinct groups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>; Table S1 in Additional data file 1): nine genes, including <italic>Rab3A</italic>, <italic>Rab3C</italic>, <italic>Scamp5</italic>, <italic>Snap25</italic>, <italic>Stxbp1</italic>, <italic>Syn1</italic>, <italic>Sv2a</italic>, <italic>Camk2N1 </italic>and <italic>Dnm1</italic>, are tightly clustered with the most abundant expression restricted to brain tissues (cluster 1, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>); 27 genes are grouped with moderate neuronal expression (cluster 2, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>); and 71 genes are expressed in all tested tissues with an ubiquitous or nonspecific pattern (cluster 3, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Expression analysis of 107 presynaptic genes across mouse tissues and developmental stages</bold>.

Our strategy involved a systematic mapping of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements for one gene (<italic>Rab3A</italic>), and then using these data as a guide to characterize the regulatory elements for other genes. <italic>Rab3A </italic>is well-suited for this case study for several reasons. First, the exclusive neuronal expression of <italic>Rab3A </italic>is conserved among mammalian species (mouse, rat and human), suggesting that common regulatory mechanisms may be evolutionarily conserved. Second, <italic>Rab3A </italic>is a small gene spanning a 3 kb genomic region with a 4.3 kb upstream intergenic region. This short genomic interval allows a systematic analysis of the entire region for functional regulatory elements. We followed a two-pronged approach to precisely characterize regulatory elements for the <italic>Rab3A </italic>gene: an assessment of multiple-species conserved elements (MCEs) and an unbiased screen for functional elements with a series of deletions.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of a genomic region sufficient for <italic>Rab3A </italic>neuronal-specific expression</title><p>The <italic>Rab3A </italic>gene resides in one of the most gene-rich regions on mouse chromosome 8 between <italic>Pd4c </italic>and <italic>BC051227 </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). Two <italic>Rab3A </italic>transcripts were found in the GeneBank mRNA database: a longer transcript containing a 374 bp 5' untranslated region (UTR) adjacent to the first exon, defined as the RefSeq transcript (build 37 assembly by NCBI); a shorter transcript containing a 156 bp 5' UTR 1,000 bp upstream of the first exon, reported in genome-wide transcriptome analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). To validate these two transcripts, we examined the presence of the two distinct <italic>Rab3A </italic>mRNA in mouse brain by RT-PCR and quantitative PCR.

Specifically, the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter gene replaced the first exon of <italic>Rab3A </italic>in a BAC clone (RP433N2) as described by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].

Three cell lines were used: Neuro2a (mouse neuroblastoma), HEK 293 (human embryonic kidney) and Hela (human adenocarcinoma). MCE1 and MCE2 robustly enhanced <italic>Luciferase </italic>activity in the Neuro2a cell line but not at a comparable level in HEK293 and Hela cells under the control of either the MCE3 or SV40 promoter. MCE4 repressed <italic>Luciferase </italic>activity in all three cell lines, even under control of the SV40 enhancer. MCE4 also showed a strong positional effect, in which a position upstream of the MCE3 promoter failed to reduce <italic>Luciferase </italic>expression. MCE5 led to a decrease of <italic>Luciferase </italic>activity under the SV40 promoter and SV40 enhancer. However, when MCE1 and MCE2 induced <italic>Luciferase </italic>activity in Neuro2a cells, MCE5 did not have an effect on <italic>Luciferase </italic>activity. +, twofold increase; ++, fourfold increase; +++, sixfold increase; +/-, no change; - -, fourfold decrease; - - -, sixfold decrease; - - - -, approximately a tenfold decrease.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>To complement the analysis of individual MCEs, we performed an unbiased screen of the 5.5 kb region for any potential <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements by <italic>Luciferase </italic>assay. Fine mapping of the entire 1.5 kb upstream region and the first intron was performed using a series of deletion constructs (Figure S2 in Additional data file 2). Closer inspection by additional <italic>Luciferase </italic>deletion constructs refined the core promoter region to a 64 bp region upstream of the <italic>Rab3A </italic>5' UTR (Figure S3 in Additional data file 2). Although two enhancer elements (Es) were mapped to E1 (-1,435, -1261) and E2 (-345, -123) regions, existence of repressor(s) (in the region between -802 and -346) cannot be excluded (Figure S4 in Additional data file 2). In addition, elements that reduce <italic>Luciferase </italic>activity (Ns) were found in the first intron, N1 (+240, +425) and N2 (+410, +556), and the <italic>Rab3A </italic>3' UTR (+3,362, +3,860) (Figures S5 and S6 in Additional data file 2). Strikingly, all experimentally identified regulatory elements correspond to MCEs. MCE1 (-1,394, -1,216) and MCE2 (-305, -137) closely correlated with the two enhancers, while MCE4 (+281, +500) covered the N1 region and overlapped with the N2 region. Thus, in the case of the <italic>Rab3A </italic>locus, MCEs in intergenic regions are good indicators of critical tissue-specific <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements.</p><p>Next we computationally searched for putative transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) in the 2.8 kb genomic region (starting from1.5 kb upstream to the end of the first intron of <italic>Rab3A</italic>) using the PWM_SCAN tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] and the 546 positional weight matrices (PWMs) corresponding to vertebrate transcription factors in TRANSFAC version 8.4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Based on a <italic>P</italic>-value threshold of 0.0002, we predicted 77 and 23 binding sites in MCE1 and MCE2, respectively. These included well-known neuronal transcription factors NGF1-C, CREB, and EBF1/Olf-1 (Table S2 in Additional data file 1). In addition, MCE4 contained sites for transcription factors REST/NRSF (<italic>P</italic>-value = 0.0001), which might contribute to MCE4's repressor effect.</p><p>A group of binding sites located within a regulatory region may represent a CRM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Therefore, we examined other genes that harbor the same CRM in their upstream regions for a similar expression pattern to that of the <italic>Rab3A </italic>gene. We searched 5 kb upstream regions of approximately 17,000 mouse RefSeq genes (version mm8) for the presence of the same set of binding sites as in <italic>Rab3A </italic>MCEs within a 500 bp window (see Materials and methods). This analysis identified 42 putative gene targets based on the <italic>Rab3A </italic>MCE1 CRM (Table S3 in Additional data file 1) and 13 gene targets based on the MCE2 CRM (data not shown). Next, we tested whether these 42 genes were expressed at significantly high levels in any of the mouse tissues for which genome-wide expression data are available. Based on the genome-wide gene expression profiles for 54 mouse tissues and 7 developmental stages (available in SymAtlas), we tested for each tissue, using the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test (see Materials and methods), whether these 42 putative targets of the MCE1 CRM had a greater expression compared to all other genes. Overall, we found that these 42 genes had higher expression levels in 18 tissues with a <italic>P</italic>-value &#x02264; 0.05, of which 10 tissues were neural tissues such as cerebral cortex, preoptic area and substantia nigra. However, the 13 genes containing MCE2's CRM failed to show significant up-regulation in any of the mouse tissues tested. Our data suggest that at least a subset of CRMs, that is, for <italic>Rab3A </italic>MCE1, might be associated with a specific expression pattern.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of common motifs mediating neuronal-specific expression of the nine presynaptic genes</title><p>Next we hypothesized that co-expression of the nine presynaptic genes (<italic>Rab3A</italic>, <italic>Rab3C</italic>, <italic>Scamp5</italic>, <italic>Snap25</italic>, <italic>Stxbp1</italic>, <italic>Syn1</italic>, <italic>SV2a</italic>, <italic>Camk2N1 </italic>and DNM1) may be mediated via common CRMs. We have previously identified and characterized MCEs of 107 presynaptic genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Assuming that MCEs could serve as a reliable guide in the search for putative neuronal-specific CRMs, we searched for DNA-binding motifs enriched in the upstream MCEs near the nine genes with strong neuronal expression (cluster 1, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>) relative to the upstream MCEs near genes with nonspecific expression pattern (cluster 3, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>).

These 16 motifs are among the TFBSs predicted in <italic>Rab3A </italic>MCE1 and MCE2, including binding sites for the well-known neuronal transcription factors REST/NRSF, CREB and NGF1c. Therefore, we asked if the presence of these sequence motifs is a likely determinant of neuronal-specific gene expression.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Enriched transcription factor binding sites identified in cluster 1 multi-species conserved elements</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Transcription factor</td><td align="center"><italic>P</italic>-value</td><td align="center">FDR (%)</td><td align="left">Brief description</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">AP-2</td><td align="center">0.002</td><td align="center">0.08</td><td align="left">Activating enhancer binding protein 2</td></tr><tr><td align="left">ETF</td><td align="center">0.006</td><td align="center">0.23</td><td align="left">TEA domain family member 2</td></tr><tr><td align="left">CREB</td><td align="center">0.008</td><td align="center">0.32</td><td align="left">cAMP responsive element binding protein</td></tr><tr><td align="left">NRSF</td><td align="center">0.008</td><td align="center">0.33</td><td align="left">RE1-silencing transcription factor</td></tr><tr><td align="left">NGFI-C</td><td align="center">0.009</td><td align="center">0.36</td><td align="left">Nerve growth factor/EGR4</td></tr><tr><td align="left">MyoD</td><td align="center">0.014</td><td align="center">0.64</td><td align="left">Myogenic differentiation 1</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Olf-1</td><td align="center">0.016</td><td align="center">0.80</td><td align="left">Olfactory neuronal TF 1</td></tr><tr><td align="left">E2F</td><td align="center">0.016</td><td align="center">0.80</td><td align="left">E2F family in control of cell cycle and tumor suppression</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Myogenin</td><td align="center">0.028</td><td align="center">1.46</td><td align="left">Myogenin/nuclear factor 1</td></tr><tr><td align="left">NF-kappaB</td><td align="center">0.028</td><td align="center">1.46</td><td align="left">Nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene</td></tr><tr><td align="left">c-Myc:Max</td><td align="center">0.030</td><td align="center">1.57</td><td align="left">Myc proto-oncogene</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Sp1</td><td align="center">0.034</td><td align="center">1.82</td><td align="left">Trans-acting specific protein 1</td></tr><tr><td align="left">AP-4</td><td align="center">0.038</td><td align="center">2.07</td><td align="left">Activating enhancer binding protein 4</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Nrf-1</td><td align="center">0.039</td><td align="center">2.08</td><td align="left">Nuclear respiratory factor 1</td></tr><tr><td align="left">HNF4</td><td align="center">0.041</td><td align="center">2.21</td><td align="left">Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4</td></tr><tr><td align="left">LXR</td><td align="center">0.047</td><td align="center">2.60</td><td align="left">Liver &#x000d7; receptor</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>The enrichment of 16 transcription factor binding sites over-represented in MCEs from cluster 1 genes in comparison to those in cluster 2 or 3 genes with a <italic>P</italic>-value &#x0003c; 0.05.

Specifically, we introduced a scoring function that scores each MCE as a sum of the likelihood-ratio of enrichment for each of the 16 motifs if they are present in the MCE. We ranked 3,347 MCEs by their scores representing the MCE's potential for regulating neuronal-specific expression in the range 0, for non-specific, to approximately 1,000, for the most neuronal-specific element. As expected, MCEs in cluster 1 have a greater score relative to those in cluster 2 (Wilcoxon rank sum <italic>P</italic>-value = 0.0015) and cluster 3 (Wilcoxon rank sum <italic>P</italic>-value = 2.2e-05) (Figure S7 in Additional data file 2).

Apart from already tested <italic>Rab3A </italic>elements (MCE1 and MCE2), we selected 14 high-scoring MCEs (ranging from 1,006 to 90.5) for 12 genes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>; see Materials and methods). Of the fourteen MCEs, eleven belong to cluster 1, two belong to cluster 2, and three belong to cluster 3 genes. In addition, as a negative control, for ten selected genes a low scoring MCE (score = 0) was also randomly chosen, matched with the high score MCE with regard to length and distance to target gene. We assessed the regulatory role of 24 MCEs (14 high scoring and 10 low scoring MCEs) in the <italic>Luciferase </italic>promoter assays, in which the <italic>Luciferase </italic>vector contained a SV40 promoter fused with the coding sequence of the firefly <italic>Luciferase </italic>gene. Tested cell lines included Neuro2a (mouse neuroblastoma cell), MEF (mouse embryonic fibroblast cell), HEK293 (human embryonic kidney cell 293) and Hela (human adenocarcinoma cell). Overall, including the two <italic>Rab3A </italic>MCEs (MCE1 and MCE2), we observed robust enhancer activities driven by 75% (12 of 16) of the high-scoring MCEs and in 30% (3 of 10) of the low-scoring MCEs in Neuro2a cells; none of the tested MCEs increased <italic>Luciferase </italic>expression in MEF, HEK293 and Hela cells except CAMK2G.23, which slightly induced <italic>Luciferase </italic>expression in Hela cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Therefore, a majority (12 MCEs; 75%) of predicted neuronal enhancers revealed a regulatory role in the neuronal cell type. More specifically, of the total 26 MCEs tested, 12 were true positives, 4 were false positives, 7 were true negatives and 3 were false negatives (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). This yields a nominal sensitivity of 12/15 = 80% and a nominal specificity of 7/11 = 63%. Our results, although based on a small testing set, indicate that this scoring strategy based on expression similarity and motif-enrichment provides a powerful tool for the identification of enhancers in a particular tissue of interest, in our case, neuronal tissue/cell type.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Functional validation of 14 high scoring MCEs and 10 low scoring MCEs listed in Table 3</bold>. <italic>Luciferase </italic>constructs were generated by inserting each MCE into the <italic>Luciferase </italic>promoter vector (pGL3p), which contains a SV40 promoter and <italic>Luciferase </italic>coding sequence. <bold>(a-d) </bold>The corresponding <italic>Luciferase </italic>activity was examined in one neuronal cell line, Neuro2a cells (a), and three non-neuronal cell lines, Hela cells (b), HEK293 cells (c) and MEF cells (d).

In this study we have focused on identifying common CRMs mediating neuronal expression, using a combined computational and experimental approach. In order to achieve biological specificity, we have restricted our investigation to neuronal-specific genes of a specific function, namely, presynaptic neurotransmitter release. Using a combination of TFBSs in conserved elements in nine genes with an abundant and restricted expression in neuronal tissues, we developed a combined computational-experimental strategy for the evaluation of the 'neuronal regulatory potential' of MCEs.</p><p>Several slightly different approaches to identify CRMs mediating tissue-specific gene expression have been previously proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Our approach differs from these in a few important ways. For instance, some of the other approaches employed genome-wide selection of co-expressed genes solely based on microarray expression profiles. This may recruit many genes that may belong to diverse pathways, therefore reducing the signal-to-noise ratio in subsequent analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. In contrast, we restricted our analysis to 150 genes known to be involved in synaptic transmission in presynaptic neurons; we further divided them into distinct expression clusters based on neuronal-related and non-neuronal-related tissue types. Nine presynaptic genes were found to have a striking neuronal-specific pattern that is likely co-regulated by common CRMs, whereas 72 genes with widespread and/or low levels of expression served as an internal control.</p><p>A major challenge in the identification of TFBSs is that the binding motifs are usually short and degenerate and thus result in high false positive rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. However, it has been shown that functional binding sites tend to be clustered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Thus, by first identifying enriched motifs in the MCEs near the nine neuronal-specific genes, and by focusing on clustered occurrences of these motifs, we could reduce the rate of false positives. Seventy-two presynaptic genes with non-specific expression served as negative controls, further enhancing the specificity of CRM identification.</p><p>Another challenging issue with many previous computational studies is the arbitrary selection of the proximal promoter region to search for enriched motifs and determine CRMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. As previously shown, selection of evolutionarily conserved sequences from larger intergenic or intronic (MCE) regions may represent an alternative approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Consistent with these previous findings, a detailed experimental delineation of regulatory elements of <italic>Rab3A </italic>revealed a remarkable correspondence between functional elements and evolutionary conservation. However, it has been shown that, in many cases, functional elements are known to reside in non-conserved regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>].</p><p>To capture the contributions of various enriched motifs comprising a CRM, we chose a likelihood-ratio-based scoring metric specifically designed to assess the neuronal regulatory potential of a MCE. Our scoring metric weights the presence of a binding site based on its enrichment <italic>P</italic>-value, such that more enriched (lower <italic>P</italic>-value) motifs are weighted higher. This choice was based on the ability of the scoring metric to discriminate MCEs in the vicinity of genes expressed highly and specifically in neuronal cell types from MCEs near genes that are broadly expressed. In this respect, our approach is most similar to that taken in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], where the authors estimated the weights based on an optimization procedure. Besides the statistical analysis used to verify the specificity of the MCE ranking procedure, we experimentally validated several high-scoring and low-scoring MCEs through a cell line-based <italic>Luciferase </italic>reporter assay. The comparison of neuronal cell line and non-neuronal cells offered, to some extent, a clue as to tissue/cell type specificity. Overall, based on 26 tested MCEs, we were able to predict neuronal-specific expression with roughly 75% sensitivity and 63% specificity. Although we have provided a proof-of-principle, we expect that a scoring metric trained on a larger set of validated neuronal-specific genes would permit a genome-wide prediction of neuronal enhancers.</p><p>From a methodological perspective, the strengths of our study include: carefully selected co-expressed genes with a related function (pathway); a two-pronged approach to determine <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements of one prominent gene - <italic>Rab3A</italic>; reliance on MCEs regardless of their proximity to the gene; pre-determination of enriched motifs to define the CRM; a weighted scoring strategy to rank MCEs according to their neuronal regulatory potential; and experimental validation of a subset of both high-scoring and low-scoring MCEs for their neuronal-specific enhancer properties. Certainly, despite these advantages, we are also aware of several limitations. First, our experimental validation is based on cell-culture experiments. However, <italic>in vitro </italic>methods cannot fully recapitulate endogenous expression patterns. As described in Pennacchio <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], an <italic>in vivo </italic>enhancer assay in transgenic mouse embryos would be a more reliable and conclusive method to evaluate our findings. Moreover, although our scoring system is applicable to a genome-wide prediction of neuronal-specific enhancers, we still need to assess this application on a large set of gene and genomic elements.</p><p>This study focuses on identification of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements responsible for neuronal expression; however, <italic>cis </italic>elements only partly determine gene expression, which is regulated by additional epigenetic factors such as nucleosome positioning, DNA methylation and a number of histone modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Such epigenetic marks play critical roles in gene regulation in higher organisms. For instance, several studies have revealed the critical role of nucleosomes in chromatin structure and remodeling and, ultimately, in gene regulation. Nucleosome occupancy can block access to regulatory elements, thereby inhibiting the binding of transcription factors to specific DNA sequences. To assess the role of nucleosome occupancy, using a previously published computational modeling approach and the software program provided by the authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>], we predicted the nucleosome occupancy probability for the 16 MCEs (including 50 bp flanking sequences). In our study, four MCEs with high scores for enrichment of neuronal-specific motifs did not show any enhancement of <italic>Luciferase </italic>gene expression. We found that relative to the 12 positive elements, the 4 negative elements had significantly greater probability of being occupied by nucleosomes (Mann-Whitney rank sum <italic>P</italic>-value = 0.04). This finding suggests that nucleosome occupancy, in addition to other levels of regulation, needs to be included in the evaluation of regulatory potential of genomic elements.</p><p>Conserved non-coding sequences are not only essential for gene expression, but are also associated with phenotypic variability and human disorders. To date, increasing attention has been focused on changes in <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions, such as substitutions or deletions, that might contribute to species uniqueness and human disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>].

For example, a non-coding single nucleotide polymorphism (RET+3) within a conserved enhancer element in the first intron of RET, a receptor tyrosin kinase, has been reported to be significantly associated with Hirschsprung disease featured by congenital aganglionosis with megacolon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. Our study decoding <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements required for neuronal gene expression could further facilitate investigation of genetic variations in functional regulatory elements, thus greatly improving our knowledge of how regulatory sequences are involved in human diseases.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We selected nine presynaptic genes that were most abundantly expressed in neural tissues and demonstrated, by <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>screens, that MCEs upstream of one of these genes, <italic>Rab3A</italic>, functioned as <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements. We then identified 16 transcription factor binding motifs that were enriched in intergenic MCEs in the vicinity of these nine genes. We devised a computational scoring metric based on the enriched motifs to assess an MCE's potential to function as a neuronal-specific enhancer. This scoring metric was shown to accurately detect neuronal-specific enhancers, based on experimental validation of a number of predicted MCEs using cell based assays. Thus, our study introduces a comprehensive strategy for identification of neuronal specific enhancers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Expression clustering of microarray profiles</title><p>Mouse expression profiles are available from the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]; the data used were based on the analysis across 54 mouse tissues and 7 developmental stages on Affymetrix microarrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>].

We clustered 240 unique oligonucleotide probe sets that interrogated 126 different presynaptic genes into three distinct clusters.

In addition, clustering of expression data placed 19 genes into more than one cluster and these genes were eliminated in the further analysis.
