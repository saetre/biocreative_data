The Dam1 complex is formed by at least nine proteins including Dam1p, Duo1p, Dad1p, Spc19p and Spc34p. In this study, domains of Spc34p that physically interact with other subunits of the complex were mapped using a high-throughput methodology. The method is a combination of two-hybrid screening of a random truncation library of the Spc34 gene and a unique PCR-based amplification that converge the selected DNA fragments to a few short fragments. Duo1p, Dam1p, Dad1p and Spc19p binding domains of Spc34p were mapped on M1-E59, M1-D47, M1-D47 or T207-E295 and S154-Q294, respectively. Most of the boundaries were located at less conserved regions among fungal Spc34p homologs, which is consistent with the boundaries of the putative secondary structures. The accuracy of the mapped domain boundaries was verified using truncated Spc34p polypeptides. The results and methodology we demonstrated herein not only shed light on the molecular architecture of the protein complex but also pave the road to the high-throughput identification of specific interaction domains of proteins whose possible interaction partners have been identified in genome-scale analyses.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Interactions between proteins play crucial roles in the structural architecture of cells and organelles as well as functional organization of biological reactions executed in, on and between cells. An entire corpus of all the possible protein&#x02013;protein interactions in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> has been emerging due to comprehensive and exhaustive protein&#x02013;protein interaction analyses using the yeasts two-hybrid system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c3">3</xref>) or large-scale analysis of protein complexes using affinity-column chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c4">4</xref>). The function of a novel protein found in an interaction cluster with well-characterized proteins can be annotated to be the same biological context as the characterized proteins. In addition to functional annotation, the molecular organization of the protein complex can be indicated by the new members of the interaction cluster. In the comprehensive two-hybrid analysis, such interaction clusters have been discovered in, for example, autophagy-related proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c3">3</xref>), vesicular transport system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c3">3</xref>), calmodulin-dependent protein kinase Cdc28 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c2">2</xref>) and kinetochore-related proteins including Dam1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c3">3</xref>). Thus, the information from the huge protein&#x02013;protein interaction network gives clues for subsequent analyses on the respective interactions or protein complexes.</p><p>One of the next important milestones in yeast&#x02019;s functional genomics is the systematic analyses of &#x02018;interaction targeting&#x02019; where the specific interactions between endogenous proteins are disrupted by constitutive/conditional knockout methods such as over-expression of the binding domain as an antagonist (reviewed by Ito <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c5">5</xref>). Such methodology allows for the roles of individual interactions in a biological context to be validated. However, one of the bottlenecks to be overcome is the low throughput of interaction domain identification. Conventional methods for domain mapping usually require either preliminary information on protein structure, or time-consuming, trial-and-error analysis of domain boundaries. A novel high-throughput method with well-formatted procedure would be advantageous for the interaction domain identification. Such a high-throughput method would be useful for elucidation of the molecular orientation and structural organization of newly discovered protein complexes in a particular interaction cluster as well as the interaction targeting. The information on the structural/functional domains responsible for the inter-subunits&#x02019; binding can give important clues to allow an understanding of how the protein complex is constructed and coordinated, and how the entire function of the complex is controlled.</p><p>Dam1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c7">7</xref>), also known as DASH complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c8">8</xref>), is the yeast outer kinetochore complex consisting of Dam1p, Duo1p, Dad1p, Ask1p, Spc19p, Spc34p and some other recently found subunits such as Dad2p &#x0005b;also called Hsk1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c8">8</xref>)&#x0005d;, Dad3p and Dad4p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c9">9</xref>). Recent physiological and genetic analyses show that the complex is physically attached to the nuclear microtubule and central kinetochore, and plays crucial roles in metaphase and anaphase spindle integrity maintenance as well as organized segregation of sister chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c8">8</xref>, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c11">11</xref>), possibly under the control of phosphorylation by aurora B kinase (Ipl1p complex; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c9">9</xref>). The physical interactions between the subunits were originally discovered in the comprehensive interaction analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c3">3</xref>). All members except for Ask1p and recently found Dad2-4 subunits show physical interaction with Spc34p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c3">3</xref>), suggesting Spc34p plays a pivotal role as a scaffold within the Dam1 complex.</p><p>In this work, we performed an exhaustive identification of the interaction domains of Spc34p for the other subunits using a unique high-throughput methodology that can be efficiently applied to the systematic identification of interaction domains and interaction targeting. The domain boundaries mapped with this method were verified, indicating a high degree of accuracy of the mapped domain boundaries. Subunit orientations of the Dam1 complex revealed in this work and an overview of the potential molecular architecture of the complex is also discussed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>DNA polymerases such as Taq and Ex-Taq DNA polymerases, and some other DNA modification enzymes including DNA ligase and restriction enzymes were purchased from TaKaRa (Japan) unless otherwise stated. Pfu-turbo DNA polymerase was from Stratagene. Conventional yeast two-hybrid system (MATCHMAKER Gal4 Two-Hybrid System ver. 1) was purchased from BD Biosciences (CA). Oligo nucleotides for conventional PCR, PASA-PCR and DNA sequence analysis were from FASMAC (Japan).</p></sec><sec><title>Construction of the prey vector pGAD424-TA</title><p>Plasmid pGAD424-TA was the derivative of a conventional vector pGAD424 (BD Biosciences). After the elimination of pGAD424 endogenous EcoRV site by site-directed mutagenesis, another EcoRV site was introduced to the multiple cloning sites by PCR using oligonucleotides (ERV-gad424f, ATCGGATCCGTCGACCTGCAGAGAT, and ERV-gad424r, ATCTGGATCCCCGGGAATTCGATCT) as primers. The resulting plasmid, termed pGAD424-TA, was verified by DNA sequencing of the multiple cloning sites and leucine complementation analysis. The resulting plasmid was digested with EcoRV, then treated with Taq DNA polymerase under a typical buffer condition (recommended in manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol) in the presence of 2 mM dTTP for 2 h at 70&#x000b0;C to attach extra-dTs at both 3&#x02032;-ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c12">12</xref>). Modified pGAD424-TA was purified with phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation, then used as a T-vector for the following random truncation library construction.</p></sec><sec><title>Plasmids for baits</title><p>Yeast cDNAs for Dam1 complex subunits were prepared from total RNA of strain TM101 by reverse transcriptase&#x02013;PCR with ORF-specific primers. The resulting gene fragments were cloned into the unique SmaI site of the conventional two-hybrid bait vector pGBT9. The DNA sequences of the resulting plasmids were verified, then designated as pGBT9-X (X &#x0003d; Duo1, Dam1, Dad1 or Spc19).</p></sec><sec><title>Construction of truncation library of Spc34 by DNase I random digestion and TA-cloning</title><p>Five micrograms of PCR-amplified DNA fragment containing the entire Spc34p coding region was added to a reaction mixture consisting of 20 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub> and an appropriate amount of DNase I (Ambion, TX) and allowed to be randomly digested for 5 min at 37&#x000b0;C to give an average of one or two breaks per gene. The reaction was stopped by the addition of phenol/chloroform solution. After ethanol precipitation, the digested fragments were treated with Ex-Taq DNA polymerase in the presence of 0.2 mM dNTPs to form dA-protruding 3&#x02032; ends. The DNA fragments were then fractionated by 0.7&#x00025; agarose gel electrophoresis and fragments ranging from 400 bp to full-length in size were gel-purified. The purified fragments were ligated to 100 ng of the T-vector at 12&#x000b0;C for 12 h, followed by transformation of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> DH5&#x003b1;-FT to construct an Spc34 random truncation library. The resulting bacterial colonies grown on the LB plates containing ampicillin were pooled, and plasmid DNA was isolated using the alkaline&#x02013;SDS method. The pool of plasmids, designated pGAD-Spc34<sub>frag</sub> library, was used as the prey library in the following yeast two-hybrid screening.</p></sec><sec><title>Yeast two-hybrid screening and convergence of the selected fragments using PASA-PCR</title><p>Two-hybrid screening of interaction-positive clones was carried out according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol (BD Biosciences). Briefly, <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> strain HF7c cells carrying pGAD-Spc34<sub>frag</sub> library were transformed using the pGBT9-X and then spread on agar plates of synthetic medium that lacks leucine, tryptophan and histidine supplemented with appropriate amount of 3-AT. It should be noted that the diversity of the insert fragment was acceptably retained during the competent cell preparation, since the analysis of na&#x000ef;ve fragment library using colony-directed PCR (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 60) showed no significant changes in the size variation between before and after the competent cell preparation. The resulting colonies (more than 1000 clones) on the selection plates were scraped with a spreader and pooled in a tube. Plasmids were harvested from the pool using a conventional method based on cell-lytic enzyme Zymolyase (Seikagaku-Kogyo, Japan), and used as templates for PASA-PCR. PASA-PCR was carried out as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c13">13</xref>) using pGAD424-specific primers (pasa-adf, ATACCCCACCAAACCCAAAA and pasa-adr, ACGATTCATAGATCTCTGCAGG) with Pfu-Turbo DNA polymerase. The reaction condition was as follows; 30 cycles of 94&#x000b0;C for 30 s, slow cooling at the constant rate of 0.2&#x000b0;C s<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> to 58&#x000b0;C, and 58&#x000b0;C 5 s, followed by 10 cycles of 94&#x000b0;C 30 s, 53&#x000b0;C 30 s and 72&#x000b0;C 60 s. After the amplification, the products were mixed with EcoRV-digested pGAD424-TA, and used for the transformation of HF7c competent cells with pGBT9-X (X &#x0003d; Duo1, Dam1, Dad1 or Spc19). Resulting transformants on the selection plates were then subjected to DNA sequence analysis to identify the boundary sequences at the cloning site.</p></sec><sec><title>Sequence alignment and secondary structure prediction</title><p>Polypeptide sequence alignment of Spc34p with other closely related yeast homologs was carried out using &#x02018;Fungal Alignment&#x02019; of the <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> Genome Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.yeastgenome.org/">http://www.yeastgenome.org/</ext-link>). The secondary structures of Spc34p were analyzed using Chou-Fasman secondary structure prediction program compiled in a conventional gene/protein analysis software (GENETYX-MAC, ver. 11.2.0., Software Development Co.

Coiled-coil structure was predicted using COILS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c14">14</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/COILS_form.html">http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/COILS_form.html</ext-link>) or MultiCoil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c15">15</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://multicoil.lcs.mit.edu/cgi-bin/multicoil">http://multicoil.lcs.mit.edu/cgi-bin/multicoil</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Design of the methodology for high-throughput identification of interaction domains</title><p>The methodology for high-throughput identification of interaction domains is schematically illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg888f1">1</xref>. First, the fragment library of the interesting gene is constructed to give combinatorial endpoints to the target gene sequence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg888f1">1</xref>A, step I): a fragment encompassing the entire protein coding region is prepared by PCR using gene-specific primers, then subjected to DNase I random digestion. Subsequently, the digested fragments are treated with Taq DNA polymerase with 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity (e.g. TaKaRa Ex-Taq DNA polymerase) to remove single stranded ends and add additional dA at their 3&#x02032; ends. The trimmed double stranded fragments are then ligated with pGAD424-TA vector of which ends are modified in advance by Taq DNA polymerase with dTTP. The ligation reaction based on the complementary T-A pair allows stoichiometric insertion of the random digested fragments to the vectors, and prevents self-ligation of the vector as well as concatemarization of insert fragments (data not shown).</p><p>Secondly, <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> HF7c were transformed by the fragment library plasmid and then by bait-expression plasmid pGBT9-X to perform two-hybrid screening (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg888f1">1</xref>A, step II). In the two-hybrid screening, every possible clone bearing the endpoints acceptable for the specific interaction is selected. Although we employed the classical vectors and host strain (HF7c) for the two-hybrid screening to show the feasibility and generality of our system, other useful host strains and screening systems such as the diploid cell-based two-hybrid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c17">17</xref>) or commercially available LexA-based two-hybrid system (e.g. BD Biosciences) with inducible promoters are potentially compatible.</p><p>In step III, the interaction-positive fragments are converged to a single or few clones. Although every clone selected in step II should encompass the region responsible for the specific interaction (shown in red boxes in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg888f1">1</xref>), most of the selected clones have flanking sequence on either or both sides of that region. PASA-PCR (<bold>p</bold>referential <bold>a</bold>mplification of the <bold>s</bold>hortest <bold>a</bold>mplicon using modified PCR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c13">13</xref>) is used to enrich the shortest fragment that carries the least flanking sequence. The amplification manner of PASA-PCR is the PCR adaptation of <italic>in vitro</italic> evolution using Q&#x003b2; RNA replicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c18">18</xref>), where the shorter duplicating RNA molecules were propagated more efficiently by iterative cycles of <italic>in vitro</italic> selection and amplification. PASA-PCR consists of iterative cycles (typically, 30&#x02013;50 cycles) of denaturation of template DNAs and an extremely abbreviated annealing/extension period (&#x0003c;5 s), followed by an additional 10 cycles of conventional PCR to raise the yield of the converged products. Because of the short annealing/extension period, the numbers of cycles necessary for the amplicon to duplicate are dependent on their sizes, as discussed in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c13">13</xref>). The strength of PASA-PCR is its ability to facilitate homologous recombination. In PASA-PCR, primers cannot complete their extension within a single cycle, so that prematurely extended primers anneal on another template in the following cycles (template switching based on <italic>in vitro</italic> homologous recombination, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg888f1">1</xref>B). As a result, the effective concentration of templates is reduced for the primer that started its extension on the templates with long flanking sequences (the primer PA in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg888f1">1</xref>B) in the previous cycle, yet it remains unchanged for the primer that started on the short template (the primer PB in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg888f1">1</xref>B). This difference in the effective concentration allows the shortest amplicon to duplicate more efficiently than the longer ones. In addition, the homologous recombination between the prematurely extended primers occurs, resulting in the generation of novel combinations of the endpoints (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg888f1">1</xref>B). Fragments thus generated are shorter than the other fragments, so that they are amplified more efficiently in the following cycles. Moreover, such recombination means that we do not have to construct a huge initial random fragment library to cover every possible combination of endpoints. Thus, owing to this property, a relatively small (as few as 10<sup>4&#x02013;5</sup> clones for the gene of &#x0003c;1000 bp) library is sufficient for the exhaustive screening.</p><p>In the final step, the converged fragments are polished by a second round of two-hybrid analysis with the specific binding partner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg888f1">1</xref>A, step IV). To avoid laborious gel-purification or ligation reaction, the converged fragments are mixed with pGAD424-TA vector linearized by EcoRV digestion and the mix is used directly for transformation via homologous recombination <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c19">19</xref>). Following the screening, the fragments are then amplified using colony-directed PCR from the yeast colonies and the products are used as templates for DNA sequencing.</p></sec><sec><title>Selection of interaction-positive Spc34 fragments and their convergence by PASA-PCR</title><p>We performed the interaction domain mapping of Spc34p for the interaction partners as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg888f1">1</xref>. Yeast HF7c cells harboring pGAD-Spc34<sub>frag</sub> (consisting of 10<sup>4</sup> independent clones with various insert sizes) were transformed by plasmid pGBT9-X (X represents respective genes for interaction partners including Dam1p, Duo1p, Dad1p and Spc19p) then allowed to grow on selection plates. The cells showing Spc34<sub>frag</sub>-dependent growth (&#x0223c;1000&#x02013;1500 colonies/interaction partner) were pooled, and their plasmids were subjected to PASA-PCR-convergence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg888f2">2</xref>). It should be noted that we used a pair of pGAD424-specific primers, pasa-adf and pasa-adr (see Materials and Methods for their sequences), for PASA-PCR. These primers were designed to anneal to positions remote from the cloning site in order to facilitate <italic>in vivo</italic> homologous recombination in the following subcloning step (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg888f1">1</xref>A, step IV). The fragments amplified by these primers, therefore, contain an extra 88 bp sequence derived from the prey vector besides the insert sequence.</p><p>The convergence of fragments occurred successfully for each interaction partner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg888f2">2</xref>). Spc34 fragments responsible for Dam1p and Duo1p interactions appeared &#x0223c;290 bp. Amplification of the fragments by conventional PCR (lanes C) resulted in a major fragment at 1000 bp with some minor bands at the lower positions. The major band in lane C was a product from the clone bearing undigested Spc34 (data not shown). A comparison of the size-distribution of the fragments amplified by PASA-PCR with those by conventional PCR clearly shows how efficiently PASA-PCR enriches rarely existing short fragments from the pool of binding-positive fragments.</p><p>In addition to these interaction domains, converged PCR products were also obtained in Dad1p interacting fragments as templates, although the convergence was not strict (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg888f2">2</xref>). The fragments converged to three fragments with distinctive sizes (bands of migration points of 380 and 250 bp with the smallest band &#x0223c;200 bp). In this case, the smallest fragments of &#x0003c;200 bp might be false-positive fragments likely generated by misannealing of the primers, since any insert fragments responsible for the smallest band were not found in the pool selected in the following step (data not shown). As shown below, the remaining two fragments encoded two distinct regions of Spc34p, suggesting that the two fragments were converged independently. As described above, one of the principal driving forces for the convergence is <italic>in vitro</italic> homologous recombination between prematurely extended primers, therefore, competition does not occur between two independent sequences. This is the reason why the two fragments with different (but similar) sizes were converged independently.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA sequence analysis of the converged fragments</title><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg888f3">3</xref> shows the endpoint positions of the interaction-positive inserts converged by PASA-PCR. For each interaction partners, five or more clones were sequenced, and the endpoints found at the cloning site were annotated on the Spc34p amino acid sequence. In each case, the identified endpoints were focused on a single, or a few specific positions. For example, three out of five of the fragments for the Dam1p interaction had an identical C-terminal endpoint at D47. Likewise, C-terminal endpoints for Duo1p interaction were mainly mapped at E59. Further analysis of more clones (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 18 clones) showed that nearly 90&#x00025; had an identical endpoint at E59, suggesting a significant convergence. The sizes of these regions were consistent with those amplified by PASA-PCR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg888f2">2</xref>). These data also suggest that the shortest amplicon among the selected fragments was successfully enriched, so that the major endpoint in the converged fragments likely appears as a &#x02018;critical endpoint&#x02019;. Moreover, the high intensity of the convergence suggests that DNA sequence analysis of several clones is sufficient to find the critical endpoint. This would be a very convenient property for high-throughput identification of interaction domains, where many domains need to be identified simultaneously in the limited resources for DNA sequencing analysis (e.g. colony picking, template preparation, sequence data analysis, etc.). In contrast, the region for Spc19p interaction was mapped in the latter part of Spc34 sequence (around S154-Q294, depicted in black arrows). These suggest that Spc34p likely consists of two or more independent folding units.</p><p>While the convergence in their endpoints was obviously detected, the region responsible for Dad1p interaction domain was mapped to two distinct regions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg888f3">3</xref>, depicted in orange arrows). Three out of 16 of the selected fragments (19&#x00025;) contained the region for N-terminal 47 residues of Spc34p (M1-D47), and the rest (81&#x00025;) had the C-terminal 89 residues (T207-E295). The respective sizes of the allocated regions were consistent with the sizes of the fragments amplified by PASA-PCR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg888f2">2</xref>). Their appearance frequencies in the selected clones were likely consistent with the intensities of their amplified products (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg888f2">2</xref>). These results suggest that Dad1p subunit can attach to either or both of the regions. In addition, the positions of these critical endpoints were mapped on the region where the local amino acid sequence was less conserved among closely related homologous proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg888f3">3</xref>), suggesting correlation of the endpoints with the structure of Spc34p.</p><p>A relationship between putative secondary structures of Spc34p and the converged endpoints are also shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg888f3">3</xref>. Except for those at the N- or C-termini of Spc34p, the most critical endpoints were found at the boundaries of predicted secondary structures. For example, the C-terminal endpoints of the fragments for Dam1p or Dad1p interaction appeared at the same position (D47), where is the boundary of a putative loop and &#x003b2;-strand. Similarly, the critical endpoint for Duo1p occurred between a putative &#x003b2;-turn and &#x003b2;-strand, and the endpoints for Spc19p were spread within the putative domain linker where serine residues appear in high frequency. The coincidences between critical endpoints and the boundaries of putative secondary structures were also found when we used alternative secondary structure-prediction programs such as GOR 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c19">19</xref>), or GOR 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c20">20</xref>), whereas somewhat less significant coincidences were found when GOR 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c21">21</xref>) or PSIPRED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c22">22</xref>) was used instead (data not shown).</p><p>Interestingly, another critical endpoint for Dad1p interaction was found at T207 from where the putative &#x003b1;-helix starts. The &#x003b1;-helix and the following two &#x003b1;-helices contain periodical appearance of hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acid residues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg888f3">3</xref>, represented as serial alphabets colored in red and blue, respectively), suggesting that these three putative helices can be involved in coiled-coil structures to form interaction surface(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c14">14</xref>). The predicted structures for these putative coiled coils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c15">15</xref>) indicate their propensity to form trimeric coils rather than dimeric coils. Although the prediction program does not find any typical coiled structures in the opposite Dad1p sequence, the periodical hydrophobic residues interrupted by glycines and an intervening sequence is located in the center of the Dad1p sequence as follows: V27-<bold>L</bold>QE<bold>I</bold>NET<bold>M</bold>NS<bold>I</bold>LNG<bold>L</bold>NG<bold>L</bold>NIS<bold>L</bold>ESSIAVGRE<bold>F</bold>QS<bold>V</bold>SDL<bold>W</bold>KT<bold>L</bold>YDG<bold>L</bold>ES<bold>L</bold>SDE<bold>A</bold>-P81, where letters in bold represent the periodical hydrophobic residues. The periodicity of hydrophobic residues with the intervening sequence is completely conserved among Dad1p homologs of the closely related yeasts including <italic>S.bayanus</italic> and <italic>S.paradoxus</italic> (Fungal Alignment, SGD webpage). The conserved sequence is also found in distantly related homologous proteins such as a putative gene product of <italic>Ashbya gossypii</italic> (accession no. E66080) and <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (accession no. AX488771), suggesting that the importance of irregular repeat with intervening sequence in Dad1p function (data not shown), and the possible interaction manner between Spc34p C-terminal region and Dad1p is coiled-coil. Although it is no more than a speculation, the first coil-like structure of Spc34p as well as its homologs also has an atypical repeat disrupted by P222, which may correspond to the irregular repeat in Dad1p.</p><p>On the other hand, another region for Dad1p interaction was mapped on the N-terminal of Spc34p, which is identical to the one identified for Dam1p interaction. The coincidence of the critical endpoints in the prey molecule (in this case, it is Spc34p fragment) may suggest that either of the bait subunits (Dam1p or Dad1p) requires the other as a bridge to form bait&#x02013;prey interaction complex. It should be noted that, as mentioned by Vidal and Legrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c23">23</xref>), it is possible that a two-hybrid analysis of two indirectly associated proteins can give a positive signal occasionally by the bridge of yeast&#x02019;s endogenous protein. In that case, the identified binding domain against the given bait is, in reality, the domain for the bridging protein. The same domain is, therefore, mapped when the bridge protein is used as the bait instead. In our case, however, it is not obvious which subunit is the bridge for the other. Since the ambiguity in the composition of bait&#x02013;prey complex as well as less accuracy in interaction-intensity quantification are intrinsic to two-hybrid assay, another extensive <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis using purified subunits is required to clarify the precise organization of subunits.</p><p>The region responsible for Spc19p binding was mapped on S154-Q294. This region encompasses the entire coiled-coil structures on which the Dad1p binding site was mapped. According to the coiled-coil prediction program, Spc19p also has three obvious coiled-coil structures for trimeric coils. Therefore, it is possible that Spc19p and Dad1p likely form trimeric coils together with the C-terminal region of Spc34p. However, in addition to the coiled-coil interaction, our data indicate that an additional sequence (S154-P206) besides the coiled-coil region is required to interact with Spc19p. In fact, N-terminal truncation of Spc34p to D170 showed a significant loss of binding affinity to Spc19p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c13">13</xref>), clearly indicating that the coiled-coil interaction is not sufficient to stabilize the putative trimer. Together with the irregular periodicity in Dad1p subunits, the evidence suggests that the architecture on the C-terminal region of Spc34p would be more complicated than a typical coiled-coil interaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Accuracy of the domain boundaries mapped as critical endpoints</title><p>Accuracy of the domain boundaries is another important criterion as well as the throughput of the process. Pin-point identification of the domain boundary guarantees reliable structural information that can give insight to the function of the polypeptide, and is essential for elucidating structure&#x02013;function relationships of proteins.</p><p>While the &#x02018;critical&#x02019; endpoints of Spc34p fragments for Duo1p and Dam1p interactions were different (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg888f3">3</xref>), they were located close to each other. The endpoints for Dam1p mainly converged at D49 with variations in R52 and D56, whereas the ones for Duo1p show higher convergence at E59, which is just outside of the region mapped for Dam1p binding. We constructed a series of truncation mutants of Spc34p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg888f4">4</xref>) on the basis of the predicted secondary structures and sequence similarity between the homologous proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg888f3">3</xref>), and tested their interactions with the binding partners.</p><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg888f4">4</xref> shows the result of the binding assay between truncated mutants of Spc34p and Duo1p or Dam1p. These data clearly indicate that the critical endpoints converged by PASA-PCR are on the boundaries of the respective interaction domains. In both cases, there were no binding regions outside of the converged region. Further deletions within the critical endpoints did not allow the host cells to grow on the selection plate except for the truncation mutant termed Spc34p(1-50). Nevertheless, the expression level of the reporter &#x003b2;-galactosidase in the clone was significantly reduced compared to that of the clone expressing Spc34p(1-59). The result suggests the importance of the putative &#x003b2;-turn (K53-H57, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg888f3">3</xref>) proximal to the critical endpoints (E59) in the efficient interaction between Spc34p and Duo1p. In addition, the C-terminal endpoint giving the highest &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity (E59, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg888f4">4</xref>) was coincident with the position that converged by PASA-PCR. This suggests the endpoint that gave maximum binding activity was preferentially enriched by PASA-PCR and the following two-hybrid assay.</p><p>The binding assay with pGBT9-Dam1 showed the weak &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity compared with full-length of Spc34p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg888f4">4</xref>), suggesting that the rest of the region (D47-E295) is required to facilitate/stabilize the interaction between the N-terminal region of Spc34p and Dam1p. Since the D47-E295 region did not show obvious signs of direct interaction with Dam1p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg888f4">4</xref>), another factor that interacts within the D47-E295 region may stabilize the binding between N-terminal region and Dam1p. Dad1p is the primary candidate for the stabilizing molecule, because of the following reasons: (i) a physical interaction between Dad1p and Dam1p has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c3">3</xref>). (ii) Dad1p had two independent binding regions on Spc34p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg888f3">3</xref>). Moreover, (iii) the boundary of Spc34p for Dad1p interaction was coincident with that for Dam1p interaction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg888f3">3</xref>). Although the coincidence of the boundary may suggest the bridging effect as discussed above, it also likely suggests co-operative interaction of Dad1p and Dam1p with the N-terminal region of Spc34p to form a stable trimeric cluster.</p></sec><sec><title>Subunit orientations and molecular architecture of the Dam1 complex</title><p>A summary of the structural information of the Dam1 complex formed around Spc34p revealed in this work is illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg888f5">5</xref>. Other Dam1 complex members not involved in direct interaction with Spc34p as well as those whose specific interaction partners are not yet clarified are included in this figure. Recent findings in inter-subunit network (depicted in gray) reported by another research group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c24">24</xref>) are also involved.</p><p>The foundation is built upon the N-terminal 59 residues and C-terminal 140 residues of Spc34p. The binding &#x02018;scaffolds&#x02019; in the termini can be spatially located in proximity by the simultaneous interaction of the small Dad1p (94 aa). An hypothesis of the co-operative assembly of Dad1p&#x02013;Dam1p on the N-terminal scaffold is also represented in this figure.</p><p>Duo1p is another member that interacts with Spc34p in the N-terminal scaffold. The interaction manner between Duo1p&#x02013;Spc34p and Dam1p/Dad1p&#x02013;Spc34p is neither competitive nor exclusive. First, physical interaction of Duo1p&#x02013;Dam1p has been found experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c24">24</xref>, also depicted in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg888f5">5</xref>). Secondly, the proteins are simultaneously immunoprecipitated as constituents of the Dam1 complex with stoichiometric (1:1) molecular ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c9">9</xref>). Therefore, Duo1p and Dam1p/Dad1p possibly interact with the scaffold simultaneously, while it is not apparent whether they assemble on the scaffold independently or synergistically.</p><p>The function of the outer kinetochore Dam1 complex is to tether microtubule with central kinetochore complexes (review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c11">11</xref>, also shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg888f5">5</xref>). The Dam1p subunit plays important role in this function. The subunit likely acts as an interface between the Dam1 complex and central kinetochore protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c3">3</xref>). It is known that the subunit executes the association/dissociation of the complex with/from the center kinetochore under the control of aurora B kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c9">9</xref>). Spc19p could also be another interface involved in the complex&#x02013;complex interaction, since the physical interaction with Ndc80p has been found in the comprehensive interaction analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c3">3</xref>). However, the mechanism of regulation of the interaction between Spc19p and Ndc80p is unclear, since Spc19p is not aurora B kinase substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c9">9</xref>). In addition, an Spc19 mutant strain lacking potential sites for phosphorylation in Spc19p does not show significant changes in phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c9">9</xref>), suggesting that interaction between Spc19p and Ndc80p is not regulated by Spc19p phosphorylation. Interestingly, Spc34p has an aurora B kinase-target site at T199 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg888c9">9</xref>), where the Spc19p-binding domain was mapped (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg888f3">3</xref>). A detailed analysis of the relationship between Spc34p phosphorylation at T199 and the function of Spc19p would elucidate a novel regulation mechanism of the complex&#x02013;complex interaction.</p><p>Thus, the accurate and high-throughput mapping of interaction domains provides structural insight into the molecular orientations and architectural design of protein complexes. Further information of the complexes will be obtained by the systematic interaction targeting, where the conditional/ constitutive antagonists for the specific interactions are designed on the basis of the domain information obtained in the high-throughput identification. Our methodology is sufficiently applicable and amenable to the high-throughput identification. The process is a combination of the construction and functional screening of combinatorial endpoints libraries (i.e. combinatorial bioengineering) and convergence of selected clones to enrich the critical endpoints (i.e. <italic>in vitro</italic> evolution). We believe this is a powerful tool in functional genome analysis, where innovations in high-throughput processing techniques have made significant breakthroughs.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg888f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> (<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the framework for the high-throughput identification of protein interaction domains.
