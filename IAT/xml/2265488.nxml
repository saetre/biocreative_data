Opa1 is a member of the dynamin family of proteins. This family consists of several large GTP binding proteins with diverse cellular functions. The archetypal dynamin is required for endocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000022-vanderBliek1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000022-vanderBliek2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, but two other dynamin-related proteins, Drp1 and Mitofusins in mammals, act along with Opa1 to control mitochondrial fission and fusion. Mitochondrial fission and fusion are dynamic processes required for the replenishment of mitochondria, for example in long neuronal projections and during cell growth and division. Mitochondrial fission facilitates the redistribution of mitochondria in response to local changes in the demand for ATP, while mitochondrial fusion is needed to exchange mtDNA and other components that may become damaged over time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000022-Okamoto1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000022-Chan1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. The rates of fission and fusion vary depending on cell type and environmental cues, but these rates are usually balanced. This balance is controlled by the opposing actions of the different dynamin family members on or in mitochondria.</p><p>The three dynamin-related proteins that affect mitochondria have different topologies and play different roles in fission and fusion. Mammalian Drp1 and the homologous proteins in C. elegans and yeast are cytosolic proteins that are required for mitochondrial division <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000022-Labrousse1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000022-Bleazard1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

Fusion between mitochondrial outer membranes is mediated by a different set of dynamin family members <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000022-Hermann1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. These proteins are called Mitofusins in mammals and Fzo1 in yeast and Drosophila. They have two transmembrane segments that anchor the proteins in the mitochondrial outer membrane.

In contrast, cultured mammalian cells transfected with Opa1 siRNA typically show the stronger effects that are associated with complete loss of Opa1 function.

There is, however, still a 66.2&#x00025; decrease of total cristae length when normalized with the lengths of inner boundary membranes or a 70.3&#x00025; decrease when normalized with the surface area of the mitochondrial section. We conclude that most <italic>eat-3</italic> mitochondria have fewer cristae than wildtype mitochondria.</p><p>Some mutant mitochondria have long inner membrane invaginations, which could in principle be enlarged cristae, but are more likely membrane folds resulting from a surplus of inner membrane (&#x0201c;3&#x0201d; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000022-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). It is, however, not clear from the EM sections whether these membrane folds are attached to the rim. In addition, many <italic>eat-3</italic> mitochondria have internal curved or ring-shaped structures formed by two concentric membranes enclosing a matrix-like material (&#x0201c;4&#x0201d; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000022-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). These membrane inclusions are <italic>eat-3-</italic>specific, since they were not observed in wildtype animals.

Given their internal location, all of these membrane inclusions are likely to be derived from the inner membrane.</p><p>To determine whether the various membrane inclusions observed in thin sections are connected outside of the plane of view, we made three-dimensional reconstructions of mitochondria using electron tomography.

There was no increase in the numbers of dying cells in <italic>eat-3</italic> embryos, nor was there suppression of the <italic>eat-3</italic> broodsize defects in the double mutants. <italic>C. elegans</italic> does have several other caspases (<italic>csp-1</italic>, <italic>csp-2</italic> and <italic>csp-3</italic>), but RNAi of these genes had no effect on <italic>eat-3</italic> animals (data not shown) nor are they known to contribute to apoptotic cell death in <italic>C. elegan</italic>s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000022-Stergiou1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>.

In summary, none of the RNAi treatments or chromosomal mutations in cell death genes showed a suppressive effect on <italic>eat-3</italic> mutants, from which we conclude that caspase-dependent cell death does not contribute to the pathology of <italic>eat-3</italic> in worms.</p><p>Mammalian cells transfected with Opa1 siRNA are more sensitive to apoptosis inducing agents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000022-Olichon4">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>, but there is also evidence that patients with dominant optic atrophy have reduced levels of ATP, which could trigger retinal ganglion cell degeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000022-Lodi1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. The gross anatomical phenotypes of <italic>C. elegans eat-3</italic> mutants, such as small size, slow growth and reduced broodsize are consistent with caloric restriction as observed in feeding mutants with pharyngeal defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000022-Avery1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000022-Morck1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. The small brood sizes of <italic>eat-3</italic> mutants are not due to retention of eggs, nor are there increased numbers of dead eggs or larvae on plates (data not shown). There is, however, a paucity of nuclei in the gonads of eat-3 RNAi animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000022-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), consistent with the production of fewer oocytes. Fewer oocytes could reflect reduced rates of mitotic division at the distal tip of the gonad, since it was previously shown that mutations in mitochondrial proteins can inhibit cell division through the actions of AMP kinase and cyclin E <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000022-Mandal1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>. Oocyte production might also be compromised at later stages, since the availability of yolk protein and other major constituents of oocytes is affected by the metabolic state of the animal. Many of the <italic>eat-3</italic> mutant phenotypes are therefore attributable to a general breakdown in mitochondrial function.</p><p>Earlier studies of yeast Mgm1 mutants show progressive loss of mtDNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000022-Shepard1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000022-Wong1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

Defects in oxidative phosphorylation proteins can result in fewer and shorter cristae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000022-Paumard1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>, which would be confined to those matrix compartments that have lost their mtDNA. Selective loss of cristae due to stochastic loss of mtDNA agrees with our electron microscopy data, since that data shows a heterogeneous mixture of mitochondrial matrix compartments, some with severely disrupted cristae and others with seemingly wildtype cristae (pairs of arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000022-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). The observation of different types of matrices enclosed by a single mitochondrial outer membrane suggests that the outer membranes of <italic>eat-3</italic> mutant mitochondria fuse irrespective of their mtDNA content, but the mitochondrial inner membranes fail to fuse, similar to the results obtained with Mgm1 in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000022-Meeusen1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The ability to suppress <italic>eat-3(ad426)</italic> defects with <italic>drp-1</italic> RNAi and mutations in <italic>drp-1</italic> is consistent with stochastic loss of mtDNA in <italic>eat-3</italic> mutants.

There are, however, several observations suggesting that the mitochondrial fusion defect and the resulting loss of mtDNA might not be the only causes of sickness in <italic>eat-3</italic> mutants: First, <italic>drp-1</italic> RNAi does not rescue the <italic>C. elegans eat-3(tm1107)</italic> deletion allele, while it does rescue the <italic>eat-3(ad426)</italic> allele. Second, <italic>C. elegans fzo-1(tm1133)</italic> mutant animals are not as severely affected as <italic>eat-3</italic> mutants, nor are they rescued by <italic>drp-1</italic> RNAi (data not shown), even though one might expect them to be equally susceptible to loss of mtDNA, since yeast Fzo1 mutants do lose their mtDNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000022-Hermann1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000022-Rapaport1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref> and they are rescued by mutations in Dnm1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000022-Wong1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000022-Fekkes1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000022-Mozdy1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

We conclude that lack of ATP due to loss of mtDNA is not enough to explain why optic nerves are singled out for destruction in patients with dominant optic atrophy.</p><p>Our results suggest an alternative explanation for the sickness of <italic>C. elegans eat-3</italic> mutants, which may also be relevant for the selective degeneration of retinal ganglion cells in patients with dominant optic atrophy. <italic>C. elegans eat-3</italic> mutants are hypersensitive to paraquat and <italic>sod-2</italic> RNAi, suggesting increased production of free radicals or an impaired disposal mechanism. A <italic>drp-1; eat-3</italic> double mutant and an <italic>fzo-1</italic> mutant are not more sensitive to paraquat, suggesting that there might be something specific about the effects of <italic>eat-3</italic> on mitochondria, for example contributing to the maintenance of cristae, as was suggested for Opa1 in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000022-Griparic1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000022-Olichon2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000022-Arnoult1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000022-Cipolat1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000022-Frezza1">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref>. The enhancement of <italic>eat-3</italic> phenotypes by <italic>sod-2</italic> RNAi and a mutation in the <italic>sod-2</italic> gene, but not by RNAi or mutations in other superoxide dismutase genes, suggests that damage from free radicals is confined to the mitochondrial matrix or the mitochondrial inner membrane. The effects are most likely not direct, since SOD-2 is a mitochondrial matrix protein while EAT-3 is primarily localized to the mitochondrial intermembrane space and other mutations that affect oxidative phosphorylation in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, such as the <italic>mev-1</italic> and <italic>gas-1</italic> mutants with mutations in complex I and II proteins, also show increased sensitivity to paraquat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000022-Kondo1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. Disruption of the electron transport chain, for example through altered cristae morphology, can increase production of free radicals, while conversely free radicals in the mitochondrial matrix can further disrupt the electron transport chain. These two problems are therefore likely to reinforce each other, possibly leading to catastrophic breakdown of mitochondrial function.</p><p>If free radicals also contribute to dominant optic atrophy in humans, then the underlying cause of this disease might be more similar to that of other optic neuropathies than previously understood. Patients with Leber's hereditary neuropathy (LHON) have mutations in subunits of Oxidative Phosphorylation complex I, which increases free radical production by disrupting the flow of electrons through complex I along with their more obvious effects on ATP production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000022-Qi1">&#x0005b;68&#x0005d;</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000022-Perier1">&#x0005b;70&#x0005d;</xref>. Optic neuropathies triggered by macular degeneration and optic neuropathies triggered by dietary deficiencies are also linked to damage from free radicals in mitochondria. Increased levels of free radicals in these diseases are compounded by the effects of light entering the eyes, since light triggers additional free radical production through absorption by cytochrome c oxidase and flavin containing oxidases in mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000022-Osborne1">&#x0005b;71&#x0005d;</xref>. Damage from free radicals will exacerbate the effects of ATP deficiency and increased susceptibility to apoptosis in patients with dominant optic atrophy. It is even possible that some of the increased susceptibility to apoptosis in Opa1 deficient cells is caused by damage from free radicals.</p><p>In conclusion, mutations in <italic>C. elegans eat-3</italic> have many of the same effects on mitochondrial morphology that were previously observed with mutations in yeast Mgm1 and mammalian Opa1. Mutations in key components of the major cell death pathway show that this pathway does not affect the <italic>eat-3</italic> phenotype. Instead, <italic>eat-3</italic> mutants are sensitive to damage from free radicals and they show hallmarks of ATP deficiency. The effects of <italic>sod-2</italic> loss of function and partial compensation by induced expression of SOD-2 suggest that damage from free radicals is localized to the mitochondrial matrix. These observations might help design more effective treatments for patients with DOA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Molecular Cloning</title><p>The D2013.5 gene of <italic>eat-3(ad426)</italic> was sequenced using amplified genomic DNA from two independent PCR reactions.
