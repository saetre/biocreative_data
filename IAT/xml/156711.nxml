Although the precise cellular roles played by this family of enzymes remain elusive, the importance of RecQ proteins is clear; mutations in any of three human RecQ genes lead to genomic instability and cancer. In this report, proteolysis is used to define a two-domain structure for <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RecQ, revealing a large (&#x0223c;59 kDa) N-terminal and a small (&#x0223c;9 kDa) C-terminal domain. A short N-terminal segment (7 or 21 residues) is also shown to be sensitive to proteases. The effects of removing these regions of RecQ are tested <italic>in vitro</italic>. Removing 21 N-terminal residues from RecQ severely diminishes its DNA-dependent ATPase and helicase activities, but does not affect its ability to bind DNA in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In contrast, removing the &#x0223c;9 kDa C-terminal domain from RecQ results in a fragment with normal levels of ATPase and helicase activity, but that has lost the ability to stably associate with DNA. These results establish the biochemical roles of an N-terminal sequence motif in RecQ catalytic function and for the C-terminal RecQ domain in stable DNA binding.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>RecQ DNA helicases play important and broad roles in cellular genome maintenance reactions (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c2">2</xref>). In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, RecQ acts in the RecF recombination pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c3">3</xref>) which functions in plasmid recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c5">5</xref>) and in helping bacteria recover from replication fork stalling at sites of ultraviolet light-induced DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c11">11</xref>). <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RecQ is also vital for suppression of illegitimate recombination or recombination between sequences with limited homology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c14">14</xref>). In eukaryotes, RecQ proteins function in several cellular processes, including aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c17">17</xref>), silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c18">18</xref>) and DNA replication, recombination and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c2">2</xref>). The importance of RecQ function in cells is best exemplified by three human syndromes, Bloom&#x02019;s, Werner&#x02019;s and Rothmund&#x02013;Thompson syndromes, which arise from mutation of human <italic>recQ</italic> genes, <italic>BLM</italic>, <italic>WRN</italic> or <italic>RECQ4</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c19">19</xref>). These mutations result in genomic instability (e.g. increased chromosomal rearrangements, chromosome breakage and&#x0002f;or hyper-recombination) and a predisposition to several cancers in all three syndromes. Since RecQ proteins play critical roles in cell function, a mechanistic understanding of their biochemical activities is of fundamental biological importance. However, the structural basis of RecQ family function has not been well defined.</p><p>RecQ family members share three regions of conserved protein sequence referred to as the Helicase, RecQ-conserved (RecQ-Ct) and Helicase-and-RNase-D-C-terminal (HRDC) domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c20">20</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg376f1">1</xref>). The helicase region contains sequence motifs necessary for using the energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis to unwind DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c21">21</xref>), and several RecQ proteins &#x0005b;Human WRN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c22">22</xref>), BLM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c23">23</xref>) and RecQL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c24">24</xref>), <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisia</italic>e Sgs1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c26">26</xref>), <italic>Schizocaccharomyces pombe</italic> Rqh1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c27">27</xref>), <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> RecQ5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c29">29</xref>), <italic>Xenopus laveis</italic> FFA-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c30">30</xref>) and <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c31">31</xref>)&#x0005d; have been shown to act as ATP-dependent DNA helicases <italic>in vitro</italic>. Moreover, helicase activity is known to be important for the cellular functions of eukaryotic RecQ proteins. Five individual missense mutations that lead to Bloom&#x02019;s syndrome result in sequence changes in the helicase region of the human BLM protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c33">33</xref>). Two of these mutations have been recapitulated in the murine BLM protein resulting in variants that lack ATPase and helicase activities <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c34">34</xref>). In addition, a point mutation that inactivates helicase activity in the <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> RecQ homolog, Sgs1, leads to hypersensitivity to DNA damaging agents in the mutant cells that mimics the <italic>SGS1</italic> null phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c36">36</xref>). Thus, helicase activity appears to be important for RecQ cellular functions.</p><p>The RecQ-Ct region lays C-terminal to the helicase segment in RecQ proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c20">20</xref>). Very little is known about the structure and function of the RecQ-Ct region in RecQ proteins, but mutational analyses have demonstrated its importance for activity in several RecQ homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c40">40</xref>). Two point mutations that lead to Bloom&#x02019;s syndrome alter conserved cysteines in the RecQ-Ct region of human BLM protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c37">37</xref>). Similarly to the <italic>BLM</italic> helicase mutations, analogous RecQ-Ct mutations made in murine <italic>BLM</italic> variants result in the loss of ATPase and helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c34">34</xref>), suggesting the RecQ-Ct region could play an integral role in RecQ enzymatic activity.</p><p>The third region of homology in RecQ enzymes forms its C-terminal conserved element, called the HRDC region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c20">20</xref>). This region is homologous with a domain of the RNase D family of nucleases but does not include the nuclease domain in RNase D. Since the HRDC region is present in two enzyme families involved in nucleic acid metabolism, it has been proposed to be involved in nucleic acid binding, the only known function in common between RecQ and RNase D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c20">20</xref>). Hypersensitivity of <italic>S.cerevisiae SGS1</italic>-deletion strains to DNA damaging agents can be complemented equally well by either full-length Sgs1 or a C-terminally truncated variant lacking the HRDC region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c41">41</xref>). Also, a recombinant fragment of Sgs1 lacking the HRDC region is active as an ATPase and DNA helicase <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c26">26</xref>). In contrast, an Sgs1 variant lacking the HRDC domain does not complement the aberrant growth phenotypes in strains lacking both <italic>SGS1</italic> and either topoisomerase I or III, implying that this region is required for some cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c36">36</xref>). Thus, the role of the HRDC domain in RecQ proteins remains unclear.</p><p>Although genetic and biochemical analyses have identified important regions within the RecQ family of proteins, connections linking RecQ protein structure to its biochemical functions have not been well defined. For example, whether regions of conserved sequence with the RecQ family correspond to true structural domains and how these domains cooperate in catalysis are important questions that have not been widely explored. In this report, we use limited proteolysis as an unbiased structural probe to define the domain structure of purified <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ. Our results reveal a two-domain structure for <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ, with a composite Helicase&#x0002f;RecQ-Ct N-terminal domain and a C-terminal HRDC domain. In addition, 21 residues at the N-terminus of the Helicase&#x0002f;RecQ-Ct domain were found to be sensitive to protease cleavage. Using the protease-sensitive sites as guides, we have constructed vectors to over-express three <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ variants: (i) a C-terminal truncation that lacks the HRDC domain (RecQ&#x00394;C); (ii) an N-terminal truncation that removes 21 residues (RecQ&#x00394;N) and (iii) an N- and C-terminal truncation that lacks both the N-terminal 21 residues and the HRDC domain (RecQ&#x00394;N&#x00394;C). The activities of the purified variants were compared with full-length <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ in DNA binding, DNA-dependent ATPase and helicase activity assays. The results of these analyses showed the HRDC domain to be required for stable DNA binding, but dispensable for catalytic function (DNA-dependent ATPase and helicase activities). In addition, our analyses illustrate the contribution of a novel N-terminal sequence motif to RecQ catalytic function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subcloning, over-expression and purification of <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ, RecQ&#x00394;N, RecQ&#x00394;C and RecQDN&#x00394;C</title><p><italic>Escherichia coli recQ</italic> was amplified from strain DH5&#x003b1; using PCR with primers specific for the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends of the protein-coding region of the gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c42">42</xref>).

The recombinant <italic>recQ</italic> gene was sequenced to confirm the proper DNA sequence for the gene. One minor discrepancy was found relative to published <italic>E.coli</italic> K12 strain <italic>recQ</italic> sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c43">43</xref>).

The predicted protein sequence of our clone is well conserved among most other bacterial RecQ proteins, including the closely related <italic>E.coli</italic> strain O157 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c44">44</xref>). pET-15b derivative plasmids encoding for RecQ&#x00394;N (residues 22 to the natural C-terminus, pJK100&#x00394;N), RecQ&#x00394;C (residues from the natural N-terminus to 530, pJK100&#x00394;C) and RecQ&#x00394;N&#x00394;C (residues 22&#x02013;530, pJK100&#x00394;N&#x00394;C) were constructed using a similar PCR-based approach and sequenced to confirm that no mutations were introduced during subcloning. Each of the plasmids allows inducible over-expression of a protein that incorporates an N-terminal hexahistidine Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-affinity purification tag and a thrombin cleavage site (20 residues total).</p><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> BL21(DE3) cells transformed with pLysS (Novagen) and either pJK100, pJK100&#x00394;N, pJK100&#x00394;C or pJK100&#x00394;N&#x00394;C were grown at 37&#x000b0;C in Luria&#x02013;Bertani medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c45">45</xref>) supplemented with 100 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml ampicillin and 25 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml chloramphenicol. Cells at early logarithmic phase (OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.3&#x02013;0.4) were induced to over-express RecQ (or a RecQ variant) by the addition of 1 mM isopropyl &#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-thiogalactopyranoside and were harvested by centrifugation after an additional 2.5 h of growth. Cells were resuspended in 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mM imidazole, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol, 10&#x00025; glycerol and lysed by sonication on ice. All subsequent purification steps were performed at 4&#x000b0;C. Soluble lysate was loaded on a Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x02013;NTA column and washed with lysis buffer until protein was undetectable in the eluent. His-tagged protein was then eluted by the addition of 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mM imidazole, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol, 10&#x00025; glycerol. Except for full-length protein used in proteolysis experiments, the eluent was dialyzed against lysis buffer, digested with thrombin to remove the His-tag (a Gly-Ser-His sequence remains on the N-terminus) and passed over a Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x02013;NTA column to remove <italic>E.coli</italic> proteins that fortuitously bind to Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x02013;NTA resin. The protein sample was then diluted to low-salt conditions and loaded onto one of two ion-exchange columns depending upon the protein being purified. For full-length RecQ and RecQ&#x00394;N, the protein was diluted to 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 125 mM NaCl, 1 mM &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol, 10&#x00025; glycerol, loaded onto a MonoQ column (Pharmacia), and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient from 100 to 250 mM. RecQ&#x00394;C and RecQ&#x00394;N&#x00394;C were diluted to 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mM NaCl, 1 mM &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol, 10&#x00025; glycerol, loaded onto a MonoS column (Pharmacia), and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient from 20 to 100 mM. Purified fractions of each protein were pooled, concentrated to &#x0223c;2 ml and dialyzed against 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM EDTA, 10&#x00025; glycerol. Proteins were then subjected to size-exclusion chromatography over a Sephacryl S-200 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in the same buffer. Highly purified fractions were identified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), pooled and concentrated to &#x0003e;1 mg&#x0002f;ml prior to storage at 4&#x000b0;C.

Inclusion of AMPPNP in chymotrypsin reactions also appeared to limit proteolysis to the &#x0223c;60 kDa fragment size (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg376f2">2</xref>A, lanes 9 and 10). In contrast, the addition of nucleotide to the subtilisin reactions did not affect the pattern or rate of proteolysis dramatically (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg376f2">2</xref>B). The addition, and presumably binding, of nucleotide to RecQ therefore appeared to protect the protein from digestion by chymotrypsin.</p><p>To identify N-terminal protease cleavage sites, chymotrypsin- and subtilisin-derived <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ core fragments were analyzed by protein sequencing as described in Materials and Methods. The N-terminal sequence of chymotrypsin-digested <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ was determined to be (Gly or Asn)-Tyr-Gln-Gln-Phe while the subtilisin-digested RecQ N-terminus was (Gly or Asn)-Leu-Glu-Ser-Gly. These sequences corresponded uniquely to sequences starting at residues 22 (Gly-Tyr-Gln-Gln-Phe) or 8 (Asn-Leu-Glu-Ser-Gly) of <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ for chymotrypsin or subtilisin cleavage, respectively. Cleavage at residues 22 or 8 accounted for only 4.6 or 3.0 kDa of the estimated mass change of &#x0223c;13 kDa observed in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg376f2">2</xref>, and implied that a second protease-sensitive site was located in the C-terminal region of the protein. To map the C-terminal protease cleavage site, the mass of the chymotrypsin-digested RecQ core fragment was measured by mass spectroscopic methods as described in Materials and Methods. The results showed two major species of 56 469 and 57 936 Da with many minor peaks also apparent between these peaks, leaving the precise identity of the C-terminal cleavage site (or sites) unclear. However, we estimated the second protease-sensitive region to be between residues 525 and 535, since the predicted masses of fragments that span from residue 22 to 525 or 535 were consistent with the changes in mobility observed by PAGE (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg376f2">2</xref>) and the mass spectroscopic measurements. This region was predicted to form the N-terminal border of the <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ HRDC domain based on an alignment of the protein with the sequence from the <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> Sgs1 HRDC domain structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c48">48</xref>), and indicated that both proteases could cleave between the HRDC domain and the remainder of the protein, removing the &#x0223c;9 kDa HRDC domain.</p></sec><sec><title>Purification of RecQ&#x00394;N, RecQ&#x00394;C and RecQ&#x00394;N&#x00394;C</title><p>Based on the N-terminal sequence of chymotrypsin-treated RecQ and on our estimate of the C-terminal cleavage site, we designed three recombinant variants of the <italic>E.coli recQ</italic> gene to test the biochemical effects of removing proteolytically labile sequences. These included variants that lacked the N-terminal 21 residues (RecQ&#x00394;N), the C-terminal 79 residues, or HRDC domain (RecQ&#x00394;C), or both (RecQ&#x00394;N&#x00394;C). Each protein was purified to apparent homogeneity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg376f3">3</xref>). The electrophoretic mobility of RecQ&#x00394;N&#x00394;C closely matched that of chymotrypsin-digested <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ, indicating that our estimate of the C-terminal protease-sensitive site was accurate (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>EMSA analysis of DNA binding by <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ, RecQ&#x00394;N, RecQ&#x00394;C and RecQ&#x00394;N&#x00394;C</title><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RecQ is a 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; DNA helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c31">31</xref>) and preferentially binds to partially duplex DNA with a 3&#x02032; ss extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c14">14</xref>). We therefore used a synthetic duplex DNA substrate with a 3&#x02032; ss extension to compare DNA binding ability among our RecQ variants. The same substrate had been used previously to measure DNA binding and helicase activity in the <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> RecQ homolog, Sgs1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c49">49</xref>). Each RecQ variant was incubated with substrate in the absence of ATP, and DNA binding was analyzed by EMSA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg376f4">4</xref>). Full-length <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ and RecQ&#x00394;N were able to shift the electrophoretic mobility of the DNA at the same protein concentrations (half-maximal shift at &#x0223c;100 nM enzyme), indicating that removal of the N-terminal 21 residues did not perturb stable DNA binding. In contrast, neither RecQ&#x00394;C nor RecQ&#x00394;N&#x00394;C was able to shift the DNA substrate in the EMSA experiment even at the highest protein concentrations used (250 nM). This result shows that the HRDC domain is important for stable DNA binding.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA-dependent ATPase activities of <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ, RecQ&#x00394;N, RecQ&#x00394;C and RecQ&#x00394;N&#x00394;C</title><p>To further characterize the effects of N- and C-terminal deletions on RecQ activity, the ATPase activities of the RecQ variants were examined using a spectrophotometric ATPase assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c47">47</xref>). <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RecQ has a weak ATPase activity that can be stimulated by the addition of a variety of DNA substrates, including ss and double-stranded (ds) DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c31">31</xref>). We analyzed the DNA-dependent ATPase activity of the RecQ variants using a ss homopolymer (dT<sub>28</sub>) as a cofactor to allow measurement of ATPase function in the absence DNA unwinding. Consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c31">31</xref>), full-length RecQ ATPase activity could not be detected in the absence of DNA but was stimulated upon the addition of DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg376f5">5</xref>). The mid-point of activation was &#x0223c;5 nM DNA. In spite of its apparent inability to bind DNA in EMSA experiments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg376f4">4</xref>), the RecQ&#x00394;C variant also had essentially wild-type levels of DNA-dependent ATPase activity with a mid-point of activation at &#x0223c;5 nM DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg376f5">5</xref>). In contrast, the RecQ&#x00394;N and RecQ&#x00394;N&#x00394;C variants had very weak ATPase activities both in the absence and presence of DNA. Both of these proteins had maximal ATPase levels of &#x0223c;1&#x00025; of the maximum ATPase rates of full-length RecQ or RecQ&#x00394;C. These results indicate that elements in the N-terminal 21 residues of <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ are important for stimulation of RecQ ATPase activity, which was unexpected since these residues are not part of the canonical helicase motifs of RecQ.</p></sec><sec><title>Helicase activities of <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ, RecQ&#x00394;N, RecQ&#x00394;C and RecQ&#x00394;N&#x00394;C</title><p>Finally, we compared helicase activities among the RecQ variants in conditions that mimicked the EMSA reactions, except with the addition of 1 mM ATP. In a concentration-dependent manner, full-length RecQ was able to unwind the 18-bp substrate with half-maximal unwinding at &#x0223c;0.1 nM enzyme (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg376f6">6</xref>). Surprisingly, RecQ&#x00394;C, which could not stably bind the same DNA substrate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg376f4">4</xref>), displayed an indistinguishable level of DNA unwinding activity to that of full-length RecQ. This shows that stable DNA binding and helicase activity can be separated in RecQ. In contrast to RecQ and RecQ&#x00394;C, neither RecQ&#x00394;N nor RecQ&#x00394;N&#x00394;C was able to unwind the substrate to a measurable level even at the highest enzyme concentrations (100 nM), indicating that the N-terminal 21 residues are critical for helicase function.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>RecQ helicases comprise a family of enzymes that play important roles in genome maintenance reactions in bacterial and eukaryotic cells. Genetic and biochemical studies of several different RecQ proteins have yielded insights into RecQ-catalyzed reactions but a structural model of RecQ proteins is presently unclear. <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RecQ is an excellent system for probing structural features of the RecQ family since the sequence elements that are conserved among RecQ homologs are present in the <italic>E.coli</italic> protein and it has proven amenable to biochemical analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c52">52</xref>). As a step towards resolving the structural basis of RecQ function, we have used limited proteolysis to map structural domains in <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ and then used <italic>in vitro</italic> assays to determine the effects of removing proteolytically sensitive regions of RecQ on its biochemical activities.</p><sec><title>Proteolytic mapping of <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ</title><p>Our limited proteolysis experiments have revealed a two-domain structure for <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ, with the Helicase and RecQ-Ct regions forming one structural domain and the HRDC region forming a second. Proteolysis by chymotrypsin occurs in two stages, with the first cleavage event removing &#x0223c;10 kDa and the second removing &#x0223c;3 kDa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg376f2">2</xref>A). These observed mass changes are consistent with the expected masses of the HRDC domain (&#x0223c;9 kDa, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg376f1">1</xref>) and N-terminal 21 residues (&#x0223c;3 kDa), and imply that the linkage connecting the C-terminus of the Helicase&#x0002f;RecQ-Ct domain to the N-terminus of the HRDC domain is exposed in the structure. An alternative explanation of this result is that the HRDC region is unstructured in <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ and can be degraded by either chymotrypsin or subtilisin. However, the HRDC domain from <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> Sgs1 is folded when expressed independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c48">48</xref>), and we have observed that the <italic>E.coli</italic> HRDC region is folded in isolation (D.A.Bernstein and J.L.Keck, unpublished results), indicating the HRDC region most likely comprises a bona fide structural domain in RecQ.</p></sec><sec><title>Importance of the N-terminal 21 residues of <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ</title><p>Removal of 21 N-terminal residues from <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ impairs both its ATPase and helicase activities (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg376f5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg376f6">6</xref>) but not its ability to stably bind DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg376f4">4</xref>). A sequence comparison of 61 bacterial RecQ proteins shows great variability among their N-termini up to residue 17 (<italic>E.coli</italic> numbering, data not shown). Starting at residue 17 however, bacterial and eukaryotic RecQ proteins have a highly conserved sequence of 14 amino acids that are 15&#x02013;16 residues away from the first conserved helicase motif sequence (motif I, residues 49&#x02013;60 in <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ). This N-terminal conserved motif, which we propose to call &#x02018;motif 0&#x02019;, is <underline>L</underline>xxx<italic>F</italic><underline>G</underline>xxx<underline>F</underline><italic>R</italic>xx<underline>Q</underline>, where underlined residues are invariant, italicized residues are conserved and x is any residue (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg376f7">7</xref>). Our results demonstrate that chymotrypsin is able to cleave after the first conserved Phe of motif 0 but that this region is not cleaved by subtilisin. Moreover, binding of ADP or AMPPNP appears to protect against chymotryptic digestion within motif 0 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg376f2">2</xref>A), implying that nucleotide binding changes the conformation of <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ, which in turn affects protease accessibility to this motif.</p><p>The identification and characterization of motif 0 in <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ helps to define the biochemical basis of a known human <italic>BLM</italic> missense mutation that can lead to Bloom&#x02019;s syndrome and may relate this portion of RecQ to other known helicases. Mutation of the Gln codon in motif 0 to Arg in the human BLM gene is sufficient to cause Bloom&#x02019;s syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c19">19</xref>) and analogous Gln&#x02192;Arg substitutions in murine BLM protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c34">34</xref>) and <italic>S.cerevisiae SGS1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c39">39</xref>) result in biochemical and cellular defects as well. Motif 0 also shares similarity with the &#x02018;Q motif&#x02019; of DEAD-box RNA helicases, in which conserved Gln and Phe residues pack against helicase motif I and directly bind the adenine base of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg376c53">53</xref>). Our data are consistent with motif 0 in RecQ participating directly in ATP binding in a manner similar to the Q motif, with its invariant glutamine and an upstream conserved aromatic residue forming part of an adenine-binding pocket. Alternatively, motif 0 could play some role in the RecQ ATPase reaction mechanism independent of ATP binding, or an indirect role in stabilizing the ATPase domain. Determining whether this motif folds similarly to the Q motif and participates in ATP binding will require further study to define the functional and structural roles of individual amino acids in RecQ.</p></sec><sec><title>The HRDC domain is required for stable DNA binding</title><p>Our proteolytic mapping results demonstrate that the HRDC domain of <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ can be physically separated from the Helicase&#x0002f;RecQ-Ct domain. While our analysis did not reveal the precise location of cutting, we were able to use mass estimates from mass spectroscopic and PAGE analyses to map the site to a short stretch of residues. In both DNA-dependent ATPase and helicase activity assays, RecQ&#x00394;C, which lacks the HRDC domain, had a very similar specific activity to that of full-length <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg376f5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg376f6">6</xref>), indicating that removal of the HRDC domain did not compromise catalytic function. However, when we compared the DNA binding abilities of RecQ&#x00394;C to full-length RecQ using EMSA, we found that RecQ&#x00394;C could not stably bind our model DNA substrate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg376f4">4</xref>). Thus, our results with RecQ&#x00394;C appear to be contradictory: in two experiments, helicase and DNA- dependent ATPase, the HRDC domain is dispensable for DNA binding while in a third, EMSA, the domain appears to be required for DNA binding. The difference between these methods that is likely to account for this discrepancy is that in our helicase and DNA-dependent ATPase experiments, the protein can freely dissociate and re-associate with DNA, whereas in our EMSA experiments, dissociation could be irreversible due to the physical separation of free DNA from the protein. Since this is only observed with <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ variants that lack the HRDC domain, our data are consistent with the HRDC domain playing a role in stable, but not transient, DNA binding. Moreover, these data imply that there are at least two distinct DNA binding elements in RecQ&#x02014;an HRDC domain-containing region that is required for stable DNA binding and an HRDC-independent element that is sufficient for more transient interactions with DNA and for DNA-dependent ATPase and helicase function. The HRDC domain might enhance RecQ DNA unwinding activity where stable DNA binding is required (e.g. for processive unwinding of long DNA), but is not necessary for its catalytic function.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg376f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Schematic diagram of <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ.
