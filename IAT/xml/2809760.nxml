Methyl modification can occur on several different amino acid residues and in distinct mono-, di-, and tri-methyl states. However, the interplay among these distinct modification states is not well understood. Here we investigate the relationships between dimethyl and trimethyl modifications on lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9me2 and H3K9me3) in the adult <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> germ line. Simultaneous immunofluorescence reveals very different temporal/spatial localization patterns for H3K9me2 and H3K9me3. While H3K9me2 is enriched on unpaired sex chromosomes and undergoes dynamic changes as germ cells progress through meiotic prophase, we demonstrate here that H3K9me3 is not enriched on unpaired sex chromosomes and localizes to all chromosomes in all germ cells in adult hermaphrodites and until the primary spermatocyte stage in males. Moreover, high-copy transgene arrays carrying somatic-cell specific promoters are highly enriched for H3K9me3 (but not H3K9me2) and correlate with DAPI-faint chromatin domains. We further demonstrate that the H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 marks are acquired independently. MET-2, a member of the SETDB histone methyltransferase (HMTase) family, is required for all detectable germline H3K9me2 but is dispensable for H3K9me3 in adult germ cells. Conversely, we show that the HMTase MES-2, an E(z) homolog responsible for H3K27 methylation in adult germ cells, is required for much of the germline H3K9me3 but is dispensable for H3K9me2. Phenotypic analysis of <italic>met-2</italic> mutants indicates that MET-2 is nonessential for fertility but inhibits ectopic germ cell proliferation and contributes to the fidelity of chromosome inheritance. Our demonstration of the differential localization and independent acquisition of H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 implies that the trimethyl modification of H3K9 is not built upon the dimethyl modification in this context. Further, these and other data support a model in which these two modifications function independently in adult <italic>C. elegans</italic> germ cells.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Histone methylation is a widespread feature of eukaryotic chromatin and has been implicated in numerous aspects of chromosome function.

Methylation can occur on numerous different sites on the histone H3 and H4 subunits. At some amino acid residues, such as lysine 4 and lysine 36 of histone H3, the presence of methyl modifications is correlated with active gene expression (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000830-Kouzarides1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>). In contrast, methyl modifications at other residues, including lysine 9 and lysine 27 of histone H3 are often, but not always, correlated with heterochromatin and gene silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000830-Kouzarides1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000830-Kim1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. The diversity of methyl modifications is partially reflected in the large number of histone methyltransferases (HMTases) encoded by genomes. Further, in addition to modifying a diverse range of histone residues, methyl marks occur in distinct mono-, di- and tri- methyl states. In some instances, histones bearing the di- and tri- methyl modifications at a given amino acid residue exhibit similar genomic distributions (<italic>e.g.</italic> H3K9 methylation in <italic>S. pombe</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000830-Grewal1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>), or are dependent on the same HMTase (<italic>e.g.</italic> H3K27me2 and H3K27me3 dependence on MES-2 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> germ cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000830-Bender1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>). However, in many cases the relationships between the distinct methylation states and the HMTases that are responsible for generating them are poorly understood.</p><p>The <italic>C. elegans</italic> germ line is an excellent system to investigate the dynamic nature of chromatin modifications and roles of histone methyltransferases (HMTases) in establishing and/or maintaining chromatin marks, as several features of this system facilitate the cytological analysis of chromosome dynamics. Germ cells are organized in a temporal/spatial gradient along the length of the gonad, making it possible to simultaneously visualize mitotically proliferating germ cell nuclei and nuclei progressing through all stages of meiotic prophase. Mitotically cycling germ cell nuclei are found at the distal end of the gonad, and as nuclei move proximally they enter meiotic prophase. Upon meiotic entry, chromosomes partially condense and reorganize spatially, and homologous chromosomes pair and synapse. Completion of pairing and synapsis defines entry into the pachytene stage, during which crossover recombination events are completed between the DNA molecules of the aligned chromosome pairs. During the diplotene and diakinesis stages, chromosomes desynapse and further condense resulting in the formation of compact bivalents in which the homolog pairs are held together by chiasmata, the cytological correlates of crossovers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000830-Zetka1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. During oocyte meiosis, individual bivalents and chiasmata are readily visible owing to the large nuclear volume of developing oocytes, whereas during spermatogenesis, late prophase bivalents occupy a small volume within the nuclei of primary spermatocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000830-Shakes1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Some chromatin modifications exhibit dramatic and highly dynamic localization changes in parallel with the reorganization and remodeling of chromosomes that occurs during meiotic prophase progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000830-Kelly1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. For example, levels of chromosome-associated H3K9me2 increase substantially during progression through the pachytene stage in hermaphrodite germ lines, then drop precipitously following the diplotene stage.</p><p>In addition to allowing us to examine large-scale histone modification dynamics as germ cells progress through the stages of meiotic prophase, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> system also permits a more detailed dissection of the genomic distribution of individual marks; the partially condensed state of chromosomes during meiotic prophase makes it possible to identify which individual chromosomes or chromosome regions are associated with distinct chromatin marks. For example, cytological analysis has demonstrated that the autosomes are enriched for H3K36me2 and H3K4me2, while these modifications are underrepresented on the sex chromosomes in both hermaphrodite (XX) and male animals (XO), correlating with the fact that there is very little expression of X-linked genes in the germ line in either sex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000830-Bender1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000830-Kelly1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000830-KolasinskaZwierz1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, both H3K27me2 and H3K27me3 are broadly distributed on all chromosomes, with H3K27me3 enriched on the weakly transcribed X chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000830-Bender1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, in addition to exhibiting a dynamic localization in the hermaphrodite germ line, H3K9me2 is also highly enriched on the partnerless X chromosome in XO males as well as on the unpaired X chromosomes present in a <italic>him-8</italic> mutant hermaphrodite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000830-Kelly1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000830-Bean1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

In contrast, it is currently unknown which histone methyltransferase is required for the dynamic H3K9me2 modification.

Using this FISH probe, in combination with H3K9me3 immunofluorescence, we demonstrated that the <italic>mIs10</italic> array FISH signal and the brightest part of the H3K9me3 IF signal co-localize, which confirmed that the site of H3K9me3 enrichment does correspond to the high-copy array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000830-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Moreover, this analysis also demonstrated that the brightest H3K9me3 staining is largely confined to the array region and does not significantly spread into the neighboring chromatin.</p><p>As <italic>mIs10</italic> is associated with an enrichment of H3K9me3, which is generally considered to be a mark of repressive chromatin, we tested whether other repressive modifications might be concentrated on this high-copy transgene array.

Further, as <italic>mIs10</italic> is enriched for H3K9me3 but not H3K27me3, it is highly unlikely that the anti-H3K9me3 signal in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germ line is due to cross-reactivity with H3K27me3.</p><p>We also tested whether H3K9me2 was enriched on <italic>mIs10</italic>. Since H3K9me2 accumulates broadly over multiple different chromosome regions within each nucleus, it was difficult to assess the relationship of H3K9me2 to <italic>mIs10</italic> in hermaphrodite germ cell nuclei. Therefore, we evaluated the relationship of H3K9me2 to <italic>mIs10</italic> in male germ lines where H3K9me2 acquisition is concentrated mainly on the single X chromosome. When male germ cells carrying <italic>mIs10</italic> were co-stained for H3K9me2 and H3K9me3, we detected a single area of strong H3K9me2 enrichment corresponding to the X chromosome, while H3K9me3 exhibited a separate distinct domain of enrichment, reflecting the presence of <italic>mIs10</italic> on chromosome V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000830-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Therefore, of the repressive histone modifications tested, the <italic>mIs10</italic> high-copy arrays only showed an enrichment of H3K9me3.</p><p>Examination of several other high-copy transgene arrays (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000830-t001">Table 1</xref>) indicated that enrichment for H3K9me3 is not restricted to <italic>mIs10</italic>, but is a common feature of high-copy arrays composed of somatically-expressed transgenes.

We observed that 55&#x00025; of nuclei examined (11 of 20) contained two well-separated H3K9me2-enriched domains, corresponding to unpaired X chromosomes. On each of the X chromosomes in these 11 nuclei we could also differentiate a spatially distinct domain enriched for H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000830-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, top), consistent with results from the XO male germ line. However, in control <italic>him-8</italic> mutant hermaphrodites without <italic>axIs36</italic>, two H3K9me2 enriched domains were visible more frequently, in 85&#x00025; (55 of 65) of nuclei examined (p&#x0003c;0.01), suggesting either that pairing of X chromosomes was improved or that H3K9me2 accumulation on unpaired X chromosomes was inhibited by the presence of <italic>axIs36</italic>. Therefore, we more closely examined the nine <italic>him-8</italic>; <italic>axIs36</italic> nuclei in which only one H3K9me2-enriched territory could be distinguished. In four of these nine nuclei, the close proximity between H3K9me3-enriched domains suggested that the two X chromosomes were likely to be too close to one another to be resolved as separate territories, as is likely the case for the 15&#x00025; of <italic>him-8</italic> nuclei with only one discernable H3K9me2-enriched region. However, in the remaining five nuclei, two well-separated regions of H3K9me3 staining were detected, indicating that the two X chromosomes were clearly unpaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000830-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, bottom). Thus, in 5 of 16 nuclei in which the X chromosomes were demonstrably unpaired, one of the two X chromosomes had failed to acquire H3K9me2. These observations raise the possibility that the presence of H3K9me3, or some other feature of the transgene array, may have the capacity to interfere with the ability of female germ cells to sense the presence of an unpaired chromosome and/or to concentrate H3K9me2 in response, possibly by enabling autosynapsis of an unpaired chromosome.</p><p>A closer examination of the imaged nuclei in the aforementioned experiments revealed that the H3K9me3-enriched regions corresponded to chromatin with a relatively weak DAPI signal (DAPI-faint), suggestive of a more open chromatin organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000830-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>).

One of the hypotheses to emerge from these analyses is that H3K9me3 corresponds to the presence of constitutive heterochromatin, while H3K9me2 is enriched on silenced euchromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000830-Peters1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000830-Rice1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000830-Shi1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000830-Trojer1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>.

These findings are compatible with the aforementioned <italic>C. elegans</italic> data and the presence of at least two independent transcriptional repression mechanisms. However, our data also suggest that at least some of the roles for H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germ line could be different than those proposed for other systems. For example, the broad chromosomal distribution of H3K9me3, together with the correspondence of H3K9me3 to DAPI-faint DNA, does not support the notion that H3K9me3 is restricted to cytologically-defined heterochromatin in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> adult germ line. Further, the enrichment of H3K9me2 on specialized chromatin structures (<italic>i.e.</italic> germline silenced extrachromosomal arrays and unpaired/unsynapsed sex chromosomes) suggests that H3K9me2 may have additional functions distinct from silencing of euchromatic genes; some of these additional functions may be conserved, as mammalian sex chromosomes also become enriched for H3K9me2 during spermatocyte meiosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000830-Khalil1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our finding that H3K9me2 is not detectable in the adult germ lines of <italic>met-2</italic> mutant worms supports the conclusion that MET-2 is likely the HMTase directly responsible for H3K9me2 in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germ line.

It remains an open question whether the reported reduction of H3K9me3 in embryos is an indirect consequence of MET-2 loss or reflects different specificities for MET-2 in different tissues. There is precedent for a single HMTase being required for different marks in different tissues, as dSETDB1, which is a member of the same HMTase family as MET-2, has been shown to be required for H3K9me2 accumulation on chromosome 4 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> salivary glands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000830-Tzeng1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000830-Seum1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, while it is required for H3K9me3, but not H3K9me2, in germline stem cells and their immediate descendants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000830-Yoon1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Even though germ line H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 are often differentially localized, several methylation models propose that the trimethyl mark is built upon a dimethyl mark <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000830-Wang1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000830-Czermin1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>.

High-copy transgene arrays are a widely used tool for studying gene transcription patterns and for rescuing mutant phenotypes of genes that function in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> soma. In this work, we found that high-copy arrays carrying transgenes with several different somatic-cell specific promoters were highly enriched for H3K9me3, and this enrichment was observed both for extrachromosomal arrays and arrays integrated at multiple positions in the genome.</p><p>A possible function for the H3K9me3 modification on arrays could be to solidify the identity of the array as being different from the native DNA and therefore prevent the array from interfering with the functions of the rest of the genome. As integrated high-copy arrays are derived from extrachromosomal DNA elements, and extrachromosomal arrays are also enriched for H3K9me3, this modification is likely acquired before genomic integration occurs. Further, arrays are initially assembled from hundreds of separate DNA fragments, including bacterial plasmids, which are introduced by microinjection into the germ line of the founding parent animal. Therefore, the enrichment of H3K9me3 could be in response to the large amount of foreign DNA present in these arrays, to the creation of unusual array DNA/chromatin structures and/or to the presence of genes with promoters not normally expressed in the germ line.</p><p>Alternatively, or in addition, the presence of enriched H3K9me3 could indicate that high-copy arrays composed of soma-specific promoters are subjected to silencing. While images shown here depict H3K9me3 enriched on high-copy arrays in the germ line, we also detected domains of H3K9me3 enrichment in the nuclei of somatic cells in worms carrying these high-copy arrays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000830.s003">Figure S3</xref>). This enrichment in somatic cells could provide insight into the perplexing issue of why high-copy transgene arrays work as well as they do for rescue and expression experiments despite carrying hundreds of copies of their component transgenes. H3K9me3 is likely repressive, as this modification was recently shown by ChIP/chip analysis to be enriched on low-expressed or non-expressed genes in <italic>C. elegans</italic> larvae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000830-KolasinskaZwierz1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, the high-levels of H3K9me3 on high-copy transgene arrays may mean that most copies of the transgenes are not expressed or are expressed at very low levels, and/or that only a few transgene copies actually contribute to the observed expression.</p><p>For several organisms, the presence of H3K9me3 is reported to indicate the presence of heterochromatin, often defined by the presence of dense, DAPI-bright chromatin. However, in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germ line, while the enrichment of H3K9me3 on high-copy arrays might indicate that silencing is occurring, the corresponding chromatin has an open, DAPI-faint appearance. This DAPI-faint appearance could be indicative of the array adopting a novel chromatin/DNA structure or of <italic>C. elegans</italic> heterochromatin adopting a configuration distinct from that seen in other organisms.</p><p>The DAPI-faint appearance of high-copy arrays was observed both when arrays were present on paired and synapsed chromosomes as well as when arrays were present on unpaired X chromosomes. Unpaired X chromosomes have been shown to become heavily enriched for H3K9me2, and this enrichment is hypothesized to be part of a mechanism that can sense and respond to the presence of unpaired chromosomes in meiosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000830-Bean1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. However, we found that the high-copy arrays present on the unpaired X chromosomes in <italic>him-8</italic>; <italic>axIs36</italic> hermaphrodites retained an enrichment of H3K9me3 and failed to become dimethylated. This observation could result from an unusual DNA/chromatin structure and/or the presence of H3K9me3 preventing the unpaired arrays from acquiring H3K9me2. This latter possibility could be due to either H3K9me3 blocking the formation of H3K9me2 or because chromatin enriched for H3K9me3 is not recognized as being unpaired. While H3K9me3 could render the accumulation of H3K9me2 unnecessary, these results indicate that the presence of unpaired chromosome segments alone is not sufficient to initiate the dimethylation of chromatin during <italic>C. elegans</italic> meiosis.</p><p>The only high-copy array in our analysis that was not enriched for H3K9me3 was an extrachromosomal array composed of multiple copies of a <italic>let-858::gfp</italic> transgene, which contains a germline-competent promoter that is silenced in the germ line.

However, our data do not rule out the possibility that H3K9me2 could still be required for the establishment of silencing.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>The Role of H3K9me2 in the Adult Germ Line</title><p>Despite the prominent and highly dynamic localization of the H3K9me2 mark in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germ cells, loss of MET-2 and consequently the loss of H3K9me2 had remarkably little visible impact on germ line organization and the chromosomal events of meiosis in most germ lines examined. Further, loss of the prominent H3K9me2 accumulation on unpaired sex chromosomes in males and <italic>him-8</italic> hermaphrodites did not result in elevated X chromosome loss during spermatocyte meiosis. However, the 1&#x00025; occurrence of achiasmate chromosomes at diakinesis demonstrates that MET-2 could function to ensure the fidelity of chromosome segregation during meiosis. That is, although MET-2 activity is not strictly required to execute any of the events of meiotic prophase, MET-2 is required to ensure that these events occur with high fidelity.</p><p>There are several ways in which MET-2 and/or H3K9me2 could function to maintain meiotic fidelity. In worms lacking these factors, chromosome and chromatin structures could be altered, resulting in an error-prone meiosis due to differences in meiotic protein accessibility or an alteration in the ability to repair meiotic recombination intermediates. Another possibility is that without MET-2 and/or H3K9me2, nuclei that should have been culled from the germ line due to infrequent meiotic errors might escape detection and/or elimination by meiotic checkpoints and go on to form abnormal diakinesis nuclei <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000830-Bhalla1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000830-Gartner1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. Alternatively, loss of MET-2/H3K9me2 might affect the transcription levels of some genes required for normal entry into, progression through and/or execution of the meiotic program. Under this scenario, the low penetrance of the observed meiotic defects could be caused by a relatively modest perturbation of gene expression levels and/or by the buffering effects of other regulatory mechanisms that operate in parallel to ensure a robust outcome for meiosis.</p><p>MET-2 has been previously implicated as a factor required for transcriptional repression in vulval development. However, the role of MET-2 in this process was not evident from a phenotypic analysis of <italic>met-2</italic> single mutants alone, but was revealed when <italic>met-2</italic> function was eliminated in combination with another protein involved in vulval cell differentiation. This property identifies <italic>met-2</italic> as a synthetic multivulva (synMuv) gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000830-Andersen1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000830-Solari1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. By definition, the synMuv phenotype can only occur when the activities of two genes are reduced or eliminated simultaneously; therefore the synMuv phenomenon has been interpreted to reflect the presence of at least two parallel pathways that collaborate to ensure the accurate specification and differentiation of vulval precursor cells (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000830-Fay1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>). The fact that many identified synMuv proteins are associated with chromatin and/or are components of conserved chromatin remodeling or modifying complexes suggests that such complexes are individually dispensable for executing distinct cellular programs, but instead function redundantly to ensure reliable outcomes. By analogy, the low penetrance of defects observed when MET-2 is absent from the adult germ line may not necessarily be an accurate reflection of the importance of MET-2 function in adult germ cells, and future analysis may reveal factors that function in parallel with MET-2 to ensure normal progression through the meiotic program and successful execution of the chromosomal events required for faithful sexual reproduction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Genetics</title><p>Except where specified, all <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains were cultured at 20&#x000b0;C under standard conditions.

For experiments where double labeling was done, the primary antibodies were applied simultaneously, followed by a simultaneous application of secondary antibodies. Images were collected in Z-series representing a longitudinal bisection of each gonad arm; images shown are projections through data stacks encompassing whole nuclei.</p><p>For the H3K9me2 experiments, we and others had found that previously purchased polyclonal antibodies were inconsistent from experiment to experiment. In contrast, we found that the mouse monoclonal antibody ab1220 gave highly reproducible results by IF. We also tested ab1220 in western analysis. Using a mixed-stage whole worm protein preparation and a chromatin fraction generated from whole adult <italic>C. elegans</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000830-Polanowska1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>, ab1220 detected a single band of the appropriate size to be a histone; further, ab1220 produced no signal when applied to a western blot of a non-chromatin fraction. Therefore, we concluded that ab1220 is a highly specific antibody. We used ab1220 to generate all anti-H3K9me2 images in this paper.</p><p>For the H3K9me3 experiments, several antibodies were tested. Antibodies that were a gift from David Allis were originally used for staining the transgene arrays but were in short supply, so we sought an alternative. Antibodies that were from a gift from Thomas Jenuwein duplicated our results but did not penetrate the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germ line well; similar results were obtained with Upstate 07-442, lot# JBC1361819. Abcam ab6001 failed to show any staining in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Finally, we found that Abcam antibody ab8898 reproduced our results and consistently penetrated the germ line well, making it a highly reliable reagent. When Abcam ab8898 was applied to a western blot of whole animal, mixed-stage <italic>C. elegans</italic> protein extract, two bands were detected, the expected histone-size band and a second higher molecular weight band. However, only the histone-size band was detected on western blots of a chromatin fraction from an adult <italic>C. elegans</italic> extract. This result indicates that the ab8898 IF signal that colocalizes with DAPI-stained chromatin in the adult germ line is specific to histones. All anti-H3K9me3 images in this publication were generated using ab8898.</p><p>The procedure for combined immunofluorescence and fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization was modified from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000830-Kelly1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> and K.
