These proteins, which we term IRF-2 binding proteins 1 and 2 (IRF-2BP1 and IRF-2BP2, the latter having two splicing isoforms, A and B), are nuclear proteins, and have the properties of IRF-2-dependent transcriptional co-repressors that can inhibit both enhancer-activated and basal transcription in a manner that is not dependent upon histone deacetylation. IRF-2BP1 and IRF-2BP2A&#x0002f;B contain an N-terminal zinc finger and a C-terminal RING finger domain of the C3HC4 subclass, but show no homology to other known transcriptional regulators; they therefore define a new family of co- repressor proteins. An alternatively spliced form of IRF-2 that lacks two amino acids (valines 177 and 178) in the central portion of the protein (IRF-2&#x0005b;S&#x0005d;) cannot bind to these co-repressors and cannot mediate repression despite having the same C- terminal repression domain as IRF-2, suggesting that the relative conformation of the DNA binding domain and the C-terminal region of IRF-2 is crucial for transcriptional repression.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Interferon Regulatory Factor-2 (IRF-2) is a member of a family of proteins (the IRFs) that play a major role in the transcriptional regulation of type I interferon (IFN) genes in response to viral infection and genes that are regulated in response to type I and type II IFNs &#x0005b;reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c1">1</xref>)&#x0005d;. IRF-2 was originally described as a protein that bound to the IFN-&#x003b2; promoter and antagonised the effect of the transcriptional activator, IRF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c2">2</xref>). Further studies have implicated IRF-2 as a negative regulator of many IFN-responsive genes that contain IRF binding sites in their promoters &#x0005b;for example, 2&#x02032;-5&#x02032;-oligoadenylate synthetase, iNOS, MHC class I; reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c1">1</xref>)&#x0005d;. Consistent with this, mice lacking IRF-2 demonstrate dramatic over-expression of genes induced by type I IFN, and develop an inflammatory skin disease in response to antigenic stimulation, indicating that IRF-2 plays an essential role in modulating the response to IFN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c3">3</xref>). As many of these genes play a role in the negative regulation of the cell cycle and&#x0002f;or apoptosis, IRF-2 is also a putative oncogene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c6">6</xref>).</p><p>In addition to its ability to inhibit expression of some genes, IRF-2 has been shown to be a transcriptional activator of others. This was first shown for the cell-cycle regulated transcriptional activation of the histone H4 gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c8">8</xref>) and has since been demonstrated for the gp91 phox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c9">9</xref>), EBV EBNA-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c10">10</xref>), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c11">11</xref>) and MHC class II transactivator (CIITA) genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c13">13</xref>). A requirement for IRF-2 in CIITA transactivation is supported by the finding that mutations in the IRF-2 DNA binding domain (DBD) are found in a pancreatic tumour cell line and in fresh pancreatic tumour explants and are associated with loss of CIITA transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c14">14</xref>).</p><p>Analysis of the domain structure of IRF-2 shows that the N-terminal 113 amino acids encompass the highly conserved IRF DBD containing a characteristic motif consisting of five tryptophan residues, which forms a &#x02018;winged helix&#x02019; structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c16">16</xref>). The transcriptional activation domain (AD) has been shown to reside between amino acids 160 and 220 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c17">17</xref>). On promoters that are not activated by IRF-2 the transactivation domain is dominantly inhibited by the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c17">17</xref>), and the C-terminus of IRF-2 can also repress transcription when fused to a heterologous DBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c18">18</xref>), indicating that this region of IRF-2 contains an autonomously acting repression domain.</p><p>The mechanisms of repression and transactivation by IRF-2 are poorly characterised, but it has been shown that IRF-2 can interact with the histone acetylase factors, GCN5, PCAF and p300&#x0002f;CBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c19">19</xref>), and with TFIIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c20">20</xref>), all of which are known to play important roles in transcriptional stimulation. Furthermore, a cDNA for the bromodomain-containing protein, Celtix-1, has been isolated from a yeast two-hybrid screen using IRF-2 as bait, and it has been suggested that Celtix-1 may play a role in transactivation by IRF-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c21">21</xref>). It is also possible that IRF-2 activates transcription by recruiting IRF-1 to some promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c12">12</xref>). To date, no factors capable of interacting with the C-terminal repression domain have been identified. In this manuscript we describe the cloning and characterisation of two novel nuclear proteins (which we call IRF-2 binding proteins 1 and 2; IRF-2BP1 and IRF-2BP2) that bind to the C-terminal repression domain and have the properties of IRF-2-dependent transcriptional co- repressors that can inhibit both enhancer-activated and basal transcription.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>Schematics of the reporter gene and effector plasmids used in this report are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg431f1">1</xref>.

To clarify this situation we initially examined the ability of GAL4-IRF-2 fusions to repress transcription from a promoter containing a synthetic multimer of the DNA binding site for GAL4 inserted between the TATA box of HSV-1 and the SV40 enhancer &#x0005b;pSV40(GALUAS)<sub>5</sub>tk&#x00394;(&#x02013;39)lucter&#x0005d;.

These effects were dependent upon GAL.IRF-2(88&#x02013;349) recruitment to the promoter since repression was not seen when the multimeric GAL UAS was replaced with a random sequence of DNA of similar length &#x0005b;pSV40(lacP&#x0002f;O)tk&#x00394;(&#x02013;39)lucter; data not shown&#x0005d;.</p><p>Removal of the C-terminal 69 amino acids &#x0005b;GAL.IRF-2(88&#x02013;280)&#x0005d; led to a complete loss of repression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg431f2">2</xref>A, lane 4), indicating, as expected, that residues in this region contribute to negative regulation. Constructs containing as few as 58 amino acids from the extreme C-terminus &#x0005b;GAL.IRF-2(292&#x02013;349)&#x0005d; are capable of repressing transcription to the same extent as the full-length protein, whilst a fusion containing the C-terminal 18 amino acids &#x0005b;GAL.IRF-2(332&#x02013;349)&#x0005d; only showed &#x0223c;30&#x00025; of this repression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg431f2">2</xref>A, lanes 5&#x02013;8).

Thirty-six colonies containing verifiable bait-dependent partners were isolated from a total of 10<sup>7</sup> yeast colonies of a human placental cDNA library screened with a fusion containing IRF-2 amino acids 292&#x02013;349 (see Materials and Methods). The cDNA inserts in these colonies were mapped and sequenced and shown to encode two novel related products &#x0005b;referred to hereafter as IRF-2-binding proteins 1 and 2; IRF-2BP1 (GenBank accession number AY278022) and IRF-2BP2&#x0005d;, with two distinct splicing isoforms of IRF-2BP2 being isolated &#x0005b;IRF-2BP2A (GenBank accession number AY278023) and IRF-2BP2B (GenBank accession umber AY278024) that lacks 16 amino acids present in IRF-2BP2A; see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg431f3">3</xref>A&#x0005d;.</p><p>The translated ORFs of IRF-2BP1 and IRF-2BP2A encode proteins of 584 and 587 amino acids, respectively, with IRF-2BP2B encoding 571 amino acids. IRF-2BP1 and IRF-2BP2A&#x0002f;B are related proteins with two highly conserved regions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg431f3">3</xref>B); at the N-terminus there is a 64 amino acid domain which contains a single C4 zinc finger motif, and at the C-terminus the final 82 amino acids encompass a C3HC4 or RING finger. The IRF-2BPs are also related to a third human cDNA that encodes a hypothetical protein of unknown function called C14orf4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c36">36</xref>), and to the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> MO4G12 and the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> CG11138 and CG1855 gene products, also of unknown function. The C-terminal RING finger of IRF-2BP2 is sufficient for the interaction with IRF-2 since we had isolated an insert encoding amino acids 456&#x02013;587 of IRF-2BP2A&#x0002f;B as a primary interacting clone in our library screen.</p><p>The specificity of interaction of IRF-2BP1, IRF-2BP2A and IRF-2BP2B with other members of the IRF family was investigated using the yeast two-hybrid assay. Whilst all three proteins could interact with GAL.IRF-2 fusions containing a variety of C-terminal IRF-2 fragments (see below), they were not capable of interacting with fusions with the C-terminal effector domains of IRF-1 or IRF-9 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg431tb1">1</xref>). Furthermore, interactions could not be observed with non-IRF preys (Jak-1, STAT1, PKR or the p65 subunit of NF-&#x003ba;B; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg431tb1">1</xref>). IRF-2BP1, IRF-2BP2A and IRF-2BP2B failed to interact with themselves or each other indicating that they may not be able to form dimers.</p><p>The IRF-2 domain dependence for IRF-2BP binding was investigated in more detail. None of IRF-2BP1, IRF-2BP2A and IRF-2BP2B interacted with IRF-2 fragments lacking the C-terminal region (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg431tb1">1</xref>). These data show that the C-terminal 58 amino acids of IRF-2 are necessary and sufficient for interaction with the IRF-2BPs. Although all of the IRF-2BP fusions interacted with the IRF-2 repression domain encoding amino acids 292&#x02013;349, IRF-2BP1 was capable of interacting with fusions containing just the C-terminal 18 amino acids of IRF-2 (amino acids 332&#x02013;349), albeit weakly (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg431tb1">1</xref>).</p><p>The fact that multiple copies of cDNAs encoding two highly related IRF-2-interacting partners were the only factors isolated from a library screen of &#x0223c;4-fold transcriptome equivalents strongly suggests that the IRF-2BPs are physiologically important partners for IRF-2. To verify interaction with IRF-2 <italic>in vivo</italic> we constructed vectors that permitted mammalian expression of epitope-tagged forms of IRF-2BP1, IRF-2BP2A or IRF-2BP2B, and transiently transfected them into HeLa cells. Whole cell extracts were prepared from these cells and immunoprecipitated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against IRF-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c34">34</xref>) and the immunoprecipitates were fractionated on an SDS&#x02013;polyacrylamide gel and analysed by western blotting using a monoclonal antibody that recognised the epitope tag. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg431f4">4</xref>A shows that each of the IRF-2BPs is co-immunoprecipitated, indicating a strong interaction with IRF-2. To determine the sub-cellular localisation of the IRF-2BPs, transiently transfected cells were harvested and both cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts prepared and analysed by western blotting. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg431f4">4</xref>B shows that, as expected for factors that interact with IRF-2 and potentially regulate transcription, each of IRF-2BP1, IRF-2BP2A and IRF-2BP2B is localised to the nucleus.</p></sec><sec><title>IRF-2BP1 and IRF-2BP2 are novel co-repressor proteins</title><p>To investigate the function of IRF-2BP1, IRF-2BP2A and IRF-2BP2B we initially examined their effect on transcription when tethered to promoters through the DBD of GAL4. IRF-2BP1, IRF-2BP2A and IRF-2BP2B are all capable of specifically repressing transcription on both SV40-driven (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg431f5">5</xref>A) and minimal (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg431f5">5</xref>B) promoters. The magnitude of repression is similar to that seen with a GAL4 fusion to a fragment of IRF-2 spanning amino acids 88&#x02013;349. Interestingly, although a fusion with just the RING domain of IRF-2BP2 (amino acids 456&#x02013;587) is unable to repress transcription from the SV40-driven promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg431f5">5</xref>A), it retains the ability to repress transcription from a minimal promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg431f5">5</xref>B). The repression effects were dependent upon recruitment of GAL4 fusion proteins to the promoter since repression was not seen when the multimeric GAL UAS was replaced with a random sequence of DNA &#x0005b;pSV40(lacP&#x0002f;O)tk&#x00394;(&#x02013;39)lucter&#x0005d;, nor with reporters under the control of other promoters lacking a GAL UAS &#x0005b;ptk&#x00394;(&#x02013;39)lucter; ptk&#x00394;(&#x02013;105)lucter; data not shown&#x0005d;.</p><p>To test whether IRF-2BP1&#x0002f;2 retain the ability to repress transcription when recruited to DNA indirectly through association with IRF-2, we examined whether they could enhance the degree of repression exerted by GAL.IRF-2 fusions. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg431f5">5</xref>C shows that repression by GAL.IRF-2 could be significantly enhanced by co-expression of IRF-2BP1 or IRF-2BP2A (IRF-2BP2B was not tested in this experiment). We conclude from this that IRF-2BP1 and IRF-2BP2A can repress transcription by their recruitment to promoters by IRF-2.</p><p>In order to test whether the IRF-2BPs affect transcriptional regulation through IRFs bound to their cognate DNA binding sites we investigated the behaviour of the IRF-dependent promoter, &#x0005b;p&#x0005b;(AAGTGA)4&#x0005d;<sub>5</sub>tk&#x00394;(&#x02013;39)lucter&#x0005d;, in transient transfection experiments. We have shown previously that the activity of this reporter in HeLa cells represents a balance of the opposing activities of IRF-1 and IRF-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c23">23</xref>). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg431f5">5</xref>D (lane 1) shows that in the absence of co-transfected IRF expression plasmids this reporter is only weakly active; this observation was expected since HeLa cells contain abundant IRF-2 but no detectable IRF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c34">34</xref>). The activity is strongly stimulated by IRF-1 expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg431f5">5</xref>D, lane 2), and this stimulation is antagonised by co-expressing IRF-2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg431f5">5</xref>D, lane 3). Co-transfection of expressing plasmids for IRF-2BP1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg431f5">5</xref>D, lane 4), and IRF-2BP2A (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg431f5">5</xref>D, lane 5), reduced IRF-1-dependent activation to 20&#x02013;30&#x00025;, whilst IRF-2BP2B (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg431f5">5</xref>D, lane 6), reduced activation to &#x0223c;60&#x00025;. Since the IRF-2BPs were unable to influence the transcriptional activity of IRF-1 when examined as a GAL4 fusion (the function of which is independent of IRF-2; data not shown), and were unable to interact with IRF-1 in the yeast two-hybrid assay (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg431tb1">1</xref>), the effects of IRF-2BP1, IRF-2BP2A and IRF-2BP2B are likely acting through endogenous IRF-2, and thus they repress transcription in an IRF-2-dependent manner.</p></sec><sec><title>Repression by IRF-2 and the IRF-2BP co-repressors is still seen in the presence of a histone deacetylase inhibitor</title><p>Many transcriptional repressors exert their effect either directly or indirectly through the deacetylation of histones in the vicinity of their binding site &#x0005b;reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c37">37</xref>)&#x0005d;. To test whether IRF-2 and its associated co-repressors work in this manner we treated cells with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor trichostatin A. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg431f6">6</xref> shows that repression of SV40-driven transcription by the GAL.IRF-2(88&#x02013;349) fusion is unaffected by trichostatin A suggesting that it is HDAC-independent. Although transcriptional repression by GAL4 fusions with IRF-2BP1, IRF-2BP2A or IRF-2BP2B was seen in the presence and absence of trichostatin A, repression by IRF-2BP1 and IRF-2BP2A is partially relieved by the addition of trichostatin A. This effect was not seen with IRF-2BP2B, which retained full repression in the presence of trichostatin A. These results suggest that the IRF-2BPs must exert a significant part of their repressive activity through a mechanism(s) that is independent of histone deacetylation.</p></sec><sec><title>An isoform of IRF-2, IRF-2&#x0005b;S&#x0005d;, which lacks two amino acids, cannot interact with the IRF-2BPs nor repress transcription</title><p>During the course of our investigations we identified a form of IRF-2 that lacks valine 177 and valine 178; this alternative form of IRF-2 lacks 6 bp that derive from the exon 5&#x0002f;exon 6 junction and has recently been described by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c38">38</xref>), and according to their convention we refer to this alternative form as IRF-2&#x0005b;S&#x0005d;. It was reported that IRF-2&#x0005b;S&#x0005d; is a less efficient transcriptional activator of the CIITA promoter than IRF-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c38">38</xref>). In order to test whether the repressive activities of IRF-2&#x0005b;S&#x0005d; and IRF-2 are also different we constructed a GAL.IRF-2&#x0005b;S&#x0005d; fusion containing the equivalent of amino acids 88&#x02013;349 &#x0005b;GAL.IRF-2&#x0005b;S&#x0005d;(88&#x02013;347)&#x0005d; and compared its ability to repress transcription with that seen with GAL.IRF-2(88&#x02013;349). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg431f7">7</xref>A and B show that the IRF-2&#x0005b;S&#x0005d; fusion is unable to repress transcription from either the enhancer-activated or basal reporter genes. This result is surprising since both forms of IRF-2 contain an identical C-terminal repression domain (292&#x02013;349) that is sufficient for repression when fused to GAL4 and sufficient for strong interaction with the IRF-2BPs.</p><p>To confirm that the effects of GAL.IRF fusions are operating at the level of transcription, we analysed RNA from transient transfections of the fusions and a reporter gene consisting of a human &#x003b2;-globin gene under the control of a minimal promoter. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg431f7">7</xref>C shows that transcription from this promoter is markedly repressed by GAL.IRF-2(88&#x02013;349), whereas the IRF-2&#x0005b;S&#x0005d; counterpart, GAL.IRF-2&#x0005b;S&#x0005d;(88&#x02013;347)&#x0005d;, is without effect.</p><p>One explanation for the difference in the negative regulatory properties of IRF-2 and IRF-2&#x0005b;S&#x0005d; may be that the C-terminal repression domains are in different conformations. Structural predictions for IRF-2 suggest that the loss of V177 and V178 disrupts the secondary structure in this region of IRF-2&#x0005b;S&#x0005d;, and generates a protein which has an alternative &#x003b2;-sheet structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c38">38</xref>). Whilst this putative structural change does not affect the ability of IRF-2&#x0005b;S&#x0005d; to bind to DNA, it may influence the conformation of other domains and this has been suggested to account for the difference in transactivation properties of IRF-2 and IRF-2&#x0005b;S&#x0005d; on the CIITA promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c38">38</xref>). To test whether the C-terminal repression domains of IRF-2 and IRF-2&#x0005b;S&#x0005d; differ in their ability to recruit the IRF-2BPs, we constructed a GAL.IRF-2&#x0005b;S&#x0005d; fusion that could be used in the yeast two-hybrid assay and investigated the interaction between this and the IRF-2BPs. Unlike the equivalent GAL.IRF-2 fusion, GAL.IRF-2&#x0005b;S&#x0005d; was incapable of interacting with any of IRF-2BP1, IRF-2BP2A or IRF-2BP2B (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg431tb1">1</xref>), demonstrating that the C-terminal repression&#x0002f;IRF-2BP-interacting domain is non-functional in the context of the IRF-2&#x0005b;S&#x0005d; protein. We also noted that the interaction between the IRF-2BPs and a GAL4 fusion with full-length IRF-2 (GAL.IRF-2&#x0005b;1&#x02013;349&#x0005d;) is weaker than that with GAL.IRF-2(292&#x02013;349), consistent with IRF-2 N-terminal sequences having an effect on interactions with the C-terminus (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg431tb1">1</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We have identified two novel nuclear factors, IRF-2BP1 and IRF-2BP2 (comprising two closely related splicing isoforms, A and B), which interact with the C-terminal 58 amino acids of IRF-2. This region of IRF-2 is a fully independent transcriptional repression domain and IRF-2BP1, IRF-2BP2A and IRF-2BP2B have the properties of co-repressor molecules that act by recruitment to DNA through this domain. Although this domain is intact in the IRF-2&#x0005b;S&#x0005d; isoform, the loss of valines 177 and 178 prevents interaction with IRF-2BP1, IRF-2BP2A and IRF-2BP2B leading to loss of transcriptional repression. These data independently verify the importance of IRF-2BP1, IRF-2BP2A and IRF-2BP2B as transcriptional co-repressors. An understanding of the biological functions of IRF-2&#x0005b;S&#x0005d; awaits further work.</p><p>IRF-2-BP1 and IRF-2BP2A&#x0002f;B have an N-terminal C4 zinc finger and a C-terminal C3HC4 RING finger, and these features are conserved between the IRF-2BPs and the uncharacterised human C14orf4 gene product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c36">36</xref>). This sequence is sufficiently related to the IRF-2BPs that it is possible that the C14orf4 gene product also interacts with IRF-2, but we have not tested this. The IRF-2BPs are also related to the <italic>C.elegans</italic> MO4G12 and the <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> CG11138 and CG1855 gene products. In none of these cases has the function been ascertained; since IRF homologues do not occur in <italic>C.elegans</italic> or <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> the IRF-2BPs may be members of a wider group of proteins that interact with a range of transcription factors.</p><p>The C3HC4 RING is a feature found in diverse families of proteins (including some co-repressors) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c41">41</xref>) and serves as a domain for protein&#x02013;protein interaction &#x0005b;reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c42">42</xref>)&#x0005d;. A major function of the RING finger in some of these proteins is to serve as a bridge between E2 and E3 ubiquitin ligases &#x0005b;reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c43">43</xref>)&#x0005d;, and in the case of NOT4 this activity is essential for repression by the CCR4&#x02013;NOT complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c44">44</xref>). Furthermore, members of the protein inhibitor of activated STATs (PIAS) family have recently been shown to act as SUMO E3 ligases; the transfer of SUMO to a number of transcriptional activators has been shown to alter their nuclear distribution and correlates with a down-regulation in their activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c51">51</xref>). Although we have yet to determine whether IRF-2BP1, IRF-2BP2A and IRF-2BP2B have ubiquitin or SUMO ligase activity it should be stressed that they have no homology with known ligases.</p><p>The RING finger motif of IRF-2BP2A&#x0002f;B (amino acids 456&#x02013;587) is sufficient to interact with the C-terminus of IRF-2, but is not sufficient to repress enhancer-driven transcription, implying that some other region of IRF-2BP2A&#x0002f;B (and presumably IRF-2BP1) is responsible for repression. Additional regions of IRF-2BP1 and IRF-2BP2 have features in common with other repressors or co-repressors. Immediately after the N-terminal conserved C4 zinc finger is a segment rich in alanine, glutamine and proline residues (also present in the C14orf4 gene product where the extended alanine and glutamine stretch is inserted). There are also several clusters of prolines, another feature that is commonly found in or near to repression domains, as evidenced in p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c52">52</xref>), Groucho (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c53">53</xref>) and HNF4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c54">54</xref>).</p><p>Since C4 type zinc fingers are typically found in DBDs of proteins, it is possible that the N-terminal zinc finger of IRF-2BP1&#x0002f;2 can bind to DNA. If this is the case, then its role may be to stabilise the interaction of the IRF-2&#x02013;IRF-2BP1&#x0002f;2 complex with the target promoter. It is also possible that this domain could mediate an interaction with another protein, either a transcription factor bound to the promoter adjacent to IRF-2 or a component of the basal transcriptional machinery.</p><p>Studies on co-repressors indicate that they often either possess or recruit HDAC activities to the target promoter and thereby modify local nucleosome structure to make the promoter less accessible to the transcriptional machinery &#x0005b;reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c37">37</xref>)&#x0005d;. Our experiments indicate that repression by GAL.IRF-2 fusions containing amino acids 88&#x02013;349 of IRF-2 and by GAL.IRF-2BP2B is unaffected by an inhibitor of HDAC activity, and that repression by GAL.IRF-2BP1 and GAL.IRF-2BP2A is only partially sensitive to this inhibitor. These experiments suggest that repression by IRF-2 and its associated co-repressors does not depend upon histone deacetylation. This is consistent with observations on several other repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c55">55</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c57">57</xref>). It is possible that the low level of HDAC-dependency seen with IRF-2BP1 and IRF-2BP2A reflects an activity that is required for repression when recruited to DNA through some transcription factor other than IRF-2.</p><p>Since the activity of the IRF-2BPs is largely independent of HDAC activity, repression must be achieved by other means. Several examples have been described in which repressors or co-repressors act by preventing the formation of a stable initiation complex. For example, the N-terminal repression domain of N-CoR has been shown to prevent the interaction between TFIIB and TAFII32 that is required for transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c58">58</xref>). We note that IRF-2BP1 can bind (albeit weakly) to a sub-region of the C-terminal repression domain of IRF-2 (amino acids 332&#x02013;349), and that this IRF-2 sub-domain is sufficient to mediate repression of a minimal promoter, consistent with a repressor that is functioning by interference with the basal transcriptional machinery. We also note that at very high levels of expression, IRF-2BP1 exerts a limited degree of interference with promoters to which it should not bind (data not shown); this behaviour might be explained by sequestering some essential component of the basal transcriptional apparatus (commonly referred to as squelching). It is interesting to note that IRF-2 has been reported to interact with TFIIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c20">20</xref>); perhaps the IRF-2BPs prevent an interaction between IRF-2-bound TFIIB and another transcriptional co-factor. The IRF-2BPs might also act by preventing the recruitment or activity of the histone acetylases GCN5, PCAF and p300 to promoters by IRF-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c59">59</xref>).</p><p>In a previous analysis of the repressor functions of IRF-2, Senger <italic>et al</italic>. were unable to identify a single domain that was capable of repressing a range of different GAL4-transactivator fusion proteins tethered to the DNA through a common site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c18">18</xref>). Instead, the magnitude of repression gradually diminished as more of IRF-2 was removed, with some activators requiring larger fragments of IRF-2 than others. The authors proposed that basic amino acids in the IRF-2 repression domain build a positively charged microenvironment that repels activator-recruited incoming CBP, or destabilises the CBP-activator interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg431c18">18</xref>). Such a model is intrinsically devoid of requirement for co-repressors. These results might also be explained if IRF-2 makes specific direct or indirect contacts with several individual components of the transcription machinery (and with chromatin and chromatin-modifying components) as seen for conventional transcriptional repressors. The identification of the IRF-2BPs as IRF-2-dependent co-repressors is consistent with this hypothesis.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg431f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Reporter and effector gene constructs.

(<bold>A</bold>) Organisation of clones isolated for IRF-2BP1, IRF-2BP2A and IRF-2BP2B. The yeast two-hybrid cDNA library screen generated five independent isolates of a 2579 bp insert that encodes IRF-2BP1. This sequence derives from an uncharacterised gene on chromosome 19 (GenBank accession number AC008623, nucleotides 134839&#x02013;137352). The first in-frame ATG is located 348 bp from the 5&#x02032; end of the insert; this was determined to be the initiating methionine, as an in-frame stop codon is present 600 bp upstream from this in the genomic sequence, and no EST clones have been identified containing upstream sequences. The ATG is followed by an uninterrupted open reading frame of 584 amino acids followed by a 3&#x02032;UTR, polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) and a poly(A) tail. A single isolate of the insert shown for IRF-2BP2A was obtained. The insert comprises &#x0223c;2500 bp derived from an uncharacterised gene on chromosome 1 (GenBank accession numbers AL161640, nucleotides 28362&#x02013;30847, and AL160408 nucleotides 4723&#x02013;2239). Due to the high G-C content of the 5&#x02032; end of this insert (and that for IRF-2BP2B; see below) we were unable to obtain accurate sequence data at the 5&#x02032; end and we note that the available sequences of both genomic clones and the ESTs stop in the same place. We have tentatively assigned the initiator ATG for IRF-2BP2A on the basis that: (i) the sequence is identical to IRF-2BP2B and very similar to IRF-2BP1 in this region; (ii) the encoded protein initiating from this ATG is highly homologous to proteins found in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>C.elegans</italic> proteins (see text and B); (iii) the assigned initiator ATG conforms to the consensus Kozak sequence; (iv) such G-C-rich sequences are frequently found in 5&#x02032;UTRs. The ATG is followed by an open reading frame of 587 amino acids, which is terminated by a 3&#x02032; TAG stop codon; this cDNA clone does not have a poly(A) tail. Two independent isolates of the 2600 bp insert encoding IRF-2BP2B were obtained. IRF-2BP2A and IRF-2BP2B differ in the size of the single intron, and thus represent alternative splice forms of a single gene. IRF-2BP2B lacks 48bp, representing 16 amino acids, that are present in IRF-2BP2A. The presumptive splice acceptor site is the same in both inserts (AL161640 nucleotide 30026) and conforms to the consensus of 10 pyrimidines followed by NCAG. The presumptive donor sites are AGGT at nucleotide 29433 for IRF-2BP2A and AGGC at nucleotide 29385 for IRF-2BP2B. We also recovered 28 independent isolates of the indicated insert of 775 bp that encodes a 3&#x02032; region common to both IRF-2BP2A and IRF-2BP2B.
