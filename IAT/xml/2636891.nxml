A neutralizing B cell epitope has recently been mapped to the N-terminus of HPV16 L2, residues 17&#x02013;36, and exposure of this region of L2 has been implicated in translocation of incoming virions from the endo/lysosomal compartment to the cellular cytoplasm. Here we examine the redox state of Cys22 and Cys28 two highly conserved cysteines located within this epitope. We also investigate the infectivity of virions containing L2 single and double cysteine point mutants.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology and Principal Findings</title><p>Denaturing/non-reducing gel analysis and thiol labeling experiments of wild type and cysteine mutant HPV16 virion particles strongly support the existence of a buried intramolecular C22&#x02013;C28 disulfide bond. The disulfide was confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry of L2 protein from non-reduced virions. Single C22S and C28S and the double C22/28S mutants were non-infectious but had no apparent defects in cell binding, endocytosis, or trafficking to lysosomes by 8 h post infection. During infection with L2 mutant particles, there was a marked decrease in L2 levels compared to wild type L2-containing virions, suggesting a failure of mutant L2/genome complexes to exit the endo/lysosomal compartment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions and Significance</title><p>L2 residues C22 and C28 are bound as an intramolecular disulfide bond in HPV16 virions and are necessary for infectivity. Previous work has suggested that the furin-dependent exposure of the 17&#x02013;36 epitope and subsequent interaction of this region with an unknown receptor is necessary for egress from the endo/lysosomal compartment and infection. Identification of the C22&#x02013;C28 disulfide suggests that reduction of this disufide bond may be necessary for exposure of 17&#x02013;36 and HPV16 infection.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are small non-enveloped DNA viruses and are the causative agents of cervical cancer, with HPV type 16 being responsible for more than 50&#x00025; of cervical cancers in women worldwide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004463-Muoz1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004463-zurHausen1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Both are absolutely conserved across all known mammalian and avian PV types. Recently, L2 residues 17&#x02013;36 have been identified as a B-cell epitope that is capable of eliciting a cross-neutralizing antibody response against a broad variety of HPV types, making the antigen a promising vaccine candidate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004463-Alphs1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004463-Gambhira1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Given the position of C22 and C28 within this neutralizing antibody epitope and the highly oxidized state of mature particles we sought to examine the redox state of C22 and C28 in HPV16 virions and their role in infectivity. We found that C22 and C28 exist as a buried intramolecular disulfide in mature virions. C22S and C28S single and C22/28S double mutant virions were non-infectious but exhibited normal cell binding, uptake, and lysosomal colocalization at 8 h post infection. Interestingly, the mutant L2 proteins were degraded more rapidly than wild type L2 during the course of infection. We hypothesize that the cysteine mutants may be defective for endosomal escape, resulting in lysosomal degradation of L2/genome complexes wherein infection is blocked.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Conserved L2 cysteines are not accessible for BMCC-biotin modification</title><p>Sequence alignment of diverse papillomavirus types shows that C22 and C28 of HPV16 L2 are absolutely conserved throughout the Family <italic>Papillomaviridae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004463-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>), prompting us to further examine the role of these two cysteines in HPV infection. To examine the native redox state of the two highly conserved L2 cysteines within the structural context of virions, we performed a thiol-specific biotinylation assay. Purified HPV16 virions were kept in their native state or reduced by DTT prior to chemical biotinylation with either amine-specific NHS-biotin or thiol-specific BMCC-biotin reagents. Biotinylated proteins were then detected by western blot and streptavidin-HRP staining. NHS-biotin labeling resulted in robust biotinylation of the amine groups of both L1 and L2 capsid proteins, irrespective of the redox status of the virions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004463-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;2). In contrast, L2 was only labeled detectably with BMCC-biotin if the virions were first reduced by DTT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004463-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, lane 4). This suggests that within the context of intact particles, C22 and C28 of HPV16 L2 are either buried and inaccessible to BMCC-biotin or they are bound up as disulfides, S-nitrosothiols (S-NO), or some other S-alkyl modification. These possibilities are not mutually exclusive, as the cysteines could be both modified and buried.</p><fig id="pone-0004463-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004463.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Highly conserved HPV16 L2 cysteines C22 and C28 are not reactive with BMCC-biotin in native virions.</title><p>(A) Primary amino acid sequence alignment of L2 proteins from various members of the Family <italic>Papillomaviridae</italic> shows conservation of C22 and C28 (HPV16) across divergent <italic>genera</italic>.

The cysteines could be linked as intermolecular disulfides to form L2-L2 dimers or they could be bound as an intramolecular disulfide to form a hairpin-like structure. L2 could also form a disulfide link to L1, which contains twelve cysteine residues. Alternatively, the L2 cysteines could be bonded to small molecules like glutathione or free cysteine as mixed disulfides or bound to nitric oxide (NO) as an S-NO group. To address these possibilities, denaturing SDS-PAGE was performed under non-reducing conditions to visualize any disulfide-linked proteins in the virions containing wild type and mutant L2 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004463-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). L1 was present as high molecular weight multimers in all the virion preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004463-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;4). L2 was present only as monomers in wild type virions, excluding the possibilities of disulfide linked L2-L2 dimers or L2-L1 complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004463-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, lane 5). As expected the double mutant was only detected as a monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004463-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, lane 8). Interestingly, the single C22S and C28S mutants were present mainly as L2 monomers although a small fraction existed as disulfide linked 150 kDa L2-L2 dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004463-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, lanes 6&#x02013;7). Recent cryoEM data from Buck <italic>et al.</italic> suggest a maximum stoichiometry of one L2 molecule per L1 pentamer or 72 L2 molecules per virion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004463-Buck1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. L2 is therefore present at &#x0223c;30&#x00025; occupancy in each of our preparations, making it likely that the L2-L2 dimers may represent the small fraction of the total L2 molecules that lie close enough in space within the 72 L1-pentamer lattice to form intermolecular disulfide linkages. The absence of intermolecular L2 dimers in wild type HPV16 virions suggests that C22 and C28 are bound either as an intramolecular disulfide hairpin or as conjugates to small molecules, molecular forms that could potentially have the same migration pattern as reduced L2 in a polyacrylamide gel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004463-Dunker1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the L2-L2 dimerization in the C22S and C28S mutant virions argues that the cysteines are normally present as an intramolecular disulfide; if they were bound as small molecule mixed disulfides or S-NO groups, then the single mutants would not be capable of L2-L2 dimerization because the single remaining cysteine would still be bound up and unavailable for disulfide linkage.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>L2 cysteines are present as an intramolecular disulfide hairpin</title><p>Thiol-specific biotinylation experiments were performed to further elucidate the nature of HPV16 L2 C22 and C28 residues. Virions were kept in their native state, reduced by DTT, or denatured with SDS prior to BMCC-biotin labeling. As seen previously, L2 molecules from virions in their native state were not labeled by BMCC-biotin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004463-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>) and reduction of virions was required for L2 biotinylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004463-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). For the reduced samples, L2 biotinylation was less pronounced for the C22S and C28S mutants than for virions containing wild type HPV16 L2 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004463-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;3), presumably because single mutants have only half the number of cysteines available for BMCC-biotin modification. As expected, no labeling was observed for the double C22/28S mutant, which lacks cysteine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004463-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>, lane 4). If C22 and C28 were normally bound together as an intramolecular disulfide one might predict that the lone cysteines of the single C22S and C28S mutants in their native virion states would be free and available to react with BMCC-biotin. Yet, biotinylation was only observed upon virion reduction with DTT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004463-g003">Fig. 3A &#x00026; B</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;3). Inaccessibility of the L2 cysteines in native virion paticles could explain this lack of BMCC-biotin labeling. To determine if C22 and C28 are simply buried in the context of native virions, virions were denatured with SDS treatment prior to BMCC-biotin labeling. Only the C22S and C28S single mutants exhibited robust L2 biotinylation upon denaturation with SDS, indicating that a majority of the lone cysteines of the C22S and C28S single mutants exist as free thiols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004463-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;3). L2 proteins of wild type HPV16 virions were only minimally labeled after denaturation, suggesting that although C22 and C28 are accessible, they are disulfide bonded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004463-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>, lane 1). Again no labeling was seen for the C22/28S double mutant because no cysteines are present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004463-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>, lane 4).</p><fig id="pone-0004463-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004463.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Thiol biotinylation assay of HPV16 L2 cysteine mutants.</title><p>(A) Lack of L2 biotinylation by BMCC-biotin of normal and mutant virions in their native state suggest that L2 cysteines are either buried and inaccessible to BMCC-biotin or bound up and not present as free thiols.

Purified wild type HPV16 virions were reacted with excess N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) to protect any native disulfide bonds from reduction by reactive free thiols. Virion proteins were then separated by denaturing, non-reducing SDS-PAGE and the L2 band was excised for in-gel trypsin digestion and extraction of tryptic peptides. Trypsin cleavage of L2 is predicted to occur following lysine residues K20, K23, and K35, within the immediate vicinity of C22 and C28, in the L2 primary amino acid sequence. K23 is positioned between C22 and C28, so the disulfide will link the adjacent T21-K23 and Q24-K35 tryptic peptides.

The majority of the AF594 signal in microscopy experiments therefore is likely to reflect L1, and this signal may persist even if L1 is proteolytically degraded. To examine the fate of the capsid proteins during cell entry and trafficking, cells were exposed to virus and whole cell lysates harvested at 0 h and 8 h post infection were subjected to immunoblotting for L1 and L2. Known amounts of purified HPV16 virions were resolved on the gels as a control to which the intensities of the sample bands on the same blot could be compared and relative differences in band intensity across different blots determined. Initial particle binding was equivalent among the HPV16 wild type and different L2 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004463-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;5) in agreement with the confocal microscopy data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004463-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>).

Initial levels of L2 were also comparable among the different mutants again demonstrating no defects in L2 levels in the virus particles or in cell binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004463-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;5).

Recently a cross-neutralizing B-cell epitope has been mapped to residues 17&#x02013;36 of HPV16 L2 and RG-1, a monoclonal antibody against this epitope has been characterized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004463-Gambhira1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Here we studied two highly conserved cysteine residues, C22 and C28, located within the RG-1 epitope. The redox status of L2 was studied by non-reducing SDS-PAGE and thiol-specific BMCC-biotin labeling experiments of HPV16 wild type and L2 cysteine mutant virions. Taken together, results strongly suggest that C22 and C28 are bonded as a buried intramolecular disulfide in wild type virions. Mutation of either C22 or C28 in L2 results in free cysteines that react with BMCC-biotin when denatured by SDS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004463-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;3). A small percentage of these C22S or C28S mutant L2 molecules can actually form L2-L2 dimers through an intermolecular disulfide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004463-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, lanes 6&#x02013;7). Wild type L2 can neither form L2-L2 dimers nor react with BMCC-biotin after SDS-denaturation because C22 and C28 are bound together as a disulfide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004463-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, lane5 &#x00026; 3C, lane 1). Consistent with these conclusions, the C22&#x02013;C28 intramolecular disulfide was directly observed in non-reduced wild type L2 by tandem MS/MS analysis of polyacrylamide gel purified protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004463-g004">Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p>All L2 cysteine mutant virions were non-infectious despite exhibiting normal cell binding, internalization, and trafficking to LAMP-1 positive lysosomes by 8 h post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004463-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). This finding is not entirely unexpected since previous work suggests that HPV16 virus like particles (VLPs), composed entirely of major capsid protein L1 bind and enter host cells normally, trafficking to the lysosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004463-Day2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. During the first 8 h of infection, we detected notable differences in the degradation of incoming wild type and mutant L2 proteins. While L2 levels decreased to &#x0223c;30&#x00025; the input for wild type virions during the first 8 h of infection, levels of mutant L2 were greatly diminished to less than 1&#x00025; of input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004463-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>, black bars). The remarkable decrease in mutant L2 protein levels correlates well with the infectivity data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004463-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>) and may reflect the inability of these mutant particles to progress past the endo/lysosomal compartment. We hypothesize the mutant L2 containing virions bind and enter cells normally, trafficking to the lysosomal compartment, but the L2/genome complex fails to exit the lysosome and becomes degraded within this compartment, thereby abrogating infectivity.</p><p>Day <italic>et al.</italic> recently characterized the mechanisms of RG-1 neutralization, finding that the RG-1 epitope (L2 residues 17&#x02013;36) is initially occluded but becomes accessible to RG-1 after a conformational change occurs on the surface of host cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004463-Day5">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Further, they demonstrate that RG-1 epitope exposure is dependent on cleavage of L2 by the cellular protease furin, a cleavage event that is essential for infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004463-Richards1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. The highly conserved furin cleavage site is positioned at residues R9&#x02013;R12, only ten residues upstream of the C22&#x02013;C28 disulfide. Abrogation of furin cleavage through either an R9S mutation in L2 or treatment with the furin inhibitor dec.-RVKR-cmk blocks infectivity albeit the virions bind and enter cells normally, traffic and uncoat within the endosomal pathway, but fail to exit the endo/lysosomal compartment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004463-Richards1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, furin-dependent display of the RG-1 epitope is likely important for endosomal escape of HPV L2/genome complexes. Our data presented herein show that in mature virions the RG-1 epitope is hidden in a buried disulfide-bonded conformation and we hypothesize that exposure of the epitope may be dependent on reduction of the C22&#x02013;C28 disulfide, in addition to furin cleavage. Previous work has shown that the RG-1 antibody is reactive with L2 by western blot <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004463-Gambhira1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref> and is therefore likely to only bind L2 17&#x02013;36 in a reduced conformation, although this has not formally been examined. Our findings in the context of those of Day and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004463-Day5">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref> suggest a possible mechanistic connection between furin cleavage and reduction of L2. However, the temporal sequence of the two events is currently unclear. One possibility is that a disulfide bonded structure may be needed for furin cleavage of L2, similar to what has been shown for HIV gp160 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004463-Sen1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004463-Wang1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Alternatively, reduction of the C22&#x02013;C28 disulfide may be a prerequisite for furin cleavage. Another possibility is that furin cleavage could precede and be required for reduction of the disulfide and exposure of the RG-1 epitope. A similar phenomenon has been shown for <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> exotoxin A (PE), a secreted ribotoxin that enters cells, traffics to the endo/lysosomal compartment and requires furin cleavage, disulfide reduction, and low pH for translocation into the cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004463-Inocencio1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004463-Mr1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. In the case of PE, furin cleavage triggers a conformational change that enables reduction of an internal disulfide by a host protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) or PDI-like enzyme, and subsequent release and cytosolic translocation of the ribotoxin domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004463-McKee1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus it seems that the host cell receptor for the RG-1 epitope is a cell surface protein, although binding of L2 to this unknown host factor is only important for egress of genome/L2 from the endo/lysosomal compartment and not for virion uptake. The 13&#x02013;31 peptide likely binds to cells in a reduced form, as these studies were performed with peptide-GFP-GST fusions purified on immobilized glutathione and eluted with <italic>reduced</italic> glutathione <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004463-Yang1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Further, 13&#x02013;31 peptide binding was blocked through a valine double point mutation of residues 21 and 22 (T21V, C22V), suggesting that the free thiol group from the reduced C22 residue may directly interact with the unknown receptor. From our data we cannot ascertain whether the defect observed for the L2 cysteine mutants comes from the lack of the C22&#x02013;C28 disulfide structure or whether it is a consequence of a failed interaction/binding between the exposed RG-1 epitope and an unknown host receptor due to the replacement of cysteines with serines. The high conservation of the RG-1 epitope and C22/C28 among HPV types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004463-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) may be a result of selective pressures to both maintain the binding/interaction capabilities necessary for endosomal escape as well as to conceal this region from immune surveillance in the form of a disulfide bonded structure.

For non-reducing/denaturing PAGE, HPV16 samples were diluted as above into HSB containing 2 mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM, Sigma) and reacted for 1.5 h at room temperature. The purpose of the NEM reaction is to inactivate free thiols (cysteines) prior to denaturation, thereby preventing reduction of any native disulfide bonds by these free thiols during denaturation. Samples were then mixed with an equal volume of non-reducing/denaturing SDS-PAGE loading buffer (62.5 mM Tris pH 6.8, 10&#x00025; glycerol, 2&#x00025; SDS, 0.05&#x00025; bromophenol blue) and incubated at room temperature for 10 min prior to electrophoresis on 7.5&#x00025; polyacrylamide gels. Samples were transferred to PVDF membranes and L1 and L2 capsid proteins were detected by probing with 1&#x02236;10,000 dilutions of anti-&#x0005b;HPV16 L1&#x0005d; monoclonal antibody (Abcam #30908) and 1&#x02236;7500 dilutions of anti-&#x0005b;HPV31 L2&#x0005d; polyclonal antisera (DK43811, kindly provided by Richard Roden, Johns Hopkins) with 1&#x02236;25,000 dilutions of the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary. HRP signal was detected with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific).</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Thiol biotinylation assays</title><p>HPV16 virions (1 &#x000b5;g L1) were incubated overnight at room temperature in either 200 &#x000b5;l HSB (native), HSB&#x0002b;10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT; reduced). Samples were loaded onto Amicon Ultra-4 5,000 MWCO centrifugation filter units (Millipore) and washed 3&#x000d7; and resuspended in 120 &#x000b5;l HSB. Biotinylation reactions were then set up using 20 &#x000b5;l of native or DTT-reduced virion sample and 1 &#x000b5;g of either amine-reactive biotinyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (NHS-biotin, Sigma) or thiol-reactive 1-biotinamido-4-&#x0005b;4&#x02032;-(maleimidomethyl)cyclohexanecarboxamido&#x0005d;butane (BMCC-biotin, Thermo Scientific). Samples were biotinylated for 30 min at 37&#x000b0;C and stopped by the addition of 10 &#x000b5;l denaturing/reducing SDS-PAGE loading buffer (containing Tris and 2-ME to quench amine/thiol reactive reagents). Samples were denatured at 95&#x000b0;C for 5 min and 10 &#x000b5;l aliquots were electrophoresed on 7.5&#x00025; polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membranes for detection of biotinylated proteins by probing with streptavidin-HRP. SDS denaturation experiments were performed by diluting HPV16 virions (500 ng L1) into 50 &#x000b5;l HSB&#x0002b;1&#x00025; SDS and 1 &#x000b5;g BMCC-biotin.

The gel was briefly stained with Biosafe Coomassie (Biorad) to visualize L1 and L2 bands. The L2 protein band (about 2 &#x000b5;g total L2 protein) was excised and in-gel tryptic digestion was done as previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004463-Shevchenko1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>. The digest was done in the presence of a mass spectrometry friendly surfactant (Protease Max, Promega) to provide increased sequence coverage and the reduction and alkylation steps were excluded. Extracted peptides were dried to completion and reconstituted to 8 &#x000b5;l in 0.1&#x00025; formic acid, 2&#x00025; acetonitrile, water. Nano reversed phase HPLC was done using a 2D nanoLC (Eksigent) with buffer A consisting of 0.1&#x00025; (v/v) formic acid in water and buffer B 0.1&#x00025; formic acid in acetonitrile. A fused silica column self packed with duragel C18 matrix (Peeke Scientific) was used with a linear gradient from 5&#x00025; B to 40&#x00025; B over 60 minutes at a flow rate of 450 nl/min. The nanoHPLC was interfaced with a nanomate (Advion Biosciences) for nanoESI into the mass spectrometer. The mass spectrometer was a LCQ Deca XP Plus (Thermo Scientific) that was set in data dependent acquisition mode to perform MS/MS on the top three most intense ions with a dynamic exclusion setting of four. The DTA files were extracted from the raw data using the bioworks browser (Thermo Scientific). The data were searched against the NCBI Virus database using Mascot, as well as against the late minor capsid protein L2 (gi 4927726) sequence using SEQUEST (Thermo Scientific).</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Virion binding and entry assays</title><p>HaCaT cells were sparsely seeded on sterile glass coverslips and grown for 1.5 days.

Cell lysates were prepared by direct addition of 200 &#x000b5;l SDS-PAGE loading buffer to the cell monolayers. Lysates were clarified of genomic DNA by passage through QiaShredder spin columns (Qiagen) and heated to 95&#x000b0;C for 5 min prior to separation on a 7.5&#x00025; polyacrylamide gel. Cell lysate (15 &#x000b5;l) was analyzed for L1 immunoblots and 30 &#x000b5;l of the lysate was analyzed for L2 immunodetection. Control lanes contained known amounts of HPV16 virions; 31 ng of L1 (9.5&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup> particles) for L1 blots and 62 ng of L1 (1.9&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup> particles) for L2 blots.
