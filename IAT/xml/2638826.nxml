In JNCL, retinal degeneration manifests at age 5&#x02013;7 years usually followed by seizures and a progressive loss of motor skills and mental acuity. JNCL is invariably fatal, with death occurring usually by 25 years. Histopathologically, post-mortem brain material from JNCL patients shows widespread neuronal loss with accompanying gliosis (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C3">3</xref>). Common to all NCLs, both neuronal and peripheral tissues from JNCL patients show extensive accumulations of lysosomal storage material, indicative of some form of lysosomal dysfunction. Consequently, the NCLs are included in the larger family of metabolic disorders, the lysosomal storage disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C4">4</xref>).</p><p>JNCL is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from mutations in the gene <italic>CLN3</italic> that encodes a multi-spanning transmembrane protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C6">6</xref>). <italic>CLN3</italic> is expressed widely and many cell types from JNCL patients display lysosomal storage material. However, only neuronal pathology is seen: either the CLN3 protein has a function unique to neurons or neurons are particularly susceptible to loss of CLN3. Although major progress has been made using mouse models to examine the disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C10">10</xref>), our understanding is currently restricted by a lack of knowledge about the functions of, and even the precise location of, the CLN3 protein within cells.</p><p>Various approaches have been used to study the cell biology of CLN3. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies using <italic>CLN3</italic> mutant cell lines generated from mouse models and human patients have suggested roles for CLN3 in many cellular processes including intracellular trafficking, endocytosis, apoptosis, autophagy and lipid cycling (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C3">3</xref>). Yeast strains mutant for the <italic>CLN3</italic> homologue, <italic>BTN1</italic>, have also proved valuable: <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> mutant strains both show elevated vacuolar pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C12">12</xref>), whereas <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> strains are defective in arginine transport into the vacuole, resulting in a disruption in nitric oxide metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C15">15</xref>). However, these varied approaches have failed to produce a consensus on the function of CLN3. Progress has also been hampered by the highly hydrophobic nature of the CLN3 protein that makes conventional biochemical approaches difficult and by the fact that it is seemingly expressed at low levels. There is a need for new model systems to study CLN3 biology and function to further our understanding of the disease. In particular, systems are required that will identify functional pathways without relying on biochemical techniques. Identifying such pathways may in turn reveal novel therapeutic targets for JNCL.</p><p>The fruit fly <italic>Drosophila</italic> is an attractive model system for studying neuronal function and neurodegeneration because of its relatively simple nervous system, the powerful genetic tools available and the ability to study neuronal and synapse biology at high resolution (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C17">17</xref>). Several human neurodegenerative disorders have been modelled successfully in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, including congenital and infantile forms of NCL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C19">19</xref>). Here we describe the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologue of <italic>CLN3</italic> and introduce gain-of-function genetic approaches to identify pathways that require <italic>CLN3</italic> function and novel interactions for <italic>CLN3</italic>. We demonstrate that ectopic <italic>CLN3</italic> expression inhibits Notch signalling but activates the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signalling pathway and identify novel and unexpected genetic interactions with a regulator of RNA translation, stability and localization.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Juvenile NCL is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the gene <italic>CLN3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C5">5</xref>). The protein encoded is a multi-spanning transmembrane protein, the topology of which remains unclear. The most recent prediction based on a model constrained by experimental data suggests six transmembrane spans with both the N- and C-termini resident in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C20">20</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome encodes one likely orthologue&#x02014;CG5582 at position 75A2. Sequence alignments show strong conservation with vertebrate CLN3 proteins in the predicted transmembrane regions, in the lumenal loops and in the C-terminal region thought to be intracellular (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddn396/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1</ext-link>). Both lysosomal targeting sequences identified experimentally in the human protein are conserved in <italic>Drosophila</italic> CLN3.</p><sec id="s2a"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> CLN3 localizes to lysosomes, the plasma membrane and recycling vesicles</title><p>The exact localization of CLN3 remains undefined despite examination of its distribution in a number of studies (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C21">21</xref>). Owing to the absence of appropriate specific antisera, most studies have employed overexpression and epitope-tagging to get an indication of localization in cultured cells and neurons. A similar approach was used to examine the distribution of <italic>Drosophila</italic> CLN3 in cells. An N-terminal <italic>GFP-CLN3</italic> construct was expressed in HEK293 cells and its distribution compared with various markers of cellular compartments and with that of the human CLN3. Like the human protein, the distribution of <italic>Drosophila</italic> CLN3 partially overlaps with that of LAMP1, a marker for late endosomes and lysosomes [compare Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN396F1">1</xref>A and B; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C23">23</xref>)]. At higher expression levels, CLN3 is also seen on the plasma membrane (data not shown). Strong co-localization was also seen in a subset of transfected cells with anti-Rab11, particularly in large vesicles in the periphery of the cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN396F1">1</xref>C), supporting previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C24">24</xref>). Rab11 regulates the recycling of vesicles from the perinuclear recycling compartment to the plasma membrane, suggesting that CLN3 may be a component of, or trafficked by, these vesicles. No significant co-localization was seen with markers of other compartments or endosomes (data not shown).</p><fig id="DDN396F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1.</label><caption><p>Localization of <italic>Drosophila</italic> CLN3 in HEK293 cells.

The highly hydrophobic nature of the CLN3 protein means that some of the commonly used biochemical approaches for identifying interactions can be difficult. To overcome this problem, we decided to develop a strategy that would allow us to identify interacting molecules and functional signalling pathways using genetic approaches. We generated transgenic flies to express <italic>CLN3</italic> under the control of the bipartite GAL4-UAS system that allows for highly regulated tissue-specific expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C25">25</xref>). We were then able to examine the phenotypic consequences of increasing levels of CLN3 function during organ and tissue development in the fly. These phenotypes were caused by a moderate increase in the expression of <italic>CLN3</italic>; for example, in our experiments, in the wing, we estimate that the levels of CLN3 are increased 2.86-fold (&#x000b1;0.42 SD) over basal levels of CLN3 expression (see Materials and Methods). Finally, we were able to use genetics to identify pathways and molecules that affect these phenotypes.</p><p>Initially, we decided to focus on overexpression in the developing fly eye. The development of the eye is heavily dependent on endocytic and vesicle trafficking events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C28">28</xref>), both suggested functions for CLN3. Expression of <italic>CLN3</italic> in the eye produced a significant glazing of the compound eye indicative of degeneration (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN396F2">2</xref>A versus B and C). The severity of the phenotype varied between lines, presumably reflecting differing levels of expression of the <italic>CLN3</italic> transgene from different chromosomal locations. Expression of a <italic>YFP-CLN3</italic> fusion produced a similar phenotype (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN396F2">2</xref>D), as did the expression of human <italic>CLN3</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN396F2">2</xref>K). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) shows loss of the regular crystalline array of ommatidia, fusions of ommatidia and alterations in bristle patterns (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN396F2">2</xref>E versus F). Sections through the eyes show an extensive degeneration (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN396F2">2</xref>G versus H). To confirm that this phenotype is specific to <italic>CLN3</italic> overexpression, we also overexpressed the lysosomal proteins, LAMP and spinster, and the late endosomal protein, Hook, in the eye. These controls displayed no phenotype, suggesting the CLN3 phenotypes are specific and not a consequence of overloading the endosomal-lysosomal membrane system (data not shown).</p><fig id="DDN396F2" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;2.</label><caption><p>Overexpression of <italic>CLN3</italic> in the developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye results in degeneration.

Co-expression of an RNAi construct designed for <italic>CLN3</italic> knockdown did revert the phenotype back towards wild-type, indicating that the initial phenotype is specifically because of the overexpression of <italic>CLN3</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN396F2">2</xref>J).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Notch-like phenotype resulting from overexpression of CLN3</title><p>Having observed strong phenotypes in the eye, <italic>CLN3</italic> was expressed ubiquitously throughout <italic>Drosophila</italic> development or selectively in imaginal tissues which give rise to particular structures of the adult fly during metamorphosis. In both cases, phenotypes reminiscent of Notch loss-of-function resulted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C28">28</xref>). Ubiquitous overexpression using the daughterless Gal4 driver was semi-lethal.

Expression driven by dppGal4 driver resulted in duplications in the sternopleural bristles on the side of the adult fly (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN396F3">3</xref>E versus F, bristles circled, denoted <italic>dpp&#x0003e;cln3</italic>). Finally, expression driven along the wing margin under the control of the VgM gal4 line caused large notches to appear in the wing blade (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN396F3">3</xref>I, arrowheads, denoted <italic>VgM&#x0003e;cln3</italic>). Taken together, these phenotypes strongly suggest that overexpression of <italic>CLN3</italic> leads to loss of Notch function. Notch acts as a receptor for the Delta/Serrate/LAG-2 ligand family which functions in a variety of contexts to allow communication between cells whereby transcription of target genes are activated in the Notch expressing cell. This signalling pathway requires proteolytic cleavage of the Notch receptor and its endocytosis into the cell (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C30">30</xref>).</p><p>If Notch signalling was indeed affected by <italic>CLN3</italic> overexpression, we reasoned that introducing a mutant allele of the Notch ligand, Delta, should enhance the effect. We focused on duplication of the macrochaetae on the scutellum of the adult fly. In control flies, there are invariably 4.0 macrochaetae (<italic>n</italic> = 26, see Materials and Methods for genotypes). When <italic>CLN3</italic> was overexpressed in the posterior of the imaginal wing disc using the engrailed GAL4 driver, duplications of one or more of the bristles were common and the mean number of macrochaetae per scutellum increased to 4.65 (<italic>n</italic> = 17). When <italic>CLN3</italic> was overexpressed in a genetic background heterozygote for a strong allele of Delta, the frequency of duplication increased further to a mean of 6.29 macrochaetae per scutellum (<italic>n</italic> = 24, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). These data indicate that the Notch signalling pathway does interact genetically with the gain-of-function phenotypes seen with <italic>CLN3</italic> overexpression.</p><p>Several of the phenotype described earlier can also result from alterations in EGF, BMP and other signalling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C31">31</xref>). To demonstrate further that that <italic>CLN3</italic> overexpression does indeed inhibit Notch signalling, transcription of the <italic>cut</italic> gene was used as readout for the Notch pathway. <italic>cut</italic> encodes a homeodomain protein structurally related to human CDP and mouse cux proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C32">32</xref>). <italic>cut</italic> is transcribed in a narrow strip of cells at the dorsal&#x02013;ventral margin of the developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal wing disc, and this transcription requires Notch activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C33">33</xref>). We made use of the fact that dppGal4 drives expression along the anterior&#x02013;posterior compartment boundary of the wing disc which intersects at only one region with the dorsal&#x02013;ventral stripe of <italic>cut</italic> expression. This is demonstrated in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN396F4">4</xref>A, where a membrane-tethered GFP was expressed under the control dppGal4 (<italic>dpp&#x0003e;CD8::GFP</italic>).

This was confirmed by immunostaining for Notch protein which indicated no changes in Notch protein levels in the wing disc where <italic>CLN3</italic> was expressed (data not shown). We also asked whether <italic>CLN3</italic> overexpression was actually inhibiting downstream targets of Notch transcription, rather than Notch itself. Notch is cleaved upon ligand binding, releasing the intracellular part of the protein which translocates to the nucleus to act on transcription. The Notch<sup><italic>intra</italic></sup> construct does not require ligand binding or cleavage and so acts as a dominant active molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C34">34</xref>).

Activation of JNK signalling can commonly lead to apoptosis (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C41">41</xref>). Apoptotic cells were identified through expression of a reporter for caspase activity&#x02014;a membrane-tethered CD8::PARP fusion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C42">42</xref>). In apoptotic cells, PARP is cleaved by caspases and this event can be detected with an antibody specific to the cleaved form.

Few apoptotic cells were visible in wing discs expressing the reporter alone (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN396F5">5</xref>E). In contrast, when <italic>CLN3</italic> was co-expressed, a large increase in apoptosis was seen (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN396F5">5</xref>F), especially in the wing pouch.</p><p>Taken together, these data suggested that <italic>CLN3</italic> overexpression may affect JNK signalling, but to examine this more directly, we looked for genetic interactions between the two.

Using a <italic>puc-lacZ</italic> reporter as a readout for JNK-signalling activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C39">39</xref>), ectopic activation of JNK signalling could clearly be seen in the posterior half of wing discs when <italic>CLN3</italic> was overexpressed in that compartment [Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN396F5">5</xref>L versus M, compare anterior (left) and posterior (right) compartments]. This activation of JNK signalling does not appear to be due to an increase in JNK levels but rather an increase in active JNK, as there is no observable increase in JNK protein levels in the <italic>CLN3</italic> overexpressing cells (data not shown). In contrast, in a similar experiment, <italic>CLN3</italic> overexpression had no effect on EGF receptor signalling in the posterior half of wing discs, visualized using an <italic>argos-lacZ</italic> reporter (data not shown). It therefore seems unlikely that the activation of JNK signalling is due to a generalized effect on ligand&#x02013;receptor complex trafficking or degradation.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Dominant modification of the CLN3 overexpression eye phenotype</title><p>Alterations of the appearance of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye and wing are commonly used for genetic screens.

Consequently, the cell biology underlying the disease remains poorly understood and options for therapeutic intervention for this fatal disorder are non-existent. To expand the animal models available to study CLN3 biology, we describe the characterization of <italic>Drosophila</italic> CLN3. We find that <italic>Drosophila</italic> CLN3 shows considerable similarity to the human form, with significant stretches of homology and an intracellular location that corresponds to that seen for human CLN3.

When expressed in human HEK293 cells, N-terminally tagged forms of <italic>Drosophila</italic> CLN3 protein localize partially to late endosomes or lysosomes. On occasion, some CLN3 appeared on the plasma membrane and was also localized within Rab11-positive recycling vesicles. Although <italic>Drosophila</italic> CLN3 is found in the same intracellular compartments as human CLN3, we consider these results as indicative only because the CLN3 proteins were both tagged and overexpressed. Moreover, fusion of tags to the C-terminus of <italic>Drosophila</italic> CLN3 led to retention of the protein in the ER (data not shown) as has been reported previously for human CLN3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C22">22</xref>).

Supporting previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C22">22</xref>), we find that similarly truncated forms of either human or <italic>Drosophila</italic> CLN3 protein fail to localize correctly. The proteins localize into a reticular network, suggesting that they fail to fold correctly and are retained in the ER.</p><p>Although JNCL is a recessive trait generally thought to be due to a loss-of-gene function, it is possible to identify functional properties of the CLN3 protein by creating a gain-of-function condition. Overexpresssion of either <italic>Drosophila</italic> or human CLN3 in the developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye cause neurodegenerative phenotypes, suggesting that both proteins have similar functional properties and activate or inhibit similar downstream pathways. This neurodegenerative activity is specific to the overexpressed gene because the phenotype caused by the increased <italic>Drosophila</italic> CLN3 is suppressed by co-expression of a <italic>Drosophila CLN3</italic> RNAi transgene. In addition, overexpression of the truncated forms of both human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> CLN3 does not show any neurodegenerative phenotype, suggesting that the observed phenotypes are produced by the functional protein and that the truncated versions have lost this activity.

Fly models exists for the infantile and congenital forms of NCL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C19">19</xref>), whereas Batten disease-like pathologies are also observed in flies bearing mutations in <italic>spinster</italic>/<italic>benchwarmer</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C48">48</xref>). No mutations exist in <italic>Drosophila CLN3</italic> at present and these will be required to fully model JNCL in flies. However we can use <italic>Drosophila</italic> overexpression as a mechanism to elucidate the types of pathways that are affected by an increase in CLN3 activity. Increased levels of CLN3 cause a neurodegenerative phenotype in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye which is similar to, but more severe than, the phenotype observed when the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Cln1 gene <italic>DmPPT1</italic> is overexpressed in the same tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C49">49</xref>). In the case of <italic>DmPPT1</italic>, the loss of photoreceptors is through apoptotic cell death, whereas overexpression of <italic>CLN3</italic> seems to cause neurodegeneration via a process that does not require apoptosis. Our preliminary evidence suggests that blocking autophagy also fails to rescue the eye phenotype. The pathways activated to cause this neurodegeneration are under current investigation.</p><p>We also identified that when <italic>CLN3</italic> is expressed at high levels in all cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, phenotypes reminiscent of a loss of Notch activity are observed. This ability of increased CLN3 to block Notch activity was confirmed by demonstrating that overexpression of CLN3 in the wing inhibits the activation of a Notch target gene, <italic>cut</italic>. This inhibition of Notch is not rescued by re-expression of full-length Notch but is rescued by Notch<sup>intra</sup>, the active intracellular fragment of Notch that signals to the nucleus. This suggests that increased levels of CLN3 might affect the regulation of Notch processing or cleavage but probably not expression. Interestingly, we observed Notch inhibition only in certain developmental contexts, rather than a global inhibition throughout the development of the fly, suggesting some degree of cell specificity. Notch mutations underlie several human cognitive disorders and the Notch signalling pathway has been implicated in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and memory (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C51">51</xref>). Better understood is the major role that Notch signalling plays in a wide variety of developmental processes in many organ systems, including neurogenesis and gliogenesis, where Notch regulates decisions of cell fate, differentiation and stem cell renewal. With the NCLs being early onset diseases, they may have a developmental origin that manifests itself as an early failure of brain function. Previous studies have implicated early defects in particular brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C7">7</xref>) and it may be of interest to investigate whether defects in Notch signalling during development may compromise the normal function of these regions.</p><p>The absence of a global influence of CLN3 expression on all Notch signalling led us to investigate whether increased levels of CLN3 may affect any of the other identified pathways that impinge on Notch signalling. Overexpression of CLN3 in varied cell types gave rise to phenotypes that had been previously associated with alterations in JNK signalling&#x02014;apoptosis of cells in the developing wing and a failure of dorsal closure. Significantly, crosstalk between the Notch and JNK signalling pathways has been reported during dorsal closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C40">40</xref>). We find that the phenotypes seen when CLN3 is overexpressed are considerably enhanced when the activity of <italic>bsk</italic>, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> JNK, is simultaneously increased by the co-overexpression of <italic>bsk</italic> or of the upstream activating regulatory JNK kinase, <italic>hep</italic>. In addition, overexpression of CLN3 activates the expression of the JNK pathway downstream target, <italic>puckered</italic>. These observations are the first indication that CLN3 may play a role in regulating JNK activity and so places the protein within a major signal transduction pathway implicated in neuronal disease. JNK signalling is an important regulator of neuronal apoptosis and differentiation and aberrant signalling and has been implicated in various neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson&#x02019;s, Alzheimer&#x02019;s and Huntington&#x02019;s diseases (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C52">52</xref>). Support for the association of JNK signalling pathology with NCL disease also comes from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model for infantile NCL (INCL), where a gain-of-function screen for modifiers of a neurodegeneration phenotype induced by <italic>DmPPT1</italic> identified <italic>misshapen</italic>, an upstream kinase in the JNK signalling pathway, and <italic>kayak</italic>, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> fos, a component of AP1, a major transcription regulator and target of the JNK pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C53">53</xref>). The JNK/AP1 pathway has been implicated as a regulator of synaptic activity, dendritic and synapse growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C54">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C56">56</xref>). Although <italic>PPT1</italic> and <italic>CLN3</italic> encode very different genes, deficits in their activity lead to INCL and JNCL, respectively, whose pathologies share many common features, making it tempting to speculate that aberrations in JNK signalling may be a common failure leading to synaptic dysfunction. Similarly, loss of <italic>spinster</italic>/<italic>benchwarmer</italic> activity in <italic>Drosophila</italic> results in lipofuscin accumulation and produces synapse growth defects and loss of activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C57">57</xref>). It would be interesting to investigate whether JNK signalling is altered in loss-of-function mouse models where alterations in synaptic activity have been speculated to be a possible root cause of Batten&#x02019;s disease.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Identification of novel CLN3 functional pathways in <italic>Drosophila</italic></title><p>We have made use of the neurodegeneration phenotype caused by overexpression of <italic>CLN3</italic> in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye to perform a non-biased genetic screen to identify novel candidate genes that may form part of the CLN3 functional network. This modifier screen identifies genes that change the phenotypic consequence of CLN3 overexpression when their gene dosage and activity are reduced by half. A number of chromosomal deficiencies were identified that suppress the eye phenotype, suggesting that genes normally required to generate the degenerative phenotype are deleted in these deficiencies. Work is ongoing to identify the individual genes responsible for this suppression. In addition, we identified two deficiencies that enhance the CLN3 phenotype. Testing of individual genes in one of these deficiencies identified that loss of one copy of <italic>mago nashi</italic> is responsible for this enhancement and suggesting that the <italic>mago</italic> gene product normally acts antagonistically to the pathways activated by CLN3. <italic>mago</italic> encodes a conserved component of the EJC that was originally identified for its role in generating polarity in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C58">58</xref>). In the absence of <italic>mago</italic>, there is a failure to transport <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA to the posterior of the oocyte, suggesting a requirement for Mago to localize RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C58">58</xref>). Mago requires an interaction with a partner protein Y14/Tsunagi to bind RNA, and a reduction in <italic>tsunagi</italic> gene dosage also enhances the <italic>CLN3</italic> phenotype, suggesting that CLN3 activity influences or is influenced by a pathway-regulating RNA metabolism. Although the Mago/Y14 complex is an essential component of the EJC, it remains unclear whether this splicing role or a role in RNA localization is the most significant function for oogenesis. Transport of mRNA and ribonucleic particles to the synapse is known to be important for synapse function and plasticity because it allows the rapid local translation of crucial components necessary for dendrite/synapse activity. Many of the components necessary for the localization and translational control of these neuronal mRNAs are shared with those that are associated with localized mRNA in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocyte, e.g. Staufen, Barentsz and FMRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C59">59</xref>). In addition, Pumilio, a translational repressor also required for the polarization of the oocyte, has been shown to be associated with neuronal RNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C60">60</xref>) and is necessary for synapse function and dendrite morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C61">61</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C63">63</xref>). We have preliminary evidence that reveals a reduction in <italic>pumilio</italic> activity suppresses the effect of overexpression of <italic>CLN3</italic> in the wing (V.V., R.I.T. and G.T. unpublished data). FMRP, the fragile X mental retardation protein, is also a component of these RNP granules, and evidence for its possible function has come from modelling fragile X in <italic>Drosophila</italic> where overexpression in the eye also leads to neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN396C64">64</xref>). These results lead to the suggestion that CLN3 may participate in or be regulated by this process of RNA transport. They also demonstrate why this kind of genetic screen will complement existing approaches for identifying the functional networks of CLN3: RNA-binding components of the RNA localization machinery or translation regulators would be more difficult to isolate using, for example, <italic>in vitro</italic> binding- or yeast-based techniques.</p><p>We have demonstrated here that <italic>Drosophila</italic> CLN3 shares many properties with its human counterpart and that gain-of-function assay provides a valuable tool for studying CLN3 cell biology and for identifying novel interactions. In this study, we have identified a possible involvement for CLN3 in the Notch and JNK signalling pathways, and our dominant modifier screen has identified a potential role for the RNA localization machinery in regulating CLN3 function. These findings are particularly interesting given that misregulation of both JNK signalling and RNA localization affects synapse function and has been associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Further work driving expression of <italic>CLN3</italic> in neurons should reveal whether these interactions are important for neuronal function. In addition, further screens in the eye and wing are possible on a large scale and will identify more genetic interactions to direct and instruct future studies on CLN3 cell biology.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4a"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> stocks and husbandry</title><p>Flies were maintained at room temperature on standard cornmeal agar medium.
