Because of such a phylogenetic divergence in the composition of tRNA, the class II tRNA system is a good candidate for studying how the tRNA recognition manner has evolved in association with the evolution of tRNA. We report here a cross-species aminoacylation study of the class II tRNAs, showing the unilateral aminoacylation specificity between Escherichia coli and a yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Both SerRS and LeuRS from E.coli were unable to aminoacylate yeast class II tRNAs; in contrast, the yeast counterparts were able to aminoacylate E.coli class II tRNAs. Yeast seryl-tRNA synthetase was able to aminoacylate not only E.coli tRNASerbut also tRNALeuand tRNATyr, and yeast LeuRS was able to aminoacylate not only E.coli tRNALeubut also tRNATyr. These results indicate that the recognition manner of class II tRNA, especially the discrimination strategy of each aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase against noncognate class II tRNAs, is significantly divergent between E.coli and yeast. This difference is thought to be due mainly to the different composition of class II tRNAs in E.coli and yeast.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
