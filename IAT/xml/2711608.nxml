Expression of muscle RING-finger 1 (MuRF1), a ubiquitin ligase, is markedly induced during atrophy, and MuRF1 deletion attenuates muscle wasting. We generated mice expressing a Ring-deletion mutant MuRF1, which binds but cannot ubiquitylate substrates. Mass spectrometry of the bound proteins in denervated muscle identified many myofibrillar components. Upon denervation or fasting, atrophying muscles show a loss of myosin-binding protein C (MyBP-C) and myosin light chains 1 and 2 (MyLC1 and MyLC2) from the myofibril, before any measurable decrease in myosin heavy chain (MyHC). Their selective loss requires MuRF1. MyHC is protected from ubiquitylation in myofibrils by associated proteins, but eventually undergoes MuRF1-dependent degradation. In contrast, MuRF1 ubiquitylates MyBP-C, MyLC1, and MyLC2, even in myofibrils. Because these proteins stabilize the thick filament, their selective ubiquitylation may facilitate thick filament disassembly. However, the thin filament components decreased by a mechanism not requiring MuRF1.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Atrophy of skeletal muscle occurs upon disuse or denervation and systemically in fasting and many disease states, including cancer cachexia, sepsis, renal failure, and cardiac failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lecker et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jackman and Kandarian, 2004</xref>). This rapid loss of muscle mass is largely due to accelerated protein degradation, although in systemic catabolic states protein synthesis also decreases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jackman and Kandarian, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lecker et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sacheck et al., 2007</xref>). Normally, the proteins comprising the myofibril are among the most stable in the body. During atrophy, however, the myofibrillar apparatus, which comprises at least 60% of muscle proteins, decreases in mass to a greater extent than the soluble components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Munoz et al., 1993</xref>) and results in decreased strength. The present studies were undertaken to gain insight into the mechanisms responsible for this accelerated degradation of myofibrillar proteins.</p><p>Recent findings indicate that these different types of atrophy activate a common series of biochemical and transcriptional adaptations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sacheck et al., 2007</xref>) leading to enhanced protein degradation by both proteasomal and lysosomal systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mammucari et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>). The degradation of myofibrillar components during atrophy is mediated by the ubiquitin&#x02013;proteasome pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Solomon and Goldberg, 1996</xref>). Despite this rapid degradation of diverse muscle proteins during atrophy, two muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases (E3s), muscle RING-finger 1 (MuRF1) and atrogin-1/MAFbx, are markedly induced; and in knockout mice lacking either enzyme, the rapid loss of muscle mass upon denervation is significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bodine et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gomes et al., 2001</xref>). To date, it is unclear whether these E3s ubiquitylate many muscle components or only key regulatory ones, whose destruction promotes the breakdown of other proteins. MuRF1 is a monomeric E3 belonging to the tripartite motif family of ligases which contain a tripartite RING:B-box:coiled-coil domain that is essential for ubiquitin conjugation. Two close homologues of MuRF1 (MuRF2 and MuRF3) are present in normal muscle and appear to be important for maintenance of normal contractile function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fielitz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Witt et al., 2008</xref>). MuRF1, on the other hand, is required for rapid atrophy but not for normal muscle growth.</p><p>In the present studies, we have used mice that lack MuRF1's RING domain to clarify the role of its ligase activity in denervation atrophy. Although two substrates have been reported for MuRF1, cardiac Troponin-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kedar et al., 2004</xref>) and myosin heavy chain (MyHC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clarke et al., 2007</xref>), the role of MuRF1 in degrading specific myofibrillar or soluble proteins in skeletal muscle is unknown. Specifically, it is unclear whether MuRF1 or any E3 can act on the proteins within the myofibril, which is a highly organized rigid structure, or whether mechanisms exist to release proteins from the sarcomeres before ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Model studies in muscle extracts have demonstrated rapid hydrolysis of purified actin and myosin by the ubiquitin&#x02013;proteasome pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Solomon and Goldberg, 1996</xref>). However, these proteins were much more stable when associated with each other in the actomyosin complex or intact myofibrils. These findings raised the possibility that the ubiquitin&#x02013;proteasome system may not by itself be able to degrade components of intact myofibrils, and constituent proteins have to be released by some mechanism to be substrates for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Solomon and Goldberg, 1996</xref>). Consequently, several groups have presented evidence that a calpain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tidball and Spencer, 2002</xref>) or caspase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Du et al., 2004</xref>) may initially cleave the myofibrillar components, thereby accelerating disassembly and degradation by the ubiquitin&#x02013;proteasome system. However, direct proof of these models functioning in atrophying muscles is lacking. Alternatively, an E3 may act directly on specific components of the myofibril to promote its disassembly and degradation during atrophy. Here, we present evidence for such a role for MuRF1.</p><p>Myofibrils are composed of precisely aligned filament systems arranged in repeating units of sarcomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Clark et al., 2002</xref>), whose primary constituents are myosin in the thick filament and actin in the thin filament. The myosin molecule comprises 50% of myofibrillar mass and contains two heavy chains, two regulatory light chains (MyLC2), and two essential light chains (MyLC1). These light chains bind to the globular heads of myosin, which comprise the cross-bridges that extend from the thick filaments to interact with actin and generate force through ATP hydrolysis. Several observations in vivo and with isolated myofibrils indicate that MyLC1 and MyLC2 are required for thick-filament stabilization and normal contractility. Loss of MyLC1 or MyLC2 in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rottbauer et al., 2006</xref>) or their homologues in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2008</xref>) results in a perturbation of contractility and a striking disorganization of the thick filaments.</p><p>In addition, the sarcomere contains many structural and regulatory proteins that contribute to myofibril integrity and stability. For example, myosin-binding protein C (MyBP-C) is a component of the thick filament and is distributed every 43 nm within the C-zone of the sarcomere, where the cross-bridges are found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Offer et al., 1972</xref>). Transgenic mice expressing truncated MyBP-C that lacks the myosin-binding site in cardiac muscle exhibit significant sarcomere disorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 1998</xref>). Because MyBP-C, MyLC1, and MyLC2 are required for sarcomere stability, their selective loss and rapid ubiquitylation, which we demonstrate here, are likely to be a mechanism promoting myofibrillar disassembly during atrophy.</p><p>In these studies, we used biochemical and genetic approaches to clarify in vivo the contribution of MuRF1's ligase activity to the atrophic process and to clarify MuRF1's role in disassembly of the myofibrillar apparatus in adult mice. Specifically, we investigated (1) whether any myofibrillar protein may be lost selectively during denervation atrophy, (2) whether ubiquitylation by MuRF1 is important for the degradation of the various myofibrillar proteins lost during atrophy, (3) whether MuRF1 can ubiquitylate regulatory proteins, whose loss may promote the breakdown of other myofibrillar components, and (4) whether myofibrillar proteins that are degraded in a MuRF1-dependent mechanism can be ubiquitylated within the myofibril, in the extracted actomyosin complex, or only when isolated and purified. These studies surprisingly demonstrate that distinct mechanisms exist for degrading components of the thick and thin filaments, and that certain thick filament&#x02013;associated proteins are lost differentially during atrophy and are selectively ubiquitylated within the intact myofibril. Their differential loss may represent a critical step that promotes further ubiquitylation and degradation of other myofibrillar components.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>MuRF1 binds a specific subset of muscle proteins</title><p>To understand the role of MuRF1 in muscle atrophy, we sought to identify its substrates. Soluble extracts of gastrocnemius muscles from normal mice (the 3,000 <italic>g</italic> supernatant) were incubated with immobilized GST-MuRF1 to isolate those muscle proteins having high affinity for MuRF1. The resulting precipitates were washed extensively with buffer containing 500 mM NaCl to remove nonspecific or weakly associated proteins. The proteins on the pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200901052/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>) and mass spectrometry. Many myofibrillar components, especially components of the thick filaments and M-line region, were identified (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>), including myosin-binding protein C (MyBP-C, also called C-protein), myosin essential light chain (MyLC1) and regulatory light chain (MyLC2), myosin heavy chain (MyHC) type II isoform, myomesin 1, and filamin C (also called filamin 2, &#x003b3;-filamin, or ABP-L), a component localized to the Z-disk. This binding of MyLC2 is consistent with the results of screening a muscle cDNA library for MuRF1-binding proteins by a yeast two-hybrid assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Witt et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, MyHC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clarke et al., 2007</xref>) has been shown to be ubiquitylated by purified MuRF1. We could not precipitate Troponin-I from skeletal muscle extracts with MuRF1, although cardiac Troponin-I is reported to be a substrate of MuRF1 in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kedar et al., 2004</xref>), and is readily ubiquitylated by purified MuRF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2007</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table I.</label><caption><p>MuRF1 binds a variety of myofibrillar proteins present in muscle homogenate (3,000 <italic>g</italic> supernatant)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Protein name</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gene</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gene ID (NCBI)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Precipitated from normal muscle with pure MuRF1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ubiquitylated after addition of E1, E2, and ATP</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Immunoprecipitated from denervated muscle with Myc-&#x00394;R-MuRF1</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">MyBP-C</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mybpc2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">233199</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Myosin regulatory light chain (MyLC2)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mylpf</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">17907</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Myosin essential light chain (MyLC1)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Myl1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">17901</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Myosin heavy chain 1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Myh1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">17879</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Myosin heavy chain 4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Myh4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">17884</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Myosin heavy chain 8</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Myh8</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">17885</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Myomesin 1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Myom1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">17929</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Actin, alpha skeletal muscle</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Acta1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">11459</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Filamin C, gamma isoform 1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Flnc</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">68794</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>MuRF1-bound proteins were immunoprecipitated together with MuRF1 from gastrocnemius muscles and identified by mass spectrometry.

Because the Ring-finger domain is required to catalyze ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hatakeyama and Nakayama, 2003</xref>), but not for interaction with substrates, in the Myc-&#x00394;R-MuRF1 strain, the proteins ubiquitylated by MuRF1 upon denervation should escape rapid degradation but still can bind to Myc-&#x00394;R-MuRF1, which should greatly facilitate their identification by mass spectrometry. Similar approaches have been successfully used in vitro to identify the substrates of other RING-finger E3s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Qiu and Goldberg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jang, 2004</xref>).

Marked induction of Myc-MuRF1 protein in these lysates was observed by Western blot and resembled the induction of MuRF1 in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Interestingly, the content of Myc-&#x00394;R-MuRF1 in the denervated muscles was higher than the content of MuRF1 in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>), probably because like many E3s, MuRF1 autoubiquitylates, and in the absence of the Ring-finger domain, the protein is inactive and consequently much more stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Qiu and Goldberg, 2002</xref>). Even though it lacks the RING domain (55 amino acids), the expressed Myc-&#x00394;R-MuRF1 protein was very similar in size to the endogenous MuRF1 because it contains a Myc tag (36 amino acids).

Although other ubiquitin ligases are also induced during atrophy (i.e., atrogin-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gomes et al., 2001</xref>], which is also essential for rapid atrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bodine et al., 2001</xref>], as well as E3&#x003b1;-II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kwak et al., 2004</xref>]), MuRF1 is necessary for most of the increase in ubiquitin conjugates during denervation atrophy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). Thus, MuRF1 either ubiquitylates most proteins being degraded 10 d after denervation, or its actions allow other ligases to act. In either case, MuRF1 clearly is a very general ligase affecting many contractile (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>), soluble, and nuclear proteins (unpublished data), as was also suggested by two-hybrid studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Witt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hirner et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, our studies implicate ubiquitylation by MuRF1 in the selective loss of MyBP-C, MyLC1, and MyLC2, as well as the slower degradation of MyHC, and thereby in the disassembly and degradation of myofibrillar proteins, which is the defining feature of the atrophy process.</p><p>Inactivation of MuRF1's capacity to bind E2s by deletion of its Ring-finger motif attenuated atrophy and prevented the differential loss of MyBP-C, MyLC1, and MyLC2 from the myofibril (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). Their selective loss is a new feature of atrophying muscles and seems to be of regulatory importance. Because these proteins appear to be critical in stabilizing the myofibril (see below), the reduced loss of MyHC in the &#x00394;R-MuRF1<italic><sup>myc/myc</sup></italic> mice might be a direct consequence of the sparing of MyLC1, MyLC2, and MyBP-C. Also surprising were the findings that these components of the thick filaments are degraded sooner and by a distinct mechanism from the thin filament components, actin, tropomyosin, and &#x003b1;-actinin, whose degradation is independent of MuRF1.</p><p>Because MuRF1 is required for rapid atrophy, but not for normal muscle growth or function, identification of its substrates is essential to understand the mechanisms of protein loss. We have identified a number of myofibrillar components as novel substrates for MuRF1 in vivo, all of which are important for muscle integrity and contractile activity. Mutations in each of them cause severe disorders characterized by disarrayed myofibrils and compromised contractile function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Clark et al., 2002</xref>). Although cardiac Troponin-I was previously reported to be a MuRF1 substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kedar et al., 2004</xref>), Troponin-I could not be immunoprecipitated with MuRF1 from these skeletal muscles and was not lost by a MuRF1-dependent mechanism after denervation. MyHC had been shown to accumulate in mice lacking MuRF1 and MuRF3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fielitz et al., 2007</xref>) and to be degraded in a MuRF1-dependent manner upon dexamethasone treatment of embryonic myotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clarke et al., 2007</xref>). Accordingly, decreased content of MyHC by a MuRFl-dependent mechanism was clearly evident at 14 d denervation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>). However, within the myofibril from innervated muscles, MyHC is not ubiquitylated by MuRF1 and is not a preferred substrate of MuRF1 even 10 d after denervation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p>It is noteworthy that these various myofibrillar proteins could be precipitated with GST-MuRF1 from the cytosolic fraction, and were ubiquitylated by pure MuRF1. Soluble pools of these myofibrillar components have been reported in chicken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Horvath and Gaetjens, 1972</xref>) and were found in the mouse muscle extracts (unpublished data). Possibly, these soluble components function either as precursors to the mature contractile apparatus or as components released during myofibrillar turnover, or may represent a fraction of myofibrillar proteins that are easily released upon homogenization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Etlinger et al., 1975</xref>). However, these proteins did not accumulate in the cytosol during atrophy, when they were lost from the myofibril (unpublished data).</p><p>Although it has long been recognized that the major myofibrillar proteins are degraded by the ubiquitin&#x02013;proteasome pathway during atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Solomon and Goldberg, 1996</xref>), the identification of MuRF1 as the critical ligase that acts on the myofibrillar compartment (perhaps together with other E3s) suggests a role for ubiquitylation in disassembly of the myofibril. It is noteworthy that purified monomeric actin and MyHC were efficiently ubiquitylated by MuRF1, but not when associated with each other in the actomyosin complex or in the intact myofibril (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>, unpublished data). Previously, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Solomon and Goldberg (1996)</xref> demonstrated in crude homogenates that the ubiquitin&#x02013;proteasome system rapidly degrades monomeric actin and myosin, but this process was not demonstrable in the extracts, when these proteins were associated with each other in the actomyosin complex or a myofibril. These early findings suggested that during atrophy a mechanism may exist to release these components from the myofibril or to enhance the susceptibility of actin, myosin, and other myofibrillar proteins to ubiquitylation. However, based upon the present findings, it no longer seems necessary to postulate such a release system (see below).</p><p>MuRF1 could ubiquitylate these substrates together with UbcH1, which forms K-48&#x02013;linked polyubiquitin chains, and UbcH13/Uev1, which forms processively K-63&#x02013;linked chains, and UbcH5, which forms mixed chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). However, it is unclear which E2s function in proteolysis with MuRF1 or which types of ubiquitin chains it forms in normal or atrophying muscles. Although K-63&#x02013;linked ubiquitin chains were believed to serve functions other than proteasomal degradation in vivo, recent findings indicate that K63 chains can target substrates to the proteasome in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Saeki et al., 2009</xref>). Also, the nature and content of the E2s can influence the rates of protein degradation and thus the rate of atrophy.</p><p>It is particularly intriguing that MyLC1, MyLC2, and MyBP-C are selectively degraded in a MuRF1-dependent manner after denervation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>), and that these proteins, unlike MyHC and actin, are efficiently ubiquitylated by MuRF1 within the myofibril (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>, unpublished data). Thus, these critical stabilizing proteins can be substrates within the myofibril without dissociation or proteolytic processing. Furthermore, the susceptibility of MyHC to ubiquitylation and degradation is enhanced 14 d after denervation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>), presumably because the levels of MyBP-C and MyLCs in the myofibril are reduced. Accordingly, myosin can be extracted from the cardiac thick filament only after MyBP-C content has been reduced by 20% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kulikovskaya et al., 2007</xref>). By contrast, the thin filament components, actin, tropomyosin, and &#x003b1;-actinin, were lost from the myofibril 14 d after denervation by a mechanism that does not require MuRF1 or the MuRF1-dependent loss of MyBP-C and MyLCs. However, it is also possible that MuRF1 may target for degradation proteins associated within the Z-disk lattice because Filamin C was precipitated together with MuRF1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). Alternatively, another E3 induced in atrophy may promote disassembly of the Z-disk or thin filaments, and function in the &#x00394;R-MuRF1 animals.</p><p>Although no reduction in the absolute levels of contractile proteins was demonstrable by these techniques until 10 d after denervation, their degradation must have been accelerated much sooner because the loss of proteins results from the integrated effects of enhanced proteolysis over time. Any small changes in myofibrillar content (e.g., 10&#x02013;20% decreases) that occur sooner after denervation probably cannot be detected by the methods used here. Accordingly, our finding that MuRF1 is induced by 3 d after denervation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>) implies that MuRF1 functions maximally early in atrophy (and before any loss of myofibrillar proteins is detectable). MuRF1 may promote the degradation of soluble cytosolic components, many of which associate with MuRF1 (unpublished data).</p><p>It is noteworthy that decreases in muscle mass can be demonstrated during the first week after denervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Furuno et al., 1990</xref>) and do not seem attributable to MuRF1-dependent loss of myofibrillar components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>). However, other E3s are induced rapidly during atrophy (e.g., atrogin-1) and may help accelerate degradation. Also, recent investigations have shown that autophagy is activated rapidly during denervation-atrophy and seems to promote destruction of mitochondria and cytosolic proteins, perhaps during the first week after denervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mammucari et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">O'Leary and Hood, 2009</xref>), before any loss of myofibrillar myosin and actin can be detected.</p><p>Thus, during atrophy, MuRF1 seems to function at the initial steps of thick filament disassembly, apparently by selectively ubiquitylating certain key regulatory components, whose degradation should facilitate the breakdown of the remaining thick filament components. The extraction of these ubiquitylated regulatory proteins from the myofibril might be directly linked to their degradation by the 26S proteasome, whose 19S component catalyzes ATP-dependent unfolding and translocation of substrates into the core 20S proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Smith et al., 2005</xref>). Alternatively, ATP-dependent extraction of these proteins may be catalyzed by the p97/VCP complex, which extracts ubiquitin-conjugated proteins from ER membranes in the ER-associated degradation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ye et al., 2001</xref>) and plays an important role in myofibril assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Janiesch et al., 2007</xref>). Additional evidence for a critical regulatory role of myofibrillar MyBP-C is that mRNAs for this protein also decrease selectively during denervation atrophy (unpublished data).</p><p>MyBP-C and MyLC2 are critical modulators of muscle contractility, and their loss may account for some of the alterations in contractile properties seen after denervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zorzato et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Trachez et al., 1990</xref>). Extraction of MyBP-C from skinned fibers leads to an increase in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of force development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hofmann et al., 1991</xref>). Removal of myofibrillar MyLC2 has a similar effect on the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-tension curve as removal of MyBP-C. Both proteins thus appear to reduce inappropriate contractions by decreasing the probability of the myosin heads binding to actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moss et al., 1983</xref>). In addition, in heart, increasing MyBP-C content enhances the ATPase activity of actomyosin but not if MyLC2 was removed, and this effect reappeared when MyLC2 was restored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Margossian, 1985</xref>).</p><p>Several days after denervation, the muscle's contractile properties change (i.e., there is a prolongation of the contraction and relaxation periods), apparently due to alterations in intracellular concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zorzato et al., 1989</xref>) as well as an increased myofibrillar Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Trachez et al., 1990</xref>). As noted above, extraction of MyBP-C or MyLC2 also leads to increased myofibrillar sensitivity to Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Because Ca<sup>2+</sup> is less efficiently pumped out of the cytosol of denervated muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Finol et al., 1981</xref>), the selective loss of these regulatory components might contribute to their altered contractile properties. Another characteristic of atrophied muscle is a progressive reduction in the twitch force. Because MyLC1 is required for full force production by muscle myosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">VanBuren et al., 1994</xref>), its selective loss (as well as subsequent loss of MyHC) should contribute to the loss of tension after denervation.</p><p>Although the ubiquitylation on the myofibril and selective degradation of the critical stabilizing proteins MyBP-C, MyLC1, and MyLC2 by MuRF1 is an attractive new mechanism for loss of the thick filaments, it remains to be proven that these sequential steps are essential for the loss of MyHC and rapid atrophy. It will also be important to establish the nature of the subsequent steps, which lead to a loss of thin filaments during atrophy and also during the slower turnover of myofibrillar components in normal muscle. This mechanism (ubiquitylation of key regulatory components in the myofibril) is very different from the frequent suggestion that the initial attack on the contractile apparatus is by endoproteases, such as caspases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Du et al., 2004</xref>) or calpains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tidball and Spencer, 2002</xref>). Although such mechanisms may function in certain apoptotic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Du et al., 2004</xref>), direct evidence that these proteases play an essential or primary role is lacking, and the present findings demonstrate a very different MuRF1-dependent mechanism that appears to function in vivo at the level of the myofibril.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies and materials</title><p>Anti-Myc was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., anti-ubiquitin (clone FK2) from Biomol, anti-MyHC from Abcam, and anti-actin from Sigma-Aldrich.
