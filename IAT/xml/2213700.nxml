Although precise subcellular targeting of apical and basolateral determinants is required for epithelial architecture, little is known about how the individual determinant proteins become localized within the cell. Through a genetic screen for epithelial defects in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> follicle cells, we have found that the cytoplasmic Dynein motor is an essential regulator of apico&#x02013;basal polarity.

Intriguingly, the presence or absence of this exon corresponds to a developmental switch in <italic>sdt</italic> mRNA localization in which apical transcripts are only found during early stages of epithelial development, while unlocalized transcripts predominate in mature epithelia. This work represents the first demonstration that Dynein is required for epithelial polarity and suggests that mRNA localization may have a functional role in the regulation of apico&#x02013;basal organization.

Thus, it is not surprising that highly polarized epithelia have become the predominant tissue type among metazoans. Epithelial cells have distinct apical and basolateral membrane domains, each of which contains a unique complement of lipids and proteins to regionalize cellular functions. Intracellular junctions separate the apical from basolateral domains and mediate cell&#x02013;cell adhesion and selective permeability within the monolayer. Although the mechanisms that specify apico&#x02013;basal polarity have been a topic of great interest in recent years, there are still many open questions about how this cell architecture is established and maintained.</p><p>Studies in model organisms and mammalian tissue culture have identified an elaborate protein network regulating epithelial polarity across animal species &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040008-b001">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040008-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. At the core of this network are three protein complexes, which sequentially localize to and specify one of the two membrane domains and position the adherens junctions at their interface. The Baz complex (Bazooka/aPKC/Par6) acts first in the hierarchy to specify the apical domain &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040008-b004">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040008-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. The Scrib complex (Scribble/Discs Large) then functions as a basolateral determinant by repressing the apicalizing activity of the Baz complex. Finally the Crb complex (Crumbs/Stardust/DPATJ) is targeted to the apical membrane to antagonize the Scrib complex &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040008-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040008-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Crb is the only transmembrane protein among the known core polarity determinants and is a potent regulator of apical identity.

Extensive studies in cultured mammalian cells have implicated exocytic vesicle trafficking in polarity regulation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040008-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040008-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. Under this paradigm, vesicles carrying newly synthesized transmembrane proteins are specifically targeted to either the apical or basolateral domain. While direct vesicle trafficking is an appealing potential mechanism for the localization of Crb, it is likely to be of limited use in the apical targeting of Sdt and DPATJ, the cytoplasmic members of this complex. Moreover, the currently recognized members of the Baz and Scrib complexes are entirely comprised of cytoplasmic proteins, which must be specifically localized to either the apical or lateral domains to perform their polarity functions. Uncovering the mechanisms that govern the subcellular targeting of cytoplasmic polarity determinants is critical, therefore, to our understanding of apico&#x02013;basal polarity regulation.</p><p>One mechanism that many cell types employ to position proteins within the cytoplasm involves the subcellular localization of their corresponding mRNAs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040008-b019">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040008-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. There are several strategies by which mRNAs can become enriched within a given cytoplasmic domain, but the most common strategy involves the assembly of transcripts into large RNA-protein particles that are transported along cytoskeletal elements by molecular motors. Subcellular transport, followed by localized translation, ensures that new proteins will only be produced in the cytoplasmic region where their function is required &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040008-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. This mechanism, which is conserved across such diverse taxa as fungi, plants and animals, has been particularly well studied in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocyte where mRNAs encoding patterning regulators such as <italic>oskar</italic>, <italic>gurken</italic> and <italic>bicoid</italic> are precisely targeted to the three different regions of the oocyte where their protein products are required &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040008-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. mRNA localization has also been observed in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> blastoderm, where transcripts such as <italic>wingless</italic>, and those encoding pair-rule genes, are targeted to the apical cytoplasm &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040008-b026">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040008-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Here we show that loss of the minus end-directed microtubule motor Dynein in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> follicle cell epithelium leads to defects in apico&#x02013;basal polarity. Our data indicate that Dynein is required for the localization of Sdt and suggest a mechanism whereby the Dynein-dependent apical targeting of specific <italic>sdt</italic> mRNA isoforms enriches Sdt protein in the apical cytoplasm. Surprisingly, the apical localization signal for the <italic>sdt</italic> mRNA maps to an alternatively spliced coding exon. Selective removal of this exon coincides with a developmental switch between localized and unlocalized isoforms of the transcript, in which apically localized <italic>sdt</italic> transcripts play an early role in the assembly of the Crb complex, while unlocalized transcripts are sufficient to maintain polarity in mature epithelia. These results suggest that the strategy for the apical targeting of the Crb complex changes during epithelial maturation and introduce a new class of gene products, mRNAs, to the existing paradigm for apico&#x02013;basal polarity regulation</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cytoplasmic Dynein Function Is Required for Epithelial Cell Shape and Integrity</title><p>To identify new genes required for epithelial architecture and morphogenesis, we performed a genetic screen in the follicle cell (FC) epithelium of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> egg chamber (EC).

Dhc is the force-generating subunit of the cytoplasmic Dynein motor, which transports diverse cargoes, such as vesicles, mRNAs and organelles, toward microtubule (MT) minus ends in eukaryotic cells. As is typical for polarized epithelia, FCs contain a dense population of MTs along their lateral cortex with their minus ends pointed toward the apical surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040008-g002">Figure 2</xref>A) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040008-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040008-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. This cytoskeletal geometry suggests that Dynein could affect cell architecture by targeting apical determinant proteins to their site of action at the apical cell surface. Crb stands out as a potential Dynein cargo because it is the only transmembrane protein among the known apical determinants. We initially hypothesized, therefore, that Dynein might affect apico&#x02013;basal polarity by transporting vesicles containing newly synthesized Crb to the apical surface.</p><fig id="pgen-0040008-g002" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Loss of Dhc Disrupts the Apical Localization of Sdt and Crb</title><p>(A) An anti-&#x003b1;-Tubulin antibody (green) reveals MTs in the FCs, while a <italic>nod::LacZ</italic> transgene (magenta) shows that the MT minus ends point toward the apical surface.

The results show that, even in <italic>Dhc</italic> cells with relatively normal shape, Crb is missing from the apical surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040008-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Although <italic>Dhc</italic> cells occasionally display a weak, cytoplasmic staining for Crb (data not shown), overall protein levels are severely reduced when compared to wild-type cells. These experiments show that Dynein is indeed required for the apical targeting of Crb and suggest that Dynein transport is also necessary for the maintenance of wild-type Crb levels in the FCs.</p><p>The fact that Crb is missing from the apical surface in <italic>Dhc</italic> clones is consistent with our initial hypothesis that Dynein could be transporting Crb-containing exocytic vesicles, but we were struck by the strong general reduction in Crb protein levels. It has been previously shown that Crb levels are reduced in embryonic epithelia when its cytoplasmic binding partner <italic>stardust (sdt)</italic> is mutated &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040008-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;, so we next investigated whether Dynein is required for Sdt localization. Sdt is strongly depleted from at the apical surface in <italic>Dhc</italic> cells and is instead found throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040008-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). These data indicate that Dynein is also required for the apical targeting of Sdt and suggest that the mechanism by which Dynein localizes Crb could be indirect.</p><p>Although it is well established that Crb and Sdt depend upon one another for their apical localization, the degree of this dependency can vary with the identity and developmental stage of the tissue examined &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040008-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040008-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040008-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. To determine whether the disruption of just one of these proteins in <italic>Dhc</italic> FC clones could account for the mis-localization of the other, we investigated the relationship between Crb and Sdt in pre-vitellogenic egg chambers. Crb is only partially required for the apical localization of Sdt in the FCs, as there is still a significant amount of Sdt at the apical surface and cell junctions of <italic>crb</italic> mutant cells prior to stage 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040008-g002">Figures 2</xref>D and S1A). The Sdt localization defect in <italic>crb</italic> clones is, therefore, much weaker than that of <italic>Dhc</italic> clones. However, Crb protein is missing from the apical surface of <italic>sdt</italic> clones from the very earliest oogenic stages and overall Crb protein levels are strongly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040008-g002">Figures 2</xref>E and S1B), a phenotype indistinguishable from that of <italic>Dhc</italic> clones. Together these data indicate that that the mislocalization of Sdt in <italic>Dhc</italic> clones can potentially account for the loss of Crb.</p><p>Is Dynein's role in Crb and Sdt localization specific or does loss of Dynein lead to a general disruption of protein polarization? This question is particularly important because a recent study showed that Dynein helps localize Baz to the apical surface in the cellularizing embryonic blastoderm &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040008-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. In contrast to the strong reductions in Crb and Sdt, <italic>Dhc</italic> FC clones show only modest reductions of Baz, aPKC and Par6 at the apical surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040008-g002">Figures 2</xref>F and S2). Because Crb is missing in <italic>Dhc</italic> mutant cells we investigated whether Baz complex components were similarly reduced in <italic>crb<sup>11A22</sup></italic> cells and found a nearly identical phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0040008-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). These results suggest that the apical reduction of Baz in <italic>Dhc</italic> clones may be secondary to the loss of Crb. It is likely that Dynein does play some role in the apical targeting of Baz in the FCs, however, as we did observe rare <italic>Dhc</italic> clones in which Baz and aPKC were relocalized from the apical to the lateral domain, a phenotype never seen in <italic>crb</italic> clones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0040008-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). Finally, the apical localization of &#x003b2;<sub>H</sub>-Spectrin is indistinguishable from wild-type (unpublished data), as is the localization of Discs-large (Dlg) to the lateral domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040008-g002">Figure 2</xref>G).

One cause for this deficiency may be that Dynein is required for a number of essential cellular processes, making it difficult to study this motor under strong loss-of-function conditions. For instance, previous studies of Dynein function in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos have relied on combinations of hypomorphic <italic>Dhc</italic> alleles or injection of &#x003b1;-Dhc antibodies which only partially block Dynein function &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040008-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040008-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040008-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. Notably, these manipulations have failed to produce epithelial polarity phenotypes. We have shown that strong loss of Dynein function in the FCs disrupts both molecular and morphological aspects of apico&#x02013;basal polarity, providing the first direct evidence for the role of this motor in this key cell biological process. It is currently unclear why the FCs tolerate strong loss of Dynein function better than other tissues, but this property provides a unique opportunity to begin dissecting the many roles that Dynein is likely to play in epithelial organization.</p><p>How does Dynein regulate apico&#x02013;basal polarity? Since Dynein is a minus-end directed MT motor and minus ends are apically oriented in epithelia, we investigated whether Dynein might ferry components of the Baz and/or the Crb complexes to their sites of action at the apical surface. Two pieces of data indicate that the Baz complex is not the primary Dynein cargo contributing to FC polarity. Although Baz is occasionally relocalized to the lateral FC surface in <italic>Dhc</italic> clones, most mutant cells display significant amounts of apical Baz. Furthermore, ECs in which the entire epithelium is mutant for <italic>baz</italic> or <italic>aPKC</italic> display multilayering at both EC poles (&#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040008-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d;, unpublished data), a phenotype that is distinct from the posterior multilayering in <italic>Dhc</italic> mutant epithelia. These observations are consistent with recent studies in the embryonic blastoderm, where it was shown that Dynein does play a role in Baz localization, but that it is not the only means by which this protein is targeted to the apical domain &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040008-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. Together, these data indicate that, while Dynein likely does play a role in the apical targeting of Baz in both the embryo and the FCs, Dynein's major contribution to FC apico&#x02013;basal polarity corresponds to a different cargo.</p><p>Our results favor a model in which Dynein works primarily through the Crb complex to influence epithelial polarity. When Dynein function is reduced in the FCs, Crb and Sdt disappear from the apical surface, even in <italic>Dhc</italic> cells that remain cuboidal. Moreover, the morphology of an egg chamber in which the entire epithelium is mutant for <italic>Dhc</italic> is quite similar to that seen for <italic>crb</italic> and <italic>sdt</italic> mutant egg chambers<italic>,</italic> as all three display multilayering predominantly in the posterior (&#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040008-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;, data not shown). A major challenge comes in deciphering which Crb complex components are specifically transported by Dynein. We have focused on the relationship between Dynein and Sdt because genetic interaction and molecular epistasis experiments indicate that loss of apical Sdt can account for many aspects of the <italic>Dhc</italic> polarity phenotype. Our finding that the apical localization of <italic>sdt</italic> transcripts is Dynein-dependent suggests a mechanism by which Dynein could localize Sdt, in part, through the apical targeting and localized translation of its mRNA. <italic>sdt</italic> transcripts cannot be the only Crb complex component transported by Dynein, however, as the phenotype of <italic>sdt<sup>EH681</sup></italic> mutant FCs does not recapitulate all aspects of the polarity phenotype of <italic>Dhc</italic> mutant clones. Interestingly, <italic>crb</italic> transcripts are also targeted to the apical FC cytoplasm in a Dynein-dependent manner, although at a later stage than <italic>sdt</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0040008-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). This finding raises the possibility that, in addition to Baz, <italic>crb</italic> mRNA and/or Crb complex proteins represent other Dynein cargoes required for full epithelial polarization. Future work will be required to more finely dissect Dynein's complex contributions to the apical targeting of the Crb complex.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Developmental Regulation of <italic>sdt</italic> mRNA Localization</title><p>While investigating whether <italic>sdt</italic> mRNA was likely to be a primary Dynein cargo contributing to apico&#x02013;basal polarity, we made the surprising discovery that the apical targeting of <italic>sdt</italic> transcripts is regulated through the alternative splicing of a coding exon, exon 3. We are aware of only two other genes in which transcript localization is regulated in this way &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040008-b050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040008-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d;. In both instances, however, the signal lies within the 3&#x02032;UTR, so the splicing event does not affect protein structure. It is curious that alternative splicing of the <italic>sdt</italic> mRNA localization signal also deletes 433 amino acids from the protein. The role of the amino acids encoded by exon 3 in Sdt function is not yet known. These amino acids are not conserved in vertebrate Sdt homologs. Moreover, Sdt A and Sdt B bind the intracellular domain of Crb with equal efficiency in vitro &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040008-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d; and our work with the <italic>sdt<sup>EH681</sup></italic> allele, as well as over-expression studies with the <italic>sdt A</italic> and <italic>sdt B</italic> transgenes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0040008-sg001">Figure S1</xref>) indicate that both protein isoforms stabilize Crb in vivo. Although we have not ruled out the possibility that exon 3 regulates both mRNA localization and protein function, together these observations suggest that the splicing of exon 3 may primarily regulate mRNA localization.</p><p>A potential role for Dynein-dependent apical targeting of <italic>sdt</italic> mRNA in epithelial polarity is supported by our analysis of the relative contributions of the <italic>sdt A</italic> and <italic>sdt B</italic> isoforms. Although the lack of Sdt A in <italic>sdt<sup>EH681</sup></italic> FC clones reduces Crb at the apical membrane, this deficit leads to relatively mild effects on other aspects of polarity. This apparent discrepancy can be explained by the extrinsic cue for apical identity that is provided to the FCs through their direct contact with the germline &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040008-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040008-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;, which may compensate for reduced Crb complex function in this tissue. However, in the embryo, where no such cue is available, <italic>sdt<sup>EH681</sup></italic> has a nearly null phenotype, which is rescued much more efficiently by <italic>sdt A</italic> than <italic>sdt B.</italic> Overall, these data suggest that the apical targeting of <italic>sdt</italic> transcripts may represent an important mechanism contributing to apico&#x02013;basal polarity.</p><p>Interestingly, the apical targeting of <italic>sdt</italic> mRNA is developmentally regulated in both embryonic and adult epithelia. Specifically, we have shown that apically localized <italic>sdt</italic> transcripts are found only during early stages, while unlocalized transcripts predominate at later stages. Why is <italic>sdt</italic> transcript localization regulated in this way? It is tempting to speculate that apical transcripts are required primarily for the establishment of apico&#x02013;basal polarity but not its maintenance. In reality, however, the functional distinction between the two phases of <italic>sdt</italic> mRNA localization is almost certainly more subtle. When apical <italic>sdt A</italic> transcripts are present, the epithelia are relatively immature; they tend to be proliferative, display incomplete junctional structures and have yet to adopt their final cell morphology. By contrast, when unlocalized <italic>sdt B</italic> transcripts predominate, the epithelia are more likely to be post-mitotic and highly differentiated. These observations raise the possibility that a concentrated pool of Sdt protein, generated by localized translation of apical transcripts, could function to stabilize Crb primarily during periods when cell polarity is labile, but that this dynamic regulatory mechanism would be dispensable in fully differentiated cells.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> genetics.</title><p>FC clones were generated as previously described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040008-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d; using the <italic>e22c-Gal4</italic> driver and <italic>ubiquitin-GFP</italic> to mark wild-type cells.
