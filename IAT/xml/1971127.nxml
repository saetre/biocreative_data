AD is one of the most common chronic diseases in childhood affecting 10&#x00025;&#x02013;20&#x00025; of children in industrialized societies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050242-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;, with a steady increase over the past decades &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050242-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050242-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. Along with asthma and hay fever, AD is commonly associated with an abnormal immune response and the formation of allergy antibodies (IgE) against innocuous environmental allergens.</p><p>AD is often the first clinical manifestation of allergic disease. The onset of disease is typically observed during the first two years of life &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050242-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. For the majority of affected children, AD heralds a lifetime of allergic disease. A susceptible child commonly passes a characteristic sequence of transient or persistent disease stages that is known as the &#x0201c;atopic march&#x0201d; which begins with AD and food allergy in the young infant and continues with the development of allergic airways disease later in childhood and adulthood &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050242-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. The close familial and intra-individual association of the allergic disorder strongly suggests shared genetic etiology.</p><p>A strong genetic component in allergic disorders has been recognized almost a century ago. Cooke and van der Veer first reported that the relatives of patients are at significantly increased risk of developing allergic disease &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050242-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. Even today, a positive family history for allergic disorders is the single strongest predictor for the development of AD &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050242-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. Additional evidence for the importance of genetic factors in atopic disease comes from twin studies. The concordance rate for AD among monozygotic twins of about 80&#x00025; far exceeds the concordance rate of 20&#x00025; observed among dizygotic twins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050242-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050242-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. These data clearly indicate that the genetic contribution to the expression of AD is substantial. Furthermore, studies on the vertical transmission of AD and atopic disease show that children are more likely to inherit these disorders if the mother is affected (parent-of-origin effect) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050242-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. The predominance of maternal inheritance may be due to environmental factors such as uterine milieu or breast feeding, but they may also arise due to genetic mechanisms such as parent-specific gene expression (genomic imprinting) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050242-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>AD and atopic disorders are regarded as multifactorial conditions, the onset and severity of which are influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. The data are consistent with an immune etiology shared by all allergic diseases and a congenital target organ defect, the penetrance of which is modified by multiple environmental factors during early childhood. The identification of genes underlying AD and allergic disorders has the capacity to define primary physiologic mechanisms, thereby clarifying disease pathogenesis, identifying pathways and targets for therapeutic intervention.</p><p>Although several genome-wide linkage screens for AD have been conducted &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050242-b012">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050242-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;, there was no substantial overlap between the identified regions of highest linkage, and the underlying genes remained elusive &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050242-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;.

Linkage analysis yielded a 1-lod support interval of 5.4 Mb between the markers M3CS075 and M3CS233 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050242-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Subsequently, we conducted an association scan of the 5.4-Mb region using 212 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at an average distance of 25.5 kb (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050242-st001">Table S1</xref>). The SNPs were selected primarily to cover known and predicted genes. Because we had observed a strong maternal effect in the linkage study &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050242-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;, we chose a family-based association analysis that allowed us to search for risk alleles preferentially transmitted from the mother &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050242-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;.

To define the critical region, we typed 16 additional SNPs. Eight of these markers showed association with AD and a maternal transmission pattern to affected children, which was consistent with our previous linkage results (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050242-t001">Table 1</xref>).

We used the marker that had shown the strongest association, rs4688761, to identify 73 of the 199 families from the original linkage scan in whom the disease-associated allele had been transmitted to affected offspring. Nonparametric linkage analysis in the 73 associated families yielded significant evidence for linkage (<italic>Z</italic><sub>all</sub> &#x0003d; 4.18 versus 4.31 in the complete cohort), demonstrating that the majority of the linkage signal was attributable to these families. The significance of this finding was assessed by performing nonparametric linkage analysis in 10,000 random selections of 73 families. An empirical significance level was calculated as the proportion of replicates for which the maximum <italic>Z</italic><sub>all</sub> score was equal or greater than that obtained in the actual analysis. The probability of obtaining a <italic>Z</italic><sub>all</sub> score of &#x02265;4.18 by chance in a random selection of 73 families was estimated by 10,000 simulations to be 0.027.</p><p>To confirm the association result, we used a large independent replication set consisting of 292 complete nuclear families including 481 children with AD. We genotyped the selected eight SNPs covering an interval of 96 kb that were associated with AD in the discovery dataset. We confirmed the association with AD across all markers with the strongest association with AD observed for marker A36637742 (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.00038), which also showed a significant overtransmission of the maternal allele (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.0013) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050242-t002">Table 2</xref>). The association remained significant after correction for multiple testing. For each marker, it was the more common allele that was overtransmitted. Haplotypes were constructed over the region, which confirmed the association with AD and showed that this phenotype is associated with the overtransmission of the most common haplotype (haplotype frequency 65&#x00025;, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050242-t003">Table 3</xref>), and of the maternal allele (<italic>p</italic><sub>maternal</sub> &#x0003d; 0.000025 for AD, P&#x0005f;POO<sub>maternal emp</sub> &#x0003d; 0.033). Next, we compared the AD status among the parents: in the discovery cohort, significantly more mothers (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 63) than fathers (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 19) suffered from AD (odds ratio &#x0005b;OR&#x0005d; 4.39, 95&#x00025; confidence interval &#x0005b;CI&#x0005d; 2.51 &#x02013; 7.68, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 5.46 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>). Similarly, in the replication cohort, mothers (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 83) were significantly more frequently affected with AD than fathers (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 55) (OR 1.71, 95&#x00025; CI 1.16 &#x02013; 2.52, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 8.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>). To assess whether the parent-of-origin effect that was observed originated from the discrepancy in AD prevalence among the parents, we compared haplotype transmissions from affected and unaffected mothers. In the discovery cohort, the excess in maternal transmissions was not predominantly attributable to affected mothers (T:UT &#x0003d; 24:21, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.14) compared to unaffected ones (T:UT &#x0003d; 81:47, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.0059). Similarly, affected mothers (T:UT &#x0003d; 25:17, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.14) of the replication cohort did not contribute a larger transmission excess than the unaffected ones (T:UT &#x0003d; 70:29, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.00013). We conclude that the observed maternal overtransmission pattern in both cohorts was not due to the higher AD prevalence among mothers.</p><table-wrap id="pbio-0050242-t002" content-type="2col" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Association Analysis of Single Markers for Atopic Dermatitis in the Replication Dataset</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0050242.t002"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="pbio-0050242-t003" content-type="2col" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Haplotype Analysis for AD in the Replication Dataset</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0050242.t003"/></table-wrap><p>A database search within the associated 96-kb interval revealed a single predicted gene, <italic>FLJ35880</italic>, extending 11.6 kb into the associated region.

In addition, we performed in silico comparisons of the six variants located within a vWA with the crystal structure of the human vWF A3 domain. One variant, V669G, affects an amino acid within a highly conserved stretch of eight amino acids. The mutation of an adjacent amino acid within this conserved region of a vWA in the homologous gene <italic>COLVIA1</italic> has been reported to cause the monogenic muscle disorder Bethlem myopathy &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050242-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. This variant, however was rare (allele frequency 1,3&#x00025;). One additional variant (E455K) is located in a region predicted to be important for integrin&#x02013;collagen interaction, and another one (M56T) is located in a helix near a rather conserved region that may also affect protein&#x02013;protein interaction.

The candidacy of this chromosomal region was further supported by Bradley et al., who mapped a locus for AD severity in close proximity (3q14) in a Swedish population &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050242-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. By positional cloning, we have now identified the disease-causing gene, <italic>COL29A1,</italic> which encodes a novel epidermal collagen.</p><p>The disease gene was located in a two-staged investigation consisting of systematic linkage and association scanning of the region and subsequent confirmation of the association in a large, independent, replication dataset. In the first stage, we genotyped additional microsatellite markers in the candidate region, which narrowed the initial 12.75-cM linkage interval to 5.4 Mb. The association analysis with an average marker distance of 25.5 kb, finally, revealed an association that was confined to a haplotype block of 170 kb, which included a single gene, <italic>COL29A1</italic>. Pairwise LD measures indicated LD across the entire gene and defined two subblocks of increased LD. The strongest association was observed within the 96-kb subblock encoding the collagenous domain and the C terminus of collagen XXIX. A rapid decay of LD at the borders of the <italic>COL29A1</italic> haplotype block and lack of association of the SNPs located within the neighboring genes clearly limited the association to <italic>COL29A1</italic>. In addition, we demonstrated in the discovery dataset that the families that contributed to the association of SNP rs4688761 with AD also accounted for most of the linkage signal. This finding corroborated that variants in <italic>COL29A1</italic> explained the previously reported linkage of AD to 3q21 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050242-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. Finally, we confirmed association in a large independent family cohort, making <italic>COL29A1</italic> the first AD susceptibility gene, to our knowledge, that is identified by positional cloning.</p><p>Consistent with the linkage analysis, we found a maternal transmission pattern to affected offspring in both family cohorts. Although the sexes were equally represented among the affected children of both cohorts, we observed a marked maternal preponderance in AD status among the parents in both cohorts. This finding clearly supports the notion of a maternal effect. It may, however, also raise the question whether the maternal overtransmission pattern observed for the <italic>COL29A1</italic> haplotype was due to the different prevalence of AD in mothers and fathers. This is unlikely to be the case, because the analytical tools used in this study, nonparametric linkage and TDT, do not take into account the parental phenotype. Furthermore, we showed that the observed maternal effect was not predominantly attributable to transmissions from affected rather than unaffected mothers. Although parent-of-origin effects have not previously been reported for genes from Chromosome 3q21, they have been observed at other loci influencing allergic disease &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050242-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. Tissue-specific imprinting of genes encoding extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins has been reported in the mouse &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050242-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;, and their disruption has been shown to impair skin structure and function &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050242-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. Interestingly, <italic>COL29A1</italic> is expressed in human placenta, an organ of embryonic origin. Apart from classic genomic imprinting mechanisms, maternal effects may be due to an interaction of the child's genotype with the maternal environment during prenatal life.</p><p>Sequencing of the exons and promoter region revealed 19 nonsynonymous coding SNPs, six of which were located within a vWA. In silico analysis of these variants revealed only one rare mutation altering a highly conserved amino acid, but all of them may affect protein&#x02013;protein interaction. None of the nonsynonymous coding SNPs explained the observed association on its own. It has been demonstrated in other complex diseases that multiple independent variants may occur in a single disease gene &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050242-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. It is therefore possible that several variants or combinations thereof which are associated with the most common haplotype of <italic>COL29A1</italic> are involved in the disease pathogenesis. The functional influence of the associated variants remains to be determined.</p><p>Involvement of <italic>COL29A1</italic> in AD is further supported by its tissue- and cell-specific expression pattern. Like <italic>COL29A1</italic>, a growing number of collagens recently identified show a restricted expression pattern. These are not mainly found in fibrous connective tissue, but rather in the ECM of more specialized tissue structures pointing to a distinctive function of these proteins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050242-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. Highest <italic>COL29A1</italic> expression was observed in the skin, but also in other epithelial tissues such as the lung, small intestine, and colon, which are the main manifestation sites of allergic disorders, including asthma and food allergies. This gene expression pattern might indicate a role of collagen XXIX in a wider spectrum of allergic diseases and suggests a molecular link between AD, respiratory airways disease, and food allergies, which are epidemiologically closely associated &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050242-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050242-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In human skin, collagen XXIX was detected throughout the viable layers of the epidermis with an increase toward the differentiated cells of the granular layer. Comparative expression analysis of <italic>COL29A1</italic> by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry in skin biopsies of patients with AD and healthy controls revealed a distinct lack of <italic>COL29A1</italic> mRNA and protein in the outer viable layers of the epidermis. The process of epidermal stratification is tightly regulated by an increasing gradient of extracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration and a specific special and temporal expression pattern of transcriptional regulators &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050242-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. Our findings indicate that the specific cellular milieu acquired during terminal epidermal differentiation affect the regulation or degradation of <italic>COL29A1</italic> mRNA in the outer epidermis. However, our findings do not allow us to distinguish between these two processes.</p><p>Lack of collagen XXIX in the outer epidermis of AD patients indicates that a defective ECM may give rise to the disease, proposing a new pathomechanism for AD. Collagens are the most abundant ECM proteins in vertebrates and play a crucial role in maintaining tissue integrity.

It is therefore conceivable that collagen XXIX plays an important role in keratinocyte cohesion.

For detection of the hybridized probe, slides were incubated with BCIP/NBT staining solution (Roche Diagnostics) for 4 d according to the manufacturer's recommendations.</p><p>To quantify gene expression in skin specimens, total RNA was isolated from 160 &#x003bc;m cryosections of skin biopsies using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.qiagen.com">http://www.qiagen.com</ext-link>). RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA with random hexamer primers using the Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche Diagnostics). Taqman real-time PCR was performed with iTaq SYBR Green (BioRad; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biorad.com">http://www.biorad.com</ext-link>) and gene-specific PCR products were detected on the ABI PRISM 7900 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). All measurements were performed in duplicate. <italic>COL29A1</italic> expression was normalized for 18S rRNA expression. Differences in gene expression were calculated using the &#x00394;&#x00394;ct method and were expressed as fold change. Gene-specific primers were as follows; <italic>COL29A1</italic>-forward, 5&#x02032;-CCACCCTCTGGATCATCACT, <italic>COL29A1</italic>-reverse, 5&#x02032;-GTTTTCTGTGCCACCGTTCT, KRT10-forward, 5&#x02032;-CTGAAACCGAGTGCCAGAAT, KRT10-reverse, 5&#x02032;-GCCTCCGGAACTTCCCTCT, 18S rRNA-forward, 5&#x02032;-GGATGCGTGCATTTATCAGA, 18S rRNA-reverse, 5&#x02032;-GATCAGCCCGAGGTTATCTA. The sizes of the PCR products were confirmed by gel electrophoresis and the specificity of the reaction was confirmed by melting curve analysis of the PCR products. For statistical analysis, the unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test was used.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Antibodies and immunohistochemistry.</title><p>A polyclonal antibody against human collagen XXIX protein was raised by immunizing rabbits with a collagen XXIX specific peptide (SLGSTRKDDMEELAC, residues 2115&#x02013;2128) (Eurogentec; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.eurogentec.com">http://www.eurogentec.com</ext-link>). The specificity of the antibodies purified by affinity chromatography was tested by comparing their reactivity against recombinant proteins by Western blotting and by blocking experiments.</p><p>For immunohistochemistry, freshly isolated skin specimens from five AD patients and five healthy individuals were embedded in Tissue-Tek. Cryosections of 5 &#x003bc;m thickness were prepared and fixed with acetone. Sections were incubated with anti-collagen XXIX antibodies followed by dextran-coupled anti-rabbit antibody, an alkaline phosphatase labelled amplification polymer (DAKO EnVision System; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dako.com">http://www.dako.com</ext-link>) and detection with fuchsin (DAKO). Nuclei were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin solution (Sigma-Aldrich; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sigmaaldrich.com">http://www.sigmaaldrich.com</ext-link>). Omission of primary antibody and preincubation with equimolar amount of peptide used for generation of the antibody in rabbits were used as negative controls for parallel sections. The results were consistent among the AD patients on one hand, and among the control biopsies on the other.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio-0050242-sg001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>Hapmap LD Data for the <italic>COL29A1</italic> Region on Human Chromosome 3</title><p>LD plot for the CEPH population (Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western Europe) is shown &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050242-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;.
