To identify the most highly conserved of the many BRCA1 functions, we screened the evolutionarily distant eukaryote <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> for mutants that suppressed the G1 checkpoint arrest and lethality induced following heterologous BRCA1 expression. A genome-wide screen in the diploid deletion collection combined with a screen of ionizing radiation sensitive gene deletions identified mutants that permit growth in the presence of BRCA1. These genes delineate a metabolic mRNA pathway that temporally links transcription elongation (<italic>SPT4, SPT5, CTK1, DEF1</italic>) to nucleopore-mediated mRNA export (<italic>ASM4, MLP1, MLP2, NUP2, NUP53, NUP120, NUP133, NUP170</italic>, <italic>NUP188, POM34</italic>) and cytoplasmic mRNA decay at P-bodies (<italic>CCR4, DHH1</italic>). Strikingly, BRCA1 interacted with the <italic>p</italic>hosphorylated RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) <italic>c</italic>arboxy <italic>t</italic>erminal <italic>d</italic>omain (P-CTD), phosphorylated in the pattern specified by the CTDK-I kinase, to induce <italic>DEF1</italic>-dependent cleavage and accumulation of a RNAPII fragment containing the P-CTD. Significantly, breast cancer associated BRCT domain defects in BRCA1 that suppressed P-CTD cleavage and lethality in yeast also suppressed the physical interaction of BRCA1 with human SPT5 in breast epithelial cells, thus confirming SPT5 as a relevant target of BRCA1 interaction. Furthermore, enhanced P-CTD cleavage was observed in both yeast and human breast cells following UV-irradiation indicating a conserved eukaryotic damage response. Moreover, P-CTD cleavage in breast epithelial cells was BRCA1-dependent since damage-induced P-CTD cleavage was only observed in the mutant BRCA1 cell line HCC1937 following ectopic expression of wild type BRCA1. Finally, BRCA1, SPT5 and hyperphosphorylated RPB1 form a complex that was rapidly degraded following MMS treatment in wild type but not BRCA1 mutant breast cells. These results extend the mechanistic links between BRCA1 and transcriptional consequences in response to DNA damage and suggest an important role for RNAPII P-CTD cleavage in BRCA1-mediated cancer suppression.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Inherited heterozygous BRCA1 and BRCA2 defects have been associated with an enhanced risk of early onset breast cancer. These tumor suppressor genes normally function to maintain genome integrity by participating in the repair of DNA damage. Although the repair-related functions of BRCA1 have been extensively characterized (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001448-Venkitaraman1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>), identifying the underlying mechanism responsible for the onset of breast cancer has remained elusive. The BRCA1 protein functions in multiple pathways that maintain genomic integrity through its impact on the repair of a variety of genomic lesions including DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). BRCA1 participates in recombinational repair of DSBs, non-homologous end-joining of DSBs, checkpoint arrest, transcriptional regulatory mechanisms and chromatin remodeling as well as centrosome duplication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001448-Venkitaraman1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001448-Zhong1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, the BRCA1 protein has been found to physically interact with numerous other proteins in distinct, multi-component DNA repair complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001448-Wang1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001448-Chiba1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001448-Greenberg1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Although BRCA1 seems to be a central DNA repair component due to its many physical interactions in repair-related processes, the tumor suppressor activity is largely confined to breast and ovarian epithelia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001448-Venkitaraman1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. To resolve this enigma, BRCA1 has been suggested to interact with a subset of tissue specific, non-redundant cofactors in a single key pathway to mediate its tumor suppressive effects.</p><p>As an alternative approach for studying this important repair protein, we have utilized the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae,</italic> which has served as the fundamental model organism for the identification of the genetic controls associated with DNA repair and checkpoint functions that are conserved in most eukaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001448-Resnick1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Yeast is an excellent model organism for elucidating BRCA1 function since heterologous expression of BRCA1 causes slow growth and lethality in both haploid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001448-Humphrey1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> and diploid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001448-Westmoreland1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> wild type (WT) yeast. Mutations within the BRCT domain of BRCA1 that are associated with familial breast cancer, but not polymorphisms without disease association, suppress this slow growth phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001448-Humphrey1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In order to identify a key pathway that may underlie the tumorigenic potential of BRCA1 in breast cancer, we took advantage of the evolutionary distance between humans and yeast. In effect, we used yeast as an evolutionary &#x0201c;filter&#x0201d; to identify conserved proteins that, through severe functional constraints, have maintained the ability to interact with BRCA1 over a vast evolutionary distance. Other successful examples of this approach include the identification of relevant conserved genetic and biochemical networks that interact with mutant Huntington protein as well as alpha-synuclein, which has been implicated in the pathology of Parkinson's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001448-Willingham1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001448-Giorgini1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Since interaction of BRCA1 with such conserved proteins may account for lethality in WT yeast, we screened for nonessential gene deletions in the yeast diploid deletion collection that suppressed BRCA1-induced lethality. Previously, we described that deletions of the G1 checkpoint adaptation genes <italic>CCR4</italic> or <italic>DHH1</italic> that also mediate radiation resistance, suppressed BRCA1-induced lethality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001448-Westmoreland1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In this report we screened both ionizing radiation (IR) sensitive mutants and an unselected pool of yeast deletion mutants to identify additional suppressors of GAL-induced BRCA1 lethality. Many of these suppressors are functionally and temporally linked in mRNA metabolic processes that include transcriptional elongation, mRNA export and decay. Focusing on the process of elongation, we demonstrate in human cell extracts that BRCA1 can be co-immunoprecipitated with the human ortholog of Spt5p and hyperphosphorylated RNAPII. We show that BRCA1 interacts with the <italic>C t</italic>erminal <italic>d</italic>omain (CTD) of <italic>RNA p</italic>olymerase II (RNAPII) when the CTD is phosphorylated in a pattern specified by the CTDK-I kinase (CTK), to mediate <italic>p</italic>hospho-<italic>CTD</italic> (P-CTD) cleavage. This P-CTD cleavage is not induced by cancer-associated mutations in the BRCT domain (C-terminal domain of BRCA1) and is suppressed by genomic deletion of the RNAPII <italic>de</italic>gradation <italic>f</italic>actor <italic>DEF1</italic> and <italic>CTK1,</italic> the CTD kinase that results in phosphorylation of serine 2 and serine 5. We further show that UV-irradiation results in a proteasome dependent accumulation of the P-CTD cleavage product in yeast and human breast cancer cells wild type for BRCA1 but not in a BRCA1 mutant cell line. Ectopic expression of the wild type BRCA1 protein in this mutant line restores damage dependent P-CTD cleavage indicating a direct mechanistic link between BRCA1 and this newly discovered RNAPII processing event. From this and other supportive data, we propose a model in which BRCA1-induced RNAPII P-CTD cleavage and degradation is a key component of a highly conserved, checkpoint/surveillance pathway that detects DNA damage within actively transcribing genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>A genome-wide screen for suppressors of BRCA1-induced lethality in yeast identifies genes required for mRNA elongation, export and decay</title><p>Although a BRCA1 ortholog is not found in the yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, expression of BRCA1 in yeast results in slow growth and lethality.

By screening for rapid growth on GAL-URA (GAL) medium immediately following transformation of the <italic>BRCA1</italic> expression plasmid into a pool of genetically tagged deletion strains, we initially identified a total of 48 mutant strains that suppressed BRCA1 lethality.

BRCA1 suppressor strains were initially identified by sequencing rapid growing strains arising on GAL-URA plates following transformation of the diploid deletion strain pool with the <italic>GAL::</italic>BRCA1 expression plasmid. Putative BRCA1 suppressor strains identified from the pool were selected from the arrayed deletion strain library and transformed with the BRCA1 expression plasmid, grown to stationary phase in GLU and 2 ul aliquots were replica spotted onto GLU and GAL plates from serial 5-fold dilutions in water (arrows indicate direction of decreasing cell concentration). Typical results are depicted for seven strains. Five deletion strains (<italic>apt1&#x00394;, nst1&#x00394;, oca1&#x00394;, ygr039W&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>ylr412W&#x00394;</italic>) failed to suppress BRCA1 lethality and were omitted from further study. Two deletion strains, <italic>bbc1&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>ygr064W&#x00394;</italic> (which deletes the N terminus of <italic>SPT4</italic>) were confirmed to suppress BRCA1-induced lethality.

We collectively identified mutants with defects in highly conserved cellular processes that primarily affect mRNA metabolism. Specifically, these processes include transcription elongation (<italic>DEF1, SPT4, SPT5, SUB1</italic>), mRNA export (<italic>MLP2, ASM4, NUP2, NUP120, NUP133, NUP170, NUP188, POM34;</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001448-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>) and mRNA decay at cytoplasmic processing bodies (<italic>DHH1, CCR4</italic>).

Using known network interactions, we identified a further 9 deletions including <italic>mlp1&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>nup53&#x00394;</italic> as suppressors of BRCA1.

Thus a total of 45 suppressors of BRCA1 lethality were identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001448.s001">Table S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Suppression of lethality is not due to reduced BRCA1 expression, nuclear exclusion or second site suppressors</title><p>Since suppressors of BRCA1 lethality could have an impact upon mRNA expression and export or nuclear import of the BRCA1 protein, we analyzed representative strains for BRCA1 expression and subcellular localization. Following a standard whole cell extraction protocol using ice-cold NP40 buffer, BRCA1 was extensively degraded even in the presence of protease inhibitors (data not shown). To alleviate this problem we adopted an extraction protocol in 95&#x00025; ethanol that rapidly fixes the cells and greatly reduced BRCA1 degradation (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). GAL-induced expression of BRCA1 protein was unaffected by deletion of the major transcriptional regulators that suppress lethality when compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001448-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). Furthermore, intranuclear localization of GAL-induced BRCA1 was unaffected in suppressor mutants that regulate transcription (<italic>spt4&#x00394;</italic>) or nuclear pore functions (<italic>nup170&#x00394;</italic>) as determined by immunofluorescent detection (IF, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001448-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>).

In each case, BRCA1 lethality was restored on GAL indicating that second site mutations were not responsible for the suppressor phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001448-g001">Fig. 1F</xref>). Thus suppression of BRCA1 lethality appears to result from the identified gene deletions and absence of the corresponding gene products that functionally mediate the lethal BRCA1 response.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Recombination and TCR repair are dispensable for BRCA1-induced lethality</title><p>In human cells, BRCA1 has been shown to interact with components of the recombinational repair apparatus (Rad51p) as well as components of the non-homologous end-joining pathway which are all highly conserved in yeast and required for DSB repair (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001448-Deng1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001448-Bau1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>).

We therefore investigated whether expression of BRCA1 in yeast was also genome-destabilizing and could account for some or all of the lethality observed in yeast. We first examined whether lethality was dependent on plasmid selection following expression of BRCA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001448-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). In order to determine the kinetics of BRCA1-induced plasmid loss and subsequent lethality, we performed a &#x0201c;pullback&#x0201d; experiment in which WT cells containing the BRCA1 plasmid or empty vector were plated within GAL-URA or GAL&#x0002b;URA medium to induce BRCA1 expression. At increasing time intervals, we overlaid the GAL plates with either GLU-URA or GLU&#x0002b;URA medium to repress BRCA1 expression. When plasmid selection (-URA) was maintained throughout the experiment so that only plasmid retaining cells would survive, a rapid time dependent decrease in survival was observed. Following plating under non-selective conditions (&#x0002b;URA) survival was still significantly reduced as compared to WT cells containing empty vector, however survival was increased as compared to that under selective conditions indicating that loss of the plasmid selectable marker comprises only part of the observed BRCA1-induced lethality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001448-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>).

BRCA1-induced accumulation of the P-CTD fragment was enhanced by concomitant treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 in the permeable <italic>erg6&#x00394;</italic> strain suggesting that the P-CTD was subject to proteasome-mediated degradation following cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001448-g004">Fig. 4F</xref>).

Taken together, these results indicate that expression of BRCA1 with an intact BRCT domain in yeast leads to the appearance of a novel P-CTD fragment, cleaved from a form of RNAPII whose phosphorylation state is dependent on CTDK-I. Subsequent stability of this fragment is influenced by the proteasome system.</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>BRCA1 interacts with the DSIF complex in yeast and human cells</title><p>Suppression of BRCA1-induced lethality in <italic>spt4&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>spt5</italic> yeast strains suggests that the DSIF complex may mediate interaction of BRCA1 with RNAPII. Therefore, we tested whether components of the DSIF complex physically interact with BRCA1 in yeast and human cells. Following expression of a V5 tagged Spt4p in yeast co-expressing BRCA1, we were able to co-IP BRCA1 and Spt4p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001448-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). As our genetic screen in yeast was intended to identify novel BRCA1 interactive targets in mammalian cells, we turned our attention to a more physiologically relevant system. Using lysates from the MCF7 breast cancer cell line that harbors wild type BRCA1, we detected an interaction between endogenous SPT5 and BRCA1 by co-IP analysis. This interaction was present both in unirradiated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001448-g005">Fig. 5B,C</xref>) and in cells following 20 J/m<sup>2</sup> of UV-irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001448-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). In HCC1937 cells harboring a hemizygous BRCA1 mutation (5382insC resulting in mistranslation starting at codon 1755 and premature termination at 1829), we found no detectable interaction between these two proteins, with or without DNA damage suggesting that the BRCA1 C-terminal domain is required. In MCF7 cells the interaction was detectable in both directions using either SPT5 or BRCA1 as a capture protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001448-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>, right half). Finally, interactions between SPT5, BRCA1 and the phosphorylated full-length form of RPB1 (IIo) were also detectable in unirradiated MCF7 cell extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001448-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>, left half).</p><fig id="pone-0001448-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001448.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>BRCA1-DSIF complexes are rapidly degraded.</title><p>(A) Spt4p physically interacts with BRCA1 in yeast. WT cells bearing the <italic>GAL::</italic>BRCA1 and <italic>GAL::</italic>Spt4-V5-<italic>LEU2</italic> expression plasmids were induced for co-expression of BRCA1 and Spt4-V5 (16 hrs). Whole cell lysates (WCL) were prepared in various concentrations of NP40 and either loaded directly (200 ug/lane) or subjected to co-IP reactions overnight using anti-BRCA1 antibody or normal mouse IgG. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting using anti-V5 antibody as a probe. Spt4p is detected as a double band in WCL of WT cells migrating between 14 and 20 kDa. This doublet Spt4p band was also detected endogenously using anti-Spt4p antibody (sc-26353, Santa Cruz) as a probe (data not shown). The upper Spt4-V5 band was observed to interact maximally with BRCA1 at an NP40 concentration of 0.8&#x00025;. BRCA1 similarly interacted with endogenous Spt4p when anti-Spt4p antibody (sc-26353, Santa Cruz) was used as the IP antibody (data not shown). (B) Interaction of BRCA1 with SPT5 is dependent on the BRCA1-BRCT domain in human cells. MCF7 and HCC1937 cells were either left untreated or exposed to UV (20 J/m<sup>2</sup>) for 6hr in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (50 uM). WCL were prepared and subjected to co-IP analysis using normal mouse IgG (NLM), anti-BRCA1 or anti-SPT5 mouse monoclonal antibody as the IP reagent. Western immunoblot (IB) analysis utilized anti-BRCA1 as a probe. The interaction of SPT5 with BRCA1 is observed in both unirradiated and UV-irradiated MCF7 cells. Interaction between BRCA1, and SPT5 is abolished in HCC1937 cells. At the time of irradiation, cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (50 uM) to inhibit rapid damage-induced degradation of the BRCA1-SPT5 complex. In the absence of proteasome inhibition, no BRCA1-SPT5 interaction was seen following UV irradiation (data not shown). (C) BRCA1 interacts with SPT5 and RNA polymerase II in human cells. Co-IP reactions using the indicated monoclonal antibodies and normal (non-immune) mouse IgG (NLM) were separated by SDS-PAGE. Western immunoblot (IB) analysis utilized, anti-BRCA1, anti-2,5P and anti-SPT5 as probes. Both BRCA1 and SPT5 interacted with the full-length hyperphosphorylated form of RNA polymerase II (IIo). SPT5 interaction with BRCA1 could be detected using either anti-BRCA1 or anti-SPT5 monoclonal antibodies as the immunoprecipitation reagent. Interaction between SPT5 and BRCA1 was abolished in HCC1937 cells that express a BRCT defective form of BRCA1. (D) Rapid MMS-induced degradation of BRCA1, SPT5 and RNAPII is BRCT domain dependent. MCF and HCC1937 cells were either left unexposed or exposed to the radiomimetic methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) for 2 hours at 37&#x000b0;C. Separated proteins were Western immunoblotted using anti-BRCA1, anti-SPT5, anti-RNAPII antibody N20 and anti-actin as probes. Whereas MMS treatment of MCF7 cells (BRCA1&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;) led to a dramatic degradation of BRCA1, SPT5 and RNAPII (Rpb1 subunit). MMS treatment of HCC1937 cells (BRCA1&#x02212;/&#x02212;) resulted in reduced and/or delayed degradation of the three proteins. These results suggest that the co-degradation may be a BRCT domain dependent process.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0001448.g005"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2l"><title>MMS treatment induces rapid degradation of BRCA1, SPT5 and RPB1</title><p>BRCA1 appears to have ubiquitin ligase activity, with phosphorylated RPB1 acting as a substrate in a DNA damage responsive manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001448-Starita1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001448-Kleiman1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> . Since SPT5 appears to be associated with both BRCA1 and the RNA polymerase, we asked whether its degradation was influenced by BRCA1 or DNA damage. Treatment of MCF7 and HCC1937 cells with the radiomimetic alkylating agent MMS for 2h induced a dramatic dose dependent decrease in steady-state SPT5 levels in the BRCA1 wild type MCF7 cells but not the mutant HCC1937 line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001448-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>). Loss of BRCA1 and RPB1 was also much more dramatic in MCF7 cells providing further evidence for a functional link between these proteins. Proteasome inhibition only partially prevented the damage-induced loss of all three proteins in MCF7 cells (data not shown). Dependence of damage-induced degradation of BRCA1, SPT5 and RPB1 on a functional BRCA1-BRCT domain suggests that this BRCA1-mediated degradation pathway may be critical for the suppression of tumorigenesis. Moreover, the BRCA1-mediated co-degradative loss of the abundant SPT5 protein along with RNA polymerase II suggests that the DSIF complex may have a key role in maintaining RNAPII stability prior to DNA damage.</p></sec><sec id="s2m"><title>P-CTD cleavage is induced following DNA damage in yeast and human cells</title><p>Since BRCA1 may subvert a conserved transcription associated damage pathway in yeast to exert its lethal effects, we examined if UV-irradiation, an efficient block to transcriptional elongation, could also induce P-CTD cleavage in yeast. Following a moderate dose of UV irradiation (120 J/m<sup>2</sup>), a transient 50 kDa P-CTD fragment was detected between 4 and 5 hours post irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001448-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0001448-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001448.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>DNA damage induces RNAPII P-CTD cleavage in yeast and human cells.</title><p>(A) UV damage in yeast induces RNAPII P-CTD cleavage. Stationary phase WT diploid yeast cells were irradiated with 120 J/m<sup>2</sup> of UV-irradiation. UV induced a transient 50 kDa RNAPII P-CTD cleavage fragment at 4&#x02013;5 hours following irradiation and outgrowth in fresh YPD medium. This fragment was similar in size to that observed following BRCA1 expression. The survival fraction for colony forming ability following UV irradiation was 0.70. P-CTD cleavage was not observed in unirradiated control cells (data not shown). (B) Antibodies specific for the RNAPII CTD immunoprecipitate a RNAPII P-CTD fragment following UV irradiation. WCL were prepared from unirradiated and UV-irradiated (20 J/m<sup>2</sup>) MCF7 and T47D cells 4 hours after irradiation in the presence of MG132 and subsequently immunoprecipitated with either 2,5P or 8WG16 anti-CTD antibodies. 8WG16 is specific for unphosphorylated and partially phosphorylated forms of Rpb1. Immunoprecipitates were separated on polyacrylamide gels and the P-CTD detected by Western blot using the 2,5P anti-CTD antibody as described above. UV damage enhanced the ability to detect the P-CTD fragment by immunoblotting following immunoprecipitation (IP) with either 2,5P or 8WG16 antibody. Although P-CTD fragment was detected in extracts from unirradiated cells, the ability to IP the P-CTD fragment was enhanced in extracts from UV-irradiated cells. Images depict proteins greater than 75 kDa. Cross-reacting heavy chain antibodies used in the IP reactions were detected at &#x0223c;50 kDa (data not shown). (C) UV-irradiation induces RNAPII P-CTD cleavage in human cells. Human cell lines MCF7 and HCC1937 were grown to 70&#x02013;80&#x00025; confluence and either left unirradiated or irradiated with UV (20 J/m<sup>2</sup>). Unirradiated (&#x02212;) and UV-irradiated (&#x0002b;) cells were subsequently incubated at 37&#x000b0;C in growth medium with (&#x0002b;) or without (&#x02212;) the proteasome inhibitor MG132 for 6 hours. Whole cell lysates were prepared by scraping cells into 95&#x00025; ethanol at 4&#x000b0;C. Proteins extracted in the ethanol soluble fraction were separated on a 4&#x02013;15&#x00025; polyacrylamide gel and probed with anti-2,5P antibody. Following initial immunoblotting, the membrane was stripped and re-probed with anti-actin antibody to serve as a loading control. Since the CTD of human RNAPII contains 52 heptapeptide repeat units, UV-induced the cleavage of Rpb1 releasing a P-CTD fragment that was approximately twice the size (&#x0223c;110 kDa) of the yeast P-CTD fragment which contains 25 heptapeptide repeats (&#x0223c;50 kDa, see panel A). In repeated experiments, the P-CTD fragment was frequently observed in extracts from unirradiated MG132 treated cells (data not shown) however, detection of the P-CTD fragment was enhanced in extracts from similarly treated cells exposed to UV. Greatly reduced levels of P-CTD cleavage was also observed in the BRCA1 defective cell line MDA-MD-436 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001448-Elstrodt1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref> following UV-irradiation and proteasome inhibition (data not shown). (D) UV-induced RNAPII P-CTD cleavage is BRCA1-dependent. Cells with a BRCA1-BRCT domain defect (HCC1937) were separately transfected with empty vector (PC) or vectors expressing truncated BRCA1 (BRCA1-&#x00394;M) and full-length wild type BRCA1. At 48 hours post transfection cells were UV-irradiated, treated with MG132 and homogenized in ethanol as described above (panel C) and methods. Aliquots (10 ul) from the insoluble fraction resuspended in loading buffer were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted (IB) with the indicated antibodies as described above (panel C). The P-CTD cleavage fragment was only observed following ectopic expression of full-length wild type BRCA1. The faster mobility of the BRCA1 protein expressed from the BRCA1-&#x00394;M construct is due to an in frame internal deletion of 518 amino acids which retains the RING and BRCT domains of BRCA1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001448-Starita1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. BRCA1 expressed endogenously in the HCC1937 cells is detected as a lighter band with mobility similar to that of the ectopically overexpressed BRCA1. (E) A model for BRCA1 DNA damage surveillance during transcription. This model describes a BRCA1-dependent transcription-mediated checkpoint/surveillance system that is highly conserved among eukaryotes. The components of this pathway were identified as suppressors of BRCA1-induced lethality in yeast. Following DNA damage within actively transcribing genes, the elongating phosphorylated RNA pol II (form IIo) is stalled by DNA damage. In yeast, the Ctk1p kinase specifies the phosphorylation pattern of the CTD &#x0201c;recognized&#x0201d; by BRCA1. BRCA1 in the presence of specific co-factors including DSIF (Spt4p/Spt5p) and the yeast degradation factor Def1p is proposed to bind the P-CTD. This activates a protease activity that cleaves the CTD from the catalytic domain of Rpb1p (resulting in CTD-less form IIb). We propose this event is an upsteam signal that activates checkpoint arrest in G1. The checkpoint arrest signal remains &#x0201c;on&#x0201d; until prematurely terminated mRNA is exported from the nucleus utilizing Mlp1p, Mlp2p and numerous nuclear pore components to be degraded at the cytoplasmic processing body utilizing Ccr4p and Dhh1p. Following P-CTD cleavage, Rpb1p is targeted for ubiquitin-mediated degradation at the proteasome.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0001448.g006"/></fig><p>Although the repeated RNAPII CTD sequence of yeast and human cells is highly conserved, the human CTD is approximately twice the length of the yeast CTD. Consistent with this larger size, following UV-irradiation of human breast epithelial cells and immunoprecipitation with the 2,5P antibody, we detected the appearance of a &#x0223c;110 kDa P-CTD cleavage fragment in MCF7 and T47D (BRCA1 &#x0002b;/&#x0002b;) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001448-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). To confirm the identity of this CTD fragment, we used comparative immunoprecipitations with 2,5P and a second anti-CTD specific antibody 8WG16, which recognizes both unphosphorylated as well as partially phosphorylated RNAPII CTDs. These anti-CTD antibodies detected the 110 kDa CTD fragment in both of the BRCA1 (&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;) cell lines MCF7 and T47D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001448-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). Interestingly, the P-CTD fragment can be observed in extracts from unirradiated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001448-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>) suggesting that P-CTD cleavage may result from RNAPII pausing and/or spontaneous damage during ongoing transcription. Since treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 was required to detect increased levels of the UV-induced P-CTD fragment in MCF7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001448-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>), this suggests that the P-CTD fragment is targeted by ubiquitination for rapid proteasome degradation following cleavage. Persistence of the P-CTD fragment was also enhanced in MG132 treated yeast cells expressing BRCA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001448-g004">Fig. 4F</xref>). These results suggest that damage-induced P-CTD cleavage is a conserved eukaryotic response.</p></sec><sec id="s2n"><title>Damage-induced P-CTD cleavage is a BRCA1-dependent response</title><p>To determine if P-CTD cleavage was a BRCA1-dependent damage response, we UV-irradiated BRCA1 (&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;) and BRCA1 (&#x02212;/&#x02212;) breast epithelial cells with and without exposure to the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001448-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). RNAPII P-CTD cleavage was observed in UV-irradiated BRCA1 (&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;) cells (MCF7) but not in BRCA1 (&#x02212;/&#x02212;) breast cancer cells (HCC1937) following proteasome inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001448-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). Since treatment with MG132 was required to visualize the UV-induced P-CTD fragment in BRCA1 (&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;) cells, the P-CTD is likely eliminated rapidly via the proteasome pathway. To confirm that UV-induced P-CTD cleavage was a BRCA1-dependent process, we ectopically expressed either full-length (wild type) or an internal deletion (&#x00394;M) BRCA1 construct in the BRCA1 mutant cell line HCC1937. Following UV-irradiation and proteasome inhibition with MG132, the P-CTD fragment was only detected in cells expressing the full-length wild type BRCA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001448-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>).

Furthermore, using the N20 antibody that recognizes the N terminus of RPB1, we clearly visualized the reciprocal &#x0223c;180 kDa RPB1 IIb cleavage product (a fragment that cannot be detected with the anti-2,5P antibody) that arises following loss of the P-CTD after DNA damage in HCC1937 cells that express wild type BRCA1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001448.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that UV-induced P-CTD cleavage is mechanistically linked to expression of the wild type BRCA1 protein in human breast epithelial cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In trying to define a fundamental role for BRCA1 in breast cancer, we took advantage of the evolutionary distance between humans and yeast to identify proteins and/or processes that have the ability to interact functionally with BRCA1 in yeast; these BRCA1-interacting partners were identified by finding yeast deletions that suppress BRCA1-induced lethality. For such &#x0201c;targets&#x0201d; to be biologically relevant, the yeast genes and human orthologs would most likely play roles in DNA damage responses and genome stability, and they would have an increased likelihood to physically interact with the BRCA1 protein. We present evidence that fulfills these criteria for proteins in the DSIF complex (SPT4/SPT5). Further, DSIF and other conserved suppressors of BRCA1-induced lethality may be grouped into a temporally linked mRNA signaling/decay pathway that responds to DNA damage encountered by RNAPII in actively transcribing genes at the elongation stage of transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001448-g006">Fig. 6E</xref>).

These results implicate BRCA1 in DNA damage-mediated degradation of elongating RNAPII via cleavage of the P-CTD. The highly conserved nature of the Rpb1p CTD suggested that similar interactions occur in human cells. Our results in human breast cancer cell lines fully support this interpretation. We have shown that P-CTD fragments exist in breast cancer cell lines, are stabilized by proteasome inhibition, and depend upon the presence of wild type BRCA1. Reconstitution of the damage-induced P-CTD accumulation following ectopic expression of wild type BRCA1 in the mutant HCC1937 cell line provides direct evidence for this process.</p><p>Results from ectopic expression in yeast of mutant BRCA1 proteins and from examination of human HCC1937 cells (expressing a carboxy terminal BRCA1 deletion) both point to the BRCT domain of BRCA1 as the mediator of P-CTD cleavage and associated lethality in yeast. Although the BRCA1-BRCT domain is necessary to promote P-CTD cleavage, it is not sufficient. For example, the BRCA1(&#x00394;M) construct (that contains intact RING and BRCT domains) fails to reconstitute BRCA1-induced P-CTD cleavage following DNA damage.

The apparent damage-induced disruption of BRCA1 interaction with RNAPII may reflect degradation of RNAPII following DNA damage, dependent on specific co-factors such as DSIF as suggested in this study.

Our study supports (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001448-g006">Fig. 6E</xref>) an emerging model that human cells employ the RNAPII holoenzyme complex during transcription elongation for DNA damage surveillance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001448-Ljungman1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001448-LindseyBoltz1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref> . In this respect, BRCA1 may act as a sensor of DNA damage to monitor stalling of the transcription apparatus at DNA lesions and, therefore, participates in a transcriptional checkpoint to signal the presence of lesions within actively transcribing genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001448-Aiyar1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>.

Our finding that the human ortholog of Dhh1p (DDX6) interacts with BRCA1 in the cytoplasm at P-bodies following DNA damage also supports such a model (T. Westmoreland and J. Marks, unpublished). The determination that Dhh1p (and its human ortholog, DDX6) is an essential component of processing bodies that are sites of mRNA decay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001448-Sheth1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001448-Cougot1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref> allows us to functionally link transcription elongation arrest by DNA damage to mRNA export and decay through BRCA1 and P-CTD cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001448-g006">Fig. 6E</xref>). Thus BRCA1 may facilitate repair of DNA damage by mediating P-CTD cleavage and subsequent degradation of stalled transcription complexes to allow enhanced access of repair complexes to the lesion site. This model also accommodates reports that BRCA1 participates in transcription-coupled repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001448-Abbott1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001448-LePage1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref> and is supported by the finding that overexpression of hTREX84 and dysregulation of mRNA export may be a hallmark of breast tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001448-Guo1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Taken together our data support BRCA1 playing a critical role in a novel checkpoint pathway that senses DNA damage within actively transcribed DNA to initiate cleavage and degradation of stalled RNAPII elongation complexes. Furthermore, our results showing BRCA1-BRCT function is required for the rapid alkylation-induced degradation of BRCA1-SPT5 and RNAPII suggests that chemotherapeutic treatments utilizing alkylating agents may be clinically effective for treating breast cancers in which BRCA1-mediated degradation is defective. Moreover, the use of proteasome inhibitors in concert with alkylating agents may be equally effective for treating those breast cancers in which the damage-induced BRCA1-SPT5-RNAPII degradation pathway remains intact. Defects in this conserved BRCA1-dependent RNAPII cleavage and degradation pathway may be critical for the initiation of breast or ovarian cancer, predicting that genetic defects in other conserved components of this pathway may also contribute to these diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Strain and plasmid constructs</title><p>Unless otherwise stated, WT and deletion strains are in the diploid BY4743 strain background.
