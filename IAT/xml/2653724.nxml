In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, transposons are heavily methylated at both CG and non-CG sites, whereas the non-CG methylation is rarely found in active genes. Our previous genetic analysis suggested that a jmjC domain-containing protein IBM1 (increase in <italic>BONSAI</italic> methylation 1) prevents ectopic deposition of non-CG methylation, and this process is necessary for normal <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> development. Here, we directly determined the genomic targets of IBM1 through high-resolution genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation. The <italic>ibm1</italic> mutation induced extensive hyper-methylation in thousands of genes. Transposons were unaffected. Notably, long transcribed genes were most severely affected. Methylation of genes is limited to CG sites in wild type, but CHG sites were also methylated in the <italic>ibm1</italic> mutant. The <italic>ibm1</italic>-induced hyper-methylation did not depend on previously characterized components of the RNAi-based DNA methylation machinery. Our results suggest novel transcription-coupled mechanisms to direct genic methylation not only at CG but also at CHG sites. IBM1 prevents the CHG methylation in genes, but not in transposons.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>IBM1</kwd><kwd>transposon</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transposons and repeats, which are major deleterious constituents in genomes of vertebrates and plants, are epigenetically silenced by DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Yoder <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Walsh <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Miura <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Singer <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Kato <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bender, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Chan <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Gehring and Henikoff, 2007</xref>). A central question in epigenetics is how the methylation machinery distinguishes between transposons and cellular genes.</p><p>The flowering plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> serves as a powerful model system to understand control of DNA methylation through genetic and genomic approaches. Genome-wide analyses of DNA methylation in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> reveal that transposons are heavily methylated at both CG and non-CG sites, whereas the methylation in genes is at much lower level and limited to CG sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Lippman <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Zilberman <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Cokus <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Lister <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://neomorph.salk.edu/epigenome.html">http://neomorph.salk.edu/epigenome.html</ext-link>). The methylation at CG sites is maintained by DNA methyltransferase MET1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Finnegan <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Kankel <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Saze <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). Methylation at non-CG sites depends on DNA methyltransferases CMT3 and DRM2; the former mainly methylates symmetrical CHG sites, whereas the latter can methylate asymmetrical CHH sites (H can be A, C, or T) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Bartee <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Lindroth <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Cao and Jacobsen, 2002</xref>). CMT3-dependent CHG methylation is guided by methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Jackson <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Malagnac <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). H3K9me is an epigenetic mark of silent &#x02018;heterochromatin' conserved from plants to fungi and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bender, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Chan <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Grewal and Elgin, 2007</xref>). DNA methylation at specific sequence can be induced by RNA of homologous sequence. This process, called RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM), requires <italic>de novo</italic> methylase DRM2, members of RNAi machinery, such as RDR2, DCL3, AGO4, RNA polymerase IV, as well as a putative chromatin remodeller (DRD1) and an SMC-domain containing protein (DMS3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Chan <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Matzke <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Kanno <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). The RdDM generally affects CG, CHG, and CHH sites, and the CHH methylation is normally associated with small RNA, consistent with the involvement of RNAi machinery.</p><p>In addition to these well-investigated positive regulators of DNA methylation, negative regulators of DNA methylation have been recently identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Agius <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Gehring <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Saze <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Through a genetic screen for mutants with increased methylation of a gene called <italic>BONSAI</italic>, we have previously identified the jumonji-domain-containing protein IBM1 (increase in <italic>BONSAI</italic> methylation 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Saze and Kakutani, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Saze <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). IBM1 is a member of the JHDM2/KDM3 family, which is comprised of demethylases of H3K9me conserved from plants to mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Klose <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Lu <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Sun and Zhou, 2008</xref>). The <italic>ibm1</italic> mutation induces a variety of developmental abnormalities, which are suppressed by mutants of the histone H3K9 methylase KYP/SUVH4 gene and CHG methylase CMT3 gene. The results suggest that ectopic deposition of the chromatin marks, H3K9me and CHG methylation, is responsible for the <italic>ibm1</italic>-induced developmental abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Saze <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). However, actual genomic targets of the IBM1 protein have not been identified, with the exception of the <italic>BONSAI</italic> gene. The spectrum of genomic targets of IBM1 remained unknown.</p><p>Here, we directly determined genomic targets of IBM1 by high-resolution genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation. The <italic>ibm1</italic> mutation induced extensive hyper-methylation in thousands of genes throughout the euchromatic chromosomal arm regions. The hyper-methylation was specific for CHG sites within genes. Unexpectedly, long transcribed genes were most severely affected. The results suggest that not only CG but also CHG methylation in the genes is directed by transcription-coupled mechanisms. We propose that IBM1 protects transcribed genes from the CHG methylation and maintains genome integrity by distinguishing between genes and transposons.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation revealed targets of IBM1 protein</title><p>To understand the mode and significance of the control of DNA methylation by the IBM1 protein, we determined DNA methylation across the whole genome in the <italic>ibm1</italic> mutant. For that purpose, we adapted a genomic tiling array method combined with immunoprecipitation of the genomic DNA using an anti-methylcytosine antibody. The methylation level was assessed by the hybridization signal ratio of immunoprecipitated DNA to the input DNA. Pericentromeric regions, which are rich in transposons and repeats, show more methylation signal than the gene-rich chromosome arms in the wild-type sample, as has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Lippman <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Zilberman <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Cokus <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Lister <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Compared with the wild type, the <italic>ibm1</italic> mutation caused a global increase in the signal intensity over the entire chromosome arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A and B</xref>).</p><p>At higher resolution, the comparison revealed that the <italic>ibm1-</italic>induced hyper-methylation is not uniform within the arms. Interestingly, each region of increased DNA methylation coincides with a transcription unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figures S2&#x02013;S13</xref>). We therefore calculated the methylation level for each transcription unit based on the recent annotation of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome (TAIR7: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.arabidopsis.org">http://www.arabidopsis.org</ext-link>). When <italic>ibm1</italic> and wild type were compared, thousands of genes showed a significant increase in DNA methylation signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). On the other hand, transposons did not show comparable changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C and E</xref>). In independent experiments using different plants and different probe amplification methods, the wild-type and <italic>ibm1</italic> samples showed consistent results for each gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). For further analysis, we selected 3112 genes (651 species of class I genes and 2461 class II genes; with stronger effects in class I genes) that reproducibly showed the most dense increase in methylation signal induced by the <italic>ibm1</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>).</p><p>To validate the tiling array results, DNA methylation was determined at the nucleotide level by the bisulphite sequencing method for 12 loci (6 class I genes, 3 class II genes, and 3 transposons). For all the examined class I and II genes, the bisulphite sequencing confirmed the increase in DNA methylation detected by the tiling array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figures S2&#x02013;S10</xref>); extensive hyper-methylation was noted. The bisulphite sequencing results also revealed that the increase in DNA methylation was mainly at CHG sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). This sequence specificity contrasts with genic methylation in wild type, which is almost exclusively at CG sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Cokus <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Lister <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://neomorph.salk.edu/epigenome.html">http://neomorph.salk.edu/epigenome.html</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B, G&#x02013;M</xref>). Both sense and antisense strands of the genes were affected similarly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B, E and G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figures S2&#x02013;S4</xref>). On the other hand, transposons were methylated at CG, CHG, and CHH sites already in wild type, and this methylation was not affected by the <italic>ibm1</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2N&#x02013;P</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figures S11&#x02013;S13</xref>). The bisulphite sequencing data confirmed that the targets of the <italic>IBM1</italic> function were not transposons but genes, as was suggested from the tiling array results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, another class of negative regulators of DNA methylation has been identified; DEMETER, ROS1, DML1, and DML2 are structurally related DNA demethylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Agius <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Gehring <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Triple mutation of <italic>ros1</italic>, <italic>dml1</italic>, and <italic>dml2</italic> (<italic>rdd</italic>) causes increased methylation in &#x0223c;200 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Penterman <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Lister <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). The <italic>rdd</italic> triple mutation can induce hyper-methylation in the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; regions of the gene. In contrast, the <italic>ibm1</italic> mutation most severely affected the central region of transcription units, whereas the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; terminal regions were least affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). This bias is similar to the distribution of genic CG methylation in wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Zilberman <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). In the <italic>ibm1</italic> mutant, the bias was enhanced by including extensive CHG methylation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Long transcribed genes were most severely affected by the ibm1 mutation</title><p>Each transcription unit seems to be affected in a coordinated manner; some transcription units are affected over the entire gene, whereas others are not affected at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2A and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figures S2&#x02013;S13</xref>). This possibility was examined quantitatively by comparing the effects of the <italic>ibm1</italic> mutation between the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; halves of a transcription unit. This analysis revealed that they indeed behave in a coordinated manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S14</xref>). The correlation between the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; halves of a transcription unit was significant (<italic>r</italic>=0.67). In other words, when the <italic>ibm1</italic> mutation affected the 5&#x02032; half of one gene, then the 3&#x02032; half of that gene tended to be affected as well. This behaviour was not simply due to the spread of hyper-methylation to nearby sequences, because the correlation with flanking regions outside the gene was much lower; <italic>r</italic>=0.29 for the 5&#x02032; regions and <italic>r</italic>=0.36 for the 3&#x02032; regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S14</xref>).</p><p>In wild-type plants, moderately transcribed genes are most likely to be methylated, whereas genes at either extreme with regard to the expression level are less likely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Zilberman <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Notably, the <italic>ibm1</italic> mutation affected moderately transcribed genes and constitutively expressed genes most severely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A&#x02013;D</xref>). The spectrum of affected genes was consistent with that seen for genic CG methylation in wild type, and the methylation was also found at CHG sites in the <italic>ibm1</italic> mutant. In addition, some genes unmethylated in wild type also showed hyper-methylation in the <italic>ibm1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2D&#x02013;F</xref>). Interestingly, genes unmethylated in wild type and hyper-methylated in <italic>ibm1</italic> were also transcribed in wild type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S15</xref>). Overall, the methylation of transcribed genes was much enhanced by the <italic>ibm1</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Another notable feature of the effect of the <italic>ibm1</italic> mutation is that longer genes showed a much stronger response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). For genes longer than 5 kb, about two-thirds belong to <italic>ibm1</italic>-affected genes in class I or II, and the class I genes were enriched more than 10-fold compared with the total population of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>). As short genes tend to have fewer introns, we examined whether the intron number mediates the effect of the gene length on <italic>ibm1</italic>-induced hyper-methylation. However, even within the genes of the same intron number, longer genes tend to be affected severely by the <italic>ibm1</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S16</xref>).</p><p>The severe response of long genes was less evident in genes with low levels of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5D</xref>), suggesting that the effect of the gene length on the response to the <italic>ibm1</italic> mutation also depends on the transcription.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The ibm1-induced CHG methylation did not depend on previously characterized RNAi-based components for DNA methylation</title><p>The results presented above suggest that the genic methylation of both CG and CHG sites can be induced by transcription-coupled mechanisms, and that the latter is masked by the function of IBM1 protein, which contributes to the differential methylation of genes and transposons. A question would be how transcription could affect genic methylation. A change in the chromatin state might be induced by passage of the transcription machinery itself, or by the action of the resultant transcript.</p><p>For possible effects of the RNA on chromatin states, the most extensively studied system in plants is RdDM, which is connected to small RNA. We therefore tested whether known components of the RdDM process, namely, DRM2, RDR2, RDR6, AGO4, and NRPD1a, are necessary for the <italic>ibm1</italic>-induced hyper-methylation or not. Methylation in the double mutants was examined for two target genes of IBM1, <italic>BONSAI</italic> and <italic>ERL2</italic> (<italic>ERECTA-LIKE 2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S17</xref>). Interestingly, in all the double mutants, the <italic>ibm1</italic>-induced hyper-methylation was detected. The results suggest that the <italic>ibm1</italic>-induced CHG methylation does not depend on any of these previously characterized RNAi-based components of the DNA methylation machinery. Taken together, these results suggest that novel transcription-coupled mechanisms direct genic methylation not only at CG but also at CHG sites.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we determined genomic targets of the jmjC domain protein IBM1 by genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation. The <italic>ibm1</italic> loss-of-function mutation induced extensive hyper-methylation in thousands of genes. Long transcribed genes were most severely affected. Methylation of transcribed genes is limited to CG sites in wild type, but those genes were also methylated at CHG sites in the <italic>ibm1</italic> mutant. Thus, the IBM1 protein prevents CHG methylation of transcribed genes. These observations broaden our understanding of the control of genic methylation, but important questions remain, as illustrated below.</p><sec disp-level="2"><title>Why are long and transcribed genes body-methylated?</title><p>It has been shown previously that transcribed genes tend to be body-methylated at CG sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Zilberman <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Here, we report that, without the IBM1 function, transcribed genes are also body-methylated at CHG sites. For the body methylation of transcribed genes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Zilberman <italic>et al</italic> (2007)</xref> proposed that disruption of chromatin during the passage of transcription machinery allows activation of cryptic promoters, resulting in aberrant transcript formation, and subsequent DNA methylation. With regard to the <italic>ibm1</italic>-induced hyper-methylation of gene body, the entire transcription unit behaved in a coordinated manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S14</xref>). If sporadic events, such as activation of cryptic promoters, affect the entire gene, a long gene would have more chance to initiate such an event. This prediction is consistent with our observation that long genes tend to be affected most severely by the <italic>ibm1</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, our genetic analyses suggest that the <italic>ibm1</italic>-induced hyper-methylation does not depend on previously characterized components of RdDM, which include RNAi machinery and the <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylase DRM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S17</xref>). Even if aberrant RNA is involved in genic methylation, the latter might use an as yet uncharacterized pathway.</p><p>Alternatively, the passage of transcription machinery itself, rather than the RNA produced, might mediate a change in the chromatin state and facilitate gene body methylation. In yeast, transcription machinery can be associated with histone methylases, such as SET1 and SET2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Krogan <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Ng <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). SET2-induced H3K36 methylation recruits histone deacetylase complex, which negatively regulates the transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Keogh <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Similar mechanisms might also be used for generating repressive histone marks such as H3K9me directly or indirectly. In addition, passage of transcription machinery can enhance histone replacement, which may also affect chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Martin and Zhang, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>ibm1</italic> mutation induces genic CHG methylation, which is rarely found in wild type. Interestingly, the genic CHG methylation is also induced in the mutant background of CG methylase gene <italic>MET1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Cokus <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Lister <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). The CHG methylation in the <italic>met1</italic> mutant might function to rescue the deleterious effects of the loss of the CG methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Mathieu <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). We compared the spectrum of genes showing CHG methylation between the <italic>met1</italic> and <italic>ibm1</italic> mutants. The correlation was found to be significant between genes showing CHG hyper-methylation in <italic>ibm1</italic> and genes with CG hypo-methylation and CHG hyper-methylation in the <italic>met1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S18</xref>), suggesting that <italic>IBM1</italic> might be linked to a compensatory methylation pathway induced by CG hypo-methylation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Is the CHG hyper-methylation sufficient for silencing the gene?</title><p>Considering the large impact of the <italic>ibm1</italic> mutation on gene body methylation shown in this study, it may be surprising that effects of the <italic>ibm1</italic> mutation on developmental phenotypes are not catastrophic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Saze <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Indeed, in our preliminary results on gene expression, the CHG hyper-methylation of gene body induced by the <italic>ibm1</italic> mutation is not always associated with transcriptional silencing. Within the genes hyper-methylated by <italic>ibm1</italic> mutation, some showed a decrease in the transcript level, whereas others were unaffected or even showed an increased expression (unpublished). On the other hand, in the wild-type background, non-CG methylation is not found in active genes, but found only in silent transposons and repeats. Of the transposon-specific non-CG methylation, CHG methylation is connected to H3K9me (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Jackson <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Malagnac <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>), whereas CHH methylation is associated with small RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Matzke <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). If CHG methylation is not sufficient for the gene silencing, interaction and/or collaboration with other layers of epigenetic modifications might be important for generating silent heterochromatin.</p><p>In this context, it may be interesting that double mutant of the <italic>IBM1</italic> gene and a chromatin remodelling gene <italic>DDM1</italic> (<italic>decrease in DNA methylation 1</italic>) shows much more severe developmental phenotypes than either single mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Saze <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). As is the case for the <italic>ibm1</italic> mutation, the <italic>ddm1</italic> mutation induces methylation of the <italic>BONSAI</italic> gene. Unlike <italic>ibm1</italic>, however, <italic>ddm1</italic> mutation causes <italic>BONSAI</italic> hyper-methylation in all the three contexts: CG, CHG, and CHH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Saze and Kakutani, 2007</xref>). In addition, although the <italic>ddm1</italic>-induced <italic>BONSAI</italic> methylation depends on the presence of a LINE retrotransposon nearby (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Saze and Kakutani, 2007</xref>), our genome-wide analysis revealed that genes affected by the <italic>ibm1</italic> mutation are not necessarily located near transposons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Targets of IBM1 are low copy genes, and repetitive sequences were unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2</xref>). On the other hand, the direct targets of the <italic>DDM1</italic> gene appears to be repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Vongs <italic>et al</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Lippman <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>), and the effect of <italic>ddm1</italic> mutations on low copy sequences, such as <italic>BONSAI</italic>, might be indirect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Saze and Kakutani, 2007</xref>). Even if <italic>ibm1</italic> and <italic>ddm1</italic> mutations trigger the hyper-methylation by different mechanisms, these pathways may converge on overlapping targets, with possible interactions of different layers of epigenetic marks. The possible interactions may be clarified at the genome level by combination of genomics and genetics using these and other <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutations.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Plant materials</title><p>Isolation and initial characterization of the <italic>ibm1</italic> mutants were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Saze <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>).
