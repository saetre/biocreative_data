However, GR may also exert acute effects, including activation of signaling kinases such as c-Src and protein kinase B, possibly via the scaffold protein, modulator of nongenomic action of the estrogen receptor (MNAR). MNAR inhibited GR transactivation in A549 cells, but in HEK293 cells there was a ligand concentration-dependent biphasic effect. Transactivation driven by low ligand concentrations was inhibited by MNAR expression, whereas higher ligand concentrations were potentiating. Further analysis revealed that MNAR inhibited transactivation by the ligand-independent activation function (AF)1 but potentiated the COOH-terminal AF2 domain. The effect of MNAR was independent of c-Src activity, demonstrated by inhibitors and c-Src knockdown studies. In support of the role of MNAR in modulating GR transactivation, coimmunoprecipitation studies showed interaction between MNAR and GR in the nucleus but not the cytoplasm. Furthermore, MNAR and c-Src were also found to physically interact in the nucleus. Immunofluorescence studies showed MNAR to be predominantly a nuclear protein, with significant colocalization with GR. Deletion studies revealed that MNAR 884-1130 was coimmunoprecipitated with GR, and furthermore this fragment inhibited GR transactivation function when overexpressed. In addition, MNAR 1-400, which contains multiple LxxLL motifs, also inhibited GR transactivation. Taken together, MNAR interacts with GR in the nucleus but not cytoplasm and regulates GR transactivation in a complex manner depending on cell type. MNAR is capable of regulating both AF1 and AF2 functions of the GR independently. MNAR expression is likely to mediate important cell variation in glucocorticoid responsiveness, in a c-Src-independent mechanism.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>glucocorticoid receptor</kwd><kwd>modulator of nongenomic action of the estrogen receptor</kwd><kwd>c-Src</kwd><kwd>glucocorticoid</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>The costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges.

Their effects are mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. It is well established that on ligand binding the cytosolic GR translocates to the nucleus and exerts it effects on target genes, either by directly binding to DNA and acting as a transcription factor or by interacting with other transcription factors, including nuclear factor NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>). In addition to this well-characterized pathway, a number of rapid nongenomic actions of Gc have been documented. For example, inhaled Gc rapidly modulate airway reactivity in mild asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>). Gc also rapidly activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the downstream endothelial nitric oxide synthase in vascular endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>) and can also act via a caveolin-dependent mechanism to regulate protein kinase B (Akt), mammalian target of rapamycin, and glycogen S6 kinase 3&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>). Furthermore, it has been shown that a disrupted GR molecule incapable of migrating to the nucleus can inhibit NF-&#x003ba;B activity via an interaction with cytosolic protein kinase A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>). One of the most important anti-inflammatory actions of Gc is to inhibit phospholipase A2 activity and so release arachidonic acid from the plasma membrane, the rate-limiting step in prostaglandin synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>). Phospholipase A2 activity is inhibited by Gc, even in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors and geldanamycin, which acts to impair nuclear localization of GR by antagonizing heat shock proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>). Repression of phospholipase A2 activity by Gc is sensitive to antagonism by RU-486 but also by inhibitors of c-Src kinase, including 4-amino-<italic>S</italic>-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(<italic>t</italic>-butyl)pyrazolo&#x0005b;3,4-d&#x0005d;pyrimidine (PP2). This suggests involvement of c-Src kinase in mediating this rapid action of Gc.</p><p>Nongenomic effects have been reported for other nuclear receptors, including the estrogen receptor (ER; see Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>) and the progesterone receptor (PR; see Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>), which is capable of direct interaction with c-Src through its NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal PxxP motif.</p><p>A novel protein, initially termed MNAR for modulator of nongenomic action of the ER and also known as PELP1 (proline, glutamic acid and leucine rich protein 1) is a 110-kDa protein originally identified as a cytosolic binding partner for the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>). This protein has 10 LxxLL motifs and 3 PxxP motifs, suggesting that it may be able to interact with both nuclear receptors and proteins containing SH3 domains such as c-Src. It has previously been shown that ER, AR, and GR interact with MNAR in vitro and that ER and AR also interact with MNAR in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>).</p><p>MNAR has been reported to be present in both cytoplasm and in the nucleus, having a consensus nuclear localization sequence between amino acids 639 and 643 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>). MNAR itself lacks enzymatic activity; therefore, its mode of action has been proposed to be a scaffold bringing together c-Src and nuclear receptors, thereby allowing cross-coupling of the two signaling cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>). In addition to a cytoplasmic role, MNAR has also been reported to be localized in the nucleus and to have effects on gene transcription.</p><p>The current study explored the functional interactions between MNAR and the GR. We found interactions between the GR and MNAR in the nucleus only and found that overexpression of MNAR in A549 cells leads to impaired GR transactivation. However, further delineation of this effect in HEK cells found that this repressive effect was mediated through the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal domain of the GR. Surprisingly, loss of the GR NH<sub>2</sub> terminus showed transactivational enhancement by MNAR overexpression. Further studies of the MNAR molecule identified two regions that were responsible for inhibiting transactivation of the GR, namely the 400 amino acids in the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus but also the COOH-terminal proline-rich region.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Reagents.</title><p>Dexamethasone, RU-486, radicicol, normal rabbit serum, BSA, mouse IgG, and Protein G agarose were obtained from Sigma.

This inhibitory effect was greater with increased MNAR expression (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>), as noted previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>).</p><p>To determine the primary target for the regulatory effect of MNAR, deletion studies of the two GR transactivation domains were performed in the HEK cell line (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). Although A549 cells express endogenous GR, HEK cells only express the GR at very low level. However, we observed activation of our reporter gene at higher concentrations of dexamethasone (&#x0003e;1 nM), and so all studies using the GR deletants employed concentrations of dexamethasone shown to have no effect on transactivation in the absence of cotransfected GR (pcDNA3 study; <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>).</p><p>In the HEK cells, MNAR exerted a repressive effect on the transcriptional activity of full-length GR at low concentrations of dexamethasone, but paradoxically, potentiated transactivation at higher concentrations of ligand (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>). This effect was robust and reproducible.</p><p>Analysis of the isolated NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal transactivation domain (N500) showed that MNAR exerted a consistent repressive activity, and, as expected, there was no effect on activity from ligand binding. In contrast, deletion of the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal AF1 domain (&#x00394;AF1) resulted in a construct that activated the reporter gene in a ligand-dependent fashion, but whose effect was also potentiated at all concentrations of Gc by MNAR expression (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>). Thus MNAR can act either to inhibit transactivation through the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus of GR or to potentiate transactivation through the COOH terminal of GR. Its actions on full-length GR are critically dependent on the concentration of ligand, with higher concentrations allowing the potentiation effect to predominate (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>The role of c-Src in MNAR function.</title><p>Previous studies have suggested at the action of MNAR as a scaffolding protein, whereby it acts as a mediator in bringing nuclear hormone receptors and c-Src into close proximity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>).</p><p>To explore the role of c-Src in mediating the effects of MNAR on GR function, c-Src activation was measured in parallel with activation of Akt and Ser<sup>211</sup> phosphorylation of GR (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The kinetics for these events are similar, with a rise in c-Src kinase activity that was apparent within minutes, and persisted for at least 60 min (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>C</italic></xref>). Of the Src family of kinases, c-Src was the only member to be detectable in A549 cells by immunoblot analysis, by comparison with control A431 cells (data not shown).</p><p>Initial studies to reduce the protein level of c-Src used transfection of small-interfering RNA oligonucleotides. Although c-Src expression was reduced by 50&#x00025;, there was no change in the repression observed with MNAR expression (data not shown). To ensure that the duration of knockdown was optimal for the observed effect, a separate experiment utilizing pharmacological inhibition was performed, using PP2 and SU-6656 at concentrations shown to inhibit kinase activity of c-Src (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>D</italic></xref>). Again, there was no impact on the repressive effect of MNAR expression on reporter gene activity MNAR (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>E</italic></xref>). Finally, a series of stable cell lines expressing a short-hairpin RNA directed against c-Src were generated (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>). We compared one clone with wild-type c-Src expression (clone 5.18), a clone generated using the control vector that also had wild-type c-Src expression (pSUPER), and a matched knockdown clone (clone 5.19). Again, there was no effect of reducing c-Src protein levels on the MNAR inhibition of GR transactivation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Physical interactions between GR and MNAR.</title><p>To explore interactions between the GR and MNAR within the cell, a series of immunoprecipitations was performed. Because the intracellular location of MNAR remains unclear with reports of both cytoplasmic and nuclear localization, we performed the interaction studies in fractionated cell lysates. The purity of each fraction was routinely determined by immunoblotting for &#x003b1;-tubulin and histone H3, markers for cytoplasm and nucleus respectively (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>).</p><p>Immunoprecipitation with antibodies against MNAR specifically coimmunopreciptated GR, but only in the nuclear fraction and in a ligand-dependent manner. Interestingly, the MNAR antibody also brought down c-Src but, again, only in the nuclear fraction (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>). In contrast, there were clearly abundant GR and c-Src present in the cytoplasmic fraction, suggesting that the interaction between the proteins was only occurring in the nucleus.</p><p>A similar pattern of interaction was seen when the cell fractions were immunoprecipitated for GR (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>C</italic></xref>). Again, there was evidence for interaction between GR and MNAR selectively in the nuclear fraction, although this did not appear to be altered by ligand treatment. There was no convincing, nor consistent, direct interaction observed between the GR and c-Src in the nuclear or the cytoplasmic fraction (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>C</italic></xref>, compare control immunoprecipitate of nuclear fraction against GR immunoprecipitate).</p><p>Because subcellular fractionation may allow postlysis partition of proteins, we also examined the intracellular localization of MNAR and GR using immunofluorescence (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). MNAR was predominantly localized within the nucleus and was unaffected by Gc treatment (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>). The GR was observed to be both cytoplasmic and nuclear in the absence of ligand, but, following Gc treatment, a typical intense nucleus stain was seen with characteristic nucleolar exclusion, as previously reported (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>A</italic></xref>). Coimmunofluorescence studies revealed significant colocalization of GR and MNAR in the nucleus, both in treated and untreated cells, but with a greater degree of colocalization observed after dexamethasone treatment (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>A</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>MNAR functional domain analysis.</title><p>A number of functional domains within MNAR have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>). To determine which of these domains is important for mediating the transcriptional repressive effect, a series of deletion mutants was tested (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>A</italic></xref>).</p><p>GST pull-down assays revealed that the MNAR 884-1130 fragment efficiently interacted with the GR, despite all MNAR constructs being expressed to a similar degree in HEK cells (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>B</italic></xref>).</p><p>To identify a functional correlation for this interaction, the MNAR fragments were expressed in A549 cells where their effect on the transactivation function of endogenous GR was assessed. There was an interaction between MNAR 884-1130 and GR, with inhibition of transactivation. In addition, there was inhibition of transactivation observed with MNAR 1-400, the region containing LxxLL motifs (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>C</italic>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Interactions between steroid receptors and c-Src have received much attention in recent times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>). In particular, the interactions between the PR or the ER with c-Src have been well studied. PR has an SH3 domain located at its extreme NH<sub>2</sub> terminus that is capable of directly interacting with c-Src (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>). This domain is not conserved among other steroid receptors, but ER has been found to functionally interact with c-Src via MNAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>), and the transactivation activity of GR has been reported to be opposed by MNAR expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>). In this study, the functional interactions between MNAR and GR transactivation were studied.</p><p>There was a marked inhibition of GR transactivation observed when MNAR was overexpressed in A549 cells. In previous studies, MNAR has variously been reported to either inhibit or to potentiate steroid receptor-driven gene transactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>). This may reflect differences between cell types studied, as well as the potential presence of other steroid receptor comodulator proteins. Therefore, to explore this MNAR-dependent inhibition of transactivation, a series of studies was performed using isolated GR transactivation domains, using the GR-deficient HEK293 cell line. Initial experiments showed an unexpectedly heterogeneous pattern of MNAR effect on the transfected wild-type GR. At low concentrations of ligand, MNAR inhibited transactivation, but, at higher concentrations of dexamethasone, MNAR expression potentiated transactivation. Although previous studies had suggested that MNAR was capable of both potentiating and inhibiting transactivation, this is the first report suggesting that it is capable of subserving both actions in the same cells. Higher concentrations of dexamethasone were not used in HEK cells with the TAT3 reporter gene, since they resulted in activation of low levels of endogenous, full-length, wild-type GR, thereby risking confounding the results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>).</p><p>Studies on the constitutively active N500 GR mutant showed that MNAR robustly inhibited transactivation by &#x0003e;50&#x00025;. However, studies on the mutant with isolated COOH-terminal transactivation domain, &#x00394;AF1, showed a consistent potentiation of transactivation by MNAR, increasing with rising ligand concentration. This is reminiscent of the higher ligand concentrations causing MNAR potentiation on the full-length, wild-type GR. Taken together, these data suggest that the ligand-independent NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal transactivation domain is inhibited by MNAR, whereas the COOH-terminal AF2 transactivation domain can be potentiated. The biphasic effect of MNAR expression on wild-type GR is likely to result from the differing contributions of the two transactivation domains seen at different concentrations of ligand, with the modulator of nongenomic action of the estrogen receptorminal transactivation domain predominating at low concentrations of ligand.</p><p>The ligand-activated GR is predominantly nuclear in location, but previous reports noted interactions between nuclear hormone receptors and MNAR occurring in the cytoplasm; therefore, the compartment of GR-MNAR interaction was explored. The intracellular localization of MNAR remains unclear, with reports in the literature suggesting both a cytoplasmic site of action as well as expression and action in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>). Accordingly, we prepared cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts from cells and conducted a series of immunoprecipitations. There was clear evidence of interaction between GR and MNAR in the nucleus but no evidence of an interaction in the cytoplasm. We were also able to detect interactions between MNAR and c-Src, again predominately in the nuclear extracts. This suggests that, although GR and MNAR are capable of interaction, the interaction occurs predominately in the nucleus rather than in the cytoplasm. Although there is evidence for interaction between MNAR and c-Src, this also appears to be mainly in the nucleus. There is a weak interaction between GR and c-Src that was only seen in response to ligand and exclusively in the cytoplasm. Therefore, there appears to be a hierarchy of interactions, with GR-MNAR interactions predominantly occurring in the nucleus, whereas GR and c-Src appear to interact only weakly in the cytoplasm. Taken together, this suggests that the interaction between c-Src and GR is independent of MNAR scaffolding. It further suggests that the pool of MNAR molecules binding GR is different from that binding c-Src.</p><p>The predominant nuclear colocalization of GR and MNAR is well seen in immunofluorescence studies that show very clear overlap of intracellular distribution of MNAR and GR in the nucleus, following dexamethasone administration. In the absence of ligand treatment, the GR distribution is seen across the cell; however, there is still very little overlap in distribution between GR and MNAR in the cytoplasm. In fact, coimmunofluorescence for MNAR and tubulin also shows very little of the total cellular MNAR to be present in the cytoplasm.</p><p>Despite applying two different genetic approaches and also pharmacological inhibition of c-Src, we were unable to show a role for c-Src in mediating the effects of MNAR on GR function. Thus the actions of MNAR on the GR in the nucleus appear to be independent of c-Src, a functional outcome entirely compatible with the failure to identify physical interactions between all three proteins in the cell nucleus.</p><p>The MNAR protein contains a number of discrete domains, the functions of which have been explored previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>). We exploited these observations to identify MNAR domains capable of physically interacting with the GR. Predictions based on the MNAR sequence would have suggested that the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus of MNAR, which harbors 10 sequential LxxLL motifs, would be capable of physically interacting with GR, whereas the COOH terminus, with proline- and glutamic acid-rich regions, may not. However, studies using cotransfection followed by GST pulldown identified that the MNAR fragment from amino acids 884 to 1130 coprecipitated significantly more GR than any of the other fragments expressed. This suggests that the 884-1130 fragment is capable of physically interacting with full-length GR.</p><p>Nevertheless, the failure to identify an interaction between GR and MNAR fragment 1-400, as predicted, does not necessarily exclude the presence of an unstable, or weak, interaction. Therefore, we also conducted a series of functional studies. Two fragments clearly and significantly inhibited transactivation. The first of these was the fragment 884-1130, the same fragment that we found to be capable of physically interacting and coprecipitating the GR in earlier analysis. The second fragment capable of replicating the inhibition was fragment 1-400, which contains the majority of the LxxLL motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>).</p><p>MNAR appears capable of interacting independently with both NH<sub>2</sub> and COOH termini of GR to mediate its effects. There are precedents for transcriptional comodulators acting both to potentiate GR transactivation and also acting to inhibit transactivation; for example GR interacting protein-1 potentiates GR-dependent transactivation through a consensus GRE motif but mediates the transcriptional inhibitory activity of GR when tethered to NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>). This change of role has been ascribed to the allosteric effect transmitted by the DNA-binding domain of GR. We now show that MNAR is similarly capable of modulating GR transactivation in a positive and negative manner, partly dependent on cell line, context, and on ambient Gc concentration. Understanding the functional interaction between MNAR and GR has major implications for understanding Gc action and, furthermore, the variation in Gc sensitivity seen in conditions of altered physiological status, for example, in inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>GRANTS</title><p>This project was supported by the Wellcome Trust.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><name><surname>Barletta</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name>, Wong CW, McNally C, Komm BS, Katzenellenbogen B, Cheskis BJ.

All truncated MNAR plasmids were produced in the pEBG vector, with the GST tag on the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus. <italic>B</italic>: HEK cells were transfected overnight with plasmids for human GR&#x003b1; and various truncated forms of MNAR, and incubated with 100 nM dexamethasone before harvest. Cells were lysed in NETN buffer and then incubated for 4 h with glutathione beads. Beads were washed 5 times with NETN and then resuspended in 6&#x000d7; Laemmli buffer. Pulled-down protein complexes were run out by PAGE, transferred on a PVDF membrane, and then probed using antibodies against GR (top <italic>panel</italic>) or GST (<italic>bottom</italic>). The GST fusions all migrated at the expected molecular mass. <italic>C</italic>: A549 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing truncated MNAR protein, TAT3 reporter, and <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase. Cells were treated with dexamethasone (10 nM) overnight, and then luciferase activity was measured. The experiment was repeated two times, and the error bars represent the SD of each point, done in triplicate (t-test, &#x0002a;<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.005).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zh10100854440007"></graphic></fig></floats-wrap></article>
