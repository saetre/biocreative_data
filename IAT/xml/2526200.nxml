We have previously demonstrated in animals and humans that endothelium-derived hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is an EDHF that is produced in part by endothelial NO synthase (eNOS). In this study, we show that genetic disruption of all three NOS isoforms (neuronal [nNOS], inducible [iNOS], and endothelial [eNOS]) abolishes EDHF responses in mice. The contribution of the NOS system to EDHF-mediated responses was examined in eNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, n/eNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, and n/i/eNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. EDHF-mediated relaxation and hyperpolarization in response to acetylcholine of mesenteric arteries were progressively reduced as the number of disrupted NOS genes increased, whereas vascular smooth muscle function was preserved. Loss of eNOS expression alone was compensated for by other NOS genes, and endothelial cell production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and EDHF-mediated responses were completely absent in n/i/eNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, even after antihypertensive treatment with hydralazine. NOS uncoupling was not involved, as modulation of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH<sub>4</sub>) synthesis had no effect on EDHF-mediated relaxation, and the BH<sub>4</sub>/dihydrobiopterin (BH<sub>2</sub>) ratio was comparable in mesenteric arteries and the aorta. These results provide the first evidence that EDHF-mediated responses are dependent on the NOSs system in mouse mesenteric arteries.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: ACh, acetylcholine; BH<sub>2</sub>, dihydrobiopterin; BH<sub>4</sub>, tetrahydrobiopterin; Cu,Zn-SOD, copper, zinc-superoxide dismutase; DAHP, 2,4-diamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine; DCF, 2&#x02032;,7&#x02032;-dichlorodihydro-fluorescein diacetate; DHE, dihydroethidium; EDHF, endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor; eNOS, endothelial NOS; GPx, glutathione peroxidase; GTPCH1, GTP cyclohydrolase-1; iNOS, inducible NOS; K<sub>Ca</sub>, calcium-activated potassium; <sc>l</sc>-NNA, N&#x003c9;-nitro-<sc>l</sc>-arginine; NO, nitric oxide; NOS; NO synthase; nNOS, neuronal NOS; PGI<sub>2</sub>, prostacyclin; SNP, sodium nitroprusside; VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cell.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>The endothelium plays an important role in maintaining vascular homeostasis by synthesizing and releasing several vasodilators, including prostacyclin (PGI<sub>2</sub>), nitric oxide (NO), and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). It is widely accepted that EDHF plays an important role in modulating vascular tone, especially in microvessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). Since the first reports on the existence of EDHF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>), several candidates for EDHF have been proposed, including epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>), potassium ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>), gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>), and, as we have identified, hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). We have demonstrated that endothelium-derived H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is an EDHF in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>) and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>) mesenteric arteries and porcine coronary microvessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Other investigators have subsequently confirmed the importance of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as an EDHF in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>) and canine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>) coronary microvessels and piglet pial arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). We have also demonstrated that endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) is a major source of EDHF/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>), where copper, zinc-superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD) plays an important role to dismutate eNOS-derived superoxide anions to EDHF/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in animals and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). However, the mechanism for the endothelial production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as an endogenous EDHF remains to be elucidated. Indeed, some EDHF-mediated responses still remain in singly eNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, and the remaining responses are also sensitive to catalase that dismutates H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to form water and oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>).</p><p>NO is synthesized by three distinct NOS isoforms (neuronal NOS [nNOS], inducible [iNOS], and eNOS) that compensate each other. Although both eNOS and nNOS are constitutively expressed, iNOS is usually expressed in the context of inflammatory responses, such as sepsis, cytokine release, and heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). In the vasculature, eNOS is a well-established primary source of NO that plays an important role in the regulation of systemic blood pressure, blood flow, and regional vascular tone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>), whereas NO derived from nNOS or iNOS also plays an important role in vasodilatation and vascular protection under various pathological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). A critical determinant of NOS activity is the availability of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH<sub>4</sub>), a NOS cofactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). When BH<sub>4</sub> levels are inadequate, the enzymatic reduction of molecular oxygen by NOS is no longer coupled to <sc>l</sc>-arginine oxidation, resulting in generation of superoxide anions rather than NO, thus contributing to vascular oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction. BH<sub>4</sub> bioavailability in the vasculature appears to be regulated at the level of biosynthesis by the rate-limiting enzyme GTP cyclohydrolase-1 (GTPCH1). In contrast, administration of the BH<sub>4</sub> precursor sepiapterin ameliorates endothelial dysfunction in ApoE-deficent mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>).</p><p>We have recently generated n/i/eNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, which are unexpectedly viable and appear normal, but their survival and fertility rates are markedly reduced compared with WT mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). They also exhibit marked hypotonic polyuria, polydipsia, and renal unresponsiveness to the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin, all of which are characteristics consistent with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). Furthermore, our recent study indicates that n/i/eNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice spontaneously develop cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, and myocardial infarction, resembling metabolic syndrome in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). These results suggest that NOSs system plays an important role in maintaining homeostasis.</p><p>Both NO- and EDHF-mediated responses are impaired by various risk factors for atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>) and, conversely, the treatments of those risk factors ameliorate both NO- and EDHF-mediated responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). In various pro-atherogenic conditions, the production of reactive oxygen species is increased, whereas NO-mediated relaxations are reduced. EDHF-mediated relaxations are temporarily enhanced to compensate for the reduced NO-mediated relaxations; however, during the progression of atherosclerosis, the EDHF-mediated responses are also subsequently reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>).</p><p>These lines of evidence led us to hypothesize that EDHF-mediated responses are closely coupled to the whole endothelial NOSs system. In this study, we thus examined the contribution of the whole endothelial NOSs system to EDHF-mediated responses, using eNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, n/eNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, and n/i/eNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>).</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Endothelium-dependent relaxations and hyperpolarizations in WT and NOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice</title><p>In mesenteric arteries from WT mice of both genders, endothelium-dependent relaxations in response to acetylcholine (ACh) were highly resistant to indomethacin (10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> M) or N<sup>&#x003c9;</sup>-nitro-<sc>l</sc>-arginine (<sc>l</sc>-NNA; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> M), but were markedly inhibited by a combination of 100 nM charybdotoxin (an inhibitor of large- and intermediate-conductance calcium-activated potassium [K<sub>Ca</sub>] channels) and 1 &#x003bc;M apamin (an inhibitor of small-conductance K<sub>Ca</sub> channels), indicating a primary role of EDHF in endothelium-dependent relaxations in those resistance vessels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and E</xref>).

Thus, the study provides a novel concept on the diverse roles of the endothelial NOSs system to modulate vascular tone, which is apparently dependent on vessel size (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that demonstrates that disruption of certain genes (NOSs) abolishes EDHF-mediated responses.</p><fig position="float" id="fig9"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p><bold>Summary of this study.</bold> NO mediates vascular relaxation of relatively large, conduit arteries (e.g., aorta and epicardial coronary arteries), whereas EDHF plays an important role in modulating vascular tone in small, resistance arteries (e.g., small mesenteric arteries and coronary microvessels). All three NOS isoforms (nNOS, iNOS, and eNOS), especially eNOS, produce NO and superoxide anions, and the latter is dismutated by Cu,Zn-SOD to EDHF/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. EDHF hyperpolarizes VSMCs by opening K<sub>Ca</sub> channels, and then elicits vasodilation. On the other hand, superoxide anions from uncoupled NOSs may not significantly contribute to EDHF-mediated relaxations. Collectively, this study provides a novel concept on the diverse roles of endothelial NOSs system mainly contributing to the EDHF/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> responses in microvessels while serving as NO-generating system in large arteries.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jem2052053f09"></graphic></fig><p>In WT mice, endothelium-dependent relaxations of small mesenteric arteries were mainly mediated by EDHF, whereas those of the aorta were mediated by NO, a finding that is consistent with our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). Interestingly, EDHF-mediated relaxations were progressively reduced in accordance with the number of disrupted NOS genes in mesenteric arteries and were absent in n/i/eNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, indicating that EDHF-mediated relaxations are totally mediated by the endothelial NOSs system in mouse mesenteric arteries.</p><p>In this study, after the classical definition of EDHF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>), we evaluated EDHF-mediated responses in mouse mesenteric arteries in the presence of indomethacin and <sc>l</sc>-NNA. It is known that eNOS generates superoxide anions under normal conditions from reductase domain and only when uncoupled (e.g., BH<sub>4</sub> and/or <sc>l</sc>-arginine depletion) from the oxidase domain, and that <sc>l</sc>-arginine analogues only inhibit the latter process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). Indeed, we were able to demonstrate that endothelial superoxide generation was significantly increased in response to ACh in WT mice, whereas in n/i/eNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, this endothelial production of superoxide to ACh was absent, indicating that superoxide anions derived from NOS leads to endothelial formation of EDHF/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in WT mice. On the other hand, the residual dilation after blocking all three pathways in WT mice was greater than when blocking the same pathways in eNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. It has been reported that <sc>l</sc>-NNA dose not completely inhibit NOSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>). It is thus conceivable that the residual dilation after blocking all three pathways in male WT mice may reflect uninhibited NO-mediated responses.</p><p>In this study, in n/eNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, some EDHF-mediated responses remained. It is known that iNOS is commonly induced by endotoxins and cytokines, producing NO independently of calcium influx. However, it has also been reported that the activation of iNOS requires Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>). Furthermore, in our study, the expression of iNOS in mesentery was significantly increased in n/eNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice compared with WT or eNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. These findings suggest that residual EDHF-mediated dilation in n/eNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice could be caused by Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent iNOS activity.</p><p>It has been reported that in skeletal muscle arterioles of female eNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, EDHF-mediated responses were rather increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>). However, in this study, no such gender-specific differences were noted in the whole range of genotypes of NOSs<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. The discrepancy between the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>) and this study might be caused by the differences in blood vessels used (skeletal muscle arterioles vs. small mesenteric arteries), method of blood vessel preparation used (pressurized vs. nonpressurized) and analysis performed for the EDHF responses (pharmacological analysis alone vs. pharmacological/electrophysiological study).</p><p>The reduced EDHF-mediated responses in NOSs<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice could be caused by mechanism(s) other than reduced production of the factor. First, vasodilator properties of vascular smooth muscle might be impaired in NOSs<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. However, in the NOSs<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice of both genders, endothelium-independent relaxations to NS-1619, a K<sub>Ca</sub> opener, were preserved and those to SNP were rather enhanced, a finding consistent with the previous reports with eNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). Second, the reduced EDHF-mediated responses in n/i/eNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice could be a result of the elevated blood pressure. However, the antihypertensive treatment with hydralazine failed to improve the reduced EDHF-mediated relaxations in those mice. Third, the enhanced production of superoxide anions in n/i/eNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice from intracellular sources other than eNOS might interfere with EDHF responses. Indeed, we have confirmed that cardiac superoxide production is markedly enhanced in our n/i/eNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (unpublished findings) and, in this study, we also noted that the activities of superoxide anion scavenging enzymes, including Cu,Zn-SOD, catalase, and GPx, were all enhanced. This issue needs to be further examined in future studies.</p><p>In this study, in WT mice, the eNOS immunoreactivity was noted mainly in the endothelium of mesenteric arteries, whereas in eNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>and n/eNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, immunoreactivities of other NOSs that had not been disrupted were observed in the endothelium of the blood vessels. In n/i/eNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, none of the NOS isoforms was noted, as expected. These results support our hypothesis that the endothelial NOSs system is substantially involved in EDHF-mediated responses. On the other hand, in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), muscarinic receptors exist and it is possible that ACh might act there to elicit vasomotor responses through EDHF. However, we (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>) confirmed that in endothelium-denuded mesenteric arteries of normal mice, ACh-induced relaxation is absent, indicating that a sufficient amount of functional NOS to cause vasodilation does not exist in VSMC. Furthermore, in this study, the eNOS immunoreactivity was markedly less in the vascular smooth muscle compared with the endothelial layer (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p>The confocal microscopy study with DCF and DHE staining demonstrated that endothelial production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and superoxide in response to ACh was absent in n/i/eNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, further confirming the important role of the endothelial NOSs system in the synthesis of EDHF/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. We have previously demonstrated that catalase-sensitive EDHF responses and endothelial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production still remained in singly eNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). Thus, these findings support our hypothesis that superoxide anions derived from endothelial NOSs system appear to be the main source of EDHF/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production from the endothelium.</p><p>Recent evidence suggests that BH<sub>4</sub>-dependent eNOS uncoupling may be an important mechanism that causes endothelial dysfunction and increased superoxide production in vascular diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>). However, in this study with normal mouse mesenteric arteries, sepiapterin or DAHP had no acute effects on EDHF-mediated relaxations. Furthermore, it has been reported that endothelial production of superoxide anions from eNOS is noted even under physiological conditions in the absence of BH<sub>4</sub> deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). Indeed, in this study, we were able to demonstrate that the BH<sub>4</sub>/BH<sub>2</sub> ratio was comparable between the aorta and mesenteric arteries in WT mice, suggesting that superoxide from physiological (coupled) NOSs is the major source of EDHF/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with preserved BH<sub>4</sub> bioavailability (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>).</p><p>Several limitations should be mentioned for this study. First, in this study, although we were able to demonstrate the diverse roles of endothelial NOSs system depending on the vessel size, the detailed molecular mechanism(s) for it remains to be elucidated in future studies (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). Second, although we were able to demonstrate the endothelial production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and superoxide anions using confocal microscopy with DCF and DHE, respectively, we were unable to quantify the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and superoxide production caused by technical difficulties and limited availability of mesenteric microvessels for the measurement. However, we have previously demonstrated with an electron spin resonance method that endothelial cells produce H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, at least in micromolar concentrations, in porcine coronary microvessels under physiological conditions upon agonist stimulation, which should be enough to cause EDHF-type vasodilatation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Third, although we were able to demonstrate the important role of endothelial NOSs system in EDHF-mediated responses in vitro, the in vivo importance of the system remains to be examined in future studies. Fourth, vascular endothelial cells have several intracellular sources other than NOSs to produce superoxide anions that are dismutated to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, including NAD(P)H oxidase, mitochondrial electron transport chain, lipoxygenase, and xanthine oxidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>). In this study, we did not examine the contribution of superoxide anions derived from intracellular sources other than the endothelial NOSs system to EDHF-mediated relaxations. Fifth, although we demonstrated the important role of endothelial NOSs system in EDHF-mediated responses, we did not test our hypothesis using endothelial cell-specific NOSs<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. In this study, however, we examined endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent responses separately, and confirmed that endothelium-independent responses were unaltered in the three genotypes of NOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.</p><p>This study may have important clinical implications. EDHF plays an important role in human arteries, especially in microvessels, and its vasodilator effects are impaired in several disease states, such as aging and hypercholesterolemia, with a resultant microvascular dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). Our n/i/eNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are characterized by the phenotypes resembling metabolic syndrome in humans, which is not evident in singly eNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>).
