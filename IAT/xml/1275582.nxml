In this study, we identified <italic>MGS1</italic> as a multicopy suppressor of the temperature-sensitive <italic>dna2&#x00394;405N</italic> mutation, a <italic>DNA2</italic> allele lacking the N-terminal 405 amino acid residues. Mgs1 stimulates the structure-specific nuclease activity of Rad27 (yeast Fen1 or yFen1) in an ATP-dependent manner. ATP binding but not hydrolysis was sufficient for the stimulatory effect of Mgs1, since non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs are as effective as ATP. Suppression of the temperature-sensitive growth defect of <italic>dna2&#x00394;405N</italic> required the presence of a functional copy of <italic>RAD27</italic>, indicating that Mgs1 suppressed the <italic>dna2&#x00394;405N</italic> mutation by increasing the activity of yFen1 (Rad27) <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our results provide <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> evidence that Mgs1 is involved in Okazaki fragment processing by modulating Fen1 activity. The data presented raise the possibility that the absence of <italic>MGS1</italic> may impair the processing of Okazaki fragments, leading to genomic instability.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The completion of DNA synthesis at the lagging strand is a complicated process requiring the concerted action of at least 23 polypeptides in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Owing to their short length (100&#x02013;200 nt) and the large size of eukaryotic genome, an enormous number of Okazaki fragments (&#x0223c;2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> in humans) must be synthesized and processed during a single cell division cycle. Based on current models of Okazaki fragment synthesis and processing, polymerase (pol) &#x003b1;-primase synthesizes short RNA&#x02013;DNA primers on the lagging DNA template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). This is then followed by polymerase switching from the non-processive low-fidelity pol &#x003b1;-primase to the processive proofreading pol &#x003b4; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). The pol &#x003b4;&#x02013;PCNA complex then elongates the short RNA&#x02013;DNA primers until it encounters the 5&#x02032; end of the previously synthesized Okazaki fragment, at which point displacement synthesis leads to the formation of an RNA&#x02013;DNA flap structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>).</p><p>Studies with purified proteins suggest that the displaced RNA&#x02013;DNA flap structure is cleaved completely by the combined action of Dna2 endonuclease/helicase and Fen1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). The length of the RNA&#x02013;DNA flap generated by pol &#x003b4; appears to be governed by the binding of replication-protein A (RPA) to the displaced flap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). When the length of the flap reaches 35 nt, RPA bound to the displaced flap recruits the Dna2 helicase&#x02013;endonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>), which inhibits any further displacement synthesis. Dna2 then cleaves the flap, most probably removing the entire RNA&#x02013;DNA segment originally synthesized by the non-proofreading pol &#x003b1;&#x02013;primase complex, leaving a shortened flap structure that is cleaved by the Fen1 nuclease. Finally, the nicked DNA produced is finally sealed by DNA ligase I. Although there is substantial evidence that both Dna2 and Fen1 are essential for Okazaki fragment processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>), short DNA flaps can be processed only by Fen1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). These findings suggest that the role of Dna2 is probably related to the length of the flaps generated <italic>in vivo</italic> by the pol &#x003b4;-catalyzed displacement reaction.</p><p>Exploring lagging-strand DNA synthesis in detail is crucial for understanding the genome instability that can occur during DNA replication. For example, mutations in Werner or Bloom helicases (and their homologs in other organisms) cause genome instability in humans and are implicated in Okazaki fragment processing by virtue of their functional interactions with Fen1. <italic>In vitro</italic>, both Werner and Bloom helicases markedly stimulate Fen1-mediated flap structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic>, overexpression of the human Bloom syndrome gene suppresses replication and repair defects of yeast <italic>dna2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). The role of the Werner and Bloom helicases in Okazaki fragment processing, however, is not clear. The non-essential yeast <italic>MGS1</italic> gene is another example in this enigmatic category. It encodes a highly conserved protein related to RFC and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RuvB, and possesses DNA-dependent ATPase and DNA annealing activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). <italic>mgs1&#x00394;</italic> mutant cells display an increased rate of homologous recombination and require the <italic>RAD6</italic> epistatsis group of genes for viability. This group of genes is involved in post-replicational repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>), indicating that DNA damages, accumulated in the absence of <italic>MGS1</italic>, are repaired by the <italic>RAD6</italic>-dependent pathway.</p><p>The human homolog of yeast Mgs1 was identified as a WHIP (also called WRNIP1) by two-hybrid screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). Recently, WHIP was found to interact physically with DNA pol &#x003b4; and stimulate its DNA synthetic activity by increasing its initiation frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). Though many of the biochemical and genetic properties of Mgs1 have been defined, its role contributing to genome stability is unknown.</p><p>We have carried out experiments designed to identify novel factors involved in eukaryotic Okazaki fragment processing. These resulted in the identification of <italic>MGS1</italic> as a multicopy suppressor that rescues the temperature-sensitive growth defect of <italic>dna2&#x00394;405N</italic> (a <italic>dna2</italic> mutant allele lacking the N-terminal 405 amino acid residues). To better define the role of Mgs1 in Okazaki fragment processing, we prepared recombinant Mgs1 and investigated its interaction with Dna2 and yFen1. We found that in the presence of ATP, the purified Mgs1 enzyme stimulates the nuclease activity of Fen1 and had no effect on the endonuclease activity of Dna2. The suppression of the <italic>dna2&#x00394;405N</italic> phenotype by <italic>MGS1</italic> overexpression required the presence of a functional copy of <italic>RAD27</italic>. Our <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> results demonstrate that Mgs1 functions by stimulating Fen1 and suggest that a probable source of genomic instability in the absence of <italic>MGS1</italic> is faulty Okazaki fragment processing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Enzymes, nucleotides and antibodies</title><p>The oligonucleotides used in this study were commercially synthesized from Genotech (Daejeon, Korea) and their sequences are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.

The hydrolysis of ATP by yeast Mgs1 was stimulated by the addition of either single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) or double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) with a preference for ssDNA. In contrast, ATP hydrolysis by WHIP1 (also called WRNIP1), the human homolog of yeast Mgs1 was stimulated only in the presence of duplex DNA with ends. Because of this discrepancy in the structures of the DNA cofactors, we examined a variety of DNA preparations for their ability to stimulate the ATPase activity of the yeast Mgs1.</p><p>For this purpose, we constructed plasmids that expressed FLAG-epitope tagged Mgs1 either at its C-terminus (Mgs1-FLAG) or at its N-terminus (FLAG-Mgs1). The overexpression of Mgs1-FLAG suppresses the temperature-sensitive growth defect of <italic>dna2&#x00394;405N</italic>, indicating that it is functionally interchangeable with wild-type Mgs1. In contrast, the FLAG-Mgs1 failed to rescue the growth defect of <italic>dna2&#x00394;405N</italic>, indicating that a modification at its N-terminus interferes with its biological function. For this reason, wild-type and mutant Mgs1K183E (both FLAG-tagged at their C-termini) were expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic> and purified to near homogeneity as described in Materials and Methods.</p><p>Glycerol gradient sedimentation of the wild-type Mgs1 yields a protein peak fraction that coincided with a single peak of ATPase activity (data not shown), demonstrating that the ATPase activity is intrinsic to Mgs1. An SDS&#x02013;PAGE analysis of wild-type and mutant Mgs1 are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. As expected, Mgs1KE was devoid of detectable ATPase activity, whereas wild-type Mgs1-FLAG hydrolyzed ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Mgs1 hydrolyzed ATP most efficiently in the presence of &#x003a6;X174 sscDNA with a turnover rate of &#x0223c;0.4 ATP/min/enzyme. In the absence of DNA, Mgs1 hydrolyzed ATP less efficiently (&#x0223c;20% of the activity obtained with &#x003a6;X174 sscDNA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Poly(dA)/oligo(dT) stimulated the ATPase activity of Mgs1 weakly (&#x0223c;2-fold), whereas poly(dA) failed to do so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We found that the varying molar ratio of poly(dA) to oligo(dT) did not affect the efficiency of ATP hydrolysis by Mgs1 (data not shown). &#x003a6;X174 RFI DNA stimulated ATP hydrolysis &#x0223c;2-fold, but this stimulation was not observed when the RFI form was converted to RFIII with XhoI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), suggesting that ssDNA regions transiently present in the supercoiled DNA stimulated the ATPase activity of Mgs1. Collectively, these results suggest that DNA molecules containing both ssDNA and dsDNA structures are most effective in supporting the ATPase activity of Mgs1. Interestingly, we found that a ribonucleic acid such as poly(U) stimulates the ATPase activity as efficiently as &#x003a6;X174 sscDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Mgs1 stimulates the endonuclease activity of yeast Fen1</title><p>Suppression of the <italic>dna2&#x00394;405N</italic> mutation is observed in the presence of multicopy of the <italic>MGS1</italic> gene as well as by overexpression of either the mutant <italic>dna2&#x00394;405N</italic> allele itself or <italic>RAD27</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). Therefore, the simplest explanation is that the suppression might stem from the ability of Mgs1 to stimulate either Dna2&#x00394;450N or yFen1 activity. Purified Mgs1 did not affect the helicase or nuclease activities of Dna2. We tested both wild-type and mutant Dna2 enzymes with substrates containing varying lengths (10&#x02013;60 nt) of flaps, and failed to observe any stimulatory effect of Mgs1 on Dna2-catalyzed cleavage of such substrates (data not shown). However, it significantly stimulated yFen1 structure-specific nuclease activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). To examine the influence of Mgs1 on yFen1 activity, a double-flapped DNA substrate containing both 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; unannealed tails (15 and 1 nt long, respectively) was used as substrate, which when cleaved by yFen1 yields 16 nt long product.</p><p>In the absence of ATP, Mgs1 stimulates yFen1 weakly (&#x0223c;2-fold) at the highest concentration (450 fmol, 30 ng) of Mgs1 added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, lane 6). The stimulation plateaued after the addition of 75 fmol (5 ng) of Mgs1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, lanes 4&#x02013;6). The addition of ATP inhibited yFen1 &#x0223c;3-fold (data not shown). For this reason, we used nearly three times more enzyme (0.2 fmol) in reactions containing ATP. The additional enzyme resulted in the same level of yFen1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, complex lanes 2 and 9). In the presence of 2 mM ATP, Mgs1 stimulated the activity of yFen1 significantly more than its absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, compare lanes 2&#x02013;6 and 9&#x02013;13). This stimulation increased in proportion to the level of Mgs1 added. Mgs1 alone contained no detectable nuclease activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, lanes 7 and 14). Nor did Mgs1 alter size of the cleavage product formed by yFen1. We also examined influence of ATP on Mgs1 stimulation of yFen1 using the same level of Fen1 (0.07 fmol) as that used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> (lanes 2&#x02013;7). Under these conditions, the stimulatory effect of ATP was higher (&#x0223c;10-fold) than that observed higher levels of yFen1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Fen1-mediated suppression of <italic>dna2&#x00394;405N</italic> growth defect</title><p>The finding that Mgs1 stimulates Fen1 activity in an ATP-dependent fashion is consistent with our <italic>in vivo</italic> observations that overexpression of wild-type Mgs1, but not ATPase-negative mutant Mgs1K183E, suppressed the <italic>dna2&#x00394;405N</italic> growth defect. Since Mgs1 did not stimulate the activities of the dna2&#x00394;405N mutant enzyme, it is probable that its <italic>in vivo</italic> suppressor activity is due to stimulation of yFen1 activity as shown above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). If this were the case, suppression of <italic>dna2&#x00394;405N</italic> by Mgs1 should depend on the presence of a functional Fen1. For this reason, we examined whether multicopy <italic>MGS1</italic> could rescue the <italic>rad27&#x00394; dna2&#x00394;405N</italic>.</p><p>Because <italic>rad27&#x00394; dna2&#x00394;405N</italic> double-mutants are lethal (data not shown), we first introduced a plasmid (pRS326-RAD27, Ura3 as a selection marker) containing wild-type <italic>RAD27</italic> into yJA2 (<italic>dna2&#x00394;405N</italic>) and then deleted the chromosomal <italic>RAD27</italic> to construct yHJ2 (<italic>rad27&#x00394; dna2&#x00394;405N</italic>). The strain grew normally at 37&#x000b0;C provided wild-type <italic>RAD27</italic> (in the plasmid pRS326-RAD27) was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The yHJ2 strain harboring wild-type <italic>RAD27</italic> was transformed with pRS424 (Trp1 as a selection marker) alone or pRS424 derivatives containing wild-type <italic>MGS1</italic>, mutant <italic>mgs1KE</italic> or <italic>RAD27</italic> and transformants were grown on a plate containing 5&#x02032; fluoroorotic acid (5&#x02032; FOA).

This result supports that the suppressor activity of <italic>MGS1</italic> is due to its stimulation of yFen1 activity. Consistent with this, overexpression of <italic>MGS1</italic> did not suppress the growth defect of the <italic>rad27&#x00394;</italic> mutant (data notshown).</p></sec><sec><title>ATP binding is important for stimulation of Fen by Mgs1</title><p>We examined whether ATP hydrolysis by Mgs1 was required for the stimulation of the enzymatic activity of Fen1. We found that ATP&#x003b3;S was as efficient as ATP in supporting the Mgs1 stimulation of yFen1 (data not shown). Because ATP&#x003b3;S can be hydrolyzed by a subset of ATPase enzymes, this experiment was repeated using another non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, AppNp. The rate of product accumulation by yFen1 in the presence of Mgs1 (450 fmol, 30 ng) was 4&#x02013;5 times faster than its absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, lanes 7&#x02013;11). When ATP was replaced with AppNp, the rate of product formation was nearly the same as that observed with ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, lanes 13&#x02013;17, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). These results indicate that the binding of ATP to Mgs1, rather than its hydrolysis, is required to stimulate Fen1 activity. In the presence of ADP, Mgs1 stimulated Fen1 as effectively as in the presence of ATP&#x003b3;S or AppNp (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Mgs1 stimulation of Fen1 depends on flap length</title><p>The Dna2&#x00394;405N enzyme cleaves long flap DNAs poorly, particularly those containing secondary structure (Y. H. Kang, B. C. Lee, J. H. Kim, D. H. Kim, G. H. Ryu, K. Y. Moon, H. D. Kim, M. J. Kang, S. H. Bae and Y. S. Seo, manuscript submitted). Therefore, we investigated whether Mgs1 preferentially stimulated the cleavage of long flaps by Fen1 <italic>in vitro</italic> and thereby restores long flap cleavage in the <italic>dna2&#x00394;405N</italic> mutant <italic>in vivo</italic>. For this purpose, four additional substrates with oligo(dT) flaps of varying lengths (1, 13, 30 and 60 nt) were constructed. Because ATP is required for the maximal stimulation of yFen1 by Mgs1, 2 mM ATP was added to all subsequent experiments. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, low levels (45 fmol, 3 ng) of Mgs1 stimulated efficiently the Fen1 cleavage reaction with substrates containing 1 and 13 nt flaps. With 30 and 60 nt flap substrates, however, the stimulation showed a sigmoidal response to the amounts of Mgs1 added. In the presence of these two substrates, low levels (45 fmol) of Mgs1 hardly stimulated flap cleavage by yFen1. Only higher levels (450 fmol) of Mgs1 resulted in a significant stimulation of Fen1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, lanes 15 and 20). This raises the possibility that excess ssDNA present in the longer flap substrates may need to be coated with Mgs1, thus decreasing the level of Mgs1 available to stimulate Fen1 activity.</p><p>We also examined the effect of Mgs1 on cleavage of &#x02018;equilibrating flap&#x02019; substrates containing 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; flaps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>), both of which are complementary to the template oligonucleotide. In such substrate, both flaps can competitively reanneal either partially or completely to the template and form a variety of double-flap intermediates. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, such equilibrating flap substrates were also cleaved more efficiently by yFen1 in the presence of increasing amounts of Mgs1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;6). Poly(U) supported ATP hydrolysis by Mgs1 as efficiently as &#x003a6;X174 sscDNA, we investigated whether Mgs1 could stimulate the cleavage of flaps containing a 5&#x02032;-terminal RNA segment. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> (lanes 8&#x02013;11), Mgs1 stimulated the nucleolytic removal of the RNA&#x02013;DNA chimeric flap with a terminal 12 nt RNA and 10 nt DNA segment. Thus, the presence of a terminal RNA segment in the flap did not abrogate the effect of Mgs1 on yFen1.</p></sec><sec><title>Structure-specific stimulation of Mgs1</title><p>We investigated whether the Mgs1 activation of Fen1 activity is restricted to flap DNA substrates. For this purpose, three structurally distinct substrates containing a nicked duplex, a fork-structure and a 1 nt gapped flap were used. The 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; exonuclease activity of Fen1 was marginally stimulated in the presence of a nicked duplex DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;5). In contrast, the Fen1-dependent cleavage of both fork-structured and 1 nt gapped flap substrates was significantly stimulated by Mgs1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, compare lanes 8&#x02013;11 and 14&#x02013;17). It should be noted that cleavage of the nicked and fork-structured substrates required significantly more yFen1 (20 and 4 fmol, respectively, compared with 0.07&#x02013;00.4 fmol for flap substrates). This result indicates that Mgs1 requires ssDNA for efficient stimulation of Fen1 in addition to ATP. In support of this, Mgs1 did not stimulate yFen1 efficiently when a hairpin structure was present in the flap substrate (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Binding of Mgs1 to a flap DNA is important for stimulation</title><p>The results described above indicate that flap substrates cleaved more efficiently by yFen1 in the presence of Mgs1 should contain at least 1 nt of unannealed ssDNA. We postulate that ssDNA flaps may act as a binding site for Mgs1, which is required to stimulate Fen1. To test this possibility, we investigated the requirements of various DNA substrates for Mgs1 binding using electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays as described in Materials and Methods. We first examined the binding of Mgs1 to ssDNA containing substrates. These included double-flap, equilibrating-flap, 5&#x02032; overhang and 3&#x02032; overhang substrates. The former two substrates are efficiently cleaved by yFen1, whereas the latter two are not.</p><p>All four substrates formed a complex with Mgs1 with comparable efficiency although the 5&#x02032; overhang substrate was slightly less efficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, lanes 7&#x02013;9). The amount of Mgs1&#x02013;substrate complex formed was proportional to the amount of Mgs1 added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In the presence of 3 pmol of Mgs1, &#x0223c;40&#x02013;80% of the substrate formed a complex with Mgs1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, lanes 2, 5, 8 and 11). However, Mgs1 formed a complex inefficiently (&#x0003c;6%) under the same conditions with the nicked-duplex substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, lane 2). Cleavage of this substrate was poorly stimulated by Mgs1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In contrast, the 1 nt double (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, lanes 4&#x02013;6) and single-flap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, lanes 7&#x02013;9) substrate formed detectable complexes with Mgs1. The presence of the 1 nt long 5&#x02032; DNA in the flap appears critical for Mgs1 binding, since the 1 nt gapped substrate was hardly complexed by Mgs1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, lanes 10&#x02013;12). This finding suggests a strong correlation between binding of Mgs1 to the ssDNA flap and its ability to stimulate yFen1 activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Mgs1 does not form a stable complex with Fen1</title><p>We examined whether purified Mgs1 and yFen1 interacted using an <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assay. Mgs1-FLAG and yFen1 enzymes were mixed and then incubated with agarose-conjugated anti-FLAG antibodies. Analysis of the immunocomplexes formed did not reveal any physical association of Mgs1 with Fen1 in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).</p><p>We then examined whether Mgs1 stimulated the binding of Fen1 to substrate DNA. For this purpose, we prepared a substrate in which the template strand was biotinylated at its 5&#x02032;-terminus as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>. After 1 h incubation of the enzyme(s) and the biotinylated substrate at 4&#x000b0;C as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, the biotinylated substrate was precipitated with streptavidin agarose beads. In the absence of the substrate, neither Mgs1 nor yFen1 was detected in the precipitated DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, lanes 3 and 4), whereas they were detected in the presence of the substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, lanes 5 and 6). When both proteins were combined with the substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, lane 7), the amount of protein detected was the same as when each enzyme alone was used. We also found that addition of ATP had no effect on the binding of the two proteins to the substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, lanes 7 and 9). This observation indicates that there is either no physical interaction between Mgs1 and Fen1 or that their interaction is too weak to withstand the assays described here. The apparent stimulation of yFen1 activity by Mgs1 and our failure to detect any stable interaction between the two enzymes suggest that the physical interaction, if any, between Mgs1 and yFen1 is transient or intrinsically weak and the transient interaction may be critical for the stimulation of Fen1 activity by Mgs1.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this report, we showed that Mgs1 stimulates yFen1 activity and that this effect is enhanced by ATP. Although <italic>MGS1</italic> was isolated as a multicopy suppressor of <italic>dna2&#x00394;405N</italic>, we failed to detect any observable stimulation of endonuclease activity of Dna2&#x00394;405N (a mutant enzyme devoid of N-terminal 405 amino acids) by Mgs1. Our results indicate that the suppression of <italic>dna2&#x00394;405N</italic> by <italic>MGS1</italic> overexpression occurs indirectly via its stimulation of Fen1 activity. This view is in keeping with our previous genetic observation that overexpression of Fen1 suppresses the temperature-sensitive phenotype of the <italic>dna2&#x00394;405N</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). It was shown that overexpression of either wild-type <italic>DNA2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>) or mutant <italic>dna2&#x00394;405N</italic> (J. H. Kim and Y. S. Seo, unpublished data) suppresses temperature-dependent growth defects of <italic>rad27&#x00394;</italic> mutants. This mutual suppression supports the notion that Dna2 and Fen1 share overlapping functions, although each has its own preferred substrate for cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). However, it is possible that stimulation of Fen1 activity by Mgs1 may not be required for the processing of Okazaki fragments in the presence of intact Dna2, considering that deletion of Mgs1 hardly affected growth of yeast cells.</p><p>We noted that the stimulation of Fen1 activity by Mgs1 required a high ratio of Mgs1 to the DNA substrate. In the presence of ATP, an excess amount (3- to 5-fold, 45 and 75 fmol) of Mgs1 was necessary for a significant stimulation of Fen1 in a reaction containing 15 fmol of DNA substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, lane 11, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, lane 11, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, lane 11). The finding that WRNIP1, the human homolog of yeast Mgs1 exists in a homo-oligomeric complex, most probably an octamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>) may account for why the excess amount of Mgs1 is required for a meaningful stimulation of Fen1 activity.</p><p>Although our finding indicates that ATP hydrolysis is not required for the stimulation of Fen1 by Mgs1, it is possible that ATP hydrolysis could be important for its other functions. It is conceivable that ATP hydrolysis is required for Mgs1 if it acts as a Holliday junction migration motor protein, possibly as suggested by its homology to <italic>E.coli</italic> RuvB and its genetic interaction with <italic>TOP3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). This activity, along with the strand annealing activity of Mgs1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>), may alter the equilibrating flap structures to facilitate the formation of preferred structures for Fen1 cleavage. For example, Fen1 may be loaded through the 5&#x02032; end flap to the duplex junction, but cleavage may not occur until the equilibrating flap junction migrates to form a 1 nt 3&#x02032; flap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). Therefore, cleavage of this substrate may be increased by branch migration and annealing activities of Mgs1, which most probably would require ATP hydrolysis. However, we found that ATP hydrolysis was not required to stimulate Fen1 activity by Mgs1 with CTG-repeat equilibrating substrates (data not shown). ATP hydrolysis may be important with longer equilibrating flaps than that (27 nt) tested in this study.</p><p>Moreover, it appears that the DNA annealing activity of Mgs1 may not play a role in stimulating Fen1 nuclease activity for two reasons: first, its stimulation by Mgs1 was not altered significantly even with equilibrating flap substrates and second, ATP addition reduced the DNA annealing activity of Mgs1, while it stimulates Fen1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Presently, the role of ATP hydrolysis in stimulation of Fen1 activity is not clear. Nevertheless, the specific rescue of the <italic>dna&#x00394;405N</italic> mutation and stimulation of Fen1 are consistent with the notion that Mgs1 plays a direct role in processing of Okazaki fragments.</p><p>Although Mgs1 stimulated Fen1 activity significantly, we failed to detect a direct protein&#x02013;protein interaction between Mgs1 and Fen1. This contrasts to results obtained with Bloom or Werner helicase or hnRNP A1, all of which stimulate Fen1 activity by specific protein&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). The mode by which Mgs1 stimulates Fen1 also differs from that of other Fen1 stimulatory proteins such as PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>) and the Rad9&#x02013;Rad1&#x02013;Hus1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). These proteins cease to stimulate Fen1 activity when their entry onto the ssDNA&#x02013;dsDNA junction is blocked by a bulky complex at the duplex ends of the substrate. In contrast, Mgs1 stimulates Fen1 cleavage regardless of the presence of a bulky complex present at the DNA termini (data not shown). For this reason, we suggest that Mgs1 binds directly to ssDNA&#x02013;dsDNA junctions, and the resulting Mgs1&#x02013;substrate complex becomes more easily accessible to Fen1. This view is in keeping with our observation that Mgs1 did not stimulate cleavage of the nicked flap substrate significantly, to which Mgs1 bound poorly. Mgs1 bound to the flap may adopt a conformation in the presence of ATP that is more readily recognized by Fen1. Our failure to detect a stable complex between Mgs1 and Fen1 suggests that the interaction may be transient, which is important for rapid turnover of enzymes.</p><p>In <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>mgs1&#x00394;</italic> mutant cells are viable and exhibit elevated levels (&#x0223c;4- to 13-fold) of recombination relative to wild-type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Cells lacking <italic>MGS1</italic> display a synthetic lethal interaction with <italic>rad6</italic> and exhibit a synergistic growth defect with <italic>rad18</italic> and <italic>rad5</italic>, which are members of the <italic>RAD6</italic> epistasis group of post-replicational repair gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Thus, Mgs1 becomes essential in the absence of post-replicational repair. This observation, together with our results described above, indicates that in the absence of a functional Mgs1, processing of Okazaki fragments is impaired and this defect can be efficiently overcome by a post-replicational repair pathway that requires genes belonging to <italic>RAD6</italic> epistasis group.</p><p>Recently, it was shown that WHIP1, a mammalian homolog of Mgs1, interacts physically with DNA pol &#x003b4; and increases the initiation frequency of pol &#x003b4; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). It was suggested that this interaction is required under particular conditions such as replication fork arrest. These findings suggest another mechanism by which Mgs1 suppresses the <italic>dna2&#x00394;405N</italic> mutation. Namely, the interaction of Mgs1 with pol &#x003b4; may lead to a reduced size of flaps by affecting pol &#x003b4;-catalyzed displacement DNA synthesis. Processing of short flaps is less dependent on the function of Dna2 because they can be processed by Fen1 alone. Another possibility is that Mgs1 in association with pol &#x003b4; may increase the recruitment of Fen1, which would cleave flaps before they grow to a length processed by Dna2. If this were the case, Mgs1 could stimulate flap removal as rapidly as they are generated by pol &#x003b4;-catalyzed displacement reaction. Recently, it was shown that ligatable nicks are generated by two different mechanisms; (i) in the presence of Fen1, pol &#x003b4; and Fen1 together go through multiple cycles of displacement synthesis and flap cutting and (ii) in the absence of Fen1, idling by pol &#x003b4; predominates to maintain ligatable nicks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). The biochemical role of Mgs1 in our study is not incompatible with this model, since the stimulation of Fen1 by Mgs1 can further facilitate nick maintenance carried out by both pol &#x003b4; and Fen1. The absence of a functional Mgs1 in this regard is probably to result in faulty Okazaki fragment processing and the accumulation of damaged lesions that can be repaired by a <italic>RAD6</italic>-dependent post-replicational repair pathway.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr Jerard Hurwitz (Sloan-Kettering Institute, USA) for his critical reading of the manuscript.
