We previously reported that systemic antigen sensitization alone directly induces AHR before development of eosinophilic airway inflammation in a mouse model of allergic airway inflammation, which suggests a critical role of antigen-specific systemic immune response itself in the induction of AHR.

Fluorescence and immunohistochemical studies were performed to identify T cells recruiting and proliferating in the lung or in the gut of the recipient.

In the process of airway inflammation, various types of cells, such as eosinophils, mast cells, T lymphocytes, and dendritic cells are involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. AHR to nonspecific stimuli is a hallmark of asthma. However, the precise mechanism to induce AHR has not been fully elucidated. Persistence of eosinophilic airway inflammation is closely linked to induction of AHR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, the dissociation of AHR and eosinophilic airway inflammation often occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. For example, Leckie <italic>et al</italic>. showed that administration of neutralizing antibody (Ab) to interleukin (IL) -5 does not suppress AHR despite this treatment abrogating eosinophilia in blood and sputum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In addition, even a protective role of eosinophils on the AHR induction has been recently proposed in a mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. These findings suggest that other mechanism(s) than eosinophilic inflammation would be involved in inducing AHR.</p><p>On the other hand, in patients with asthma, activated T cells, especially CD4<sup>+ </sup>T helper (Th) 2 cells, also infiltrate into the airway, which is associated with disease severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In a mouse model, administration of blocking Ab to CD4 suppresses AHR and airway inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Moreover, transfer of CD4<sup>+ </sup>Th2 cells into naive mice and subsequent antigen-inhalation induce AHR and airway inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. These findings suggest that T cells, especially CD4<sup>+ </sup>Th2 cells, are also important for the AHR induction. However, in these studies, AHR induced by CD4<sup>+ </sup>Th2 cells accompanies eosinophilic airway inflammation. Therefore, it remains unclear whether T cells alone could directly induce AHR.</p><p>We previously reported that systemic antigen sensitization alone directly induces AHR before development of eosinophilic inflammation in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. This raised a possibility that systemic immune response to antigen itself could directly induce AHR.</p><p>The purpose of the present study was to investigate which component in the immunocompetent cells could directly induce AHR. In this study, we found that passive cell transfer of spleen cells obtained after antigen-sensitization reconstituted AHR in naive mice. Then, using this system, we studied the cell source essential for the AHR induction, and confirmed that antigen-sensitized CD4<sup>+</sup>CD62L<sup>low </sup>memory/effector Th2 cells would play an essential role for induction of basal AHR.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Immunization of mice and transfer of spleen cells</title><p>Mice were immunized as reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Seven-week-old male BALB/cAnNCrj mice (Charles River Japan, Kanagawa, Japan) or IL-4 gene-deleted mice (BALB/c-<italic>IL4</italic><sup><italic>tm2Nnt</italic></sup>; Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were sensitized with an i.p. injection of 2 &#x003bc;g ovalbumin (OVA; Sigma, St. Louis, MO), bovine serum albumin (BSA; Wako, Osaka, Japan), or keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH; Calbiochem, LaJolla, CA) plus 2 mg aluminum hydroxide (alum) on days 0 and 11. Control mice received an injection of physiologic saline (SA) without alum on days 0 and 11. Some control mice received an injection of SA plus alum. In some experiments, we used complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA; Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI) instead of alum as an adjuvant. On day 18, cell suspensions of spleens were obtained by pressing the tissues through a 70-&#x003bc;m nylon filters. Spleen cells prepared from the OVA-sensitized mice (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>, 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>, 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup>, or 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7 </sup>in 0.5 ml HBSS, respectively) or the SA-treated mice (5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup>) were transferred into syngenic recipients by intravenous injection. In some experiments, mice were sensitized with OVA on days 0 and 11, and then challenged with 3% OVA for 10 minutes from day 18 to day 20. On day 21, lungs were excised to observe eosinophilic airway inflammation. All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Research Ethics Board of the Department of Allergy and Rheumatology, University of Tokyo.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of airway responsiveness (AR)</title><p>On day 22 (4 days after the transfer), AR to methacholine (Mch) was measured with the enhanced pause (Penh) system (Buxco, Troy, NY) as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In some experiments, AR was assessed by measurement of airway resistance (Raw) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Briefly, anesthetized mice were tracheostomized and connected to a MiniVent ventilator (Hugo Sachs Elektronik, March, Germany), then ventilated with a tidal volume of 250 &#x003bc;l and a respiratory frequency of 120 breaths/minute. The mice were placed inside whole-body plethysmographs (Buxco) to measure Raw. Increasing doses of Mch were administered by ultraneblization for 3 minutes. The concentration of Mch that induced a 100% increase in Penh or Raw was expressed as PC<sub>200</sub>Mch (&#x003bc;g/ml) or PC<sub>200</sub>Mch Raw (&#x003bc;g/ml) as an indicator of AHR.</p></sec><sec><title>Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and histological examination</title><p>Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) analyses were performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The lungs were lavaged four times with SA (0.5 ml each), and approximately 1.6 ml was consistently recovered with gentle handling. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 10 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C. The cells were resuspended into 1 ml of saline with 1% BSA, and the total cell numbers were counted with a hemocytometer. Cytospin samples were prepared by centrifuging the suspensions (200 &#x003bc;l) at 300 rpm for 10 minutes. To clearly distinguish eosinophils from the neutrophils, three different stains were applied: Diff-Quick stain, May-Gr&#x000fc;nwald-Giemsa stain, and Eosino (Hansel) stain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. On the basis of the findings with these stainings, cell differentials were counted with at least 300 leukocytes in each sample. Lung histological examinations were performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Serum immunoglobulin (Ig) E and BALF cytokine concentrations were measured using ELISA kits (Pharmingen, SanDiego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The lower limits of sensitivity for the ELISA were 78 ng/ml (IgE), 7.8 pg/ml (IL-4), 15.6 pg/ml (IL-5), and 31.2 pg/ml (interferon (IFN)-&#x003b3;), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Fluorescence study and immunohistochemistry</title><p>On day 18, spleen cells (5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup>) from OVA-sensitized mice were labeled with fluorescent dye (PKH67; Sigma), and then transferred into syngenic recipients. In another experiment, CD4<sup>+</sup>CD62L<sup>low </sup>cells (4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>) from OVA-sensitized mice were positively selected as described in "depletion and positive selection study", and then labeled and transferred. On day 19, after perfusion with saline, lungs were excised. Five-micrometer sections were cut and observed by fluorescence microscopy (BX51; Olympus, Melville, NY). Immunohistochemistry was performed using Vectastain ABC kits (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. T cells were detected by staining for CD3 (cytoplasm, blue). Proliferation was assessed by staining for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA; nucleus, brown). Double-staining analysis of a single section was performed. Briefly, the tissue was deparaffinized and rehydrated with decreasing concentrations of ethyl alcohol. The slides were boiled in 0.05 M citric acid for 7 minutes. After cooling down to room temperature, endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubating the slides in 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>in methanol for 60 minutes. Next the slides were treated with blocking solution containing 5% normal rabbit serum, 2% casein, and 3% BSA for 45 minutes. Anti-CD3 Ab (5 &#x003bc;g/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was applied to the tissue and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 minutes. After washing with PBS, biotinylated rabbit anti-goat IgG Ab was applied and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 minutes. After washing, avidin-biotin alkaline phosphatase complex was applied and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 minutes, followed by the addition of substrate solution. Color development was stopped by rinsing the slides in distilled water. Then, the slides were treated with blocking solution containing 5% normal goat serum, 2% casein, and 3% BSA for 45 minutes. Anti-PCNA Ab (2 &#x003bc;g/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was applied to the tissue and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 minutes. After washing with PBS, biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG Ab was applied and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 minutes. After washing, avidin-biotin peroxidase complex was applied and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 minutes, followed by the addition of diaminobenzidine solution. Color development was stopped by rinsing the slides in distilled water. The slides were counterstained with neutral red. Positively immunostained cells were enumerated directly in 20 random high power fields (hpf; 40&#x000d7; objective).</p></sec><sec><title>Depletion and positive selection study</title><p>For depletion, on day 18, spleen cells from OVA-sensitized mice were incubated with biotinylated anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody (mAb; RM4-5; Pharmingen), anti-CD8 mAb (53-6.7; Pharmingen), anti-CD11b mAb (M1/70; Pharmingen), anti-CD11c mAb (HL3; Pharmingen), or anti-CD19 mAb (1D3; Pharmingen), and then incubated with streptavidin-microbeads (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). For depletion of invariant V&#x003b1;14 (iV&#x003b1;14) natural killer T (NKT) cells, spleen cells from OVA-sensitized mice were incubated with &#x003b1;-galactosylceramide (&#x003b1;-GalCer; kindly provided by the Pharmaceutical Research Laboratory of Kirin Brewery Company, Gunma, Japan)-loaded mouse CD1d: Ig dimeric protein (Pharmingen) and then incubated with anti-mouse IgG1-microbeads (Miltenyi Biotech). Bead-bound cells were depleted using magnetic separation columns. Flow cytometry confirmed that greater than 98% of CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup>, CD11b<sup>+</sup>, CD11c<sup>+</sup>, or CD19<sup>+ </sup>cells were removed from splenocytes, and 88% of cells that bound &#x003b1;-GalCer-loaded mouse CD1d dimer were removed (data not shown).

For positive selection, on day 18, spleen cells from OVA-sensitized mice were incubated with anti-CD4 mAb-coated or anti-CD11c mAb-coated microbeads (Miltenyi Biotech). Bead-bound cells were then isolated using magnetic separation columns. The purities of the enriched CD4<sup>+ </sup>and CD11c<sup>+ </sup>cells were 95% and 85%, respectively (data not shown).

Injection with alum alone provoked a slight non-specific increase in AR, but it was not significant (data not shown). When OVA-sensitized mice received OVA inhalation challenges, then prominent infiltration of eosinophils was provoked and AR further increased (OVA/OVA; 2,564 &#x000b1; 343 &#x003bc;g/ml; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). In the group of mice that received spleen cells from OVA-sensitized mice (defined as "TROVA-mice"; 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup>), PC<sub>200</sub>Mch was 4,191 &#x000b1; 203 &#x003bc;g/ml, which was significantly lower than that of the group of mice that received the same number of spleen cells from SA-treated mice (defined as "TRSA-mice"; 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup>; 6,357 &#x000b1; 835 &#x003bc;g/ml; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Transfer of spleen cells from mice that were injected with SA plus alum did not induce AHR (TRAlum; 6,596 &#x000b1; 697 &#x003bc;g/ml). Therefore, transfer of OVA-sensitized spleen cells reconstituted moderate AHR in a naive mouse to a similar degree of AHR induced by systemic sensitization with OVA antigen. In the TROVA-mice, AR increased in a cell-number dependent-manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>; 7,415 &#x000b1; 2,176 &#x003bc;g/ml (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>), 6,343 &#x000b1; 1,392 &#x003bc;g/ml (5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>), 4,803 &#x000b1; 572 &#x003bc;g/ml (2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup>), respectively). To confirm the reliability of the data obtained from the Penh system, we examined AR by measuring Raw with ventilated mice treated with the same immunization protocol. Similar results on AHR were obtained by measuring Raw (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>; PC<sub>200</sub>Mch Raw; SAip, 47,205 &#x000b1; 4,767 &#x003bc;g/ml, OVA ip, 20,668 &#x000b1; 1,562 &#x003bc;g/ml, TRSA, 46,702 &#x000b1; 6,653 &#x003bc;g/ml, TROVA, 22,450 &#x000b1; 9,535 &#x003bc;g/ml).

Transfer of the CD62L<sup>low </sup>memory/effector subset, but not the CD62L<sup>high </sup>subset, induced AHR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9C</xref>; CD4, 3,968 &#x000b1; 258 &#x003bc;g/ml, CD62Lhi, 6,549 &#x000b1; 645 &#x003bc;g/ml, CD62Llo, 3,824 &#x000b1; 420 &#x003bc;g/ml). When we evaluated AHR by measuring Raw, similar results were obtained (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9D</xref>; PC<sub>200</sub>Mch Raw; CD4, 23,840 &#x000b1; 3,350 &#x003bc;g/ml, CD62Lhi, 41,146 &#x000b1; 6,451 &#x003bc;g/ml, CD62Llo, 22,146 &#x000b1; 6,150 &#x003bc;g/ml). We also confirmed that some transferred CD4<sup>+</sup>CD62L<sup>low </sup>cells actually recruited into the lung (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9E</xref>). Moreover, in the mice that received the CD62L<sup>low </sup>subset, some T cells in the lung proliferated there without further antigen stimulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9F</xref>). These results strongly indicated that CD4<sup>+</sup>CD62L<sup>low </sup>memory/effector T cells were essential for this transfer-mediated, antigen-induced AHR.</p><fig position="float" id="F9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p><bold>CD4<sup>+</sup>CD62L<sup>low </sup>memory/effector subset produces Th2-type cytokines and directly induces transfer-mediated AHR</bold>.

We found that CD4<sup>+</sup>CD62L<sup>low </sup>Th2 cells play an essential role in this process. Our results strongly suggest that in sensitized individuals, memory/effector T cells could reach the lung tissue and locally act on the airways, thus would directly induce and maintain basal AHR independently of eosinophils, although the intensity could be moderate.</p><p>AHR is one of the most characteristic features of asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. However, the precise mechanism for its induction has not been fully clarified. It is considered that eosinophilic airway inflammation is closely linked to the AHR induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, a causal link between eosinophilic airway inflammation and AHR has not been established. On the other hand, CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells, especially CD4<sup>+ </sup>Th2 cells, are also involved in the induction of AHR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, the significance of eosinophils or CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells on the AHR induction has been clarified only in the effector phase, under the condition of airway antigen challenge. Therefore, the role of these cells in the AHR induction has not been evaluated in an antigen free setting. We previously reported that systemic antigen sensitization alone directly induces AHR before development of eosinophilic airway inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In addition, in the current study, transfer of spleen cells obtained from antigen-sensitized mice induced a significant AHR in naive mice without airway eosinophilia (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). These results indicate that antigen-sensitized spleen cells could directly induce AHR. In humans, we previously reported that some patients with atopic dermatitis who are highly sensitized to mite antigen have a moderate AHR regardless of the lack of any history of asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This would support the speculation that sensitization to an antigen could directly induce AHR also in humans.</p><p>We measured AR mainly by Penh system throughout the current study. Penh system has been widely used for measurement of AR to Mch in BALB/c mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Measuring Penh is superior to measuring Raw of ventilated mice in terms of its conciseness and non-invasiveness. In addition, sampling bias caused by maneuver in Penh system seemed to be lower than that in invasive ventilator system. Based on these advantages of Penh system, we could measure AR of large numbers of mice simultaneously with a good reproducibility. However, the accuracy of Penh as an indicator of AR has been recently criticized because Penh does not correlate with Raw especially in C57BL/6 mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Measuring Penh is more frequently affected by the heat and humidification than measuring Raw [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Considering these experimental and theoretical problems, we also examined AR by measuring Raw with ventilated mice in the most important experiments (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9D</xref>). We confirmed that similar results were obtained by the two systems. Therefore, we considered that the data obtained from the Penh system in the current study were, to a certain extent, reliable.</p><p>Next we studied the mechanism of the cell transfer-induced AHR. The fluorescence study and double staining demonstrated that these transferred cells reached the lung and some T cells actually proliferated in the lung without further airway antigen challenge (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Byersdorfer <italic>et al</italic>. reported that some transferred Th1 cells migrate in the airway before antigen challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Julia <italic>et al</italic>. reported that antigen sensitization alone distributes antigen-specific T cells in the BALF and in the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. These reports support the present findings. Therefore, some antigen specific T cells could have reached the lung in an antigen free setting. On the other hand, transferred cells reached the tissues other than lung such as colon, which induced a slight inflammation there (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). These results suggested that antigen sensitization or transfer of antigen-sensitized spleen cells would distribute antigen-specific T cells among tissues, and thus could induce some immure response there even without local antigen challenge.</p><p>The result of BALF cytokine concentrations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>) and transfer of CD4<sup>+ </sup>Th2 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8D</xref>) demonstrated that CD4<sup>+ </sup>Th2 cells played an essential role in the induction of the AHR. In addition, results from positive and negative selection studies clarified that CD4<sup>+</sup>CD62L<sup>low </sup>T cells were essential for transfer-induced AHR induction, while other phenotypes such as CD4<sup>+</sup>CD62L<sup>high </sup>T cells or iV&#x003b1;14 NKT cells were not (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). There are two distinct populations of memory CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells, which are distinguished by the expression of CCR7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. One is CCR7<sup>high</sup> central memory T cells which home preferentially to lymph nodes, another is CCR7<sup>low </sup>effector memory cells which traffic more efficiently to non-lymphoid tissues and acquire effector function more rapidly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Central memory T cells express high levels of CD62L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In contrast, effector memory T cells express CD62L to a lower and variable extent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Therefore, CD62L<sup>low </sup>memory T cells are thought to be a subset of effector memory T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. We demonstrated that the CD62L<sup>low </sup>subset proliferated and produced Th2-type cytokines in response to OVA, while the CD62L<sup>high </sup>subset did not (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9B</xref>). Moreover, transferred CD62L<sup>low </sup>subset recruited into the lung, and proliferated there without local antigen challenge (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9F</xref>). Therefore, in our system, some antigen specific T cells could have acquired a memory/effector phenotype (effector memory T cells), reached the lung, proliferated and produced cytokines, then finally induced AHR in an antigen free setting. Furthermore, local antigen stimuli would further accelerate immune response and thus airway eosinophilia would be induced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], which could further increase AHR (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>).</p><p>So far, whether immunocompetent cells would modify intrinsic AHR has remained unclear. De Sanctis <italic>et al</italic>. reported that T lymphocytes mediate intrinsic AHR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. However, Hadeiba <italic>et al</italic>. later reported that transfer of CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells that are not stimulated with antigen does not alter the intrinsic AHR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The latter finding is strongly supported by the present findings that antigen-stimulated cells mediated AHR induction, while cells that had not encountered antigen did not.</p><p><italic>In vitro </italic>OVA stimulation of OVA sensitized spleen cells enhanced transfer activity to induce AHR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>) and cytokine concentration in BALF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). Wise <italic>et al</italic>. reported that <italic>in vitro </italic>OVA stimulation enhances transfer activity to provoke eosinophilic airway inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. We needed larger numbers of OVA-sensitized spleen cells to induce AHR than other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], because we did not stimulate cells with OVA <italic>in vitro </italic>before transfer in most part of this study. Spleen cells from OVA-sensitized mice produced greater amount of cytokines upon further stimulation with OVA <italic>in vitro </italic>(data not shown). Therefore, the more Th2-type cytokine was produced by transferred cells, the greater the intensity of AHR increased (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p><p>Among cytokines produced by CD4<sup>+ </sup>Th2 cells, which is most important for developing of AHR has not been fully clarified. IL-13 is a candidate for developing AHR independently of eosinophilic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. On the other hand, some previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] including ours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] showed that IL-4 also plays an important role. In the current study, IL-4 and IL-5 concentrations in BALF increased by cell transfer (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), while IL-13 did not increase significantly (data not shown). Moreover, transfer of spleen cells from antigen-sensitized IL-4-deficient mice did not induce AHR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). So in the present experimental system, IL-4 would play a major role. Airway smooth muscle cells express IL-4R&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. We speculate that one of the mechanisms of AHR induction by cell transfer could be a direct influence on smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. The relationship between Th2 cytokine and smooth muscle cell should be further elucidated. NKT cells are another cell source of IL-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] and IL-13 productions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], and would influence the subsequent adaptive immune response and T cell polarization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. The development of AHR is abrogated in NKT-cell deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. However, in the current study, iV&#x003b1;14 NKT cells did not influence this transfer-mediated AHR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). This indicates that although NKT cells might play some important role in a certain phase of sensitization, once conventional T cells are activated and gain effector function, iV&#x003b1;14 NKT cells would have little contribution to the induction of AHR.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the current study clarified the significance of antigen-specific memory/effector CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cell-mediated Th2-type immune response as an essential factor to induce basal AHR in an antigen independent setting. It would also propose that suppression of antigen-specific immune response itself should be a critical target for controlling allergic asthma.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>KN and MD carried out animal experiments and preparation of the manuscript.
