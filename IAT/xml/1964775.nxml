The transcription factors NF-&#x003ba;B, AP-1, and STAT play major roles in the synthesis of immune effector molecules during innate immune responses. However, the fact that these immune responses can have cytotoxic effects requires their tight regulation to achieve restricted and transient activation, and mis-regulation of the damping process has pathological consequences. Here we show that AP-1 and STAT are themselves the major inhibitors responsible for damping NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;mediated transcriptional activation during the innate immune response in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. As the levels of dAP-1 and Stat92E increase due to continuous immune signaling, they play a repressive role by forming a repressosome complex with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> HMG protein, Dsp1. The dAP-1&#x02013;, Stat92E-, and Dsp1-containing complexes replace Relish at the promoters of diverse immune effector genes by binding to evolutionarily conserved <italic>cis</italic>-elements, and they recruit histone deacetylase to inhibit transcription. Reduction by mutation of dAP-1, Stat92E, or Dsp1 results in hyperactivation of Relish target genes and reduces the viability of bacterially infected flies despite more efficient pathogen clearance. These defects are rescued by reducing the Relish copy number, thus confirming that mis-regulation of Relish, not inadequate activation of dAP-1, Stat92E, or Dsp1 target genes, is responsible for the reduced survival of the mutants. We conclude that an inhibitory effect of AP-1 and STAT on NF-&#x003ba;B is required for properly balanced immune responses and appears to be evolutionarily conserved.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>The immune response is designed to target foreign infectious elements, not self, but it can become destructive when it fails to discriminate self from nonself. Therefore, it is important to restrain the magnitude and duration of the immune response by several mechanisms including receptor down-regulation and inhibitor synthesis. Here, focusing on the immune system of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we present a mechanism of control that relies on the transcription factors AP-1 and STAT to prevent the excessive activation of the NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;mediated immune response. Thus, AP-1 and STAT, renowned for their role in activating the NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;mediated immune response, appear also to participate in its attenuation. In their role as negative regulators, AP-1 and STAT form a complex with HMG protein and HDAC. This complex is then recruited to the promoter regions of NF-&#x003ba;B target genes, causing the chromatin structure near the NF-&#x003ba;B target genes to contract and the expression of NF-&#x003ba;B target genes to shut down. Mis-regulation of this negative-feedback process, we found, increased the lethality of bacterial infection in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. A similar scenario has been noted in mammals with over-activated NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;mediated immune responses, which has been implicated in autoimmune disease. Thus, feedback inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B appears to be evolutionarily conserved to maintain properly balanced immune responses.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>After a role in initiating an NF-&#x003ba;B-mediated innate immune response to microbial challenge, AP-1 and STAT act to form part of a repressosome to down-regulate the transcription of antimicrobial peptides and thus to resolve the immune response.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Kim LK, Choi UY, Cho HS, Lee JS, Lee WB, et al.

These interactions play key roles in the proper maintenance and termination of immune responses. However, the precise nature of the positive or negative cross-talk between these transcription factors is still unclear, as is the physiological role of such cross-talk in the innate immune response. To address these issues, we examined positive and negative interactions between transcription factors during the response to lipopolysaccharide/peptidoglycan (LPS/PGN). We found that two transcription factors, dAP-1 and Stat92E, which are activated by LPS/PGN-induced signal transduction pathways, form a repressosome complex together with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> HMG protein, Dsp1 (dorsal switch protein) and histone deacetylase, and this then inhibits transcription of diverse immune effector genes activated by Relish. We also found that mis-regulation of negative cross-talk increased the lethality of bacterial infection in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, as has been noted in mammals with over-activated NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;mediated immune responses. Therefore, the inhibitory effect of this repressosome complex on NF-&#x003ba;B plays an important role in maintaining properly balanced immune responses and appears to be evolutionarily conserved.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Requirement for Stat92E and Jra for Down-Regulating Relish Target Genes</title><p>To test for the presence of regulatory cross-talk between the signaling pathways of innate immunity, we examined the involvement of key transcription factors (Relish, Jra, Stat92E, Mad, and EcR) in LPS/PGN-induced immune responses in <italic>Drosophila</italic> SL2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050238-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

LPS/PGN-induced transcriptional activation of <italic>Attacin-A, Puckered,</italic> and <italic>CG15097</italic> was abolished only by depletion of the corresponding transcription factor, and no obvious transcriptional defect was observed as a result of depletion of Mad or EcR (the <italic>Drosophila</italic> SMAD and nuclear receptor, respectively). Intriguingly, Relish-dependent transcriptional activation of <italic>Attacin-A</italic> was hyperactivated in the absence of Jra or Stat92E.

Sequence alignment revealed several strongly conserved regions: in addition to the core promoter elements (TATA and initiator motifs), we identified a Relish-binding motif (&#x02212;140 bp), a GATA motif (&#x02212;130 bp), and a dAP-1&#x02013;binding motif (&#x02212;90 bp), along with a highly conserved region (region Y at &#x02212;45 bp) upstream of the TATA box. Intriguingly, this region contains an Relish-binding motif &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d; that overlaps with a sequence showing weak homology to the STAT consensus binding sequence &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d; in the opposite strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050238-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). To test for binding of these motifs by the corresponding transcription factors, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) with a probe spanning region Y, and we compared the results with those obtained with a probe for the distal Relish-binding motif. LPS/PGN treatment of SL2 cells led to strong mobility shifts of both probes, and these were competed out by an excess of cold probe (unpublished data). Because the region Y probe contained both the Relish- and Stat92E-binding motifs, the addition of a specific antibody against one or other of these transcription factors resulted in supershifting only a portion of the shifted bands (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050238-sg003">Figure S3</xref> and unpublished data). Therefore, we confirmed the identity of the protein(s) bound to each probe by repeating the EMSAs after depleting Relish or Stat92E, or both, by RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050238-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). The LPS/PGN-induced mobility shift of the distal Relish probe (Relish1) was lost when Relish was depleted but not when Stat92E was depleted, whereas the shift of the region Y probe was only abolished when both Relish and Stat92E were depleted, indicating that both transcription factors bind to their putative binding sites in this probe. This interpretation was confirmed by showing that the LPS/PGN-induced mobility shift was not affected by mutations affecting only the Relish or the Stat92E binding sequence, but was abolished when both binding sequences were mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050238-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Moreover the Stat92E mutant probe was not shifted in Relish-depleted extracts, and the Relish2 mutant probe was not shifted in Stat92E-depleted extracts. These results establish that region Y contains genuine Relish- and Stat92E-binding sites.</p><fig id="pbio-0050238-g002" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>A Stat92E Binding Site on the <italic>Attacin-A</italic> Promoter Plays a Crucial Role in Down-Regulating <italic>Attacin-A</italic></title><p>(A) Region Y contains an NF-&#x003ba;B binding site and a STAT binding site.

Mutation of either of the Relish-binding motifs inhibited transcription from the <italic>Attacin-A</italic> promoter such that no (Relish1 mutation) or only weak (Relish2 mutation) luciferase activity was detected. In contrast, mutation of the Stat92E- or dAP-1-binding motifs resulted in at least 3-fold higher luciferase activities than obtained with the wild-type promoter. This result, along with the result from EMSAs, demonstrates that the defects in the binding of Relish, Jra, and Stat92E to their binding motifs in the promoter result in altered <italic>Attacin-A</italic> transcription. Therefore, both Jra and Stat92E appear to down-regulate genes activated by Relish in response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Interdependence of Jra and Stat92E for Stable Binding to the Relish Target Promoter</title><p>To test whether similar transcription factor binding occurs in a chromosomal context, we examined the recruitment of transcription factors by means of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays.

Relish knock-down reduced Relish without affecting the binding of the other transcription factor. On the other hand, depletion of Jra caused the loss not only of its own binding but also of that of Stat92E, and vice versa, indicating that Jra and Stat92E bind synergistically to the Relish target promoter. This co-occupancy of the promoter by Jra and Stat92E may elicit the repressive function of the transcription factors. As shown previously, dHDAC1 is also recruited to the <italic>Attacin-A</italic> promoter after LPS/PGN-treatment, and this also requires concurrent binding of Stat92E and Jra. Knock-down of EcR or Mad had no effect on recruitment of Relish, Jra, Stat92E, and dHDAC1 (unpublished data).</p><fig id="pbio-0050238-g003" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Synergistic Binding of Jra and Stat92E to the <italic>Attacin-A</italic> Promoter</title><p>ChIP assays of the transcription factors indicated below using various mutants.

We therefore examined the requirement for <italic>Drosophila</italic> HMG proteins (Dsp1, HmgD, and HmgZ) for the Jra- and Stat92E-mediated down-regulation of <italic>Attacin-A</italic> transcription. Depletion of Dsp1 mimicked the effect of Jra knock-down, whereas knock-down of HmgD or HmgZ had no detectable effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050238-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). In addition, depletion of Dsp1 prevented the LPS/PGN-induced binding of Jra, Stat92E, and dHDAC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050238-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). Interestingly, ChIP with antibody to Dsp1 revealed that Dsp1 was recruited to the <italic>Attacin-A</italic> promoter by LPS/PGN treatment, and this was completely dependent on Jra and Stat92E, suggesting that Dsp1 is specifically localized to the <italic>Attacin-A</italic> promoter region in response to LPS/PGN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050238-g004">Figure 4</xref>C).

Most importantly, combining Relish heterozygosity with mutations of Stat92E, Jra, or Dsp1 overcame the lethal consequence of bacterial infection rather than aggravating them. Hence, the increased vulnerability to infection of the Stat92E, Jra, and Dsp1 mutants is due to excessive activation of Relish target genes rather than to reduced activation of Stat92E, Jra, or Dsp1 target genes.

We have shown above that a specific HMG protein functions as a core element nucleating the assembly of a repressor complex of AP-1, STAT, and HDAC1. The mammalian homolog of Dsp1, HMGB1, binds to a negative regulatory element adjacent to the NF-&#x003ba;B binding site in the interferon-beta enhancer &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;, and Dsp1 is a co-repressor that converts Dorsal from activator to repressor by binding to G(A) motifs adjacent to Dorsal binding sites &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b027">27</xref>&#x02013;-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;.

Evidently, the role of Dsp1 is to facilitate the formation of repressor complexes on NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;dependent promoters.</p><p>It is noteworthy that a different HMG protein, HMG-Y/I, forms repressosomes with the transcription factors NF-Y and BTEB-1 that represses transcription of a growth hormone receptor gene by recruiting the histone deacetylase complex &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;.

Nevertheless, the repressosome complex may well be an important component of <italic>Drosophila</italic> immune responses, since many Stat92E and Dsp1 mutant flies die upon bacterial infection, and this enhanced lethality was reversed by reducing Relish copy number. We propose that JNK participates in cellular immune responses and also forms a repressosome complex with Stat92E, Dsp1, and dHDAC1 that restricts the production of antimicrobial peptides.</p><p>Recently, Delaney et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d; have claimed that JNK is required for the synthesis of antimicrobial peptide genes upon bacterial infection of <italic>Drosophila</italic>.

The discrepancy between Delaney's result and ours may be due to differences between the mutants or methods used in the two studies. First, the extent of knock-down of gene activities differed: in our study, we reduced the expression of various genes (Jra, dJNK, and Stat92E) by conditional knock-down or by reducing copy number (Jra), whereas Delaney et al. clonally deleted dJNK and Jra and overexpressed a JNK inhibitor (Puc), and these procedures may have affected an essential function of the JNK pathway required for Relish-mediated transcriptional activation. Another possible explanation of the discrepancy derives from the use of different Jra alleles in the two studies. Unlike flies carrying the <italic>Jra<sup>1A109</sup>/CyO</italic> allele used by us, the heterozygous mutant flies carrying the <italic>Jra<sup>1</sup>/CyO</italic> allele used by Delaney et al. did not show any defect in Relish-dependent transcriptional activation of AMP genes even when they were examined under our experimental conditions. According to FlyBase, the truncated protein is stopped at the 177th amino acid in the <italic>Jra<sup>1</sup>/CyO</italic> allele and at the 72nd amino acid in the <italic>Jra<sup>1A109</sup>/CyO</italic> allele.
