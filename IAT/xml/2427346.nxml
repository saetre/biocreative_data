However, the mechanisms by which this interaction occurs remain unclear. Our previous study has shown that activation of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors inhibits <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) currents in PFC pyramidal neurons by disrupting microtubule-based transport of NMDARs. Here we found that activation of 5-HT<sub>2A/C</sub> receptors significantly attenuated the effect of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> on NMDAR currents and microtubule depolymerization. The counteractive effect of 5-HT<sub>2A/C</sub> on 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> regulation of synaptic NMDAR response was also observed in PFC pyramidal neurons from intact animals treated with various 5-HT-related drugs. Moreover, 5-HT<sub>2A/C</sub> stimulation triggered the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in dendritic processes. Inhibition of the &#x003b2;-arrestin/Src/dynamin signaling blocked 5-HT<sub>2A/C</sub> activation of ERK and the counteractive effect of 5-HT<sub>2A/C</sub> on 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> regulation of NMDAR currents. Immunocytochemical studies showed that 5-HT<sub>2A/C</sub> treatment blocked the inhibitory effect of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> on surface NR2B clusters on dendrites, which was prevented by cellular knockdown of &#x003b2;-arrestins. Taken together, our study suggests that serotonin, via 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2A/C</sub> receptor activation, regulates NMDAR functions in PFC neurons in a counteractive manner. 5-HT<sub>2A/C</sub>, by activating ERK via the &#x003b2;-arrestin-dependent pathway, opposes the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> disruption of microtubule stability and NMDAR transport. These findings provide a framework for understanding the complex interactions between serotonin and NMDARs in PFC, which could be important for cognitive and emotional control in which both systems are highly involved.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p><italic>Author's Choice</italic>&#x02014;Final version full access.</p></fn><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported, in whole or in part, by <grant-sponsor>National Institutes of Health</grant-sponsor> Grants <grant-num>MH63128</grant-num> and <grant-num>NS48911</grant-num>.

The pleiotropic functions of serotonin are afforded by the concerted actions of multiple 5-HT receptor subtypes, 5-HT<sub>1</sub>- to 5-HT<sub>7</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>). Mice lacking 5-HT receptors exhibit phenotypes ranging from increased anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>), to elevated aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>), to antidepressant-like behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>). One of the major targets of serotonin is prefrontal cortex (PFC), a crucial brain region controlling emotion and cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). Several lines of evidence have shown that 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors, which are abundantly co-expressed in most of PFC pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>), often have opposing actions on common substrates. For instance, activation of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors results in neuronal inhibition by increasing potassium currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>) and decreasing calcium currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). In contrast, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor stimulation leads to neuronal excitation by suppressing potassium currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>) and enhancing pre-synaptic glutamate release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). Moreover, elevated 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors and reduced 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors are found in PFC of schizophrenia patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>), suggesting that the levels of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors are differentially altered in diseased states.</p><p>One of the potential cellular targets of 5-HT receptors involved in cognitive and emotional control is the NMDA-type glutamate receptor, a ligand-gated ion channel that has been implicated in the pathophysiology of mental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>). NMDAR hypofunction caused by systemic administration of non-competitive NMDAR antagonists or knockdown of NMDAR expression produces schizophrenia-like behavioral symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>). Moreover, it has been found that the expression of NMDARs is reduced in postmortem brains of depressed patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>), and chronic antidepressant treatment enhances NMDAR levels in mouse brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>). Our previous study has shown that activation of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors suppresses NMDAR channel function in PFC pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>). It remains unknown whether 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor activation has any impact on the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>-NMDAR interaction.</p><p>Here we show that activation of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2A/C</sub> receptors in PFC pyramidal neurons regulates NMDAR channels in a counteractive manner by converging on the microtubule-based transport of NMDARs that is regulated by ERK. Given the importance of NMDAR and serotonin in mental processes under normal and pathological conditions, the complex regulation of NMDAR function by 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2A/C</sub> receptors may provide a molecular and cellular mechanism underlying the role of serotonin in regulating cognitive and emotional behaviors.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Whole Cell Recordings</italic>&#x02014;Whole cell current recordings of cultured PFC neurons employed standard voltage-clamp techniques as those we described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>). The external solution for recording NMDAR-mediated current contained (in m<sc>m</sc>): 127 NaCl, 20 CsCl, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 5 BaCl<sub>2</sub>, 12 glucose, 0.001 tetrodotoxin, and glycine 0.02, pH 7.3&#x02013;7.4, 300&#x02013;305 mos<sc>m</sc>/liter. The internal solution contained (in m<sc>m</sc>): 180 <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-glucamine, 4 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 40 HEPES, 0.5 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-<italic>N,N,N</italic>&#x02032;,<italic>N</italic>&#x02032;-tetraacetic acid, 12 phosphocreatine, 3 Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, and 0.5 Na<sub>2</sub>GTP, 0.1 leupeptin, pH 7.2-3, 265&#x02013;270 mos<sc>m</sc>/liter. Recordings were obtained with an Axon Instruments (Union City, CA) 200B patch clamp amplifier that was monitored by an IBM PC running pClamp 8 with a DigiData 1320 series interface. Electrode resistances were normally 2&#x02013;4 M&#x003a9; in bath solution. Following seal rupture, series resistance (4&#x02013;10 M&#x003a9;) was compensated (70&#x02013;90%). Attention was applied to monitor the series resistance, and recordings were stopped when a significant increase (&#x0003e;20%) occurred. The whole cell NMDAR-mediated current was evoked by NMDA (100 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) application for 2 s every 30 s with neurons held at &#x02013;60 mV. Drugs were applied with a &#x0201c;sewer pipe&#x0201d; system. The array of drug capillaries was positioned a few hundred micrometers from the cell under recording. Solution changes were controlled by the SF-77B fast-step solution stimulus delivery device (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). Data were analyzed with AxoGraph (Axon instruments) and KaleidaGraph (Albeck Software). ANOVA was performed to compare the differential degrees of current regulation between experimental groups subjected to different drug treatment. Data are expressed as the mean &#x000b1; S.E.</p><p><italic>Electrophysiological Recordings in Slices</italic>&#x02014;To record NMDAR-mediated synaptic transmission, we performed the standard whole cell recording techniques in layer V PFC pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>). Patch pipettes (5&#x02013;9 M&#x003a9;) were filled with the following internal solution (in m<sc>m</sc>): 130 cesium methanesulfonate, 10 CsCl, 4 NaCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 5 EGTA, 2.2 QX-314, 12 phosphocreatine, 5 MgATP, 0.5 Na<sub>2</sub>GTP, 0.1 leupeptin, pH 7.2&#x02013;7.3, 265&#x02013;270 mos<sc>m</sc>/liter. PFC slices (300 &#x003bc;m) were perfused at room temperature (22&#x02013;24 &#x000b0;C), with artificial cerebrospinal fluid was bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub> containing 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (20 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) and bicuculline (10 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) to block &#x003b1;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionic acid/kainite receptors and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, respectively. Neurons were observed with a 40&#x000d7; water-immersion lens and illuminated with near infrared IR light, and the image was captured with an IR-sensitive charge-coupled device camera. All recordings were performed using a Multiclamp 700A amplifier. Upon application of negative pressure, the membrane was tightly sealed with resistance (2&#x02013;10 G&#x003a9;). With additional suction, the membrane was disrupted into the whole cell configuration. The access resistances ranged from 13 to 18 M&#x003a9; with 50&#x02013;70% compensation. Evoked currents were generated with a pulse from a stimulation isolation unit controlled by an S48 pulse generator (Astro-Med). A bipolar stimulating electrode (Fredrick Haer Company) was positioned &#x0223c;100&#x003bc;m from the neuron upon recording. Prior to stimulation, neurons (clamped at &#x02013;70 mV) were depolarized to +60 mV for 3 s to fully eliminate the voltage-dependent Mg<sup>2+</sup> block of NMDAR. Age-matched saline controls were done side-by-side with drug-injected animals on each day of experiments. To minimize variations between slices, the stimulus with the same intensity was delivered by the stimulating electrode placed at the same location. Data analyses were performed with the Clampfit software (Axon Instruments).</p><p>The agents we used include serotonin, 8-hydroxy-2(di-<italic>n</italic>-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), &#x003b1;-Me-5HT, (&#x02013;)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine, ketanserin, benzothiazole, colchicine (Sigma), dynamin inhibitory peptide (Tocris), 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(<italic>t</italic>-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-<italic>d</italic>]pyrimidine (PP2) and 4-amino-7-phenylpyrazol[3,4-<italic>d</italic>]pyrimidine (PP3) (Calbiochem). They were made up as concentrated stocks in water or DMSO and stored at &#x02013;20 &#x000b0;C. Stocks were thawed and diluted immediately prior to experiments.</p><p><italic>Animal Treatment</italic>&#x02014;Young male rats (25&#x02013;28 days old) were administered intraperitoneally with the drugs as described in the text. For stereotaxic injection, rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg intraperitoneal) and then mounted into a stereotaxic apparatus (David Kopf Instruments). Fluoxetine (fluox) (2 &#x003bc;l, 0.34 mg/ml, dissolved in saline) were injected unilaterally into the PFC region using a Hamilton syringe (22-gauge needle) at a rate of 0.5 &#x003bc;l/min. The coordinates of the lateral PFC used are 1.0&#x02013;1.4 mm lateral from midline, 2.2 mm anterior to Bregma, and 3.3 mm dorsal to ventral.</p><p><italic>Small Interfering RNA</italic>&#x02014;To knock down the endogenous &#x003b2;-arrestin expression, we used the small interfering RNA (siRNA) that specifically targets &#x003b2;-arrestin1 or &#x003b2;-arrestin2 mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>). The siRNA oligonucleotide sequences were: 5&#x02032;-GGCGAGUCUACGUGACACUtt-3&#x02032; (for &#x003b2;-arrestin1) and 5&#x02032;-GGACCGGAASGUGUUUGUGtt-3&#x02032; (for &#x003b2;-arrestin2). The siRNA (purchased from Ambion, Austin, TX) was co-transfected with enhanced GFP into cultured PFC neurons (11 days <italic>in vitro</italic>) using the Lipofectamine 2000 method. Biochemical, immunocytochemical, or electrophysiological experiments were performed in neurons after 2&#x02013;3 days of transfection.</p><p><italic>Measurement of Free Tubulin</italic>&#x02014;Free tubulin from PFC cultures was extracted as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>). Cultured PFC neurons (2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup>, 14 days <italic>in vitro</italic>) in 3.5-cm dishes were washed twice at 37 &#x000b0;C with 1 ml of microtubule stabilizing buffer containing (0.1 <sc>m</sc> MES (pH 6.75), 1 m<sc>m</sc> MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 2 m<sc>m</sc> EGTA, 0.1 m<sc>m</sc> EDTA, and 4 <sc>m</sc> glycerol). Cultures were then incubated at 37 &#x000b0;C for 5 min in 600 &#x003bc;l of soluble tubulin extraction buffer (0.1 <sc>m</sc> MES (pH 6.75), 1 m<sc>m</sc> MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 2 m<sc>m</sc> EGTA, 0.1 m<sc>m</sc> EDTA, 4 <sc>m</sc> glycerol, and 0.1% Triton X-100) with the addition of protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science). The soluble extract was centrifuged at 37 &#x000b0;C for 2 min, and the supernatant was collected. Equal amounts of total protein were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-&#x003b1;-tubulin (Sigma).

Briefly, cultured PFC neurons were treated with various agents after transfection, and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature without permeabilization. After incubating in 5% bovine serum albumin to block nonspecific staining, cells were incubated with the anti-GFP antibody (1:100, Chemicon, Temecula, CA) for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes in phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated with a rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (1: 200, Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline, coverslips were mounted on slides with Vectashield mounting media (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Fluorescence images were detected using a 60&#x000d7; objective with a cooled charge-coupled device camera mounted on a Nikon microscope.</p><p>The surface GFP-NR2B clusters were analyzed with ImageJ software. All specimens were imaged under identical conditions and analyzed with identical parameters. A 50-&#x003bc;m segment of dendrite was selected from the equal distance away from the soma of four to six individual neurons. To define dendritic clusters, a single threshold was selected manually. Signal was counted as clusters when its intensity was 2- to 3-fold greater than the overall fluorescence on the dendritic shaft. Three to four independent experiments were performed. Quantitative analyses were performed blindly without knowledge of experimental conditions.</p><p><italic>Biochemical Measurement of Surface Receptors</italic>&#x02014;After treatment, PFC slices were incubated with artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing 1 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) for 20 min on ice. The slices were then rinsed three times in Tris-buffered saline to quench the biotin reaction, followed by homogenization in 300 &#x003bc;l of modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 50 m<sc>m</sc> NaPO<sub>4</sub>, 150 m<sc>m</sc> NaCl, 2 m<sc>m</sc> EDTA, 50 m<sc>m</sc> NaF, 10 m<sc>m</sc> sodium pyrophosphate, 1 m<sc>m</sc> sodium orthovanadate, 1 m<sc>m</sc> phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mg/ml leupeptin).

To examine the potential interactions between 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2A/C</sub> receptors on NMDAR functions, we tested the impact of 5-HT<sub>2</sub> activation on 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> regulation of NMDAR currents by preincubating PFC cultures with the 5-HT<sub>2A/C</sub> agonist &#x003b1;-Me-5HT (20 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>, 10&#x02013;30 min). Application of NMDA (100 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) elicited an inward current that was partially desensitized and was completely eliminated by the NMDA receptor antagonist <sc>d</sc>-aminophosphonovalerate (50 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>). As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 (<italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>)</xref>, application of the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> agonist 8-OH-DPAT (20 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) reversibly reduced NMDAR currents (21.3 &#x000b1; 0.7%, <italic>n</italic> = 16). However, in &#x003b1;-Me-5HT-treated neurons, the reduction of NMDAR current by 8-OH-DPAT was substantially attenuated (6.4 &#x000b1; 0.7%, <italic>n</italic> = 8). &#x003b1;-Me-5HT alone did not significantly affect NMDAR currents (1 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>: 4.0 &#x000b1; 0.8%, <italic>n</italic> = 5; 20 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>: 5.7 &#x000b1; 1.4%, <italic>n</italic> = 7). Another 5-HT<sub>2A/C</sub> agonist DOI also had no effect on NMDAR currents at low doses (0.05 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>: 4.2 &#x000b1; 1.2%, <italic>n</italic> = 5; 0.1 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>: 4.0 &#x000b1; 2.5%, <italic>n</italic> = 5), which are different from the inhibitory effect of DOI shown before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>). The discrepancy may be due to different experimental procedures in recording NMDA-induced currents. In a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>), microdrops of NMDA (1 m<sc>m</sc>, every 15 min) were applied to PFC slices, which did not allow the accurate detection of peak NMDA currents because of the slow diffusion of the ligand. Moreover, it was not a pure postsynaptic preparation like dissociated neurons, which could have indirect effects due to changes in the circuit. Our results suggest that 5-HT<sub>2A/C</sub> activation alone does not directly affect NMDAR currents but opposes 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> regulation of NMDAR currents in PFC pyramidal neurons.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>FIGURE 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Inhibition of 5-HT<sub>2A/C</sub> receptors unmasks the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> -mediated reduction of NMDAR-EPSC in response to 5-HT.</bold><italic>A</italic>, representative NMDAR-EPSC traces (average of three trials) showing the regulation of NMDAR-EPSC by 5-HT (10, 40, or 100 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) in neurons treated with or without the 5-HT<sub>2A/C</sub> antagonist ketanserin (<italic>ket</italic>, 20 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>). <italic>Scale bars</italic>: 100 pA, 100 ms. <italic>B</italic>, dose-response curves summarizing the percentage reduction of NMDAR-EPSC by different concentrations of 5-HT in neurons treated with or without ketanserin. *, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001, ANOVA.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc0290841690002"></graphic></fig></p><p>We further tested the influence of 5-HT<sub>2</sub> activation on 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> regulation of NMDAR-EPSC mediated by synaptic NMDA receptors in PFC slices.

To test this, we performed immunocytochemical experiments in cultured PFC neurons transfected with GFP-tagged NR2B subunits (the GFP tag is positioned at the extracellular N terminus of NR2B). Surface NR2B receptors were detected with the anti-GFP primary antibody, followed by rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody in non-permeabilized conditions. Consistent with our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>), application of 8-OH-DPAT (40 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>, 5 min), caused a marked reduction in the number and size of surface NR2B clusters (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic></xref>), as compared with control neurons (cluster density: 43.6 &#x000b1; 1.7 clusters/50 &#x003bc;m in controls <italic>versus</italic> 22.7 &#x000b1; 0.8 clusters/50 &#x003bc;m in DPAT-treated cells; cluster size: 0.33 &#x000b1; 0.02 &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup> in controls <italic>versus</italic> 0.18 &#x000b1; 0.02 &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup> in DPAT-treated cells (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9<italic>G</italic></xref>).

Surface biotinylation experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>) were performed to measure levels of surface NR1 and NR2B in PFC slices from animals intraperitoneally injected with fluoxetine (20 mg/kg). Surface proteins were labeled with Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin, and then biotinylated surface proteins were separated from non-labeled intracellular proteins by reaction with NeutrAvidin beads.

Because serotonin has multiple receptor subtypes, systemic elevation of serotonin can induce diverse physiological effects in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>). The molecular mechanisms for serotonin to regulate cellular targets through different subtypes of receptors remain to be identified. We have previously found that 5-HT<sub>2</sub> and 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors are linked to regulate GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>), whereas 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors are linked to regulate NMDA receptors in PFC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>). The specific coupling of different 5-HT receptors to distinct ion channels allows serotonin to regulate multiple targets in a precise but flexible manner. Here, we provide evidence showing that the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> regulation of NMDARs can be modified by 5-HT<sub>2A/C</sub> receptor activation, which provides a mechanism to fine-tune the effect of serotonin on NMDAR-mediated synaptic transmission and plasticity.</p><p>Under normal physiological conditions, which of the one or more 5-HT receptors in PFC pyramidal neurons that are activated by serotonin is determined by the serotonergic projection from dorsal raphe to cellular compartments rich in different subtypes of receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>). Agonist binding studies indicate that 5-HT<sub>1</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptors have different affinities (nanomolar <italic>versus</italic> low micromolar) to 5-HT, suggesting that 5-HT<sub>1</sub> receptor activation may play a dominant role in response to serotonin. Microdialysis studies have shown that synaptic concentration of serotonin can reach up to 6 m<sc>m</sc> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>), suggesting that sometimes all 5-HT receptors could be fully activated at synapses. Both 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors are expressed at dendritic shafts and spines of PFC pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>), where NMDA receptors are abundant, prompting us to speculate that both receptors may interact with NMDA receptors in synergistic or opposite ways. Our studies in PFC pyramidal neurons from both acute slices and intact animals treated with various 5-HT-related drugs indicate that blocking 5-HT<sub>2A/C</sub> receptors unmasks the ability of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors to reduce NMDAR currents, suggesting that 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2A/C</sub> receptors converge on NMDAR channels in a counteractive manner. Similar to serotonin, it has been shown that, in response to dopamine, D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> receptors that are linked to distinct signaling cascades regulate cortical GABAergic inhibition in an opposing manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>).</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig10"><label>FIGURE 10.</label><caption><p><bold>The surface NMDAR level is reduced in PFC from fluoxetine-injected animals.</bold><italic>A</italic>, Western blot analysis showing the surface and total NR1, NR2B, and GABA<sub>A</sub>R &#x003b2;2 subunits in lysates of PFC slices taken from animals receiving a single intraperitoneal injection of saline, fluoxetine, ketanserin, ketanserin plus fluoxetine, WAY-100635, or WAY-100635 plus fluoxetine (all drugs are 20 mg/kg). <italic>B</italic>, quantification of surface NMDAR subunits in PFC slices from animals treated with different drugs. *, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01; **, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001; ANOVA.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc0290841690010"></graphic></fig></p><p>Our previous study has shown that activation of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors suppresses NMDAR currents by reducing microtubule stability and the ensuing NMDAR trafficking along dendritic microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>). In this study, we found that activation of 5-HT<sub>2A/C</sub> receptor opposes the ability of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> to induce microtubule depolymerization, suggesting that microtubule dynamics and the microtubule-based NMDAR transport are regulated by 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2A/C</sub> receptors in a counteractive fashion.</p><p>The stability of microtubules is regulated by different microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) in distinct neuronal compartments. The phosphorylation state of MAP2, a dendrite-specific MAP, determines the ability of MAP2 to associate and stabilize dendritic microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>). One key signaling molecule that regulates MAP2 phosphorylation is ERK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>). Our previous study suggests that 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> activation suppresses ERK activity, which leads to the decreased MAP2 phosphorylation, MAP2-microtubule interaction, and microtubule stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>). It is possible that 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2A/C</sub> oppositely regulates ERK activity, thereby controlling microtubule stability in a counteractive manner. Consistently, our biochemical and immunocytochemical data show that 5-HT<sub>2A/C</sub> activation potently enhances ERK activity in the dendrites of PFC cultures.</p><p>How does the 5-HT<sub>2A/C</sub> receptor activate ERK? Phospholipase C and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, two downstream molecules of classic 5-HT<sub>2</sub> signaling, are not involved in this regulation (data not shown). Recent studies have suggested that the scaffolding protein &#x003b2;-arrestin, which binds to the third intracellular loop of certain G protein-coupled receptors, induces ERK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>). 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors are found to bind purified &#x003b2;-arrestin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>). However, whether 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> activates mitogen-activated protein kinase via &#x003b2;-arrestin pathway is essentially unknown. Our data show that knockdown of &#x003b2;-arrestin1/2 not only blocks the 5-HT<sub>2A/C</sub>-induced ERK activation but also eliminates the counteractive effect of 5-HT<sub>2A/C</sub> on 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> reduction of NMDAR currents. In addition, we found that the 5-HT<sub>2A/C</sub> action is dependent on Src activation and clarthin/dynamin-mediated endocytosis of the receptor. Taken together, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, via the &#x003b2;-arrestin/Src/dynamin cascade, induces ERK activation to oppose the effect of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> on NMDAR functions.</p><p>Several mechanisms have been proposed for the regulation of NMDAR functions, including altering the phosphorylation state and biophysical properties of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>) and changing NMDAR trafficking and channel numbers at the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>). Our previous finding suggests that 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> decreases surface NR2B clusters in a microtubule-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>), consistent with the role of cytoskeleton-based transport on NMDAR insertion to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref>). Our immunocytochemical data show that the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> reduction of surface NR2B clusters is attenuated by pretreatment with a 5-HT<sub>2A/C</sub> agonist, confirming that 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2A/C</sub> oppositely regulate NMDAR trafficking. Moreover, 5-HT<sub>2A/C</sub> opposes the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> reduction of surface NR2B clusters in a &#x003b2;-arrestin-dependent manner, consistent with the &#x003b2;-arrestin dependence of the 5-HT<sub>2A/C</sub> action on 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> regulation of NMDAR currents. Surface biotinylation experiments using PFC from intact animals subject to acute fluoxetine treatment have also confirmed the results found in cultured neurons.</p><p>Based on the experimental data, we speculate that, in response to serotonin, both 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2A/C</sub> receptors localized in PFC pyramidal neurons are activated, which converge to regulate NMDAR trafficking and function in an opposite manner, by coupling to distinct signaling cascades and differentially affecting microtubule stability. This study may provide significant insights into the complex regulation of NMDAR-mediated synaptic transmission and plasticity by different serotonin receptors in the PFC network.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Xiaoqing Chen for technical support.</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal">Buhot, M.
