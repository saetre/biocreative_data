A significant number of children with acute OM will go on to develop OM with effusion or chronic OM. The high prevalence of the disease, coupled with its recurrent and chronic nature, accounts for the large number of tympanostomies, the insertion of ventilation tubes or 'grommets' in the tympanic membrane, undertaken in affected children. OM is still the most common cause of surgery in children in the developed world. However, this and other treatments are largely ineffective.</p><p>There is evidence from studies of the human population that there is a significant genetic component predisposing to recurrent or chronic OM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], yet little is known about the underlying genetic pathways involved. From a deafness screen as part of the MRC Harwell mouse mutagenesis programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] we have identified two novel dominant mutants, <italic>Jeff </italic>and <italic>Junbo</italic>, which develop a conductive deafness due to a chronic suppurative OM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Both these mutants represent the first models for chronic forms of middle ear inflammatory disease in humans, and both of these mutants have now been cloned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The gene underlying the <italic>Jeff </italic>mutant was identified as <italic>Fbxo11</italic>, a member of the F-box family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The <italic>Jeff </italic>mutant carries a non-conservative glutamine to leucine change at amino acid 491. F-box proteins function as part of an SCF (SKP1-cullin-F-box) E3 protein ligase complex, recognizing and binding phosphorylated proteins and promoting their ubiquitination and degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, the substrate of Fbxo11 is unknown. It has been demonstrated that <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans </italic>DRE-1, an orthologue of human FBXO11, and the SKP1-like homologue SKR-1 function as part of an E3 ligase complex, as does its human counterpart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. There is also evidence that FBXO11 has arginine methyltransferase activity, catalyzing arginine methylation, but with a structure different from all other known protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. PRMT activity was not however detected for DRE-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Recently it has been demonstrated that FBXO11 can function as a Nedd8-ligase for the tumour suppressor protein p53, promoting the neddylation of p53 and inhibiting its transcriptional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. p53 is a partner of Smad2 in the activation of multiple transforming growth factor &#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;) target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>We previously reported that mice homozygous for the <italic>Jeff </italic>mutation die within a few hours of birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Newborn <italic>Jeff </italic>homozygotes have cleft palate, facial clefting, impairment of respiratory function and an eyes-open at birth (EOB) phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. TGF-&#x003b2; signalling has been shown to be involved in all of these processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. For these reasons it will be important to understand the role of <italic>Fbxo11 </italic>in mouse developmental processes and in particular the impact of mutations on the TGF-&#x003b2; signalling pathway.</p><p>The TGF-&#x003b2; superfamily is composed of a large number of cytokines involved in a variety of cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, epithelial mesenchymal transformation and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. They mediate their effects from membrane to nucleus through combinations of type I and type II serine/threonine kinase receptors (TGF&#x003b2;R-I and TGF&#x003b2;R-II) and their downstream effectors, Smad proteins. Certain receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads) become phosphorylated by activated type I receptors and form a heteromeric complex with a common-partner Smad4. Once formed, this R-Smad/Smad4 complex translocates to the nucleus and, in conjunction with other nuclear cofactors, regulates the transcription of target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Two different Smad signalling branches have been described. The TGF-&#x003b2; sub-family ligands TGF-&#x003b2;, Activins and Nodals, are transduced by Smad2 and Smad3. In contrast, BMP sub-family ligands are transduced by Smad1, Smad5 and Smad8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>TGF-&#x003b2; signalling is controlled by many mechanisms, including ubiquitin-mediated proteosomal degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. A key component of ubiquitination, the ubiquitin ligase (E3), controls the specificity and timing of Smad ubiquitination. The E3 ubiquitin ligases, Smad ubiquitination-related factor 1 and 2 (Smurf1 and 2), have been identified as regulators of TGF-&#x003b2; signalling targeting Smad1 for ubiquitination and degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. At higher expression levels, Smurf2 also lowers protein levels of Smad2, but not Smad3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In addition to regulation of steady-state levels of R-Smads, the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway is also involved in the degradation of activated R-Smads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Smurf2 exhibits higher binding affinity to activated Smad2 upon TGF-&#x003b2; stimulation, and Smurf2 is a candidate E3 ligase for activated Smad2 degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Roc1, a component of an SCF complex, interacts and promotes degradation of activated Smad3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. MFB-1, a novel F-box-type ubiquitin ligase, negatively regulates Dauer formation in <italic>C. elegans </italic>by modulating DAF-7/TGF-&#x003b2;-like signalling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. More recently, Arkadia, a RING-domain E3 ubiquitin ligase, has been shown to interact with and ubiquitinate phospho-Smad2/3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. At the same time, Arkadia enhances transcription, thus coupling turnover of phospho-Smad2/3 to activity.</p><p>We have set out to explore the role of <italic>Fbxo11 </italic>in development and to relate the <italic>Jeff </italic>homozygous mutant phenotype to the underlying mechanisms of <italic>Fbxo11 </italic>function. Given the findings of a palatal and EOB phenotype in <italic>Jeff </italic>mice and the role of TGF-&#x003b2; signalling in these processes, we have focused our studies on salient members of the TGF-&#x003b2; family signalling pathway and demonstrated that pSmad2 is upregulated in the epithelia of <italic>Jeff </italic>homozygotes. Moreover, we have utilized compound mutants to assess genetic interactions and throw light on the genetic pathways affected. Mice heterozygous for both <italic>Jeff </italic>and <italic>Smad2 </italic>mutations recapitulate the <italic>Jeff </italic>homozygote phenotype in the palate and lungs. However, we failed to detect any interaction between <italic>Fbxo11 </italic>and <italic>Smad2</italic>, suggesting they are indirect partners in the development of these tissues. Our observations support a model whereby in palate, eyelid and lung <italic>Fbxo11</italic>-dependent modification is required to limit the accumulation of pSmad2 in the nucleus of epithelial cells of palatal shelves, eyelids and airways of the lungs. Overall, we conclude that <italic>Fbxo11 </italic>is involved with the regulation of TGF-&#x003b2; signalling, a finding that has implications for the chronic middle ear inflammatory phenotype that is observed in <italic>Jeff </italic>heterozygotes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p><italic>Jeff </italic>homozygote mutant mice develop a variety of epithelial developmental abnormalities, including palatal and EOB phenotypes. We used immunohistochemistry (IHC) to study protein expression and localization of members of the TGF-&#x003b2; signalling pathway (TGF&#x003b2;-3, TGF&#x003b2;R-I, Smad2, Smad3 and Smad4) in <italic>Jeff </italic>mutants in both palatal and eye tissues at relevant developmental stages. Given the apparent involvement of Fbxo11 in epithelial development, we also investigated the expression of these TGF-&#x003b2; signalling pathway members in lung development.</p><sec><title>Palatal expression in Jeff mutants</title><p><italic>Jeff </italic>homozygote palatal shelves start to grow and lift on time, but they fail to fuse at the right developmental stage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>) and homozygote mice are born with cleft palate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). This is reminiscent of TGF-&#x003b2;3 mutant mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. To characterize the distribution pattern of TGF-&#x003b2; ligands, TGF-&#x003b2; receptors and Smads in the developing palates, we examined embryonic heads from wild-type and homozygote <italic>Jeff </italic>(<italic>Jf/Jf</italic>) mice by IHC (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The result revealed one major difference in the pattern and localization of pSmad2. In wild types at embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5), as the midline epithelial seam was disrupted and medial edge epithelium (MEE) disappeared, pSmad2 was largely confined to the oral/nasal triangle area as a nuclear and cytoplasmic stain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). In contrast, in <italic>Jf/Jf </italic>mice at E15.5 an increased number of epithelial cells are positive for pSmad2 in the palatal shelves concentrated to the tip of the palatal epithelium and the oral/nasal palatal epithelial cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). Moreover, in <italic>Jf/Jf </italic>palates at E15.5 pSmad2 was present as a nuclear stain in the majority of the cells. In homozygote mice 57% of epithelial cells in the palate showed a nuclear localization of pSmad2, compared with 27% in wild-type mice (<italic>P </italic>= 0.000255). There was a commensurate significant decrease in cells showing a cytoplasmic localization in <italic>Jf/Jf </italic>mice compared with wild-type mice. TGF-&#x003b2;3, TGF&#x003b2;R-I, TGF&#x003b2;R-II, Smad2, Smad4, Smurf2 and also Fbox11, in both wild-type and <italic>Jf/Jf </italic>mice, were localized to the cytoplasm of the epithelial cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). There was no difference in the distribution of activated Smad2 in wild-type and homozygote palates before the fusion (E14.5) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Cleft palate phenotype</bold>. <bold>a</bold>.

We have applied the same panel of antibodies used on the palates to sections of E16 eyelids from both wild-type and <italic>Jf/Jf </italic>mice. These studies revealed similar results to those observed on palates. The majority of localization of pSmad2 in wild-type E16 eyelids was cytoplasmic. The staining was confined to the epidermis only (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>). In <italic>Jf/Jf </italic>mice more cells are positive for pSmad2 than in wild type. Moreover, pSmad2 was present as a nuclear stain in the majority of the cells of the epidermis. In homozygote mice 66% of epithelial cells in the upper eyelids and 56% of epithelial cells in the lower eyelids showed nuclear localization of pSmad2, compared with 11% and 17% in the wild-type mice (<italic>P </italic>= 0.000333, <italic>P </italic>= 0.0000473) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>).

Examination of pSmad2 expression in <italic>Jf/Jf </italic>lungs revealed a similar picture to that which we had previously observed in both the eyelids and the palate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>).

We investigated the impact of the <italic>Jeff </italic>mutation on the TGF-&#x003b2; signalling pathway, paying particular attention to those members of the pathway that have a role in epithelial development.</p><p>In mammalian development the formation of the palate is a multi-step process, involving palatal shelf growth and elevation above the tongue, followed by fusion of the shelves and the disappearance of the MEE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Defects in any of these steps can lead to cleft palate, one of the most common birth defects in humans. Murine palatogenesis takes place between E11.5 and E15.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. All TGF-&#x003b2; ligands are known to be expressed at that stage in the developing palate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Amongst them, TGF-&#x003b2;3 is likely to be the most important in palatogenesis since mutation of the gene causes cleft palate in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In palate cultures from these mutant embryos, the fusion defect is rescued by endogenous TGF-&#x003b2;3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that TGF-&#x003b2;3 selectively regulates the disappearance of MEE during palatal fusion: TGF-&#x003b2;3 disintegrates the MEE basement membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Studies on the mechanism for MEE disappearance during palatal fusion suggests a role of TGF-&#x003b2;3 as an inducer of apoptosis &#x02013; cell death in TGF-&#x003b2;3 null palates is reduced at the time of fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Smad2 and Smad3, mediators of TGF-&#x003b2; signalling, are expressed in the MEE cells, but only Smad2 is phosphorylated during palatal fusion. Smad2 phosphorylation is temporo-spatially restricted to the MEE and correlates with the disappearance of the MEE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. TGF-&#x003b2;3 is required for phosphorylation of Smad2 in the MEE and the inhibition of MEE proliferation during palatal fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>Our studies using IHC to co-localize the TGF-&#x003b2;3 ligand, TGF-&#x003b2; receptors and Smads in developing palates revealed one major difference between wild-type and <italic>Jf/Jf </italic>mice. At E15.5 more epithelia cells are positive for pSmad2 in the homozygote palatal shelves than in the wild type. Moreover, we found that there was a substantial increase in nuclear localization of pSmad2 in <italic>Jf/Jf </italic>mice. This might suggest that the turnover of pSmad2 is stalled and pSmad2 accumulates in the nucleus, with consequent effects for TGF-&#x003b2; signalling in the epithelia.</p><p>TGF-&#x003b2;3 plays a role as an inhibitor of MEE proliferation during palatal fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and an inducer of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Using Ki67 as a marker for proliferation we did not observe increased proliferation in E14.5 and E15.5 palates of the <italic>Jeff </italic>homozygote MEE. However, we also stained for apoptotic cells using a caspase-3 antibody and found many fewer positive cells in <italic>Jeff </italic>homozygote E15.5 palates. It appears that in the presence of a mutation in <italic>Fbxo11</italic>, palatal fusion is inhibited and MEE cells are not able to progress to epithelial programmed cell death or epithelial-mesenchymal transformation.</p><p>The palatal shelves fusion is a permanent fusion, such as the fusion of the neural tube. During mammalian development some temporary fusions also occur for example, eyelid fusion, fusion of the digits and fusion of the pinnae of the ears to the scalp. The disjunction of the temporary fusions takes place after birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The eyelids develop at approximately the same time as the palatal shelves. They start to form at about E11.5, grow across the eye from E14 to E16 and, as the fusion progresses, the diminishing gap fills with a profusion of rounded cells that are extruded, flattened, and sloughed off from the area of completed fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Failure of the eyelids to grow and fuse in mice leads to the EOB defect. Mouse knockout studies have identified several signalling molecules involved in the control of embryonic eyelid closure and some of them are from the TGF-&#x003b2; family. Mutation in activin &#x003b2;B results in an EOB phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] similar to that observed in MEKK1-deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. TGF-&#x003b2;/activin signalling via the MEKK1-mediated JNK pathway is one pathway controlling eyelid closure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. MEKK1 is not required however for the classical TGF-&#x003b2;/activin pathway, which involves nuclear translocation of Smad proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Normally in mouse development, the eyelid fusion is complete by E16, but the eyelids of <italic>Jeff </italic>homozygote mice remain wide apart. The eyelids start to form the leading edge of the developing margins, but the leading edge is not extended and the eyelids do not reach each other. We applied the same panel of antibodies, employed on the palates, on sections of E16 eyelids. The expression pattern of TGF-&#x003b2;3 and the signalling receptor TGF&#x003b2;R-I are consistent with localization observed in the cytoplasm of the cells of the epidermis of both the developing wild-type and mutant eyelids. The distribution of non-activated Smads is also similar, but with pSmad2 there is a clear difference between the wild-type and homozygote eyelids. Activated Smad2 was present as a nuclear stain in the majority of the cells of the epidermis, the basal layer and also some cells from the dermis of the <italic>Jeff </italic>homozygote eyelids. In contrast, in wild-type eyelids the pSmad2 is localized in the cytoplasm of the epidermis. The difference is also time specific. At E15.5 before eyelid fusion the pattern and the localization of activated Smad2 is similar in wild type and <italic>Jf/Jf</italic>. These findings mirror and are consistent with the expression changes observed in the palate.</p><p>In the developing eyelid, as with the palate, we also studied proliferation and apoptosis in the <italic>Jeff </italic>homozygote. Using Ki67 as a marker for proliferation, we found that there was little difference between wild-type and mutant homozygotes in the number or distribution of cells stained. However, we found significantly lower staining with caspase-3 in the <italic>Jeff </italic>homozygote, indicating reduced rates of apoptosis. It would appear that, as with the palate, the absence of epithelial fusion prevents the transition to epithelial programmed cell death.</p><p>We show here that, in addition to palatal and eyelid development defects, the development of the lung in <italic>Jeff </italic>homozygotes is severely compromised. In the mouse, early lung development begins at about E9.5 with the formation of the paired lung buds and continues through the pseudoglandular phase at E9.5-16.5 when the bronchial and respiratory tree develops, and the canalicular phase E16.5-17.5 when vascularization occurs. During late lung development at E17.5-P4 the distal airways form saccular units (saccular stage) and the secondary septae divides these units during the alveolar stage at P5-28 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><p>Several studies have implicated TGF-&#x003b2; signalling in early lung development. Immunohistochemical studies on localization of the three TGF-&#x003b2; isoforms in the developing mouse embryo suggest that they play an important role in lung formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. TGF-&#x003b2; signalling is implicated in the negative regulation of lung growth and development during early lung organogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Recent expression data also indicates that active TGF-&#x003b2; signalling is required for normal late lung development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Gene-targeting studies also demonstrate the involvement of the TGF-&#x003b2; family in early and late lung morphogenesis. TGF-&#x003b2;3 null newborn mice have under-developed and poorly inflated lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The developmental delay is detectable as early as day E12.5, which implicates a role of TGF-&#x003b2;3 in early lung development. Retarded lung alveolarization and subsequent emphysema in Smad3 knockout mice, on the other hand, suggests a role for the TGF-&#x003b2;/Smad3 pathway in postnatal lung growth and emphysema prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. As the TGF-&#x003b2; family is involved in lung morphogenesis and reflecting the changes in pSmad2 expression and localization in the palate and eyelid, we have explored pSmad2 in the developing lung. Again, we find a significant increase in the expression of pSmad2. Most notably, there is a very marked increase in localization of pSmad2 to the nuclei of epithelial cells lining the airways.</p><p>Given the effects of the <italic>Fbxo11 </italic>mutation on pSmad2 in a variety of tissues, we decided to examine genetically the interaction between these two genes and generated <italic>Jf/+ Smad2/+ </italic>compound heterozygotes. Intriguingly, we found that <italic>Jf/+ Smad2/+ </italic>mice recapitulated many of the features of <italic>Jeff </italic>homozygotes, including the cleft palate, lung phenotype and post-natal mortality. The phenotypes of the <italic>Jf/+ Smad2/+ </italic>compound heterozygote are not fully penetrant. Around one-third of <italic>Jf/+ Smad2/+ </italic>mice survive but are much smaller than wild-type or single-mutant littermates. The developmental abnormalities observed in the <italic>Jf/+ Smad2/+ </italic>mice contrasts with the normal phenotype seen in <italic>Jf/+ </italic>mice and underlines the effects of the <italic>Fbxo11 </italic>mutation on pSmad2. It would appear that a complete absence of Fbxo11 function, with consequent effects on pSmad2 expression and localization, can lead to the epithelial developmental defects that we have observed. Alternatively, compromising levels of gene expression at both the <italic>Fbxo11 </italic>and <italic>Smad2 </italic>loci leads to the same phenotype.</p><p>Despite the effects of the <italic>Fbxo11 </italic>mutation, and the genetic interaction observed between Fbxo11 and Smad2, we failed to observe any biochemical interaction between Fbxo11 and Smad2. As expected we were able to demonstrate the known interaction between Smad2 and p53. It has been reported that Fbxo11 neddylates p53, inhibiting its transcriptional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, immunoprecipitations did not reveal an interaction in the tissues we tested. Indeed, <italic>Jf/+ p53/+ </italic>compound heterozygotes did not show any developmental phenotypes. Nevertheless, we found that <italic>Jeff </italic>homozygotes have markedly reduced levels of p53 and heterozygotes appeared to have intermediate levels. It appears that Fbxo11 is required for stabilisation of p53.</p><p>p53 is required for TGF-&#x003b2; responses through its interactions with Smads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. p53-deficient mammalian cells demonstrate impaired responses to TGF-&#x003b2; signals. Most importantly, p53 and Smad2 cooperated synergistically at target promoters for TGF-&#x003b2; signalling, and indeed they directly interact <italic>in vivo </italic>in a TGF-&#x003b2;-dependent fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. We propose that in the Jeff homozygous mutant, loss of <italic>Fbxo11 </italic>function leads to destabilisation of p53 by an unknown mechanism. It is possible, given the synergistic interaction between p53 and Smad2, that the loss of p53 at transcriptional targets leads to stalling and accumulation of pSmad2 in the nuclei of epithelial tissues of <italic>Jeff </italic>homozygotes. Mutant p53 leads to attenuation of TGF-&#x003b2;1 signalling including a reduction in Smad2/3 phosphorylation, inhibition of Smad2/Smad4 complex formation and Smad4 translocation to the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Overall, given the interaction between p53 and TGF-&#x003b2; signalling pathways, it seems likely that the effects of the <italic>Fbxo11 </italic>mutation on TGF-&#x003b2; signalling may be mediated through effects on p53.</p><p>Chronic and recurrent OM in the human population is known to have a very significant genetic component, yet little is known about the underlying genes or pathways involved. Moreover, although a number of mouse strains are available that show OM, they are complicated by poor penetrance or the complex syndromic nature of the disease. <italic>Jeff </italic>heterozygotes develop a highly penetrant chronic suppurative OM in the absence of any other significant pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and thus the <italic>Jeff </italic>mutant represents a powerful model for studying the genetic and pathophysiological bases of chronic/recurrent OM. The discovery of the <italic>Fbxo11 </italic>gene underlying the Jeff mutant identified an important candidate for the study of OM in the human population. Indeed, initial studies with FBXO11 SNPs in human OM families have demonstrated nominal evidence of association, indicating the genetic involvement of human FBXO11 with chronic and recurrent OM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The studies reported here support a role for Fbxo11 in TGF-&#x003b2; signalling and suggest that perturbations in this pathway may underlie chronic inflammation in the middle ear.

Negative control sections were incubated with serum instead of the antibody and otherwise processed identically.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoprecipitation</title><p>Protein samples from lungs of E15.5 wild-type embryos were prepared by homogenizing in phosphate buffer solution, containing 1% triton X100, 0.5% deoxycholic acid and cocktail of protease inhibitors. The samples were incubated with 2 mM 3,3'-Dithiobis [sulfosuccinimidylpropionate] (DTSSP) cross-linker for 30 min at room temperature and treated as described by the manufacturer (PIERCE, 21578). Total protein extract of 1 mg was pre-cleared with 15 &#x003bc;l Sepharose-protein G beads (Sigma) for 1 h at 4&#x000b0;C with rotation. The pre-cleared extract was incubated with 4 &#x003bc;g of antibody (Smad 2, p53) overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. Twenty microlitres of protein G beads was added and allowed to bind for 3 h at 4&#x000b0;C with rotation. Beads were washed four times with 500 &#x003bc;l of extraction buffer and resuspended in electrophoresis loading buffer/reducing agent (NuPAGE, Invitrogen). As a negative control, an identical reaction was prepared where goat IgG (for Smad2) or mouse IgG (for p53) was used instead of the specific antibody. Cross-linking reversal was achieved by incubation at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 min, after which samples were heated at 70&#x000b0;C for 10 min and resolved in NuPAGE 7% Tris-Acetate gels (Invitrogen). Only one third of the total reaction was loaded per lane.</p></sec><sec><title>Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation</title><p>For the fractionation CelLytic NuCLEAR Extraction kit (Sigma, NXTRACT) was used. E15.5 lungs were lysed in 1&#x000d7; lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors using a glass homogenizer. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation and the cytoplasmic fraction obtained by retaining the supernatant. The nuclear extracts were obtained by resuspending the nuclei pellet in extraction buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors, rocking the pellet for 30 min and subsequent centrifugation. Twenty micrograms of each protein sample was loaded on each lane.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot</title><p>Gels were blotted onto PVDF (GE Healthcare) and blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% dry skimmed milk and 0.1% Tween 20. Antibodies were diluted in blocking solution at 1:250 (anti-p53), 1:500 (anti-pSmad2), 1:500 (anti-FBOX11) or 1:10,000 (anti-rabbit-HRP). Incubation with primary antibodies proceeded overnight at 4&#x000b0;C and with secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed four times between antibodies and after secondary antibody in phosphate-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20. ECL Plus (GE Healthcare) was used as detection system.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>We used chi-squared test to compare the difference between the observed and the expected number of the double heterozygous mice from the two crosses. To evaluate the probability of the calculated chi-squared value the chidist function in Excel was used.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>HT carried out the immunostaining analysis, some of the proteomics analysis, contributed to the design of the study and the interpretation of the results and participated in drafting the manuscript. RH contributed to the analysis and discussion of the results. SM participated in the phenotyping and the genotyping of some of the mice, and MRR and HH performed most of the immunoprecipitations and western blot analysis and contributed to the interpretation of the results from these studies.
