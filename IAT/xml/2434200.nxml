Current studies indicate that FUS-DDIT3- liposarcoma develops from uncommitted progenitors. However, the precise mechanism whereby FUS-DDIT3 contributes to the differentiation arrest remains to be elucidated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Here we have characterized the adipocyte regulatory protein network in liposarcomas of FUS-DITT3 transgenic mice and showed that PPAR&#x003b3;2 and C/EBP&#x003b1; expression was altered. Consistent with <italic>in vivo</italic> data, FUS-DDIT3 MEFs and human liposarcoma cell lines showed a similar downregulation of both PPAR&#x003b3;2 and C/EBP&#x003b1; expression. Complementation studies with PPAR&#x003b3; but not C/EBP&#x003b1; rescued the differentiation block in committed adipocytic precursors expressing FUS-DDIT3. Our results further show that FUS-DDIT3 interferes with the control of initiation of translation by upregulation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factors eIF2 and eIF4E both in FUS-DDIT3 mice and human liposarcomas cell lines, explaining the shift towards the truncated p30 isoform of C/EBP&#x003b1; in liposarcomas. Suppression of the FUS-DDIT3 transgene did rescue this adipocyte differentiation block. Moreover, eIF4E was also strongly upregulated in normal adipose tissue of FUS-DDIT3 transgenic mice, suggesting that overexpression of eIF4E may be a primary event in the initiation of liposarcomas. Reporter assays showed FUS-DDIT3 is involved in the upregulation of eIF4E in liposarcomas and that both domains of the fusion protein are required for affecting eIF4E expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Taken together, this study provides evidence of the molecular mechanisms involve in the disruption of normal adipocyte differentiation program in liposarcoma harbouring the chimeric gene <italic>FUS-DDIT3</italic>.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Myxoid/round cell liposarcoma is the most common subtype of liposarcoma, accounting for about 40&#x00025; of all cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002569-US1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002569-Mack1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Despite ubiquitously expression of <italic>FUS-DDIT3</italic> oncogene, these mice exclusively developed liposarcomas, suggesting that FUS&#x02013;DDIT3 may impose an adipocytic program with a partial developmental blockade in mesenchymal cell progenitors. The immature nature of liposarcoma cell progenitors was confirmed by the generation of aP2-FUS-DDIT3 transgenic mice, where FUS-DDIT3, expressed in adipocytes, but not in progenitor cells, is not able to induce liposarcoma development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002569-PerezMancera1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

Many of the components of the gene regulatory network that controls the differentiation of adipocytes have been elucidated in studies of cultured 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and MEFs. These transcription factors are expressed as a cascade in which C/EBP&#x003b2; and C/EBP&#x003b4;, expressed during the first stages of the adipocyte differentiation program, induce the expression of C/EBP&#x003b1; and PPAR&#x003b3;, the master regulator of adipogenesis. A positive feedback loop mechanism between PPAR&#x003b3; and C/EBP&#x003b1; enhances their activities. This transcriptional cascade finishes with the expression of markers of mature adipocytes such as ap2, adiponectin and adipsin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002569-Rosen1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002569-Rosen3">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.

In an adipocytic context, the truncated isoforms of C/EBP&#x003b2; and C/EBP&#x003b1; (LIP and p30, respectively) have a negative effect on adipogenesis, while the full length isoforms (LAP and p42, respectively) enhance the adipocyte differentiation program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002569-Lin1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002569-Calkhoven1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The fact that FUS-DDIT3&#x02013;associated liposarcomas initiate in uncommitted progenitor cells and generate early adipocytic precursors indicate an important role for <italic>FUS-DDIT3</italic> in the control of early adipocytic development.

However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenotype.

We demonstrate that FUS-DDIT3 interferes with the PPAR&#x003b3; and C/EBP&#x003b1; activities. In addition, we show that the regulation of the translation machinery by FUS-DDIT3 plays an important role in the blockade of adipogenesis associated to liposarcoma development.

To define whether overexpression of C/EBP&#x003b1; could rescue adipogenesis in FUS-DDIT3 cells, adipocytic differentiation was induced in FUS-DDIT3 MEFs infected either with empty vector or with the C/EBP&#x003b1; expressing vector. Of interest, the impaired adipocyte differentiation block in FUS-DDIT3 MEFs was not normalized by restoring C/EBP&#x003b1; at day 8 after hormonal induction, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002569-g005"><bold>Figure 5B</bold></xref>), although the retroviral vector was producing C/EBP&#x003b1; correctly as defined by western-blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002569-g005"><bold>Figure 5C</bold></xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>FUS-DDIT3 up-regulates expression of eIF4E in liposarcomas</title><p>Although the inactivation of C/EBP&#x003b1; is not required, itself, for the blockade of adipogenesis in mesenchymal progenitor cells by FUS-DDIT3, however, the C/EBP&#x003b1; isoform ratio shift towards the truncated isoform both in mouse liposarcomas and in human liposarcoma cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002569-g001"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>). It has been previously reported that the control of initiation of translation of C/EBP&#x003b1; and C/EBP&#x003b2; by the eukaryotic translation initiation factors eIF2 and eIF4E is critical for the behavior of preadipocytes 3T3-L1. Thus, high levels of the eukaryotic translation initiation factors produce a shift towards truncated C/EBP isoforms that, in turn, induce a blockade in the terminal differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002569-Calkhoven1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, we next studied the expression level of eIF2&#x003b1; and eIF4E in FUS-DDIT3-liposarcomas.

Moreover, FUS-DDIT3 is able to transactivate the eIF4E promoter suggesting that FUS-DDIT3 is able to interfere with the translational initiation machinery and disrupt the normal adipocyte differentiation program of adipocyte progenitor cells in liposarcomas. The observation that both domains of FUS-DDIT3 are required to regulate eIF4E expression provides the first molecular evidence that the FUS component of the fusion protein is required not only for transformation but also influences the phenotype of the tumor cells. The eIF4E is frequently overexpressed in human cancers in relation to disease progression and drives cellular transformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002569-Graff1">&#x0005b;reviewed in 45&#x0005d;</xref>. In this sense, eIF4E was also strongly upregulated in normal adipose tissue of FUS-DDIT3 transgenic mice, suggesting that overexpression of eIF4E may be one of the primary events in the initiation of liposarcomas.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrate that FUS-DDIT3 is able, itself, to impede the normal adipogenesis in mesenchymal progenitor cell contributing to achieve a transformed phenotype by blocking the adipocyte differentiation program. In order to achieve this, FUS-DDIT3 blocks the activity of the most vital adipogenic transcription factors: C/EBP&#x003b1; and PPAR&#x003b3;. In addition, we show that this blockade is produced at two levels. First of all, FUS-DDIT3 represses both C/EBP&#x003b1; and PPAR&#x003b3;2 promoters, reducing the expression of both transcription factors. Additionally, the chimeric protein, obstructing the normal translational initiation activity of at least eIF4E, is able to shift towards truncated isoform the expression of C/EBP&#x003b1;, reducing its activity and contributing to attenuate the positive feedback loop between C/EBP&#x003b1; and PPAR&#x003b3; that finally results in the expression of mature adipocyte markers such us ap2 or adiponectin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002569-g007"><bold>Figure 7</bold></xref>). These results will help to develop a strategy that would form the basis for improved therapy in human liposarcomas.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the members of Lab 13 at IBMCC for advice and criticism and Dr. Teresa Flores for the critical evaluation of histology sections.
