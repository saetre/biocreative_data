Following peptide uptake into cells, amino acids are released by intracellular hydrolysis to serve as building blocks for protein synthesis, deliver precursors for more specialised synthesis or serve as fuel for ATP generation. In complex organisms peptide transporters are mainly found in epithelial cells in which they in addition to amino acids transporters contribute to overall supply with dietary amino acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006279-Broer1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006279-Daniel2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. These mechanisms are also present in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Numerous amino acid transporter systems are responsible for the uptake of free amino acids, while the uptake of di- and tripeptides is achieved by the intestinal low affinity/high capacity peptide transporter PEPT-1 (formally OPT-2, CPTB, PEP-2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006279-Meissner1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006279-Veljkovic1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Peptide transporters are electrogenic proton-coupled symporters that utilize the transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient as driving force. Thus, substrate uptake depends strongly on membrane potential and extracellular pH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006279-Ganapathy1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Peptide-driven proton import leads to an intracellular acidification. Apical sodium-proton exchangers export protons back into the intestinal lumen followed by sodium ion import for regulation of the intracellular pH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006279-Bobulescu1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006279-Gawenis1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. The <italic>C. elegans</italic> PEPT-1 protein shows all characteristics of the mammalian intestinal peptide transporters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006279-Fei1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, and similarly the Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> antiporter NHX-2 controls peptide-dependent pH<sub>in</sub> homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006279-Nehrke1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. In <italic>pept-1(lg601) C. elegans</italic>, the deletion of the peptide transporter gene causes an amino acid deficiency, a reduced growth and a 60&#x00025; decreased production of progeny when compared to wild type. A supplementation of pept-1<italic>(lg601)</italic> with free amino acids for compensation of the transporter defect increased the number of progeny by around 50&#x00025; but had no effect on the retarded postembryonic development (&#x0223c;80&#x00025; compared with wild type) or the 30&#x00025; reduced body size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006279-Meissner1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, a functional PEPT-1 transporter is critical for the amino acid homeostasis and its loss can not be completely compensated by the action of amino acid transporters. A loss-of-function of <italic>nhx-2</italic> leads to a similar phenotype as a loss of <italic>pept-1</italic>, indicating a strong interdependence of intestinal di- and tripeptide transport and Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> exchanger activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006279-Nehrke1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Most interestingly, in a full-genome RNAi screen, <italic>pept-1</italic> was found to be one of the major regulators of fat content in <italic>C. elegans</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006279-Ashrafi1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, whereas animals deficient of the <italic>nhx-2</italic> gene displayed decreased lipid stores in intestinal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006279-Nehrke1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Fat in the form of triglycerides is the main energy store in the nematode and it was found that triglycerides make up approximately 40&#x02013;55&#x00025; of total lipids in <italic>C. elegans</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006279-Ashrafi2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. The intestine is the major site of lipid storage where the triglycerides are deposited in fat granules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006279-Wood1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Consequently, it is also the main organ for breakdown of stored TAG via lipolysis for peroxisomal and mitochondrial &#x003b2;-oxidation as well as for <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of fatty acids from the precursor acetyl-CoA. In <italic>C. elegans</italic> like in mammals, insulin signaling participates in the control of fat metabolism and worms with a loss-of function of <italic>daf-2</italic>, the insulin-like receptor, have an increased body fat content and the induced metabolic shifts lead to a dauer larva-like metabolism and a higher stress resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006279-Ashrafi1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006279-Murphy1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006279-McElwee1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. The increased fat content enables the worm to survive conditions of low food supply by utilizing the stored fat as main energy source. Although <italic>pept-1</italic> interacts with the <italic>daf-2</italic> insulin-like signaling pathway, it is important to note that the fat accumulation in <italic>daf-2</italic> is associated with dauer formation and metabolism which than also leads to an increased lifespan, while the amino acid deprivation caused by a loss of <italic>pept-1</italic> does not affect dauer and has no effect on lifespan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006279-Meissner1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Despite convincing evidence that the intestinal peptide transporter contributes to lipid storage and metabolism in <italic>C. elegans</italic> as derived from the RNAi screen, nothing is known about the underlying processes. We therefore systematically analysed which metabolic routes involved in lipid absorption, storage and break-down in <italic>C. elegans</italic> are altered in <italic>pept-1(lg601)</italic> mutants. For this purpose, we used a combination of bioanalytical methods, such as RNA and metabolite profiling, <italic>in vivo</italic> isotope labeling combined with NMR spectroscopy as well as RNA interference. We demonstrate that the lack of intestinal di- and tripeptide transport leads to a dramatic shift in gene expression of lipid metabolic pathways and show that the metabolic turn-over of free fatty acids and lipids is altered. Concentrations of short- and medium-chain fatty acids are highly increased in <italic>pept-1</italic> worms while the <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of long-chain fatty acids and more so of polyunsaturated fatty acids is drastically decreased. We showed for the first time in an <italic>in vivo</italic> system, that the functional correlation of the pH<sub>in</sub> of the intestinal epithelial cells via the peptide transporter PEPT-1 and the Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> exchanger NHX-2 is an essential regulator for the uptake of free fatty acids from the diet.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Total body fat is increased in <italic>pept-1(lg601)</italic></title><p>To visualize the total body fat of wild type, <italic>daf-2(e1370)</italic> and <italic>pept-1(lg601)</italic>, populations of these worm strains were stained after fixation with Sudan Black.

We identified 1643 genes with more than 1.5-fold up-regulation in expression level and 1355 genes with an at least 1.5-fold down-regulation in transcript levels in <italic>pept-1</italic> compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006279.s001">Table S1</xref> available online). Based on gene ontology (GO) over-represented pathways with the most prominent changes were &#x0201c;Lipid and Fatty Acid Metabolism&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Cell Signaling&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Amino Acid Metabolism&#x0201d;. For genes involved in fatty acid catabolism mRNA expression profiles revealed mainly a significant down-regulation. However, for peroxisomal proteins involved in fatty acid oxidation an up-regulation of transcripts in <italic>pept-1(lg601)</italic> was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006279-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). We concentrated on these peroxisomal &#x003b2;-oxidation pathways and assessed their role in lipid accumulation in <italic>pept-1(lg601)</italic>.</p><p>The peroxisomes are central organelles for the break-down of very-long and long-chain fatty acids in eukaryotes. The peroxisomal &#x003b2;-oxidation generates H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, NADH and shortened acyl-CoA's as the major end products. Since H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can potentially damage macromolecules its elimination by catalase, which is abundant in peroxisomes, is an important process. In <italic>C. elegans</italic> CTL-2 is the peroxisomal isoform and the transcriptome data revealed 1.4-fold increased mRNA-levels in <italic>pept-1</italic>. This was confirmed by a 2.5 fold higher catalase activity in <italic>pept-1</italic> than in wild type worms (data not shown). Among the other genes that showed increased expression levels in <italic>pept-1</italic> were the ABC transporters needed for acyl-CoA import into peroxisomes as well as almost all enzymes of the &#x003b2;-oxidation chain including the acyl-CoA oxidases and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolases. To functionally asses whether these changes contribute to the altered lipid storage capacity in <italic>pept-1</italic>, we employed RNA interference (RNAi) and silenced seven selected genes that on avarage showed increased mRNA levels (<italic>pmp-4</italic>, F08A8.2, T05E7.1, W03D8.8, <italic>ech-8</italic>, <italic>ech-9</italic>, C17C3.1) followed by measurements of fat accumulation. Only the knockdown of two genes revealed a significant change in body fat content without other servere phenotypic changes. Knockdown of F08A8.2 which encodes for an acyl CoA oxidase, and <italic>ech-8</italic> which encodes for the peroxisomal bifunctional enzyme (hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase/enoyl-CoA hydratase) significantly increased total body fat in <italic>pept-1(lg601)</italic> but not in <italic>rrf-3 C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006279-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). While <italic>ech-8</italic> RNAi led to a higher number of small fat droplets, F08A8.2 RNAi induced a dramatic increase in the mean diameter of the fat droplets. These findings may be taken as an indicator that the on average observed increased expression of genes coding for peroxisomal proteins may indeed increase long-chain fatty acid breakdown in <italic>pept-1</italic>, as the knockdown of selected genes also lead to a further increase in body fat stores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006279-g001">Fig. 1C and D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title><italic>De novo</italic> synthesis of fatty acids is decreased in <italic>pept-1(lg601)</italic></title><p>To assess functionally whether <italic>de novo</italic> fatty acid synthesis is altered in <italic>pept-1</italic> as suggested by the mRNA expression data, we used an NMR based isotopologe profiling approach. Lipid extracts of wild type and <italic>pept-1 C. elegans</italic> grown on a 1&#x02236;10 mixture of &#x0005b;U-<sup>13</sup>C&#x0005d;-labelled and unlabelled <italic>E. coli</italic> were analysed. Specifically, the well-resolved <sup>13</sup>C-NMR signal of methylene carbon atoms resonating around 22.6 ppm displayed satellite pairs due to simultaneous coupling with two <sup>13</sup>C-neighbours which were distinguished from pairs due to a single <sup>13</sup>C-coupling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006279-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). On this basis, <sup>13</sup>C-isotopologues of fatty acids comprising different numbers of <sup>13</sup>C-atoms were identified and quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006279-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). The sum of &#x0005b;110&#x0005d; and &#x0005b;011&#x0005d; can be taken as a quantitative measure for <italic>de novo</italic> fatty acid synthesis. Due to the fact that the signal group at 22.6 ppm can be assigned tentatively to &#x003c9;-2 CH<sub>2</sub> atoms in long-chain saturated or &#x003c9;-6 unsaturated FAs, the relative decrease of &#x0005b;110&#x0005d; and &#x0005b;011&#x0005d; in the <italic>pept-1</italic> line indicates a markedly reduced <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis rate of around 30&#x00025; of that in wild type (3.9 versus 8.9 weight&#x00025;) of these FAs. These findings correlate well with the fatty acid profiling results and the transcriptome data that revealed a down-regulation of most genes coding for proteins in <italic>de novo</italic> fatty acid and lipid synthesis pathways (Tabel S1 available online).

Therefore, we also assessed whether the uptake of free fatty acids from the diet is altered. This was accomplished by the use of a C12 fatty acid that was covalently labeled with the fluorescent dye BODIPY. When fed to worms the BODIPY-C12 fatty acid colocalized with the Nile Red-stained body fat (data not shown), indicating that the fatty acid was taken up by the animals and incorporated into fat stores. However, uptake of the fluorescent fatty acid was much higher in <italic>pept-1(lg601)</italic> and in <italic>rrf-3;pept-1</italic>(RNAi) than in <italic>rrf-3(pk1426)</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006279-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). This finding indicates an increased intestinal absorption and storage capacity for fatty acids in peptide transporter deficient worms. The increased uptake of free fatty acid was also detectable in wild type <italic>C. elegans</italic> that were incubated for one hour in 1 mM of the PEPT antagonist Lys-&#x0005b;z-NO<sub>2</sub>&#x0005d;-Val before feeding with BODIPY-C12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006279-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). In former studies the close functional coupling between di- and tripeptide transport and the Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> exchanger NHX-2 in regulation of the pH<sub>in</sub> was demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006279-Nehrke1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

Inhibition of sodium-proton exchangers essentially abolishes peptide uptake with a concomitant decline in intracellular pH. One of these processes that is affected by alterations of transmembrane proton gradients is the cellular uptake of free fatty acids via &#x0201c;fatty acid flip-flop&#x0201d; mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006279-Hamilton1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006279-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). We therefore hypothetized that fatty acid uptake into intestinal epithelial cells could be reduced in animals lacking the sodium-proton exchanger NHX-2 while it is increased in those lacking PEPT-1. Indeed, uptake of the BODIPY-C12 fatty acid was drastically reduced by knockdown of <italic>nhx-2</italic> in wild type and <italic>pept-1</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006279-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>), which lead to a reduced body fat content visualized by Sudan Black stained smaller fat granules in both strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006279-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>).

Recent work by the Watts group also identified a strongly increased body fat content in <italic>pept-1(lg601)</italic> that is independent on the ingested food bacteria (J. Watts, personal communication). However, these findings are not in line with data presented by Ashrafi et al. (2003) demonstrating a reduced fat content in <italic>pept-1</italic> RNAi treated worms, but discrepancies between knockout and RNAi knockdown phenotype were reported for other genes before. Since lipid accumulation is the product of balance between fat storage and degradation we assessed in <italic>pept-1</italic> all parameters accessible by a combination of analytical and molecular methods. While lipid storage occurs by uptake of fat from the diet or by conversion of an excess of carbohydrates or amino acids via <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of fatty acids and triaclyglycerols, lipid degradation with release of free fatty acids is followed by &#x003b2;-oxidation in peroxisomes and mitochondria. Long-chain acyl-CoA entering peroxisomes are shortened followed by release of medium-chain fatty acids for complete breakdown in mitochondria and use of acetyl-CoA in the TCA cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006279-Reddy1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. In <italic>C. elegans</italic> numerous genes encoding enzymes of mitochondrial and peroxisomal &#x003b2;-oxidation are found <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006279-Gurvitz1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006279-McElwee2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> and we observed for the majority of peroxisomal genes an up-regulation at the transcript level. RNAi knockdown of F08A8.2 and <italic>ech-8</italic> further increased the fat accumulation in the <italic>pept-1</italic> background but not in <italic>rrf-3 C. elegans</italic>. These findings suggest an increased peroxisomal &#x003b2;-oxidation capacity, which may prevent a further lipid accumulation in <italic>pept-1</italic>. The proposed higher flux of long-chain fatty acids through the peroxisomal pathway is supported by the increased mRNA level and activity of peroxisomal catalase that we observed which is needed for detoxification of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> produced by the acyl-CoA oxidase. The proliferation of peroxisomes is strongly dependent on peroxin proteins. In mammals 13 peroxin genes are known, while the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome encodes 11 homologues of these proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006279-Thieringer1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. At least four of the dominant peroxin genes display a slightly increased mRNA expression level in <italic>pept-1</italic> when compared to wild type (<italic>prx-5</italic> (&#x0002b;1.25), <italic>prx-6</italic> (&#x0002b;1.1), <italic>prx-11</italic> (&#x0002b;1.83) and <italic>prx-13</italic> (&#x0002b;1.31)). This might suggest an increased peroxisomal proliferation rate in the peptide transporter deficient strain leading to an increased capacity to degrade very long-chain fatty acids. However, levels of medium-chain fatty acids (&#x0003e;C16&#x0003c;C20) were found to be increased in <italic>pept-1</italic>. This could be indicative for a reduced mitochondrial &#x003b2;-oxidation capacity, although transcript profiling did not reveal convincing evidence for altered mitochondrial &#x003b2;-oxidation, as some enzymes showed increased (<italic>acs-3</italic> (&#x0002b;2.3), F58A6.1 (&#x0002b;2.1), B0272.4 (&#x0002b;1.9)) others decreased (<italic>acs-1</italic> (&#x02212;3.8), <italic>ech-7</italic> (&#x02212;3.4), F09F7.4 (&#x02212;2.8)) mRNA levels. Since the medium-chain fatty acids also can be derived from the diet and <italic>pept-1</italic> animals most likely absorb more of these fatty acids, this accumulation of medium-chain fatty acids may also be explained by increased uptake and decreased use for chain elongation and PUFA production.</p><p>Using GC- and NMR-based methods, evidence is provided that the fatty acid <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis rate is low in <italic>pept-1(lg601)</italic> and moreover, the animals are deficient in the capacity to produce long-chain and polyunsaturated fatty acids from the dietary precursors. When fed on <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50, the widely used laboratory diet for <italic>C. elegans</italic>, only short and medium-chain fatty acids (C12:0, C14:0 C16:0) are provided by diet whereas long-chain and polyunsaturated fatty acids as well as mmBCFA are not available <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006279-Watts1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. As recently shown by NMR approaches, all PUFA's are exclusively synthetized in <italic>C. elegans</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006279-Perez1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Various enzymes for elongation and desaturation processes are necessary for the synthesis of long-chain fatty acids and their PUFA derivatives. Our data obtained for <italic>pept-1</italic> strongly suggest that animals have an impaired capacity for synthesis of these fatty acids. This is mirrored by low transcript levels of the enzymes involved and low values of <sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub>-isotopologues in long-chain FAs, as observed in the <italic>in vivo</italic> feeding experiment using <sup>13</sup>C-labeled <italic>E. coli</italic>. Notably, only the relative fraction of isotopologues in long-chain FA due to uptake (i.e. &#x0005b;010&#x0002b;111&#x0005d;) and due to <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis (i.e. &#x0005b;011&#x0002b;110&#x0005d;) is presented. Therefore, the absolute rates of uptake or <italic>de novo</italic> fatty acid synthesis can not be calculated on this basis. Nevertheless, the increased levels of medium-chain fatty acids such as C16:1&#x00394;9 with 2.5-fold and C18:1&#x00394;9 with 1.4-fold increased level suggest that these two most important precursor fatty acids for elongation processes in the worm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006279-Brock1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> are taken up from the diet with increased capacity.</p><p>Absorption of fatty acids from the gut lumen has been rarely studied in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Although the worm genome contains several genes coding for proteins with homology to intestinal lipases, fatty acid transporter proteins (FATP) and fatty acid binding proteins (FABP) it is yet unclear if and to which extent triglycerides are degraded in the gut lumen and how free fatty acids are taken up into the intestinal epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006279-Ashrafi2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, the gene F46B6.8 that codes for a structural homologue of the mammalian gastric triacylglyceride lipase (EC 3.1.1.3) showed a 13-fold increased mRNA level in <italic>pept-1</italic> when compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006279.s001">Table S1</xref> available online). When we applied RNAi for F46B6.8 no detectable changes in cell morphology or development of <italic>pept-1</italic> worms were observed but average fat droplet size in intestinal cells was reduced (data not shown). Assuming that increased mRNA levels of this lipase translate into increased enzymatic activity, the capacity of triglyceride degradation in the gut lumen could be increased resulting in the accelerated release of free fatty acids followed by uptake into intestinal epithelial cells. We did observe that fatty acid uptake and incorporation into intestinal lipid droplets &#x02013; probed with a fluorescent fatty acid derivative &#x02013; is markedly increased in <italic>pept-1</italic>. However, so far it is not known how fatty acid uptake is achieved in intestinal cells and which proteins are involved in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>Fatty acid uptake into cells generally involves fatty acid transporters as integral membrane proteins (FATP) and fatty acid binding proteins (FABP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006279-Schaffer1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006279-Hamilton2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. There is a controversy on whether the FATPs are solely mediating fatty acid permeation through the cell membrane or possess additionally catalytic activity as acyl-CoA synthetases. As the genome of <italic>C. elegans</italic> contains homologous genes for most of these transport and binding proteins, it is predicted that these mechanisms are also conserved in the nematode <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006279-Ashrafi2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

Here initially the fatty acid adsorbes from the lumen into the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, it then crosses the membrane with a re-orientation of the carboxylic group to the cytosolic site followed by deprotonation and finally the anion leaves the cytosolic leaflet for binding to fatty acid binding proteins or acyl-CoA-synthetase in the cytoplasm. Fatty acid permeation into the cell is consequently associated with intracellular acidification and this has already been shown in various cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006279-Civelek1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006279-Hamilton3">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006279-Elsing1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. The fatty acid flip-flop rate and therefore fatty acid uptake via this biophysical process is increased when the intracellular pH is less acidic than the pH<sub>out</sub>.</p><p>Since PEPT-1, like its mammalian counterpart PEPT1, co-transports protons into the cell when di- or tripeptides are taken up, PEPT-1 acts as an acid loader and causes a decrease in intracellular pH. The protons are re-exported by the Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> exchanger NHX-2 to the luminal side. The imported sodium ions leave the cell in exchange with potassium ions via the sodium potassium ATPase in the basolateral side of the cells. In the absence of the peptide transporter, proton influx into epithelial cells is low and the intracellular pH increases which in turn promote the flip-flop of fatty acids over the cell membrane. This would enable enhanced uptake of free fatty acids and that we clearly demonstrate to be the case with the use of the fluorescent fatty acid derivative in <italic>pept-1</italic> and in wild type <italic>C. elegans</italic> treated with the PEPT antagonist Lys-&#x0005b;z-NO<sub>2</sub>&#x0005d;-Val (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006279-g003">Fig. 3A and B</xref>). Inactivation of the Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> exchanger NHX-2 should cause the opposite; a reduced fatty acid import and that is what we observe as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006279-g003">Fig. 3</xref> when NHX-2 expression is down-regulated by RNAi or when it is blocked by the specific inhibitor S3226. Moreover, these animals are extremely lean also previously observed in <italic>C. elegans</italic> lacking <italic>nhx-2</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006279-Nehrke1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. We could show that the effect is also dominant in the <italic>pept-1</italic> background, where nhx-2(RNAi) significantly reduced the fat granule size/fat content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006279-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). The mechanisms underlying this fatty acid transport regulation based on the cooperation of peptide transporters and Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> exchangers involving alterations in pH<sub>in</sub> are displayed in the proposed model provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006279-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>. Our data strongly suggest that the increased fat storage in <italic>pept-1</italic> animals is a consequence of this increased fatty acid uptake into intestinal cells promoted by the lack of appropriate intracellular acidification rates during digestion and absorption in the absence of the peptide transporter. In summary, the regulation of the intracellular pH in intestinal epithelial cells seems to be key regulator of the uptake of fatty acids from the diet, which is the central process for body fat homeostasis in obese <italic>pept-1</italic> and lean <italic>nhx-2</italic> animals.</p><p>We here provide evidence for a central mechanism by which apical membrane transporters for di- and tripeptides and sodium-proton exchange in intestinal epithelial cells contribute to fatty acid and lipid homeostasis in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, whereas <italic>pept-1(lg601)</italic> animals are obese, animals lacking <italic>nhx-2</italic> are lean. The interplay of the two intestinal proteins in regulation of intracellular pH seems of fundamental importance for the capacity of fatty acid uptake from the gut lumen and their storage in lipid granules. In addition, animals lacking <italic>pept-1</italic> have a reduced capacity of <italic>de novo</italic> fatty acid synthesis, a reduced synthesis of PUFA and possibly an increased &#x003b2;-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids which all may be driven by the obese phenotype.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> strains and nematode culture</title><p>The following <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains were used in this study: wild type N2 var.
