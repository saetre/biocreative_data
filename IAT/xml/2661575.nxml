The EUCLID Study Group reported that the antihypertensive drug lisinopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), reduced the risk of retinopathy progression by &#x0223c;50% in patients with type 1 diabetes, thus greatly reducing the possibility of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Recently, another ACEI, perindopril, has been found capable of improving the visual functions, retinal electrogenesis, and disturbed blood&#x02013;retinal barrier in patients with preproliferative diabetic retinopathy (DR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Studies also indicated that the protective effect of ACEI on DR-related damage was associated with a decreased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), and VEGF was involved in vascular leakage and angiogenesis in DR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Our previous study demonstrated that ACEI inhibited retinal VEGF expression independent of their antihypertensive actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The detailed mechanism by which ACEI counteracts hyperglycemia-induced VEGF upregulation, however, remains to be further clarified.</p><p>In addition to VEGF, pigment epithelium&#x02013;derived factor (PEDF), a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis, has been found to be involved in the pathogenesis of PDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). It is well known that there are quite a few stimulators and inhibitors of angiogenesis in the eye; among them, VEGF has been identified as a primary angiogenic stimulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) and PEDF as a major angiogenic inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). The time course of the VEGF-to-PEDF ratio change correlated with the development and progression of retinal neovascularization. The VEGF-to-PEDF ratio represented a dynamic balance between angiogenic stimulators and inhibitors; and disturbance of the balance played a key role in the pathogenesis of DR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). In vitro study revealed that lowering of the VEGF-to-PEDF mRNA ratio could inhibit the migration of uveal melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Despite these findings, the influence of ACEI on the VEGF-to-PEDF ratio remains unknown.</p><p>Currently, the specific mechanism of diabetic microangiopathy is not completely understood. Recently, a unifying hypothesis has been proposed whereby production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to chronic hyperglycemia might be the key initiator for all of the four pathogenic pathways: the increased polyol pathway flux, increased formation of advanced glycation end products, activation of protein kinase C, and increased hexosamine pathway flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). This postulate emphasized the important role of the increased mitochondrion ROS production in diabetes complications, including retinopathy. Therefore, mitochondrial ROS may serve as an important target for DR treatment. ACEI was demonstrated to attenuate ROS generation in the heart and aorta of diabetic rats and prevent morphological changes (cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and perivascular fibrosis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). It can be deduced that the protective effect of ACEI is associated with repression of oxidative stress.</p><p>The aim of the present study is to verify whether the decreased VEGF-to-PEDF ratio can serve as an indicator for the protective effect of ACEI on DR and to investigate the role of ROS in the downregulation of the VEGF-to-PEDF ratio and the related mechanism. We found that the decreased VEGF-to-PEDF ratio was associated with the protective effect of ACEI on DR, and the decrease of VEGF-to-PEDF ratio was caused by reduced mitochondrial ROS production; our study further indicated that the reduced ROS production was a result of ACEI-induced upregulation of PPAR&#x003b3; and uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2) expression. Our findings indicate that ACEI possesses a great potential for treatment of DR.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>All experiments in this study comply with the requirements of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology statement with regard to the &#x0201c;Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research.&#x0201d; All chemicals were reagent grade quality and were purchased from Sigma Chemicals (St. Louis, MO) unless stated otherwise.</p><sec><title>Animals.</title><p>Eight-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing &#x0223c;200 g (Shanghai Laboratory Animal Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences) were randomly assigned to receive either 60 mg/kg STZ intraperitoneally or citrate buffer alone.

Tissue sections were block stained with uranyl acetate, lead stained, dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol, and embedded in epon. One-micrometer-thick sections were examined with a JEM-1200EX transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Akishima, Japan). Computer-assisted morphometric measurements (The Image Center of Beijing University of Aeronautics &#x00026; Astronautics, Beijing, China) were done on electron micrographs taken from 12 randomly selected capillaries of the outer plexiform layer from four different tissue blocks of the same retina.

We observed the changes of the VEGF-to-PEDF ratio in the rat retinal tissues and BRECs in the presence of normal or high glucose; we also observed the effect of perindopril on changes of the VEGF/PEDF ratio in diabetic rats and in BRECs exposed to high glucose. We confirmed that ACEI exerted a protective effect on DR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), and for the first time, we found that this protective effect was associated with a decreased VEGF-to-PEDF ratio (downregulating VEGF and upregulating PEDF). We found the decreased VEGF-to-PEDF ratio was a result of reduced mitochondrial ROS production, and the reduced ROS production was attributable to decreased &#x00394;&#x003c8;m, which was a result of ACEI-induced upregulation of PPAR&#x003b3; and UCP-2 expression.</p><p>We found that VEGF was upregulated and PEDF was downregulated in the vitreous of patients with PDR, which subsequently elevated the VEGF-to-PEDF ratio and was accompanied by retinal neovascularization (data not shown), whereas in diabetic Sprague-Dawley rats, both VEGF and PEDF were upregulated. (A similar result was also noticed in a study with spontaneously diabetic Torii rats, an animal model of type 2 diabetes [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>)].) Nevertheless, as a result of even more upregulation of VEGF, the VEGF/PEDF ratio was still significantly elevated compared with that of the controls; the elevation was also accompanied by early vascular damages; and a significant correlation was found between the severity of damage and the VEGF/PEDF ratio. In this study, we found that ACEI perindopril downregulated VEGF and upregulated PEDF, which subsequently resulted in a lowered VEGF-to-PEDF ratio and relieved vascular damage in the retina of diabetic rats; and the lowering of VEGF-to-PEDF ratio was significantly correlated with the relief of the vascular damage. It is therefore indicated that the protective effect of ACEI on DR was associated with the decreased VEGF-to-PEDF ratio, which may serve as an effective marker for the development, progression, and treatment outcome of DR.</p><p>To further explore the mechanism by which ACEI exerts its protective effect on DR, we investigated the possible role of mitochondrial ROS, which is taken as a key initiator for all of the four pathogenic pathways of diabetic microangiopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). We found that high glucose could induce ROS production, which was consistent with our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>); we also noticed that ACEI inhibited the retinal and cellular production of ROS and blocked the elevation of the VEGF-to-PEDF ratio. We discovered that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> upregulated VEGF, downregulated PEDF, and elevated the VEGF-to-PEDF ratio and that NAC, an ROS scavenger, could inhibit hyperglycemia-induced changes of VEGF and PEDF expression and elevation of the VEGF-to-PEDF ratio. These findings suggest that ROS is an upstream molecule of VEGF and PEDF and that ACEI lowers the VEGF-to-PEDF ratio through inhibiting hyperglycemia-induced ROS production.</p><p>Hyperglycemia-induced ROS production is primarily thought to be associated with mitochondria and NADPH oxidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). A previous study found that both hyperglycemia and angiotensin II, through activating membrane-bound NADH-/NADPH oxidase, could induce superoxide anion generation in human vascular endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). ACEI was also found to inhibit TGF-&#x003b2; and prevent activation of NADPH oxidase so as to attenuate renal damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Mitochondrial ROS was reported to play a very important role in the pathogenesis of DR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Consistent with these studies, our results also revealed that hyperglycemia induced NADPH oxidase activation (data not shown) and mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization and promoted ROS production. We noticed that perindopril suppressed hyperglycemia-induced activation of NADPH oxidase in a manner similar to that of diphenyleneiodonium in cultured BRECs under hyperglycemic conditions (data not shown).</p><p>We discovered, for the first time, that perindopril inhibited the mitochondrial ROS production by increasing the expression of UCP-2, homologous to UCP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>), found in various human tissues, and one of its major functions is as a sensor and negative regulator of ROS production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). We found that hyperglycemia could compensatorily upregulate UCP-2 so as to negatively modulate &#x00394;&#x003c8;m and ROS because treatment with specific UCP-2 antisense oligonucleotide could increase hyperglycemia-induced mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization and subsequent ROS generation. We also found that perindopril upregulated UCP-2 and reduced ROS in BRECs exposed to normal glucose, high glucose, or high glucose plus NAC, indicating ACEI can directly upregulate UCP-2; meanwhile, this effect of perindopril could be blocked by the specific UCP-2 antisense oligonucleotide, suggesting that perindopril exerts it effect through UCP-2. It can be concluded that ACEI can attenuate oxidative stress through both the NADPH oxidase pathway and the UCP-2/mitochondrial pathway. In view of the important role of ROS in the pathogenesis DR, the inhibitory effect of ACEI on mitochondrial ROS production might be an important mechanism for treatment of diabetes complications.</p><p>We also investigated the specific mechanism by which ACEI induces UCP-2 upregulation and found that PPAR&#x003b3;, a ligand-activated transcription factor belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily, was involved in the process. PPAR&#x003b3; has two isoforms, &#x003b3;1 and &#x003b3;2, and they differ at their NH<sub>2</sub> terminus, which has the same sequence except for the additional 28 amino acids at the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminus of PPAR&#x003b3;2. PPAR&#x003b3;2 is rich in the different adipose tissues, whereas PPAR&#x003b3;1 has a broader expression pattern, including the gut, brain, vascular cells, and specific kinds of immune and inflammatory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). The measurement of PPAR&#x003b3; protein expression by anti-PPAR&#x003b3; polyclonal antibody could be used to determine the total protein of PPAR&#x003b3;1 and &#x003b3;2. Owing to its critical role in fat metabolism and the role of PPAR&#x003b3; activators in diabetes prevention, PPAR&#x003b3; has been extensively studied in patients with diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). It has been reported that PPAR&#x003b3; could benefit vascular function and inhibit neovascularization, retinal leukostasis, and retinal leakage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Until now, no one has studied the effect of ACEI on PPAR&#x003b3;. Our study is the first to find that perindopril could upregulate PPAR&#x003b3;1 and &#x003b3;2 in BRECs exposed to normal-glucose or high-glucose conditions; besides, PPAR&#x003b3; inhibitor GW9662 could inhibit the upregulation of UCP-2 expression induced by high glucose or perindopril, suggesting that the upregulation of UCP-2 expression is mediated, at least in part, by PPAR&#x003b3;.</p><p>In conclusion, our study suggests that ACEI exerts a protective effect on DR and this protective effect can be reflected by a decreased VEGF-to-PEDF ratio, which is a result of reduced mitochondrial ROS production&#x02014;itself caused by ACEI-induced increase of PPAR&#x003b3; and subsequent upregulation of UCP-2 expression. It is indicated that ACEI possesses a great potential for treatment of DR; a long-term prospective study based on large samples is needed to verify the clinical effect of ACEI for DR.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>The costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges.
