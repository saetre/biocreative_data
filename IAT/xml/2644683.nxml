Finally, Notch signaling has recently been suggested to be required for normal striatal development.

Although <italic>Gsx2 </italic>mutants do not survive after birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], analyses at late embryonic stages have demonstrated severe reductions in markers of striatal projection neurons as well as olfactory bulb interneurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], both of which are derived from the LGE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>The closely related <italic>Gsx1 </italic>(<italic>Gsh1</italic>) is also expressed in the embryonic ventral telencephalon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], although no telencephalic phenotype has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Despite this, removal of <italic>Gsx1 </italic>on the <italic>Gsx2 </italic>mutant background eliminates nearly all striatal projection neurons and olfactory bulb interneurons, suggesting that <italic>Gsx1 </italic>can, at least in part, compensate for the loss of <italic>Gsx2 </italic>in the development of these ventral telencephalic structures. This compensation, however, is complex because <italic>Gsx1 </italic>is normally only present in the medial ganglionic eminence and the ventral-most portion of the LGE. In <italic>Gsx2 </italic>mutants, <italic>Gsx1 </italic>expression spreads dorsally to encompass the mutant LGE at mid-neurogenesis time points (for example, embryonic day (E)14), which is coincident with the re-establishment of ventral identity (for example, <italic>Ascl1 </italic>and <italic>Dlx </italic>expression) in the mutant LGE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Both <italic>Ascl1 </italic>and <italic>Dlx </italic>genes are known to be required for normal development of the striatum and olfactory bulb interneurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Moreover, a recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] suggests that <italic>Ascl1 </italic>and <italic>Dlx </italic>genes control distinct and parallel pathways that act in the specification of olfactory bulb interneurons. The mechanism by which <italic>Gsx1 </italic>compensates for the loss of <italic>Gsx2 </italic>has not been fully elucidated. Moreover, the requirement for <italic>Ascl1 </italic>or <italic>Dlx </italic>genes in this process is unclear.</p><p>In this study we have examined the molecular mechanisms underlying <italic>Gsx1</italic>-mediated recovery of ventral telencephalic development in <italic>Gsx2 </italic>mutants. To do this, we have generated and analyzed <italic>Gsx2</italic><sup><italic>EGFP </italic></sup>mice as well as <italic>Gsx2;Ascl1 </italic>double mutants at multiple embryonic stages. Removal of <italic>Ascl1 </italic>from the <italic>Gsx2 </italic>mutant background results in a telencephalic phenotype nearly identical to the <italic>Gsx1:Gsx2 </italic>double mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. These results thus indicate that <italic>Ascl1 </italic>is an essential component of the <italic>Gsx1</italic>-mediated recovery in a subset of LGE progenitors within the <italic>Gsx2 </italic>mutant telencephalon.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Gsx1 expression in the <italic>Gsx2 </italic>mutant telencephalon</title><p>Previous studies have shown that <italic>Gsx1 </italic>expands in the LGE of the <italic>Gsx2 </italic>mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Normally, the cells expressing <italic>Gsx1 </italic>are confined to the ventral-most portion of the LGE; however, in <italic>Gsx2 </italic>mutants the expression of this gene expands throughout the entire dorsal-ventral extent of the LGE between E11 and E14. We have generated mice in which the first exon of <italic>Gsx2 </italic>is interrupted by an IRES-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) cassette so that EGFP is expressed in place of Gsx2. These mice appear to faithfully reproduce Gsx2 expression and provide a short-term fate map of Gsx2 derived cells that no longer express the protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A&#x02013;C</xref>). Moreover, the <italic>Gsx2</italic><sup><italic>EGFP</italic>/<italic>EGFP </italic></sup>embryos lack Gsx2 protein expression, while still delineating the portion of the LGE that the targeted <italic>Gsx2 </italic>gene is being transcribed in by virtue of the EGFP staining (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F&#x02013;H</xref>). These mutants exhibit identical patterning defects to those reported for the previously available <italic>Gsx2 </italic>mutant allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] (data not shown). Using these mice together with an antibody that detects both Gsx1 and Gsx2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], we were able to examine the Gsx1 recovery on a cellular level, within the context of the Gsx2 expression domain.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Knock-in of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) into the <italic>Gsx2 </italic>locus</bold>.

At E12.5, the cells expressing Gsx1 in the mutant LGE are few in number and largely confined to its ventral half. This finding is in agreement with previous <italic>Gsx1 </italic>gene expression studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]; however, the cellular resolution afforded by the immunohistochemical approach revealed that the Gsx1 cells appear mostly at the border between the VZ and SVZ (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1I, J</xref>). This is different from Gsx2 expression in the wild-type LGE where cells throughout the apical-basal extent of the VZ express this protein, albeit at different levels of expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Previous studies have shown that the expansion of <italic>Gsx1 </italic>throughout the <italic>Gsx2 </italic>mutant LGE is complete between E14.5 and E16.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This is clearly revealed by Gsx1/2 staining in the <italic>Gsx2</italic><sup><italic>EGFP</italic>/<italic>EGFP </italic></sup>mutants at E16.5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>). At this stage, only around half the LGE cells that would normally express Gsx2 contain Gsx1 staining. Again, the majority of the Gsx1 expressing cells appear to line up at the VZ/SVZ boundary (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2H</xref>). This is similar to Gsx1/2 staining in the remnant of the medial ganglionic eminence in <italic>Gsx2</italic><sup><italic>EGFP</italic>/+ </sup>brains (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), and since this staining does not coincide with the EGFP from the Gsx2 locus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A&#x02013;C</xref>), it is likely to reflect Gsx1 expression in the wild-type medial ganglionic eminence. Thus, although Gsx1 can at least partially compensate for Gsx2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], it does not do so in all cells of the LGE that would normally express Gsx2 but only in a subpopulation positioned at the VZ/SVZ boundary.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Expansion of Gsx1 in the <italic>Gsx2</italic><sup><italic>EGFP</italic>/<italic>EGFP </italic></sup>lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE) occurs in only a subset of cells at the ventricular zone (VZ)/subventricular zone (SVZ) border</bold>. <bold>(A-C) </bold>Control embryos (<italic>Gsx2</italic><sup><italic>EGFP</italic>/+</sup>) express Gsx2 and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) throughout the VZ of the LGE at E16.5. In addition, the Gsx1/2 antibody labels scattered cells in the SVZ (B) where EGFP expression is observed in the majority of the SVZ (A, C). Asterisks in (A, C) mark Gsx1/2 staining in the remnant of the medial ganglionic eminence. Because EGFP expression from the Gsx2 locus is not found in this region, it is likely that the staining reflects Gsx1 expression. <bold>(G) </bold>The expansion of Gsx1 in <italic>Gsx2</italic><sup><italic>EGFP</italic>/<italic>EGFP </italic></sup>embryos is throughout the LGE at E16.5. <bold>(F, H) </bold>Note that Gsx1 expression in <italic>Gsx2</italic><sup><italic>EGFP</italic>/<italic>EGFP </italic></sup>embryos is observed only at the VZ/SVZ border in the LGE (arrows in merged image in (H)) whereas EGFP expression (labeling Gsx2 mutant cells) is observed throughout the VZ and the SVZ (F, H). <bold>(D, E) </bold>Control embryos (<italic>Gsx2</italic><sup><italic>EGFP</italic>/+</sup>) express Ascl1 at highest levels near the VZ/SVZ border (D) and only in scattered cells of the VZ (merged image with EGFP in (E)). <bold>(I) </bold>By E16.5, Ascl1 is recovered in the LGE of <italic>Gsx2</italic><sup><italic>EGFP</italic>/<italic>EGFP </italic></sup>embryos predominately at the VZ/SVZ border (arrows in (J)), which is similar to the expansion of Gsx1 expression in these mutants (G).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1749-8104-4-5-2"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Relationship between Gsx1 and Ascl1 in the <italic>Gsx2 </italic>mutant LGE</title><p>Ascl1 (Mash1) is known to be required for the normal development of the ventral telencephalon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, Ascl1 is dependent on Gsx2 for its normal expression in LGE progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], at least at early stages, before Gsx1 expression expands into the mutant LGE. Ascl1 is expressed by many cells within the <italic>Gsx2</italic><sup><italic>EGFP</italic>/+ </sup>VZ, although they are mainly located at the VZ/SVZ boundary (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D, E</xref>). Interestingly, the pattern of Ascl1 expression in the Gsx2 mutants is very similar to that of Gsx1 (as revealed by Gsx1/2 staining; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G&#x02013;J</xref>), with scattered cells in the VZ and the majority accumulated along the VZ/SVZ boundary. In <italic>Gsx1;Gsx2 </italic>double mutants, Ascl1 is not expressed in the LGE at early stages (for example, E12.5) but at later stages (for example, E15.5&#x02013;16.5) it is found at low levels within the presumptive LGE region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This suggests that although Gsx proteins are not absolutely required for Ascl1 expression in the LGE, they are positive regulators of its expression. The overlap in Gsx1 and Ascl1 expression in the <italic>Gsx2 </italic>mutant LGE (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2H, J</xref>) therefore suggests that Ascl1 may act in concert with Gsx1 for the compensation observed in <italic>Gsx2 </italic>mutants.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of <italic>Gsx2 </italic>in the <italic>Ascl1 </italic>mutant</title><p>Although Ascl1 expression in LGE progenitors has been shown to require Gsx2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], the role (if any) of Ascl1 in regulating Gsx2 expression has not been reported. In E12.5 <italic>Ascl1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mutants, we found that Gsx2 (and Gsx1/2) staining in the LGE was not significantly different from that observed in wild types (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A, D</xref> and data not shown). Conversely, at E18.5 we observed a large increase in the numbers of cells expressing Gsx2 along the dorsal-ventral aspect of the VZ in the <italic>Ascl1 </italic>mutants and in certain cases clusters of Gsx2 expressing cells were found in the forming striatum (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>). The expression of Gsx2 coincided with Ki67 staining in many of these clusters (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E, F</xref>) on closely adjacent sections, suggesting that despite their ectopic location, these Gsx2 cells may remain in the cell cycle. <italic>Gsx1 </italic>expression was not changed in the LGE of <italic>Ascl1 </italic>mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] (data not shown). These findings could indicate that, in addition to being downstream of <italic>Gsx </italic>genes, Ascl1 may also serve a negative feedback function to repress Gsx2 in LGE progenitors, particularly at late embryonic stages.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Increase in progenitor cell markers in the lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE) of Ascl1 mutants</bold>. <bold>(A, D) </bold>At E12.5, Ascl1 mutants express Gsx2 in a relatively normal pattern in the LGE compared to wild type.

It is possible, therefore, that the phenotypes observed in the <italic>Gsx2;Ascl1 </italic>double mutants are a result of compound effects of a loss of Notch signaling together with distinct Gsx2 requirements. To address this, we examined the expression of factors in the Notch signaling pathway, Ngn2, Dll1 and Hes5, in relation to Gsx1/2 expression. In <italic>Gsx2 </italic>mutants, Ngn2 was shifted ventrally into the LGE as previously described (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8F</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], although it appeared to be directly abutting the ventrally shifted Gsx1/2 staining (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>). Indeed, both <italic>Dll1 </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8J</xref>) and <italic>Hes5 </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8N</xref>) were continuously expressed throughout the <italic>Gsx2 </italic>mutant LGE. In the <italic>Ascl1 </italic>mutants, Gsx1/2 staining was present up to the normal pallio-subpallial boundary (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref>) and Ngn2 staining abutted it at its normal ventral position (compare Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8G</xref>). This theoretically leaves no proneural gene expression in the LGE and, in fact, both <italic>Dll1 </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8K</xref>) and <italic>Hes5 </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8O</xref>) staining was absent, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. This is not the case in <italic>Gsx2;Ascl1 </italic>double mutants, where Ngn2 was observed to extend ventrally into the double mutant LGE and improvement in <italic>Dll1 </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8L</xref>) and <italic>Hes5 </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8P</xref>) expression was observed, at least within the presumptive LGE region, compared to <italic>Ascl1 </italic>mutants. This indicates that the Notch signaling defects observed in <italic>Ascl1 </italic>mutants are, in part, due to Gsx2 expression remaining in the LGE. Thus, it appears that Ascl1 performs a non-proneural function in the Gsx1-mediated recovery observed in the <italic>Gsx2 </italic>mutant.

What remained unclear was why the Gsx1-dependent compensation was not more effective in restoring normal development.

Interestingly, these cells are largely located at the boundary between the VZ and SVZ, similar in location to that of Ascl1 expressing cells. Based on the facts that the striatal phenotype of the <italic>Gsx2;Ascl1 </italic>mutants is nearly identical to that observed in <italic>Gsx1;Gsx2 </italic>mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and that Gsx1 expands in the <italic>Gsx2;Ascl1 </italic>mutants in a similar way to that observed in <italic>Gsx2 </italic>mutants, we conclude that <italic>Ascl1 </italic>is required downstream of <italic>Gsx1 </italic>for this recovery. These findings suggest that there are <italic>Ascl1</italic>-dependent and <italic>Ascl1</italic>-independent pathways for LGE development. This is in agreement with recent studies by Long <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] showing that Dlx1/2 and Ascl1 regulate parallel and overlapping pathways in LGE specification.

It does not appear that Gsx2 represses Gsx1 expression because only a subset of the cells that normally express Gsx2, particularly those at the VZ/SVZ boundary, are Gsx1-positive in the <italic>Gsx2 </italic>mutant LGE. It seems possible, therefore, that Gsx1 can only be expressed in certain cell types or in cells that have reached a particular level of maturation (that is, cells transitioning from the VZ to the SVZ). Indeed, it appears that Gsx1-positive cells in the medial ganglionic eminence region also reside largely in the VZ/SVZ boundary region (for example, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Interestingly, at early stages (that is, E12.5) in the <italic>Gsx2 </italic>mutants, the LGE SVZ does not form, and only after Gsx1 has expanded throughout the mutant LGE (that is, by E14&#x02013;15) does the it do so in this mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Together with the current findings, these results suggest that Gsx1 may be expressed in more mature progenitors and might even play a role in the maturation process.</p><p>Ascl1 has previously been implicated in the development of the striatum and olfactory bulb interneurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In general, however, the requirement for Ascl1 in striatal and olfactory bulb development is not as great as that for Gsx2. In fact, the striatum of the <italic>Ascl1 </italic>mutant is only slightly reduced in size when compared to the wild type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).

Although striatal development is only modestly affected by the loss of <italic>Ascl1</italic>, we show here that the added loss of <italic>Gsx2 </italic>results in a nearly complete loss of striatal development.

The loss of Gsx1 and Gsx2 severely depletes the expression of Ascl1 throughout embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], suggesting that both are genetically upstream; however, our findings here also demonstrate a delay in the expression of Gsx1 in <italic>Gsx2;Ascl1 </italic>double mutants at early stages (for example, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8D</xref>), potentially implicating Ascl1 in feedback regulation of Gsx1 expression.</p><p>Ascl1 is a known regulator of the Notch signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and Notch signaling has previously been implicated in controlling striatal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. It does not seem that the striatal defects observed in the <italic>Gsx2;Ascl1 </italic>double mutants, described here, are simply due to compound effects of the loss of Gsx2 and impaired Notch signaling because we observed an improvement in Notch signaling (as indicated by <italic>Hes5 </italic>and <italic>Dll1 </italic>expression) within LGE progenitors of the <italic>Gsx2;Ascl1 </italic>double mutants compared to <italic>Ascl1 </italic>mutants. Our interpretation of this result is that <italic>Gsx2;Ascl1 </italic>mutants are similar to <italic>Gsx2 </italic>mutants in that Ngn2 is allowed to expand ventrally into the LGE and, as a result, Notch signaling is improved. Clearly, Ascl1 plays a role in regulating Notch signaling within LGE progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]; however, the fact that striatal development is not more severely affected in the <italic>Ascl1 </italic>mutant could suggest that Gsx2 normally works through another gene encoding a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factor to regulate aspects of LGE neurogenesis.</p><p>A somewhat surprising finding that we observed in the <italic>Ascl1 </italic>mutants was that Gsx2 expression appeared to be increased at perinatal stages. This is not the case at early time points (for example, E12.5) and suggests that Ascl1 may play a role in depleting the Gsx2 progenitors during embryogenesis. The increased Gsx2 in the <italic>Ascl1 </italic>mutant LGE correlated well with the expression of Sp8, a zinc finger transcription factor that has previously been shown to be dependent on Gsx2 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies have described a reduction in dopaminergic and GABAergic interneurons in the <italic>Ascl1 </italic>mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]; however, no data on other subtypes have been provided. We show here that unlike the dopaminergic and GABAergic subtypes, the CR interneurons are not reduced and may, in fact, be increased. The neurotransmitter of this subtype remains somewhat unclear. Recent reports suggests that as few as 14% are GABAergic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], while others suggest that most if not all are GABAergic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Our data seem to support the former possibility (at least at this stage of development) since the reduction in GABAergic neurons (as marked by GAD<sub>67</sub>) is not paralleled by CR-positive cells in the <italic>Ascl1 </italic>mutant olfactory bulb. We have recently shown that the zinc finger transcription factor Sp8 is required for the normal development of the CR interneurons in the olfactory bulb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Accordingly, we found that in <italic>Ascl1 </italic>mutants at late stages of development, Sp8 staining is maintained in the dLGE and olfactory bulbs. Because Gsx2 is required for Sp8 expression in the dLGE and the latter is essential for normal CR interneuron production, it seems likely that the sequential expression of these two transcription factors cooperate to generate this interneuron subtype. However, despite that Gsx2 appears to function upstream of Ascl1, this bHLH factor does not actively promote CR interneuron development.</p><p>The origin of distinct subtypes of olfactory bulb interneurons has recently been the subject of considerable attention. Kohwi <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] have recently suggested that CR interneurons arise from pallial and septal regions but not the dLGE. On the other hand, De Marchis <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] found that these interneurons were generated from the postnatal region of the SVZ that directly derives from the dLGE. In support of this, Merkle <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] showed that at least some CR neurons are derived from the rostral dorsal SVZ (a likely derivative of the dLGE). Although CR interneurons start to be produced at embryonic time points, a recent study by Batista-Brito <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] have shown that most are generated at postnatal time points. Our data show that at least a few CR neurons are present in the late embryonic dLGE and that <italic>Ascl1 </italic>mutants appear to exhibit enhanced CR neuron production in the dLGE and possibly olfactory bulb. Thus, Ascl1 may play a role in the temporal regulation of CR interneuron production from the dLGE and its SVZ derivatives. In any case, our findings clearly demonstrate that the dLGE is a significant source of CR interneurons that are generated at embryonic time points; however, we cannot exclude the contribution of the septum in the generation of these interneurons as shown by Merkle <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], particularly at early postnatal stages. Indeed, Gsx2 is expressed at high levels in both the dLGE as well as in the dorsal portion of the septum (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) and CR staining in the septal region is also lost in the Gsx2 mutant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Regardless of their origin, it seems that all subtypes of olfactory bulb interneurons, at least at embryonic time points, require Gsx2 for their normal production.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data show that Gsx1 compensates for the loss of <italic>Gsx2 </italic>gene function in only a subpopulation of the LGE progenitors that normally express Gsx2, which may explain why the compensation is not more complete. Additionally, we show that Ascl1 is an obligate factor for Gsx1 in the recovery process and that this is independent of its well-known proneural function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p><italic>Gsx2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and <italic>Ascl1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] mice were genotyped as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].
