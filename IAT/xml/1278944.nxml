Debranching appears to be a rate-limiting step for the turnover of intronic RNA, insofar as the steady-state levels of lariat introns are greatly increased in a &#x00394;<italic>dbr1</italic> strain. To gain insight to the requirements for yeast Dbr1 function, we performed a mutational analysis of 28 amino acids that are conserved in Dbr1 homologs from other organisms. We identified 13 residues (His13, Asp40, Arg45, Asp49, Tyr68, Tyr69, Asn85, His86, Glu87, His179, Asp180, His231 and His233) at which alanine substitutions resulted in lariat intron accumulation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Conservative replacements at these positions were introduced to illuminate structure&#x02013;activity relationships. Residues important for Dbr1 function include putative counterparts of the amino acids that comprise the active site of the metallophosphoesterase superfamily, exemplified by the DNA phosphodiesterase Mre11. Using natural lariat RNAs and synthetic branched RNAs as substrates, we found that mutation of Asp40, Asn85, His86, His179, His231 or His233 to alanine abolishes or greatly diminishes debranching activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. Dbr1 sediments as a monomer and requires manganese as the metal cofactor for debranching.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Lariat RNAs, wherein the 2&#x02032;-hydroxyl of an internal adenosine nucleotide is linked to the 5&#x02032; end of the intron, are formed naturally as splicing intermediates by Group II introns and by the pre-mRNA spliceosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). Y-shaped branched RNAs with 2&#x02032;-5&#x02032; phosphodiester linkages are generated during <italic>trans</italic>-splicing in nematodes and trypanosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Bacterial multicopy single-stranded DNAs (msDNAs) are mixed branched structures, wherein the 2&#x02032;-hydroxyl of an RNA molecule is linked via a phosphodiester bond to the 5&#x02032; end of a DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Branched polynucleotides have also been made synthetically using ribozymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>), deoxyribozymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>) or solid-phase chemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>).</p><p>The 2&#x02032;-5&#x02032; phosphodiester linkages in lariat intron RNAs are cleaved by a debranching enzyme, Dbr1, that was discovered in HeLa cell extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). The yeast <italic>DBR1</italic> gene was identified in a genetic screen for mutations that affect Ty transposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). Chapman and Boeke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>) found that transposition frequency was reduced and the steady-state levels of excised lariat intron RNAs were greatly increased in a <italic>dbr1</italic> mutant strain. Whereas the basis for the involvement of Dbr1 in Ty transposition is still not entirely clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>), intron accumulation in a <italic>dbr1</italic> mutant strain is a direct consequence of the failure to cleave the 2&#x02032;-5&#x02032; phosphodiester linkage. The debranched linear intron is usually degraded by either the 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; exonucleases Xrn1 and Rat1 or the 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; exonucleolytic activities of the exosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Some yeast lariat introns are processed by an endonucleolytic pathway involving Rnt1, the yeast ortholog of RNase III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>DBR1</italic> gene is not essential for viability in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>dbr1</italic> cells show no discernible growth defect, despite the increased levels of lariat intron RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe dbr1</italic><sup>+</sup> is also non-essential, however, the <italic>S.pombe dbr1</italic><sup>null</sup> mutant grows more slowly than <italic>dbr1</italic><sup>+</sup>, the mutant cells are significantly elongated and the amounts of lariat intron RNAs are increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). The intron accumulation phenotype and the slow growth defect of <italic>S.pombe dbr1</italic><sup>null</sup> cells can be alleviated by expression of Dbr1 homologs from <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, human or mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>).</p><p>Dbr1 was suggested to be a member of the metallophosphoesterase superfamily that includes &#x003bb; phosphoprotein phosphatase, calcineurin and Mre11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). The three signature motifs of this class of enzymes, which contain a dinuclear metal center, are DIH(X)<sub>&#x0223c;25</sub>GDYVDR(X)<sub>&#x0223c;27</sub>GNHE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). Structural studies of bacteriophage &#x003bb; phosphatase (a phosphomonoesterase) and <italic>Pyrococcus furiosus</italic> Mre11 (a phosphodiesterase) showed that conserved His, Asp and Asn side chains are involved in binding of the two manganese ions, whereas conserved His and Asn side chains contact the phosphate in the active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). Debranching enzymes contain a similar constellation of conserved amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Most metallophosphoesterases require transition metal ions (e.g. Mn<sup>2+</sup> or Ni<sup>2+</sup>) for catalysis and are inhibited by zinc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). The metal-requirement of yeast Dbr1 has not been assessed in detail because the debranching activity of purified recombinant Dbr1 was independent of added metals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). In contrast, the debranching activity purified from HeLa cell extracts required added divalent cations and magnesium, calcium and manganese were effective cofactors for activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). Biochemical studies of yeast Dbr1, which routinely include magnesium in the reaction mixture, showed that a 20- to 100-fold molar excess of enzyme over substrate is typically required to obtain efficient debranching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>).</p><p>Here we show that Dbr1 is metal-dependent and acts catalytically only when manganese is included in the reaction mixture. We performed an alanine scan of yeast Dbr1 targeting 28 amino acids that are conserved among Dbr1 homologs from other species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and thereby identified 13 residues important for intron debranching activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. Structure&#x02013;activity relationships were determined via conservative mutagenesis and selected mutant proteins were characterized with respect to their ability to catalyze debranching <italic>in vitro</italic>. Our findings indicate that Dbr1 is indeed a member of the metallophoshoesterase family, with an active site similar to that of Mre11.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast plasmids and targeted mutagenesis of DBR1</title><p>Plasmid p358-Dbr1 (<italic>CEN TRP DBR1</italic>) was generated by inserting the NcoI&#x02013;XhoI fragment from pET16b-DBR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>) into p358-dbr1(+/&#x02212;), a plasmid that contains 648 and 562 bp of upstream and downstream yeast genomic DNA flanking the <italic>DBR1</italic> open reading frame (ORF), respectively. Mutations were introduced into the <italic>DBR1</italic> gene by the two-stage PCR overlap extension method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>).

To test the functionality of <italic>DBR1</italic> mutant alleles <italic>in vivo</italic>, the p358-Dbr1 plasmids were introduced into the YFK1 strain. The empty vector pSE358 (<italic>TRP1 CEN</italic>) served as a negative control.

Aliquots (&#x0223c;5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> cells) were harvested and RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNA isolation kit according to the vendor's instructions. RNA concentration was calculated on the basis of <italic>A</italic><sub>260</sub>. Equivalent amounts (15 &#x000b5;g) of total RNA from each sample were resolved by electrophoresis through a 1.4% agarose/formaldehyde gel and transferred to a Hybond membrane (Amersham).

Hybridization was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>) and the hybridization signal was quantified by scanning the membrane using a phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics) and visualized by autoradiography. In every sample, the values for intron signal was divided by the control signal (<italic>ACT1</italic> mRNA or <italic>PGK1</italic> mRNA). This value (intron/control) was set to 100% for the &#x00394;<italic>dbr1</italic> samples.

Cultures were inoculated from single colonies and maintained in logarithmic growth at 37&#x000b0;C in Luria&#x02013;Bertani medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin to a final volume of 500 ml. When <italic>A</italic><sub>600</sub> reached 0.6&#x02013;0.8, the cultures were chilled on ice for 30 min, and then adjusted to 0.4 mM isopropyl-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and 2% ethanol. The cultures were incubated for 16&#x02013;18 h at 17&#x000b0;C with constant shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and the pellets stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C.</p><p>All subsequent procedures were performed at 4&#x000b0;C. The cell pellets were suspended in 20 ml of buffer A [50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 250 mM NaCl and 10% sucrose]. Lysozyme was added to 0.2 mg/ml, the suspension was mixed gently for 30 min and then adjusted to 0.1% Triton X-100. The lysate was sonicated to reduce viscosity and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 15&#x02009;000 r.p.m. in a Sorvall SS34 rotor. The soluble lysate was mixed for 1 h with 2 ml of Ni-NTA agarose (50% slurry, Qiagen) that had been equilibrated in buffer A.

Bound proteins were eluted with buffer E containing 300 mM imidazole. Five 2 ml fractions were collected and their polypeptide compositions assessed by SDS&#x02013;PAGE. Fractions containing Dbr1 proteins (&#x0223c;6 ml) were pooled and 4 ml of buffer D [50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, 5 mM DTT and 1 mM EDTA] was added. The protein solutions were mixed for 1 h with 2 ml of heparin Sepharose fast flow (Amersham) that had been equilibrated in buffer D containing 150 mM NaCl. The slurry was then poured into a column, washed with buffer D containing 150 mM NaCl and eluted with buffer D containing 500 mM NaCl. Dbr1 was recovered in the 500 mM NaCl eluate. Protein concentrations were determined by using the BioRad dye-binding reagent with BSA as the standard. The yields of protein recovered from 500 ml cultures varied between 0.3 mg for mutant Y100A and 3 mg for D49A. The yield of wild-type Dbr1 was 2.5 mg.</p><p>Where indicated, the purification protocol outlined above was modified to include dialysis and zonal velocity gradient sedimentation steps. Dbr1-containing fractions that were eluted from Ni-NTA resin were pooled and dialyzed twice against 50 volumes of 50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, 5 mM DTT and 3 mM EDTA. The dialyzed preparation was further purified by heparin Sepharose chromatography as described above.

In contrast, H13A, D40A, R45A, N85A, H86A, E87A, H179A, D180A, H231A and H233A appeared to be wholly non-functional, insofar as the steady-state intron levels of <italic>ACT1</italic>, <italic>CYH2</italic>, <italic>RPS13</italic> and U3 RNAs in these cells were &#x02265;90% of the amount observed in &#x00394;<italic>dbr1</italic> cells.

More severe defects were observed in <italic>D49A</italic>, <italic>Y68A</italic> and <italic>Y69A</italic> cells, where each of the four introns tested accumulated to 40&#x02013;85% of the level seen in &#x00394;<italic>dbr1</italic> cells (the affected amino acids are denoted by * in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We consider intron accumulation that is &#x02265;25% of the level seen in &#x00394;<italic>dbr1</italic> cells to be indicative of a significant defect in Dbr1 activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. By this criterion, His13, Asp40, Arg45, Asp49, Tyr68, Tyr69, Asn85, His86, Glu87, His179, Asp180, His231 and His233 are important for Dbr1 function <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Structure&#x02013;activity relationships at important Dbr1 residues</title><p>We tested the effects of conservative substitutions at the thirteen positions in Dbr1 that were defined by the alanine scan as important for <italic>in vivo</italic> activity.

The conservative mutant alleles were introduced into the &#x00394;<italic>dbr1</italic> strain. Total RNA was isolated from the mutant yeast strains and analyzed by northern blotting in parallel with RNA from the Dbr1-Ala mutants.

Based on structural studies of &#x003bb; phosphatase and Mre11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>), we predict that Asn85 is part of the metal-binding site of Dbr1 and that His86 participates in catalysis through contacts with the scissile phosphodiester at the branch (see Discussion). Replacing the side chain of Glu87 by glutamine resulted in a non-functional Dbr1, but aspartate restored the <italic>in vivo</italic> function partially, i.e. the level of intron in <italic>E87D</italic> cells was 30% compared to 110% in <italic>E87A</italic> cells. This finding indicates that a negative charge at position 87 is important, but that optimal debranching activity <italic>in vivo</italic> requires proper spacing between the main chain and the carboxylate.</p><p>A side chain carboxylate was also important at positions 40, 49 and 180 in Dbr1, insofar as <italic>D40E</italic>, <italic>D49E</italic> and <italic>D180E</italic> cells had reduced intron levels compared to Dbr1 strains in which these aspartates were replaced by alanine or asparagine. However, the degree of rescue varied. <italic>D180E</italic> resembled wild-type cells, with little intron RNA present. Thus, the glutamate substitution at position 180 fully restored debranching activity. In contrast, the intron level in <italic>D40E</italic> cells was 65%, compared to 110 and 105% for <italic>D40A</italic> and <italic>D40N</italic>, respectively. This result suggests that the additional methylene group in the glutamate side chain significantly hinders Dbr1 function. Substitution of Asp49 by glutamate resulted in improved Dbr1 function; the level of intron RNA in <italic>D49E</italic> cells was 30%, compared to 85% and 70% in <italic>D49A</italic> and <italic>D49N</italic> cells.</p><p>Dbr1 activity was significantly diminished when Arg45 was replaced by alanine and glutamine; <italic>R45A</italic> and <italic>R45Q</italic> cells accumulated 80 and 74% of the intron RNA levels seen in &#x00394;<italic>dbr1</italic> cells. However, replacing Arg45 by lysine partially restored debranching activity, such that 20% intron RNA accumulated in <italic>R45K</italic> cells relative to &#x00394;<italic>dbr1</italic>. The positive charge at position 45 is apparently critical for Dbr1 function.</p><p>Alanine substitution at Tyr68 and Tyr69 reduced the activity of Dbr1 significantly.

Substituting Tyr68 and Tyr69 with phenylalanine fully restored Dbr1 activity, arguing against the importance of the side chain hydroxyl. The levels of intron RNA were higher in <italic>Y68S</italic> and <italic>Y69S</italic> cells (70&#x02013;75%) compared to the alanine replacements, indicating that serine at these positions had a negative effect on enzyme function.</p><p>The strict requirement for histidines at positions 13, 179, 231 and 233 was underscored by the finding that none of the conservative substitutions we tested restored activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). A slight improvement was observed when the histidine at position 231 was replaced by asparagine, yet the level of intron accumulation (65%) remained well above our threshold for a significant loss of debranching activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of Dbr1-Ala mutants <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>His<sub>10</sub>-tagged Dbr1 and 20 Dbr1-Ala mutants were purified from soluble bacterial lysates by Ni-NTA agarose and heparin Sepharose chromatography steps.

The reaction products were analyzed by northern blotting using intron-specific probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>). Inclusion of wild-type Dbr1 in the reaction resulted in near-quantitative conversion of the slowly migrating U3 lariat intron into a more rapidly migrating linear product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, compare lanes &#x02212; and WT). The <italic>CHY2</italic> and <italic>ACT1</italic> lariat introns were also quantitatively debranched by wild-type Dbr1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and data not shown).

The D33A, K58A, F65A, Y68A, Y69A, Y100A, R120A, D180A, D300A and R306A proteins completely debranched the lariat intron (&#x02265;98% linear product). In contrast, N85A and H86A were inactive; i.e. no increase in linear product was detected. The activities of D40A and H179A proteins were greatly diminished; the mutant proteins debranched 23% and 15% of the total lariat intron RNA, respectively under these conditions. Other mutants were partially active, insofar as 44% (H13A), 71% (R45A and D49A), 52% (E87A), 30% (H231A) and 40% (H233A) of the lariat RNA was debranched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>Dbr1-Ala mutants were also tested for their ability to cleave a 5&#x02032;-labeled synthetic branched RNA oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

Wild-type Dbr1 converted 95% of the branched RNA into a faster migrating linear product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, compare lanes &#x02212; and WT). The Dbr1-Ala mutant proteins H13A, D33A, D49A, K58A, F65A, Y68A, Y69A, E87A, Y100A, R120A, D180A, D300A, R306A debranched &#x02265;85% of the synthetic substrate under these conditions. The yield of linear product generated by R45A, H231A and H233A was 79&#x02013;82%. The efficiency of debranching by D40A and H179A was 34% and 4%, respectively, and N85A and H86A were inactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p>Assays of the extent of debranching at saturating enzyme levels identify only the most severe mutational effects on Dbr1 activity, but are relatively insensitive to partial losses of function.

In this experiment, 4 ng (&#x0223c;80 fmol) of Dbr1 was reacted with 100 fmol of branched oligonucleotide. The reaction containing wild-type Dbr1 attained an endpoint at 60 s with 93% of the input substrate converted to linear product; 79% of the substrate was debranched at the earliest time point (13 s). Alanine substitutions at Asp49, Arg45, His233, His231 and Asp40 exerted increasingly severe effects on the rate of debranching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

Whereas the debranching activity of recombinant yeast Dbr1 was reported independent of adding divalent cation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>), debranching enzyme purified from HeLa cells was metal-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>).</p><p>Our mutational results suggest that Dbr1 is a member of the metallophosphoesterase superfamily.

His<sub>10</sub>-tagged Dbr1 was isolated from soluble bacterial lysates by Ni-NTA chromatography and then dialyzed against buffer containing EDTA.

Various metals were tested at 2.5 mM concentration for their ability to support debranching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). At 50 nM Dbr1, magnesium, manganese and calcium supported near-quantitative debranching of 5 nM substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). No activity was observed with copper or zinc. Magnesium was most effective at 2.5 to 10 mM and higher concentrations inhibited debranching activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and data not shown).</p><p>Manganese was the only effective cofactor when the Dbr1 concentration was reduced to 2 nM and the branched substrate concentration was 5 nM. Whereas 2.5 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub> supported 98% debranching, little or no linear product was detected with 2.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, CuSO<sub>4</sub>, ZnSO<sub>4</sub>, CaCl<sub>2</sub> or BaCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The optimal manganese concentration was between 2 and 8 mM; activity was reduced to one-half and one-fifth of the peak value at 20 and 40 mM manganese, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The extent of debranching was proportional to input Dbr1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A</xref>). From the slopes of the titration curves, we calculated that Dbr1 debranched 0.35 and 7 fmol of substrate per fmol of enzyme in the presence of 2.5 mM magnesium and 4 mM manganese, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A</xref>). Thus, Dbr1 acted catalytically in manganese, but not in magnesium. This is consistent with prior studies that routinely used magnesium and a 20- to100-fold excess of enzyme over substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>).</p><p>An additional experiment was performed in which 4 mM of manganese was mixed with 2.5 mM of each of the other divalent cations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). The debranching activity was abolished in the presence of copper and zinc, but was unaffected by magnesium, calcium or barium. At non-saturating enzyme concentrations, we did not observe stimulation of the debranching activity in 4 mM manganese when the reactions were supplemented with 2.5 to 10 mM magnesium (data not shown). Dbr1 displayed a bell-shaped pH profile with a peak from pH 6.5 to 7.5. Activity declined to one-tenth the peak value at pH 5.5 and less than one-half at pH 8.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p><p>We have used synthetic branched substrates of various lengths and composition (ribonucleotides or deoxyribonucleotides) for <italic>in vitro</italic> debranching assays (depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>). Enzyme titration experiments, using 100&#x02013;200 fmol of substrate, showed no difference in the efficiency of debranching of these different substrates by Dbr1 (data not shown). Note that each of the structures contains a branch site adenosine linked to guanosine; this is the naturally occurring branch dinucleotide and prior studies have established that Dbr1 has a preference for purines at these positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>).</p><p>To gauge the native size of Dbr1 (48 kDa), the enzyme was analyzed by sedimentation in a 15&#x02013;30% glycerol gradient.

Dbr1 sedimented as a single peak between BSA and chymotrypsinogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Debranching activity was highest in fraction 5, coinciding with the abundance of the Dbr1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). The sedimentation profile suggests that Dbr1 is a monomer in solution.</p></sec><sec><title>Debranching activity of mDbr1 and SpDbr1</title><p>In order to determine whether manganese was an effective cofactor for other debranching enzymes, we expressed the mouse and fission yeast Dbr1 homologs in <italic>E.coli</italic> and purified soluble His<sub>10</sub>-tagged mDbr1 and SpDbr1 from bacterial extracts. The sizes of the major polypeptides in the protein preparations were consistent with the calculated molecular masses of recombinant His-tagged mDbr1 and SpDbr1, which are 64 and 57 kDa, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A and D</xref>). mDbr1 debranched a 5&#x02032;-labeled synthetic substrate efficiently in the presence of manganese, but not other metals tested (magnesium, copper, zinc, calcium or barium) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). The optimal manganese concentration was 2 to 4 mM (data not shown). The pH optimum for mDbr1 activity was between pH 6 and 7 (data not shown). The extent of debranching was proportional to the amount of mDbr1 and in the linear range of enzyme-dependence, mDbr1 debranched 1.1 fmol of synthetic RNA substrate per fmol of enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). The specific activity of mDbr1 was 40-fold lower in reactions with magnesium than with manganese (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Reaction of increasing amounts of SpDbr1 with 5 nM branched RNA substrate and 4 mM manganese resulted in the formation of 1.8 fmol of linear product per fmol of SpDbr1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Here we conducted a genetic and biochemical characterization of yeast Dbr1, the enzyme responsible for debranching the lariat intron products of pre-mRNA splicing. We find that Dbr1 is a monomeric enzyme that acts catalytically <italic>in vitro</italic> in the presence of manganese. The need for a dialysis step against EDTA-containing buffer in order to reveal the divalent cation dependence of yeast Dbr1 suggests that the enzyme retains a bound metal during purification, which may account for conflicting findings in prior reports concerning the metal-dependence of yeast and human Dbr1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). The strong preference for manganese at limiting enzyme concentrations is consistent with our mutational results that place Dbr1 as a member of the metallophosphoesterase superfamily.</p><p>Although a potential relationship of Dbr1 to the metallophosphoesterases had been proposed 11 years ago based on local amino acid sequence similarities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>), no systematic effort had been made to test the validity of this prediction. Since the relationship was posited, a wealth of structural and functional information has been gained for exemplary metallophosphoesterase family members, including calcineurin, &#x003bb; phosphatase and Mre11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). The alanine scan of yeast Dbr1 reported here was targeted broadly to 28 amino acids that are conserved in Dbr1 homologs from other organisms. The instructive finding was that seven of the thirteen residues defined by the alanine scan as critical for intron debranching by Dbr1 <italic>in vivo</italic> (His13, Asp40, Asn85, His86, His179, His231 and His233) correspond to putative counterparts of the side chains that comprise the binuclear metal-binding sites and phosphate-binding site in the crystal structure of Mre11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>), which, like Dbr1, is a manganese-dependent phosphodiesterase.</p><p>The active site of <italic>Pfu</italic>Mre11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) contains two manganese ions coordinated directly by aspartate, histidine and asparagine side chains. Six of the seven metal-binding amino acids in Mre11 (His10, Asp49, Asn84, His173, His206 and His208) are conserved in Dbr1 (as His13, Asp40, Asn85, His179, His231 and His233), essential for debranching <italic>in vivo</italic>, and intolerant of conservative substitutions. Analysis of the effects of selected Ala mutations on debranching of a synthetic oligonucleotide substrate <italic>in vitro</italic> highlights important catalytic roles for proposed metal-binding residues Asp40, Asn85, His179, His231 and His233. We surmise that Dbr1 likely contains a binuclear manganese cluster similar to that seen in Mre11.</p><p>The <italic>Pfu</italic>Mre11 structure contains 5&#x02032;-dAMP in the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). The bridging water between the two manganese ions is a good candidate for the attacking nucleophile, because it is located 3.1 &#x0212b; from the phosphorus atom and is almost perfectly apical to the phosphate oxygen atom of the leaving group, which is a nucleoside 3&#x02032;-O in the case of Mre11. As discussed by Voegtli <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>), the bridging water ligand between the manganese ions should have a low p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> and thereby be activated by the metals for attack on the phosphate, which, in Mre11, is coordinated by Asn84 and His85 side chains of the signature GNH(E/D) motif. The corresponding Asn85 and His86 side chains of yeast Dbr1 are critical for debranching <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> and intolerant of conservative substitutions. Therefore, we propose that Asn85 and His86 of Dbr1 contact the scissile 2&#x02032;-5&#x02032; phosphodiester of the branched RNA in a manner analogous to that seen in the Mre11-dAMP complex.</p><p>Dbr1 residue Glu87 is part of the <sup>84</sup>GNHE<sup>87</sup> motif and essential for lariat debranching <italic>in vivo</italic>. Conservative substitution of Glu87 with aspartate resulted in partial restoration of function, but glutamine had no salutary effect. This position is occupied by glutamate in &#x003bb; phosphatase, but is substituted by an aspartate in Mre11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The equivalent Glu77 side chain in the &#x003bb; phosphatase crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>) makes no contacts with either the metal cluster or the bound sulfate ion (a mimetic of phosphate). Rather, Glu77 appears to play a structural role in ensuring the proper conformation of the active site, via hydrogen bonds from the glutamate to three backbone amide nitrogens, including that of Asp49 (corresponding to Asp40 in Dbr1), which coordinates both of the divalent cations. The equivalent Asp86 side chain in the Mre11 structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>) also makes hydrogen bonds to backbone amides flanking essential catalytic residues. We therefore invoke a similar structural role for Glu87 in Dbr1. The notion that conformational perturbations in the <sup>84</sup>GNHE<sup>87</sup> motif can affect Dbr1 activity is consistent with an earlier report that changing Gly84 to alanine resulted in lariat intron accumulation <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>).</p><p>Changing Dbr1 residue Arg45 to alanine or glutamine adversely affected Dbr1 activity <italic>in vivo</italic>, but conservative replacement by lysine ameliorated the defect. The R45A mutation slowed the rate of debranching of a synthetic oligonucleotide substrate by a factor of 6. Although there are no contacts between arginine or lysine residues and the phosphate of 5&#x02032;-dAMP in the crystal structure of <italic>Pfu</italic>Mre11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>), the structure of &#x003bb; phosphatase shows that Arg53 makes a bidentate contact with a sulfate ion that likely mimics a phosphate in the active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). It is conceivable that Dbr1 Arg45 is analogous to Arg53 of &#x003bb; phosphatase.</p><p>The roles of several other functionally relevant Dbr1 residues defined by the present mutational analysis (e.g. Asp49, Tyr68, Tyr69 and Asp180) cannot be readily inferred, because they do not have clearly identifiable counterparts in the available metallophosphoesterase structures. Conservative mutagenesis shows that the carboxylate is the relevant functional group at positions 49 and 87. The finding that debranching function is restored when phenylalanine is introduced in lieu of tyrosine at positions 68 and 69 is inconsistent with the earlier suggestion that phosphorylation of Tyr68 might be functionally important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). We envision two potential classes of functionally important residues that would be conserved among Dbr1 proteins, though not necessarily among other metallophosphoesterases: (i) those that stabilize the Dbr1 tertiary structure (e.g. via hydrophobic interactions or buried salt bridges) and (ii) those that contribute to Dbr1 substrate specificity, via interactions with constituents of the branch structure other than the scissile phosphate. Further biochemical, structural and genetic characterization of Dbr1 will be required to address the basis for substrate recognition and specificity.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by NIH grant GM50288 to B.S., and by a grant from NSERC Canada to M.J.D.
