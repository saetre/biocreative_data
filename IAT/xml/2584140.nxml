In clinical practice, the degree to which this can be achieved is often limited by the increased risk of severe hypoglycemia that accompanies intensified glucose-lowering regimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>). Individuals with type 1 diabetes are, moreover, particularly prone to develop hypoglycemia because of defects in the normal compensatory homeostatic defense response. Almost all individuals with type 1 diabetes fail to release glucagon in response to hypoglycemia, a defect that appears to relate to the progressive loss of &#x003b2;-cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>) and is thought to arise predominantly through the loss of intraislet insulin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>). This leaves epinephrine as the major hormonal counterregulatory defense against low blood glucose. However, a majority of patients will also develop additional deficiencies in the epinephrine counterregulatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>). It has now been established in both rodent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>) and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>) studies that antecedent exposure to hypoglycemia is a major factor involved in the genesis of this defect. Several small trials in human subjects have shown that strict avoidance of hypoglycemia can improve epinephrine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>) and symptomatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>) responses during a subsequent hypoglycemic clamp study. The difficulty in achieving strict hypoglycemia avoidance in both of these trials means that this intervention has not become part of routine clinical practice. Thus, therapeutic options designed to limit the impact of hypoglycemia during intensive insulin therapy remain limited.</p><p>The stimulus to epinephrine release during hypoglycemia is thought to result from activation of specialized glucose-sensing neurons within the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>) and periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>). Glucose-sensing neurons use glucose as a signaling molecule to alter their firing rate and are of two predominant subtypes, namely, glucose-excited neurons, whose firing rate increases, and glucose-inhibited neurons, whose firing rate decreases, as ambient glucose levels rise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>). Based largely on data in rodents, it is currently believed that glucose-sensing neurons react to alterations in extracellular glucose using mechanisms similar to those used by the pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell, with glucokinase and the ATP-sensitive K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channel (K<sub>ATP</sub>) as key steps in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>).</p><p>K<sub>ATP</sub> channels provide a link between neuronal metabolism and membrane potential in many tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>). Classical K<sub>ATP</sub> channels comprise two subunits: a receptor (SUR-1, SUR-2A, or SUR-2B) of sulfonylureas and an inward-rectifier K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channel member, Kir6.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>). Skeletal muscle and cardiac K<sub>ATP</sub> channels comprise SUR-2A and Kir6.2, whereas the pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell K<sub>ATP</sub> channel, the prototype glucose-sensing cell, comprises SUR-1 and Kir6.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>). In the pancreas, the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel has been shown to play a key role in the mechanism by which &#x003b2;-cells regulate insulin release in response to changes in the glucose to which they are exposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>). K<sub>ATP</sub> channels have been demonstrated throughout the brain, including hypothalamic regions thought to be involved in glucose sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>). Examination of gene expression in glucose-sensing neurons using single-cell RT-PCR identified mRNA for SUR-1 and Kir6.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>). Electrophysiological studies of rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>) and mouse brain slice preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>) have demonstrated that sulfonylureas can stimulate the firing of glucose-excited neurons and can alter the response of glucose-excited neurons to changes in ambient glucose levels. In animal models, transgenic Kir6.2 knockout mice show impaired glucose counterregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>), and we have recently shown in vivo that pharmacological closure of the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH; a key glucose-sensing region) via direct microinjection of glibenclamide suppressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>), whereas K<sub>ATP</sub> channel openers (KCOs) amplified, the counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia in both normal and recurrently hypoglycemic rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>). In this later study, the SUR-1&#x02013;selective KCO NN414, when microinjected into the VMH, a key brain glucose-sensing region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>), amplified hypoglycemic counterregulation at significantly lower concentrations than the nonselective KCO, diazoxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these data suggest that K<sub>ATP</sub> channels allow glucose-sensing neurons to translate the metabolic signal into an alteration in neuronal firing rates and, moreover, that KCOs may offer a potential therapeutic option for individuals with type 1 diabetes. In the current study, this hypothesis is explored in a series of rodent models. Our data show that systemic administration of a SUR-1&#x02013;selective KCO has a consistent effect to amplify the epinephrine response to controlled hypoglycemia in nondiabetic and diabetic rats and in those with defective counterregulation.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>Male Sprague-Dawley (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 102; weight 305 &#x000b1; 4 g &#x0005b;means &#x000b1; SE&#x0005d;) and diabetic BB rats (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 12; disease duration 2&#x02013;4 weeks) were housed in the Yale Animal Resource Center, fed a standard pellet diet (Agway Prolab 3000), and maintained on a 12-h/12-h day/night cycle. Diabetic BB rats were maintained on once-daily protamine zinc insulin, with doses based on body weight, 9:00 <sc>a.m.</sc> glucose, and protocol. The animal care and experimental protocols were reviewed and approved by the Yale Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</p><sec><title>Surgery.</title><p>One week before each study, all animals were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection (1 ml/kg) of a mixture of xylazine (20 mg/ml AnaSed; Lloyd Laboratories, Shenandoah, IA) and ketamine (100 mg/ml Ketaset; Aveco, Fort Dodge, IA) in a ratio of 1:2 (vol:vol), before undergoing vascular surgery for the implantation of vascular catheters in a carotid artery and jugular vein. In some rodents, after this procedure, microinjection guide cannulas were bilaterally inserted into the VMH (coordinates from bregma: antero-posterior &#x02212;2.6 mm, medio-lateral &#x000b1;3.8 mm, and dorso-ventral &#x02212;8.3 mm at an angle of 20&#x000b0;), as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Recurrent hypoglycemia protocol.</title><p>In these studies, rats received an intraperitoneal injection of human regular insulin (Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN) at a dose of 10 units/kg given once daily for the 3 consecutive days before the glucose clamp study. Each episode of hypoglycemia (tail vein blood glucose 1.7&#x02013;2.2 mmol/l &#x0005b;30&#x02013;40 mg/dl&#x0005d;) lasted for &#x0223c;3 h, after which the rats were given free access to food and intraperitoneal dextrose, if required. Any rats experiencing a seizure were excluded and did not undergo a subsequent clamp study. The model of recurrent hypoglycemia used in our laboratory has been previously reported in detail and has been shown to induce suppression of epinephrine responses to subsequent hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>KCOs.</title><p>This study used intravenous delivery of the SUR-1&#x02013;selective KCO NN414 (Novo Nordisk A/S, Malvo, Denmark) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>). NN414 was prepared in 1.5 mg m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> artificial extracellular fluid (aECF) for systemic delivery. In all studies, NN414 was delivered systemically 30 min before the induction of hypoglycemia.</p></sec><sec><title>Microinjection.</title><p>On the morning of the study, 26-gauge microinjection needles, designed to extend 1 mm beyond the tip of the guide cannula (Plastics One, Roanoke, VA), were inserted bilaterally to the VMH.

Microinjection occurred immediately before the hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic clamp study as detailed below. At the end of the study, the rats were killed, and probe position was confirmed in all rats.</p></sec><sec><title>Infusion protocol.</title><p>In all experiments, the same hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic clamp infusion protocol was used. Overnight-fasted rats had their vascular catheters opened and were then allowed to settle over 90 min. Thereafter, a hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic clamp technique as adapted for the rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>) was initiated.

Samples for measurement of the hormones epinephrine, norepinephrine, glucagon, insulin, and C-peptide were taken at &#x02212;30, 0, 60, and 90 min.</p></sec><sec><title>Analytical procedures.</title><p>Plasma glucose was measured by the glucose oxidase method (Beckman, Fullerton, CA). Catecholamine analysis was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography using electrochemical detection (ESA, Acton, MA); plasma insulin and glucagon were measured by radioimmunoassay (Linco, St. Charles, MO).

Of note, only the higher dose of NN414 (6 mg/kg) induced a significant fall in C-peptide before initiation of the hypoglycemic clamp study (308 &#x000b1; 53 to 75 &#x000b1; 16 pmol/l; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). In addition, mean plasma glucose achieved during the clamp procedure was slightly but significantly higher in those rats that had been given 0.6 and 0.06 mg/kg NN414.</p><p>During the basal period, mean counterregulatory hormone levels did not differ between groups and were not affected by injection of NN414 or control (data not shown). Hypoglycemia induced significant rises in all counterregulatory hormones in both control and NN414 groups, with the exception of high-dose NN414, in which glucagon failed to rise during hypoglycemia, despite the marked reduction in C-peptide (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). In contrast, NN414 had a marked and significant effect on plasma epinephrine during hypoglycemia (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>). NN414 given at 0.6 mg/kg produced an &#x0223c;108&#x00025; increase in the peak plasma epinephrine over the control group. The rise in plasma norepinephrine (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>) was substantially less than the rise in epinephrine, and peak levels were lower in rats treated with 0.6 and 6 mg/kg NN414. However, the overall glucose counterregulatory response was significantly amplified with NN414, with all doses resulting in a clear reduction in the amount of exogenous glucose (glucose infusion rate &#x0005b;GIR&#x0005d;; <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref>) required to maintain the hypoglycemic clamp. After 0.6 mg/kg NN414, this represented an &#x0223c;80&#x00025; reduction in the GIR.</p><p>To explore the utility of the nonselective KCO diazoxide, an identical hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia study was performed in Sprague-Dawley rats. Diazoxide (6 mg/kg; <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 6) delivered systemically significantly amplified the mean (&#x000b1; SE) peak epinephrine (2,307 &#x000b1; 342 vs. 1,479 &#x000b1; 205 pg/ml, diazoxide vs. control, respectively; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) but not the peak norepinephrine (507 &#x000b1; 89 vs. 539 &#x000b1; 29 pg/ml; NS) or peak glucagon (354 &#x000b1; 38 vs. 252 &#x000b1; 82 ng/l; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.2) response to hypoglycemia. Diazoxide-treated rats also required less glucose during the hypoglycemic clamp study (4.9 &#x000b1; 1.6 vs. 10.5 &#x000b1; 1.8 mg &#x000b7; kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> &#x000b7; min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).

We have previously reported that this model induces defective counterregulatory responses to subsequent hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>). As in the previous studies, rats received 0.6 mg/kg NN414 or vehicle delivered intravenously 30 min before the clamp procedure.

As expected, plasma C-peptide was low under basal (42 &#x000b1; 10 and 36 &#x000b1; 3 pmol l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and hypoglycemic (36 &#x000b1; 1 and 29 &#x000b1; 3 pmol/l) conditions and did not differ between groups (control &#x0005b;<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 6&#x0005d; vs. NN414 &#x0005b;<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 6&#x0005d;, respectively). In the diabetic BB rats, no significant rise in plasma glucagon from baseline was seen during hypoglycemia in either group, and peak plasma glucagon during hypoglycemia also did not differ between groups (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). However, as in the nondiabetic rats, systemic NN414 produced a marked stimulus to epinephrine secretion (&#x0223c;200&#x00025; increase; <xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), although absolute epinephrine levels remained lower than those seen in the nondiabetic rats. In addition, NN414 significantly amplified the norepinephrine response during hypoglycemia (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>C</italic></xref>; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), the overall effect being to reduce GIR by &#x0223c;60&#x00025; (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>D</italic></xref>; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In the present study, systemically delivered SUR-1&#x02013;selective KCO was shown to amplify the glucose counterregulatory response to acute hypoglycemia in normal and recurrently hypoglycemic nondiabetic rats and in diabetic BB rats exposed to recurrent hypoglycemia (a rodent model of type 1 diabetes with markedly impaired glucose counterregulation). Moreover, the SUR-1&#x02013;selective KCO was effective when given acutely or when delivered for 3 consecutive days before the hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic clamp study. Taken together, these studies in the rat suggest that SUR-1&#x02013;selective KCOs may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of HAAF in type 1 diabetic humans.</p><p>The K<sub>ATP</sub> channel consists of pore-forming Kir6.x subunits that associate with different types of regulatory sulfonylurea receptor subunits: SUR-1, SUR-2A, and SUR-2B. SUR-2 channels are predominantly expressed in cardiac/skeletal muscle (SUR-2A) and vascular smooth muscle (SUR-2B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>), activation of which can cause vasodilation and effect cardiac muscle contractility. Diazoxide activates both SUR-1 and SUR-2B regulatory subunits. When delivered directly to the VMH, diazoxide can amplify the counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>), and in the current study, when given systemically at a dose of 6 mg/kg, diazoxide can also amplify the counterregulatory response (the higher dose required consistent with the reduced potency of diazoxide to activate SUR-1 compared with NN414 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>&#x0005d;). However, through its action on the SUR-2B subunit of the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel, the use of diazoxide is limited by its potential to cause vasodilation, reflex tachycardia, and hirsuitism (also thought to be SUR2 mediated). The current studies used a compound, NN414, developed by Novo Nordisk, as a selective SUR-1 KCO. In vitro studies have shown that NN414 is highly selective for the Kir6.2/SUR-1 channel, with no significant activation of SUR-2A and -2B channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>). NN414, even at high doses, has been shown to have no effect on blood pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>). Thus, for an effective long-term therapy for individuals with type 1 diabetes, a SUR-1&#x02013;selective agent is liable to be both more effective in its action on glucose sensing and less likely to be associated with these adverse effects.</p><p>Our findings contrast with those of Raju and Cryer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>), who examined the effect of oral diazoxide (6 mg/kg) on the counterregulatory responses to hypoglycemia in 14 nondiabetic humans. Diazoxide, given orally, suppressed basal C-peptide and suppressed the glucagon response to hypoglycemia induced 2 h later while having no effect on epinephrine, norepinephrine, or neurogenic symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>). Similarly, Bingham et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>) reported no effect of oral diazoxide (5 mg/kg) on the hormonal counterregulatory response in 10 nondiabetic humans. In our rodent study, diazoxide given intravenously 30 min before hypoglycemia also suppressed C-peptide but resulted in an amplified epinephrine response during hypoglycemia. The glucagon response was also increased but not significantly so. These differences may reflect species differences in Kir6.2/SUR-1 channel expression and function, and in addition, the higher systemic diazoxide levels that were probably achieved in the rodent may have induced a degree of hypotension (not measured in the present study) that may have contributed to the epinephrine response. However, this would not explain the NN414 findings. Furthermore, in pilot studies we found that oral NN414 (1.2 mg/kg) has the same effect to amplify counterregulation during hypoglycemia (data not shown). The consistent effect of NN414 to amplify the epinephrine counterregulatory response suggests that higher systemic levels of diazoxide may be necessary to induce a SUR-1&#x02013;mediated action on the catecholaminergic response to hypoglycemia.</p><p>It was notable in the present study that high-dose NN414 markedly suppressed glucagon secretion during hypoglycemia. Before induction of the hypoglycemic clamp, plasma C-peptide was also more markedly suppressed by high-dose NN414. This latter finding is consistent with the intraislet insulin hypothesis, in which defective glucagon secretion during hypoglycemia is thought to arise through a failure of intraislet insulin levels to fall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>). Alternatively, it may represent a direct action of NN414 on K<sub>ATP</sub> channels in the pancreatic &#x003b1;-cells. It has been shown in &#x003b1;-cells isolated from SUR-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, but not wild-type mice, that both tolbutamide and glucose fail to produce membrane depolarization and that diazoxide reduces glucagon secretion to the same extent as an elevation of glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>). This effect might arise from the distinct electrophysiological properties of &#x003b1;-cells.</p><p>It was also notable that norepinephrine responses during hypoglycemia did not parallel those of epinephrine. During hypoglycemia, systemic norepinephrine has not proven discriminatory in previous clamp studies in rodents by our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>). Norepinephrine is released primarily from sympathetic nerve terminals, and so, systemic levels provide only a weak index of local sympathetic neural activity. Plasma norepinephrine is also both lower than epinephrine (&#x0223c;10&#x02013;25&#x00025;) and a less potent agonist of adrenergic receptors, so small differences between groups in systemic levels are not informative. It was also of note that the absolute effect of NN414 was less in diabetic BB rats than in nondiabetic rats. This suggests that additional mechanisms, not reversible through KCO therapy, may contribute to defective counterregulation in diabetes.</p><p>It is interesting to speculate on where the systemically delivered KCO might act. Although the Kir6.x pore-forming unit is widely expressed in the body, the expression of SUR-1 is predominantly limited to brain and pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>). Within the brain, SUR-1 and Kir6.x are expressed both in regions known to be involved in glucose sensing and in other brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>). Glucose-sensing neurons in the VMH are known to express SUR-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>). Our data demonstrating that the action of systemic NN414 could be reversed after the direct application of a K<sub>ATP</sub> channel blocker to the VMH suggest this is one potential site that mediates the effect of NN414. That being said, it is also possible that the changes seen were the net result of K<sub>ATP</sub> channel opening at a different site and an independent action of K<sub>ATP</sub> channel closure in the VMH. NN414, if acting centrally, could equally be acting on glucose-sensing neurons in other brain regions such as the hindbrain. Sulfonylurea-like compounds are not generally thought to cross the blood-brain barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>), although recent studies of KCOs in ischemic preconditioning in the brain provide some evidence that they might act centrally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref>). Unfortunately, a radiolabeled form of NN414 is not available to directly test this question. Another possibility is that NN414 is interacting with portal-mesenteric vein (PMV) glucose sensors. PMV glucose sensors play a role in the modulation of counterregulatory responses to hypoglycemia. However, PMV glucose sensors are thought to play a greater role in slow-fall rather than the rapid induction of hypoglycemia induced in the present study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r48">48</xref>), and a role for SUR-1 in these sensors has not been established. Another peripheral glucose sensor is located in the carotid body, but dogs with carotid body resections showed blunted glucagon and cortisol secretion during hypoglycemia, with epinephrine and norepinephrine release being unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r49">49</xref>). Finally, SUR-1 and Kir6.2 are coexpressed with glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) in intestinal L- and K-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r50">50</xref>), which raises the possibility of an indirect action through altered GLP-1 secretion. However, we have previously shown in human subjects that glucose ingestion while hypoglycemia is maintained leads to an amplification of the epinephrine response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r51">51</xref>), which would suggest that K<sub>ATP</sub> closure, rather than opening, within L-cells mediates this effect. Moreover, GLP-1 secretion is liable to be minimal during hypoglycemia.</p><p>One other notable finding in the present study was that 3 days of NN414 given as a single intravenous bolus resulted in an amplified epinephrine response to a subsequent controlled hypoglycemic challenge. The ability of a compound to amplify counterregulatory responses to a subsequent episode of hypoglycemia and not just when given during the hypoglycemic episode would be important for type 1 diabetic individuals in whom hypoglycemia does usually occur at predictable times. Why this effect should occur after 3 days of NN414 therapy is unknown. NN414 given to human subjects at a similar dose (0.625 mg/kg) has a half-life of only 1.2 h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>), and so it seems unlikely to represent a persisting direct action on the Kir6.2/SUR-1 channel. This finding therefore raises the possibility that NN414 could through secondary effects render the glucose-sensing pathway more sensitive to a subsequent hypoglycemic challenge.</p><p>In summary, in the current study, we have been able to demonstrate in a variety of rodent models that the SUR-1/Kir6.2&#x02013;selective KCO when given systemically is able to amplify epinephrine responses to hypoglycemia. These studies provide the first evidence of a potential therapeutic intervention for HAAF in type 1 diabetes. The dose of NN414 that we used in these rodent studies compares with that of trials in human subjects assessing pharmacokinetics after single-dose NN414 (0.625&#x02013;12.5 mg/kg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>); however, no human studies using this compound during hypoglycemia have as yet been performed. Future studies in rodent models designed to establish the best strategies for delivering these agents and in human subjects to validate the rodent data are now required.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>R.J.M. has received a Career Development Award from the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.
