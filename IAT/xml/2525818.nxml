Notch signaling plays a role in cell fate decisions in many different tissues of multicellular organisms including the nervous system.

Similar to that described in other species the GFP-positive ChP of zebrafish as expected develops at the dorsal midline of the fourth ventricle in close contact with dorsal cranial vessels. We did not observe sprouting of capillaries from the dorsal veins into the ChP proper as late as 144hpf, which implies it either takes place during later development or otherwise indicates a simpler organization of the ChP-associated vasculature in zebrafish compared to that in mammals, where fenestrated capillaries are embedded in the ChP proper.

It is characterized by both the recruitment of cells originated from the dorsal neuroepithelium and migration of cells from rhombic lips towards the midline where they form the monolayered sheet of TC as manifested by an appearance of GFP-positive cells at the dorsal midline. This phase is abnormal in <italic>mib</italic> mutants, where cell differentiation starts prematurely, the ability of cells to join the TC is impaired and the sheet of GFP-positive TC is interrupted by GFP-negative cells. This early disruption of TC rises a number of questions such as what regulates the initial assembly of TC, and whether this property is intrinsic or extrinsic to the TC. The abnormality of the ChP in <italic>mib</italic> is caused by an early defect in its patterning.

Importantly, at the end of ChP morphogenesis the midline group of cells is connected to the bilateral groups of radial cells in rhombic lips of r5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003090-g002">Fig. 2E'</xref>). It is not clear whether this event represents one more stage of ChP morphogenesis and whether the bilateral clusters represent a separate population of ChP cells.

Perhaps the fast movement detected is linked to the appearance of the glycogen stores. Future experiments could evaluate whether glycogen in zebrafish ChP is distributed in a similar fashion to that in other vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003090-Dziegielewska1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003090-Jacobsen1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. The presence of glycogen may provide a mechanistic explanation of how cells develop the ability to move fast during the final phase of ChP morphogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Cell lineage of ChP cells</title><p>It was previously described that different cell types contribute to the mammalian ChP. Some of those cells share their origin with hindbrain roof plate and others originate directly from the rhombic lips <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003090-Hunter1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. The question remains whether the same developmental scenario takes place in zebrafish. Our results show that indeed cells delaminating from the rhombic lips contribute to the ChP field, but the analysis of movies was not informative to trace origin of ChP cells. The transplantation experiments demonstrated a common origin of the ChP, cells in bilateral clusters of r5 and neural crest derivatives. Therefore, we can conclude that in zebrafish ChP cells derive from the lateral edge of the neural plate. But given the fact that more work is needed to define different cell lineages within the ChP, it could be premature to conclude that all cell types in the ChP derive from the lateral neural plate.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals</title><p>Zebrafish were maintained according to established protocols <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003090-Westerfield1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref> in agreement with the IACUC regulations and rules of the IMCB zebrafish facility.
