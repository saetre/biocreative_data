In the uninjured retina, scattered M&#x000fc;ller glia (more frequently those in peripheral retina) are associated with clusters of proliferating retinal progenitors that are restricted to the rod photoreceptor lineage, but following injury, the M&#x000fc;ller-associated retinal progenitors can function as multipotent retinal stem cells to regenerate other types of retinal neurons.

It is now widely recognized that neural stem cells persist in specialized 'niches' in the adult mammalian forebrain where they generate large numbers of selected types of neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. One of the most intriguing recent discoveries is that these adult neural stem cells exhibit some properties of glial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and that neurons in certain regions of the developing embryonic mammalian and avian brains also derive from radial glia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In the adult brain, the microenvironmental compartments called 'niches' provide an embryonic-like milieu to support the maintenance of neural stem cells with the essential properties of self-renewal and pluripotency, <italic>i.e</italic>. capacity for multi-lineage differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Although still poorly understood, some defining characteristics of adult stem cell niches in the brain and elsewhere are beginning to emerge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Some common features of neural stem cells and their niches include: prominent cadherin-mediated adhesive junctions, a rich extracellular matrix and contact with a specialized basal lamina via integrin-mediated junctions, close association with blood vessels, cell-surface carbohydrate markers (<italic>e.g</italic>., stage-specific embryonic antigen-1, SSEA-1, also called Lewis X, LeX or leukocyte cluster of differentiation 15, CD15), expression of BLBP (brain lipid binding protein, encoded by the gene <italic>brain-type fatty-acid binding protein 7</italic>, <italic>FABP7</italic>), expression of selected classes of intermediate filament proteins (<italic>e.g</italic>., nestin), responsiveness to extrinsic signals such as IGF (insulin-like growth factor), TGF&#x003b2;/BMP (transforming growth factor&#x003b2;/bone morphogenetic protein) family, Wnts, Shh (sonic hedgehog), Notch, and LIF (leukemia inhibitory factor). Probably not coincidentally, these extrinsic regulators represent all of the major families of signaling pathways that are essential for early embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>The neural retina is an embryonic derivative of the forebrain, but unlike the cerebral cortex, adult neural stem cells have not been described in mammalian retina <italic>in vivo</italic>. With the exception of fish and larval amphibians, retinal neurogenesis in vertebrates is completed during embryonic or early postembryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Neural progenitors with the capacity to generate retinal neurons can be recognized from the earliest stages of neural induction by regionalized expression of a series of transcriptional regulators that specify retinal identity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. These early 'eye field transcription factors' include the paired-class homeobox genes <italic>Pax6 </italic>and <italic>Rx</italic>, a member of the <italic>sine oculis </italic>homeobox family, <italic>Six3</italic>, and a LIM-homeobox gene, <italic>Lhx</italic>. Additional members of the paired-class homeobox family, <italic>Chx10 </italic>(known as <italic>vsx2 </italic>in goldfish and zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]) and <italic>Crx</italic>, appear at later stages in the developing optic cup [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Continued co-expression of these homeobox transcription factors is a distinguishing feature of multipotent retinal progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>In larval amphibians and teleost fish, retinal neurogenesis continues postembryonically at the interface between neural retina and ciliary epithelium, a region called the ciliary marginal zone (CMZ) or circumferential germinal zone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In these species the CMZ generates the majority of retinal tissue found in the adult eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], but the specialized cellular and molecular characteristics of the CMZ niche that support the maintenance and regulate the activity of retinal stem cells in the adult fish eye have not yet been elucidated. A reduced and transient CMZ has been described recently in postnatal chicks and marsupial mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and a residual CMZ is seen in mice with a genetic lesion that increases activity of sonic hedgehog signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Although the ciliary epithelium of the adult mammalian retina may retain some neurogenic potential <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], any endogenous capacity for neurogenesis in these species remains latent and without functional consequence.</p><p>In addition to the CMZ, another source of retinal progenitor cells persists in the adult teleost fish retina, although the identity and characteristics of these cells are not well understood. In the uninjured, differentiated retina, rod photoreceptors accumulate in central retina as the fish eye grows, and they are generated by rapidly dividing, lineage-restricted rod precursor cells located in the outer nuclear layer (ONL), among the nuclei of differentiated rods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The rod precursors are derived from more slowly proliferating progenitors in the inner nuclear layer (INL) that give rise to clusters of rapidly proliferating progenitors (transit amplifying cells), which migrate into the outer nuclear layer along the radial fibers of the M&#x000fc;ller glial cells in larval [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and adult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] fish. Not all of the M&#x000fc;ller glia are associated with neurogenesis and the spatial distribution of rod precursors and clusters of INL progenitors varies in that they are present in greater density near the CMZ, <italic>i.e</italic>., in the most recently generated retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The slowly dividing progenitors in the INL are immunoreactive for Pax6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], but it is not known whether they express other retinal progenitor transcription factors found in the CMZ. The rod precursors in the ONL do not express Pax6, but they do express the proneural bHLH transcription factor, <italic>NeuroD</italic>, suggesting that these ONL progenitors may be committed to the photoreceptor lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>Although their identity has not yet been established, it is clear that multipotent retinal stem cells (with the capacity to generate all types of retinal neurons, not just rod photoreceptors) persist not only in the germinal zone of the CMZ but also in central retina. Adult teleost fish have a robust capacity to regenerate retinal neurons and to restore the appropriate laminar retinal architecture following damage inflicted by surgical lesions, neurotoxins, laser or photic lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. All of these studies concluded that the source of regenerated neurons in central retina is an intrinsic progenitor population and not the CMZ. In the intact retina, the progeny of the INL progenitors differentiate only as rod photoreceptors, but several authors have speculated that these progenitors may retain the capacity to generate multiple lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Alternatively, it has been suggested that M&#x000fc;ller glial cells, which proliferate rapidly in response to retinal damage, may retain a latent capacity to generate neurons in the fish retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>In the present study we define the molecular profiles of retinal progenitor cells in the growing and regenerating adult zebrafish retina and we examine the properties of the cellular niches in which they reside. We introduce a simple heat lesion paradigm for analysis of retinal regeneration, we describe the time course of regeneration of cone photoreceptors, and we examine the molecular profile of the injury-induced proliferating progenitor cells that give rise to regenerated cones. Our data show that the adult fish retina has two types of specialized microenvironmental niches that sustain multipotent, self-renewing retinal stem cells: the peripheral CMZ and the microenvironment created by some M&#x000fc;ller glia in differentiated retina. We further demonstrate that the retinal stem cell niches in the CMZ germinal zone and the injury-induced stem cell niche in the regenerating retina share a common molecular signature that includes activated Notch signaling, diffuse distribution of N-cadherin, expression of BLBP, and expression of the retinal homeobox genes <italic>rx1, pax6a </italic>and <italic>vsx2/Chx10</italic>. M&#x000fc;ller glia form the retinal stem cell niche and may generate retinal stem cells in the regenerating retina. Like the neuroepithelial cells (retinal stem cells and progenitors) of the CMZ they are associated with the specialized basal lamina of blood vessels at the vitreal surface of the retina and their nuclei divide at the apical surface in contact with the subretinal space (an embryonic derivative of the ventricular lumen of the forebrain).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Molecular profile of retinal stem cells and progenitor cells in the zebrafish CMZ</title><p>The initial differentiation of retinal neurons and formation of retinal laminae in zebrafish is completed by the end of embryonic development at 3 days post-fertilization (dpf), after which proliferating retinal progenitors are concentrated in a germinal zone at the peripheral margins of the retina in a wedge of cells formed by the converging retinal laminae, called the ciliary marginal zone, CMZ (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). A subset of the proliferating retinal progenitors in the zebrafish CMZ express paired-class homeobox transcription factors associated with retinal specification, including <italic>rx1</italic>, which is also expressed in differentiating (postmitotic) cone photoreceptors in the ONL (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B, C, F</xref>), <italic>vsx2/Chx10 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>) and <italic>pax6a </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>).

In larval Xenopus retina the pattern and spatial distribution of these and other molecular markers in progenitor cells in the CMZ has been interpreted to reflect the temporal sequence of retinal development: multipotent progenitors (<italic>i.e</italic>. retinal stem cells) are adjacent to the ciliary epithelium and retinal progenitors with more restricted fates are more centrally located [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. To determine whether a similar organization exists in the CMZ in zebrafish we systematically examined the expression patterns of a selected subset of these genes. We divided the CMZ into four anatomically defined regions: peripheral, middle, central-outer and central-inner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). We then assayed gene expression by <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization in the CMZ of 2-month-old zebrafish and ranked the level of signal in each of the four regions as strong (rank = 3), moderate (2), weak (1), or not detectable (0). Because <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization is not a quantitative assay tool, no conclusions can be drawn about absolute levels of gene expression, nor can the absence of a signal be taken as evidence of no expression, since other more sensitive techniques detect lower levels of mRNA transcripts. However, the advantage of <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization is that it provides spatial information about relative expression levels in different cell populations within a heterogeneous tissue, which was the primary goal of our analysis.

To identify the retinal stem cells responsible for regenerating retinal neurons, we first needed to know when the regenerated neurons are born so we could focus on cells proliferating during and/or before that time. Not all of the mitotic cells at every interval following the lesion are retinal stem cells; for example, microglia proliferate rapidly in response to retinal injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] and phagocytize the dead cells and debris. Differentiated M&#x000fc;ller glia proliferate after injury, even in mammalian retinas that fail to regenerate neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we confined our analysis of the time course of neuronal regeneration in the retina to cone photoreceptors because they have distinctive and highly specialized morphology and several unique cell-specific markers. To document regeneration of cones, we first labeled proliferating cells with BrdU at 3 to 10 dpl and then waited for several days up to one month to allow the progeny of the mitotic cells to differentiate. We then identified double-cones with the zpr1 antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). When the retina is examined 4 hours after BrdU exposure at 4 dpl, mitotic cells are labeled in the region of the lesion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). At this stage, microglia (the vascular-derived, resident macrophages that are specifically labeled with the 4C4 antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]) are in the subretinal space between the outer limiting membrane and the RPE and are not part of the pool of proliferating cells within the retina (data not shown). When fish survived for 4 days after the BrdU (to 7 dpl), a few progeny of the BrdU<sup>+ </sup>cells had begun to differentiate and express the double cone marker zpr1, and they are small and immature compared with the intact cones adjacent to the lesion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). By 31 dpl the regenerated cones are fully differentiated and indistinguishable from the surrounding photoreceptors, with the exception that their nuclei retain the BrdU-label (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>).

It is therefore a useful marker to identify BrdU<sup>+ </sup>proliferating M&#x000fc;ller glia.</p><p>If M&#x000fc;ller glia function as retinal progenitors/stem cells in the injured retina, they should be proliferating before and/or during the interval when regenerated cone photoreceptors are being born (<italic>i.e</italic>., undergoing their terminal mitotic division), which we found is between 2 and 4 dpl. Very few cells incorporate BrdU at 1 dpl (data not shown), but at 2 dpl approximately 80% of the proliferating cells are <italic>apoE</italic><sup>+</sup>/BrdU<sup>+ </sup>M&#x000fc;ller glia (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). The fraction of <italic>apoE</italic><sup>+</sup>/BrdU<sup>+ </sup>M&#x000fc;ller glia in the population of proliferating cells dropped to ~50% by 3 and 4 dpl, while the total number of BrdU<sup>+ </sup>nuclei increased from a mean of 34 per section at 2 dpl, to 85 per section at 3 dpl, to 235 per section at 4 dpl (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). These data are consistent with several interpretations. M&#x000fc;ller glia that express <italic>apoE </italic>constitute the vast majority (80%) of the proliferating cells at 2 dpl when the size of the BrdU<sup>+ </sup>population is smallest. The remaining 20% of the BrdU<sup>+ </sup>cells that are <italic>apoE</italic><sup>- </sup>at this time could be progenitors in the rod lineage or dedifferentiated M&#x000fc;ller glia or progeny of M&#x000fc;ller glia that have down-regulated <italic>apoE </italic>expression. A closer examination of the rare BrdU<sup>+ </sup>cells at early intervals prior to 2 dpl with specific markers for retinal stem cells and progenitors (<italic>e.g., rx1, pax6a, vsx2, neuroD, crx</italic>) might answer this question. The decline in the M&#x000fc;ller glia fraction of the expanding BrdU<sup>+ </sup>population at 3 and 4 dpl could be explained by dedifferentiation of proliferating M&#x000fc;ller cells and/or a more rapid rate of proliferation of non-M&#x000fc;ller retinal progenitors. Finally, these data are also consistent with the hypothesis that injury-induced retinal stem cells might derive from M&#x000fc;ller glia that begin to proliferate at or before 2 dpl, dedifferentiate and give rise to retinal stem cells.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We have characterized the molecular microenvironment of two kinds of specialized niches that sustain retinal stem cells in zebrafish: 1) the ciliary marginal zone (CMZ) at the peripheral retinal margin and 2) some M&#x000fc;ller glia in the differentiated retina (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). The retinal stem cell niche in the zebrafish CMZ has several features in common with the neurogenic niches in the adult mammalian brain, including the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the dentate gyrus subgranular zone (SGZ), which have been described as 'displaced neuroepithelium'. Adult neural stem cells are specialized astrocytes that serve as both neural stem cells and niche cells; they extend processes to form apical junctions at the ventricular surface and also have extensive contacts with the basal lamina surrounding blood vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The retinal stem cells in the zebrafish CMZ that co-express <italic>rx1, pax6a </italic>and <italic>vsx2/Chx10 </italic>contact both the apical surface and the basal lamina and are in close proximity to a large blood vessel (ora collection vessel) that is SSEA-1<sup>+ </sup>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Other characteristics that mimic neuroepithelial cells of the developing neural tube and retina include activation of the Notch signaling cascade (reflected by expression of <italic>notch1a/1b, notch3, dlA, dlB, dlC, her6/Hes1, her2/Hes5</italic>: RLB and PAR, unpublished observations) and diffuse distribution of N-cadherin on the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. The radial glial marker BLBP is a downstream target of Notch signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>] and of Pax6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>], both of which are implicated in the maintenance of neural stem cell fate. The CMZ cells in zebrafish express the radial glial marker BLBP, as do the cells of the ciliary epithelium and retinal pigmented epithelium, and immature M&#x000fc;ller glia. Mitotic activity in the CMZ is stimulated by insulin-like growth factor (IGF) in goldfish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>], and by Wnt or sonic hedgehog (Shh) in chick, mouse and Xenopus retinas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. The SSEA-1 carbohydrate binds Wnts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], and its association with the ora collection vessel in zebrafish may contribute to the special microenvironment that maintains a neuroepithelium at the CMZ. The proximity of the RPE on the apical side is another potential source of secreted signals that might promote neuroepithelial properties in the CMZ. The RPE in zebrafish expresses BLBP and is a source of Shh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>]. We have not yet looked for PEDF (pigment epithelium-derived factor) in zebrafish, but this growth factor is secreted by components of the SVZ and supports self-renewal of adult neural stem cells in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Stem cell niches in zebrafish retina</bold>. The germinal zone at the boundary between neural retina and ciliary epithelium (CE) is a circumferential wedge of neuroepithelial cells (in red) called the ciliary marginal zone (CMZ). Multipotent retinal stem cells span the width of the retinal epithelium adjacent to the CE and more restricted retina progenitors give rise sequentially to 1) retinal ganglion cells (GC), 2) amacrine cells (AC), 3) bipolar (BP) and horizontal cells (HC), and 4) cone photoreceptors. The CMZ is separated from the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) by a narrow subretinal space. The ora collection blood vessel (BV) encircles the retina at the CMZ; other blood vessels of the hyaloid circulation lie along the vitreal surface. M&#x000fc;ller glia (blue) span the width of the retina and create a niche that supports retinal progenitors of the last-born retinal neuron in the 5) rod photoreceptor lineage (green). Expression of specific markers is shown for retinal progenitors/stem cells and associated cell types. Retinal injury induces a reorganization of the M&#x000fc;ller cell/rod lineage niche to produce a regeneration niche (purple) that mirrors the CMZ niche in patterns of cellular organization and gene expression.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-213X-6-36-7"/></fig><p>A separate type of retinal stem cell niche is created within the differentiated retina by some of the M&#x000fc;ller glia. Retinal M&#x000fc;ller glia are often compared with radial glia of the developing brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>]. Like radial glia, processes of M&#x000fc;ller glia span the width of the retinal epithelium from the apical epithelial surface (outer limiting membrane) to the basal lamina at the vitreal surface and they express structural and functional markers of astrocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). In the intact retina of teleost fish, rapidly proliferating INL progenitors (the transit amplifying cells in the rod photoreceptor lineage) are clustered around radial M&#x000fc;ller cell fibers and they use these radial processes as guides along which to migrate into the ONL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>], as we showed previously by serial reconstruction electron microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Not all M&#x000fc;ller glia are associated with INL progenitors, and the frequency is highest near the retinal periphery (the youngest retina, most recently generated by the CMZ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. We do not yet know whether these neurogenic niches are associated with a specialized subpopulation of M&#x000fc;ller glial cells. In the intact retina, the retinal progenitors in these putative M&#x000fc;ller cell niches are directed exclusively into the rod lineage, but following injury, the frequency of neurogenic clusters increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>], the fate of the retinal progenitors is altered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>], and the structural and molecular characteristics of the M&#x000fc;ller glia change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>] (present data). M&#x000fc;ller glia in the injured fish retina exhibit many phenotypic changes associated with reactive gliosis, such as up-regulation of GFAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>], which is often considered an indicator of stress and pathological processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>] and reentry into the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Here we show that they also exhibit phenotypic changes suggestive of dedifferentiation, such as re-expression of BLBP and migration of their nuclei toward the apical surface, both of which are characteristic of immature M&#x000fc;ller glia in the larval zebrafish retina (RLB, LKB and PAR, unpublished observations). The injury-induced retinal stem cells/multipotent progenitors are entwined in M&#x000fc;ller processes, which in response to injury up-regulate components of the Notch-Delta signaling pathways and <italic>N-cadherin </italic>(<italic>cdh2</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>]. The N-cadherin protein becomes distributed to the basolateral membranes of the activated M&#x000fc;ller glia, similar to its distribution on neuroepithelial cells.</p><p>Radial glia in the embryonic mammalian brain are neurogenic progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>] and specialized astrocytes in the adult mammalian brain function as neural stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">84</xref>], so it is not surprising that we and others have suggested that M&#x000fc;ller glia might generate the injury-induced retinal stem cells in teleost fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>], although direct evidence that employs a selective and permanent lineage tracer for M&#x000fc;ller glial fate mapping has not yet been accomplished. Fischer and Reh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">85</xref>] have proposed that a latent neurogenic capacity persists in M&#x000fc;ller glia of early postnatal chick based on observations of BrdU incorporation and expression of neuronal markers in immature M&#x000fc;ller cells following intraocular injection of neurotoxins (NMDA, kainate or colchicine) or growth factors (IGF and FGF2), and similar observations were made in rat retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">86</xref>]. However, physiologically relevant, regenerative repair of retinal neuron loss has only been demonstrated in teleost fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and some amphibians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>One of the most striking morphological changes in the injured fish retina is the migration of proliferating retinal progenitor cells and M&#x000fc;ller nuclei to the apical surface and the subsequent reestablishment of a neuroepithelium; this anatomical organization is a necessary condition for regeneration of retinal neurons independent of the mechanism of injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. For example, neurotoxins that selectively destroy retinal neurons in the inner layers of adult goldfish fail to elicit a retinal stem cell response and the missing neurons are not replaced. Only when photoreceptors are destroyed is the regenerative process triggered and the retina repaired including inner neurons as well as photoreceptors. One possible explanation for this differential response to injury is that damaged photoreceptors release factors that stimulate retinal stem cells and create a 'regeneration niche'. Another possibility, not mutually exclusive, is that in the absence of photoreceptors, the proliferating retinal progenitors reestablish contact with the apical surface thus recreating a neuroepithelial organization similar to that found in the CMZ. Migration of M&#x000fc;ller nuclei to the apical surface following loss of photoreceptors is clearly not a sufficient trigger to elicit a regenerative stem cell response, since M&#x000fc;ller glia in the mammalian retina undergo a similar behavior in the injured or dystrophic mammalian retina but do not generate neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">87</xref>]. The key unanswered question is what extrinsic signals are necessary and sufficient to provoke the formation of a regenerative retinal stem cell niche? Several extracellular factors associated with maintenance of the undifferentiated, multipotent state in neural progenitors in early development, promote glial differentiation at later stages, including activation of LIF and Notch signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">88</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B89">89</xref>]. In the developing retina, activation of Notch signaling either maintains undifferentiated progenitors or promotes M&#x000fc;ller glia differentiation, depending on stage-dependent contextual cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">90</xref>]. The LIF pathway may also be implicated: M&#x000fc;ller glia isolated from the neonatal mouse retina and induced to proliferate by exposure to growth factors express LIF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">91</xref>], and LIF is necessary for injury-induced neurogenesis in mouse olfactory epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B92">92</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data indicate that M&#x000fc;ller glia in the adult fish retina have a complex response to local injury that includes some features of reactive gliosis (up-regulation of GFAP and re-entry into the cell cycle) together with dedifferentiation and re-acquisition of phenotypic and molecular characteristics of multipotent retinal progenitors (diffuse distribution of N-cadherin, activation of Notch-Delta signaling, and expression of <italic>rx1, vsx2/Chx10</italic>, and <italic>pax6a </italic>and BLBP). The outcome of this injury-induced glial activation is not generation of more M&#x000fc;ller glia and formation of a glial scar, as is typical in mammalian retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">87</xref>], but instead a retinal stem cell niche is recreated with molecular and morphological features that mirror the neurogenic CMZ. Our data suggest that in the injured retina activated M&#x000fc;ller glia cells define the retinal stem cell niche and our results are consistent with the proposal that retinal stem cells derive from proliferating M&#x000fc;ller glia. This idea fits with the emerging view that adult neural stem cells <italic>in vivo </italic>are a subpopulation of radial glial-derived cells that retain a neurogenic potential.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Thermal retinal lesions</title><p>Zebrafish from our outbred wild-type colony were maintained according to standard procedures.
