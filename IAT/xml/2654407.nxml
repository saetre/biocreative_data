Here we show by a focused siRNA miniscreen that the synergistic action of the BH3-only proteins Bim and Bmf is required for apoptosis induced by infection with <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> (Ngo). While Bim and Bmf were associated with the cytoskeleton of healthy cells, they both were released upon Ngo infection. Loss of Bim and Bmf from the cytoskeleton fraction required the activation of Jun-N-terminal kinase-1 (JNK-1), which in turn depended on Rac-1. Depletion and inhibition of Rac-1, JNK-1, Bim, or Bmf prevented the activation of Bak and Bax and the subsequent activation of caspases. Apoptosis could be reconstituted in Bim-depleted and Bmf-depleted cells by additional silencing of antiapoptotic Mcl-1 and Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>, respectively. Our data indicate a synergistic role for both cytoskeletal-associated BH3-only proteins, Bim, and Bmf, in an apoptotic pathway leading to the clearance of Ngo-infected cells.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>A variety of physiological death signals, as well as pathological insults, trigger apoptosis, a genetically programmed form of cell death.

Here we unveil the molecular mechanisms leading to apoptosis of infected cells. We show that Ngo-mediated apoptosis requires a special subset of proapoptotic proteins from the group of BH3-only proteins. BH3-only proteins act as stress sensors to translate toxic environmental signals to the initiation of apoptosis. In a siRNA-based miniscreen, we found Bim and Bmf, BH3-only proteins associated with the cytoskeleton, necessary to induce host cell apoptosis upon infection. Bim and Bmf inactivated different inhibitors of apoptosis and thereby induced cell death in response to infection. Our data unveil a novel pathway of infection-induced apoptosis that enhances our understanding of the mechanism by which BH3-only proteins control apoptotic cell death.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Infection with various pathogens results in the inhibition or activation of apoptotic cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000348-Zychlinsky1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Since this process resembles anoikis, we further investigated the connection between Ngo-induced cell detachment and apoptosis. HeLa cells were infected with Ngo VPI (N242), a clinical isolate and morphological changes were correlated with the activation of caspases. Detachment from the culture support was visible as soon as 6 to 9 h post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000348-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) concomitant with the proteolytic maturation of caspase 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000348-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). To test whether caspase activity is required for exfoliation, cells were infected in the absence or presence of the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk and then were analyzed by electron and fluorescence microscopy. In the presence of Z-VAD-fmk, Ngo-infected cells continued to detach yet remained otherwise intact and hence failed to disintegrate by apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000348-g001">Figure 1C and 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000348.s011">Video S1</xref>) while the activation of caspases 3 and 7 was blocked during the entire duration of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000348-g001">Figure 1E and 1F</xref>). Detachment was further analyzed by acquiring z stacks of infected cells by laser scanning confocal microscopy and subsequent 3-dimensional remodeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000348-g001">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000348.s012">Video S2</xref>).

Eleven clinical gonococcal isolates from different patients isolated from blood, urethra, cervix, vagina or urine were analyzed. The capacity of these strains to adhere to HeLa cells correlated well with the induction of exfoliation and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000348-t001">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000348.s001">Figure S1</xref>), suggesting that exfoliation and apoptosis induction is a common effect of adherence to HeLa cells. We also investigated whether the effect is specific for HeLa cells. N242 induced significant apoptosis in ME180 and Hep2 cells. From the genetically defined derivatives of the laboratory strain MS11, only strain N920 which forms pili induced apoptosis in ME180 cells, whereas strains expressing Opa57 (N1163, not shown) or Opa52 (N309) failed to induce significant apoptosis in HeLa, Hep2 and ME180 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000348.s002">Figure S2</xref>). N242 is a clinical isolate expressing 5 different Opacity-associated (Opa) proteins required for the binding of these bacteria to heparane sulfate proteoglycanes (HSPG), integrins or &#x02018;carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules&#x02019; (CEACAMs) of the host cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000348-Makino1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>; for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000348-Dehio1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>).

By investigating the apoptotic pathway involved in the infection-induced activation of Bak and Bax, we discovered an unexpected connection between pathogen-induced cytoskeletal reorganization and apoptosis. Attachment of bacteria initiated the activation of Rac-1 leading to rearrangement of the cytoskeleton (which is presumably required for exfoliation) and the activating phosphorylation of the stress kinase JNK-1. JNK-1 then participated in the activation of the BH3-only proteins Bim and Bmf that together facilitate Bak- and Bax-dependent apoptosis.</p><p>Besides the well characterized isolate N242 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000348-Makino1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, several other clinical isolates induced exfoliation and apoptosis indicating that gonococci trigger similar pathways leading to cell death. Our preliminary data on the initial trigger of cell detachment leading to cell death unveiled a role of specific adhesin &#x02013; receptor interactions. N242 induced exfoliation and cell death in different cell lines tested. These effects very likely depend on the interaction of one or more of the expressed Opa proteins with a yet uncharacterized receptor. Although derivatives of strain MS11 failed to induce apoptosis in HeLa cells, a similar efficient response as with N242 was observed with derivative N1163 (Opa57; PorB<sub>IA</sub>) upon infection of HeLa-CEACAM1 but not in HeLa-CEACAM3. Interestingly, CEACAM-1 has been shown to be upregulated in primary ovarian surface epithelial cells by gonococcal infection suggesting that the interaction with this receptor has in vivo relevance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000348-Muenzner2">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>.
