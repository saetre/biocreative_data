Tumor spread takes place primarily via lymphatic vessels, which leads to early metastases in prostate-draining iliac and sacral lymph nodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In advanced prostate cancer, tumors commonly metastasize to bone and other distant sites presumably via angiogenic routes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The mechanisms causing invasive and metastatic prostate cancer are still largely unknown. The interactions of lymphangiogenic and angiogenic pathways in the development of distant metastases of prostate cancer are not fully understood either. Metastasis in regional lymph nodes is associated with later appearance of bone metastases and a poor prognosis of prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], but it is not known whether spreading to distant sites occurs via regional lymph nodes or directly via hematogenous routes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) and its receptors VEGFR3 and VEGFR2 have a central role in regulation of the development and function of the lymphatic system as well as in tumor lymphangiogenesis. VEGF-C induces lymphatic endothelial cell proliferation, survival and migration <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. It is a dimeric glycoprotein, which binds and activates VEGF receptor tyrosine kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. VEGF-C was first cloned from human prostate cancer cell line (PC-3 cells) as a ligand for lymphangiogenic receptor (VEGFR3) and angiogenic receptor (VEGFR2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. It is synthesized intracellularly as a 58 kD propeptide, which undergoes proteolytic cleavage, and leads to 29 and 31 kD polypeptides, which are rapidly secreted and bind VEGFR3 in particular with high affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Additional processing results in 21 kD VEGF-C, which binds both VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Peritumoral lymphangiogenesis enables tumor cell dissemination to lymphatic vessels. VEGF-C is overexpressed in various human cancers including breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In experimental models, tumor cells that overexpress VEGF-C induce peritumoral lymphangiogenesis and tumor cell invasion to lymphatic vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, conflicting data of this has been reported in other studies suggesting that intratumoral lymphatic vessels may not be functional or that peripheral lymphatics may not function properly, which questions the role of lymphangiogenesis in primary tumor cell dissemination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The lymphangiogenic effects of VEGF-C can be blocked by VEGFR3 inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Without VEGF-C or VEGFR3, lymphatic endothelial cells are not able to form sprouting capillaries. In VEGF-C -/- mice, the sprouting of lymphatic vessels can be rescued by adding VEGF-C or VEGF-D (another lymphangiogenic growth factor that binds VEGFR3) but not VEGF, which indicates that the lymphangiogenic effects of VEGF-C are mediated primarily through VEGFR3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Like VEGF-C, VEGFR3 is upregulated in vascular endothelial cells in pathological conditions such as solid tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>Regulation of VEGF-C and VEGFR3 in prostate cancer metastasis was studied using orthotopic PC-3 prostate tumors, which naturally express VEGF-C. Orthotopic PC-3 tumors invade spontaneously to prostate-draining lymph nodes, but dissemination to distant sites such as bone, lung and liver occurs more slowly and less frequently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. We studied the effect of blockade of VEGFR3 on PC-3 tumor growth and metastasis by using adenoviral delivery of a VEGFR3 Ig fusion protein (VEGFR3-Ig), which functions as a decoy receptor for VEGFR3. Furthermore, we studied the effect of a high level of VEGF-C on growth, angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis and metastasis in orthotopic PC-3 prostate tumors, expressing ectopic VEGF-C.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>The human hormone-resistant prostate cancer cell line PC-3 was obtained from the American Tissue Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA) and cultured in DMEM supplemented (10%) with heat inactivated fetal bovine serum, iFBS.

However, it is not clear whether VEGF-C is only a marker of progressed disease or if it also facilitates lymph node metastasis in prostate cancer. Experimental models suggest that VEGF-C is involved in tumor lymphangiogenesis and often, but not always, it is upregulated in metastatic tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. According to some reports, VEGF-C-stimulated lymphangiogenesis in tumors and lymph nodes is required for metastasis at distant sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. On the other hand, Padera <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and Wong <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] have shown that lymph node metastasis may develop without increased lymphangiogenesis and or even absence of intratumoral lymphatic vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>We used orthotopic PC-3 prostate tumors that metastasize to regional lymph nodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] to study the role of VEGF-C in prostate tumor growth and metastasis. Blockade of VEGFR3 with VEGFR3-Ig decoy receptor protein led to a decreased density of lymphatic capillaries, which was associated with total inhibition of lymph node metastasis. These results are in line with those of previous studies on prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and other prostate tumor models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] suggesting that VEGF-C signaling via VEGFR3 has a major role in lymph node metastasis. Some of the previous studies also suggest correlation between the density of lymphatic vessel network and spreading of tumor cells to lymph nodes, although other investigators have not found an association between lymphatic vessel density and lymph node metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p><p>In our study, the blockade of VEGFR3 by VEGFR3-Ig also inhibited the growth of orthotopic PC-3 tumors and decreased the density of blood vessels as shown by quantification of CD34-immunostained capillaries within tumors. The VEGFR3 has been shown to contribute to the formation of blood capillaries in various tumor models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], which may explain the effects on angiogenesis as well as the decreased tumor size in orthotopic PC-3 tumors. Accordingly, orthotopic PC-3 tumors overexpressing ectopic VEGF-C grew much faster than mock-transfected controls. The morphology of the tumors was highly angiogenic as shown by histology and immunohistochemical staining for CD34 and VEGFR2. This could be explained by the fact that VEGFR3 also contributes to angiogenesis as suggested in another study on PC-3 tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. It has been shown that signaling via VEGFR3 stimulates angiogenesis in developing tissues and at least in some tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. This possibility is also supported by our observation of decreased angiogenesis in tumors in which VEGFR3 was blocked with VEGFR3-Ig decoy receptor. Other possible explanations could be the ability of VEGF-C to bind and activate VEGFR2, which is primarily expressed in blood capillary endothelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], or stimulation of angiogenic VEGFR2 by heterodimerisation of VEGFR3 with VEGFR2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. PC-3 cells transfected with the VEGF-C gene almost exclusively expressed and secreted a proteolytically processed form of VEGF-C (29/31 kDa) that primarily binds VEGFR3 but also VEGFR2 even if with minor affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Analysis of the distribution of the lymphatic capillaries showed that there was no statistically significant difference in the density of lymphatic capillaries in tumor periphery between PC-3/VEGF-C and PC-3/mock tumors. However, it seemed that the center of PC-3/VEGF-C tumors had fewer lymphatic vessels than PC-3/mock and PC-3 tumors. Other investigators have reported that tumor center lacks functional lymphatic vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] or that it is primarily the peripheral lymphatic capillaries that mediate tumor cell spread to lymph nodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Many studies have also reported an increased network of peritumoral lymphatic vessels in experimental breast and prostate tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. It has been claimed that elevated interstitial fluid pressure within the tumors may compress thin-walled lymphatic capillaries and compromise their function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. In our experiments it seemed likely that the highly expanded network of blood vessels in PC-3/VEGF-C tumors may have caused pressure that has impaired or prevented growth of lymphatic capillaries within the tumor tissue. This may also have caused decreased metastasis to lymph nodes. However, our observation that the presence of peritumoral lymph vessel network similar to that in control tumors was associated with decreased lymph node metastasis. This suggests that also the central vessels play a role in lymphatic tumor spread or that other metastatic routes were primarily used in PC-3/VEGF-C tumors.</p><p>Interestingly, while high expression of VEGF-C in orthotopic PC-3 tumors was associated with decreased lymph node metastasis, the rate of lung metastasis was clearly increased. Even wild-type PC-3 tumors metastasize to the lungs, but at a low rate and slowly along an extended time period whereas in PC-3/VEGF-C tumor-bearing mice metastasis to the lungs was increased or at least clearly accelerated. In our experiments it seems possible that in these tumors, lung metastases arose via hematogenous pathways, facilitated by the extensive blood capillary network. Another possibility is that the tumor cells spreading via lymphatic vessels passed the lymph nodes and were taken to distant sites. Burton <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] very recently reported that in different orthotopic prostate cancer models VEGF-C/VEGFR3 mediated metastasis to lymph nodes was mandatory to metastasis to distant sites. In addition, Hirakawa <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] have recently shown evidence that VEGF-C can facilitate tumor cell metastasis to lung and other organs by modulating lymph node vascularization and function. If this was the case in our PC-3/VEGF-C tumor-bearing mice, the reasonably dense network of peritumoral lymphatic vessels would have mediated the spread of the tumor cells to distant sites via lymph nodes to the lungs. It will be interesting to investigate in further studies the possible effect of VEGF-C on tumor cell survival outside the tumor environment and on the interactions of tumor cells with lymphoid tissues and cells at other metastatic sites.</p><p>Our observations on a switch of a lymphangiogenic to an angiogenic-type pattern of metastasis upon high VEGF-C expression in prostate cancer models differ from the results of some other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Those studies reported that VEGF-C/VEGFR3 stimulation primarily increased lymphatic vessel network and lymph node metastasis, which was also a prerequisite for later lung metastasis if it was observed. The reason for this discrepancy is presently unclear but one explanation in our tumors could be a expanded blood capillary network, which may have provided a more effective pathway for metastasis than lymphatic capillaries. It is obvious, however, that the regulation of metastatic pathways by different factors is very versatile and context dependent in various tumor models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p><p>Treatment of PC-3/VEGF-C tumor bearing mice with VEGFR3-Ig further decreased the density of lymph vessels. This suggests that the formation of new lymphatic capillaries in PC-3 tumors is dependent on VEGFR3 function even in the presence of massive angiogenesis. Treatment with VEGFR3-Ig had, however, less obvious effects on CD34-positive blood capillary density and tumor size than in parental PC-3 tumors. The reason for this difference is presently unclear but it is possible that the VEGFR3-Ig treatment conditions (concentrations, dosing schedule) should have been further scrutinized to obtain an optimal inhibition of all effects of VEGF-C overexpression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results show that although the VEGF-C/VEGFR3 pathway is important for formation of lymphatic vessels and lymph node metastasis of orthotopic PC-3 prostate tumors, high expression level of VEGF-C can also lead to activation of angiogenesis. This is associated with a change in the pattern of primary lymph node metastasis to preferential occurrence of metastasis at distant sites such as the lung, which suggests that the hematogenous route is preferred over the lymphatic route as a metastatic pathway of the orthotopic prostate tumors. Our results support the concept that the development of angiogenic and lymphangiogenic metastatic routes is tumor and context dependent. An effective blockade of both lymphangiogenic and hematogenous pathways is thus needed to inhibit metastasis in prostate cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>cDNA: complementary deoxyribonucleic acid; DAB: diaminobenzidine; DMEM: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; EDTA: ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid; H&#x00026;E: hematoxylin-eosine; iFBS: heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum; iv: intravenous; lacZ: &#x003b2;-galactosidase fusion protein; mRNA: messenger ribonucleic acid; PSA: prostate-specific antigen; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; s.c.: subcutaneous; VEGF: vascular endothelial growth factor; VEGF-C: vascular endothelial growth factor C; VEGF-D: vascular endothelial growth factor D; VEGFR2: vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2; VEGFR3: vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3; VEGFR3-Ig: vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 fusion protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JT carried out the cell cultures, RNA isolation, Northern Blot analyses, analysis of morphology and morphometry and statistical analysis.
