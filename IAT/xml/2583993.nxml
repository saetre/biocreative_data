Brain levels of TNF&#x003b1; mRNA and protein were measured and compared between TNF&#x003b1;-Tg and non-transgenic (non-Tg) littermates. Mean infarct volume was calculated 24 hours or 7 days after one hour of reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Cortical perfusion was monitored by laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF) during MCAO. Cortical vascular density was quantified by stereology. Post-ischemic cell death was assessed by immunohistochemistry and regional measurement of caspase-3 activity or DNA fragmentation. Unpaired <italic>t </italic>tests or analysis of variance with post hoc tests were used for comparison of group means.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In TNF&#x003b1;-Tg rat brain, the aggregate mouse and rat TNF&#x003b1; mRNA level was fourfold higher than in non-Tg littermates and the corresponding TNF&#x003b1; protein level was increased fivefold (p &#x02264; 0.01). Infarct volume was greater in TNF&#x003b1;-Tg rats than in non-Tg controls at 24 hours (p &#x02264; 0.05) and 7 days (p &#x02264; 0.01). Within the first 10 minutes of MCAO, cortical perfusion measured by LDF was reduced in TNF&#x003b1;-Tg rats (p &#x02264; 0.05). However, regional vascular density was equivalent between TNF&#x003b1;-Tg and non-Tg animals (p = NS). Neural cellular apoptosis was increased in transgenic animals as shown by elevated caspase-3 activity (p &#x02264; 0.05) and DNA fragmentation (p &#x02264; 0.001) at 24 hours.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Chronic elevation of TNF&#x003b1; protein in brain increases susceptibility to ischemic injury but has no effect on vascular density. TNF&#x003b1;-Tg animals are more susceptible to apoptotic cell death after MCAO than are non-Tg animals.

When present in supra-physiological levels after injury, it is known to modulate neural cell loss in cerebral ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], intracerebral hemorrhage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], chronic cerebral oligemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The level of TNF&#x003b1; in human brain becomes elevated after cerebral infarction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and appears sequentially in the infarct core and peri-infarct areas before expression in tissue within the unaffected hemisphere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Elevated levels of TNF&#x003b1; have been observed consistently in serum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and in cerebrospinal fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] after acute ischemic stroke. In animal models of cerebral ischemia, high levels of TNF&#x003b1; have been found after global [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and focal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] ischemic injury. Several investigators reported reduction of infarct volume through inhibition of TNF&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], although Nawashiro and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] showed that pretreatment of mice by intracisternal administration of TNF&#x003b1; reduced infarct volume paradoxically without an inhibitor.</p><p>Active, soluble TNF&#x003b1; is derived through proteolytic cleavage from a transmembrane precursor by TNF convertase (TACE), a member of the disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) group of enzymes. Among neural cell types, soluble TNF is secreted robustly by microglia and astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] but is also expressed by neurons and steroid-producing cells of the adrenal <italic>zona reticularis</italic>. Once released, soluble TNF circulates as a homotrimer that will bind with one of two distinct receptors of 55-kDa (TNFR1) or 75-kDa (TNFR2) molecular weight. The complex interactions of both soluble and transmembrane TNF&#x003b1; with the two TNF receptors have been reviewed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The first receptor, p55/TNFR1, may bind either form of TNF&#x003b1; before dissociating from an endogenous inhibitor and recruiting the TNF receptor-associated protein death domain (TRADD). Once complexed, p55/TNFR1-TRADD may either facilitate apoptosis by activation of caspase-8 or enhance cell survival through disinhibition of the nuclear transcription factor, NF&#x003ba;B. The second receptor, p75/TNFR2, becomes active only upon binding transmembrane TNF&#x003b1; and will develop a low-affinity interaction with TRADD. The p75/TNFR2-TRADD construct is less stable than p55/TNFR1-TRADD and is considered to have a more focused role in cell survival by upregulating anti-apoptotic factors or preventing activation of caspase-8. Certain steps in the cascade, such as the activation of caspase-8 to induce apoptosis and the release of NF&#x003ba;B to generate pro-survival elements, arise upon stimulation of the same receptor (p55/TNFR1) and may constitute a natural check-and-balance system that determines the ultimate fate of the cell.</p><p>Our previous work suggests that the apparent duality of effect attributed to TNF&#x003b1; is controlled by interaction between the cytokine ligand and p55/TNFR1 or p75/TNFR2. We demonstrated that inactivation of both receptors in double-knockout mice causes exacerbation of the excitotoxic effects of kainic acid in the CA<sub>3 </sub>region of the hippocampus and expansion of infarct volume after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. We further highlighted the role of p55/TNFR1 as a gatekeeper molecule by showing that knock-out mice lacking only this receptor had significantly greater neuronal injury after kainic acid injection or MCAO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>In this paper, we describe the first application of focal cerebral ischemia in a unique transgenic rat overexpressing the murine TNF&#x003b1; gene. We present the results of a feasibility experiment testing the hypothesis that chronic elevation of TNF&#x003b1; in brain increases infarct volume after focal cerebral ischemia. We also report on comparison of TNF&#x003b1;-transgenic (TNF&#x003b1;-Tg) rats with non-transgenic (non-Tg) controls to determine if overexpression of the TNF&#x003b1; gene alters the vascular anatomy of the cerebral cortex, the circulatory response of the brain to ischemia, or post-ischemic cellular apoptosis. Our overall goal in performing this work was to determine how elevated levels of TNF&#x003b1; protein, such as may be observed in human brain after stroke, will modify cerebral ischemic injury.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Construction of the transgenic animal</title><p>The TNF&#x003b1;-Tg rat was constructed in the research facility of Xenogen Biosciences in Cranbury, New Jersey. Construction began by isolation of the murine TNF&#x003b1; gene from a 129 SV mouse genomic library as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The 2.8 kb EcoRI fragment containing the murine TNF&#x003b1; promoter and the entire coding region of the corresponding murine TNF&#x003b1; gene was ligated to the 0.77 kb EcoRI-PstI/SalI fragment containing the 3'-untranslated region and polyadenylation signal of the human &#x003b2;-globin gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The BamHI-SalI fragment was microinjected into fertilized eggs of Sprague-Dawley (S-D) rats using standard techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. TNF&#x003b1;-Tg males were bred to female, wild type S-D rats. Approximately half of the resulting offspring carried the murine TNF&#x003b1; gene, as confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genotyping with primers specific for the murine TNF&#x003b1; gene, 5'-GGG GAA AGG TGG TAT CTC-3' (sense primer) and 5'-CGC TTT CTT GCT GTC CAA-3' (antisense primer) applied to total cellular DNA isolated from tail snip tissue.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of TNF&#x003b1; mRNA and protein</title><p>The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Kentucky approved all experiments performed with the TNF&#x003b1;-Tg rat. To analyze TNF&#x003b1; mRNA levels in TNF&#x003b1;-Tg and non-Tg brain, reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR; Ambion, Austin, TX) was performed on total RNA isolated from one cerebral hemisphere. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect aggregate mouse and rat TNF&#x003b1; in the remaining cerebral hemisphere (R &#x00026; D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).</p><p>To determine the contribution of the native rat gene to the mRNA response, we screened for rat TNF&#x003b1; mRNA in different brain regions, external organs, and serum in a second set of animals. Samples were homogenized and total RNA was extracted with an RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA). The Quantikine rat TNF&#x003b1; probes and Calibrator Kit (#RN510) was then used with an mRNA base kit (#RN000) of R &#x00026; D Systems to quantify rat TNF&#x003b1; mRNA. Parallel samples were homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), centrifuged, and total rat and mouse TNF&#x003b1; was measured by ELISA (R &#x00026; D Systems; Quantikine M catalog #MTA00).</p><p>To measure TNF&#x003b1; protein and mouse or rat mRNA in small quantities of brain tissue (= 50 mg) obtained from ischemic animals, we developed a micro-sample preparation technique and refined our protein ELISA and mRNA quantification methods. Tissue samples obtained from the border zone approximating the ischemic penumbra and the infarct core in the rat brain were homogenized in Mammalian Tissue Lysis Buffer (#C3228; Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO) consisting of a dialyzable mild detergent (bicine), 150 mM NaCl, and a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Roche). The homogenates were centrifuged at 12,000 &#x000d7; g for 10 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C. Protein concentration was quantified with the BCA protein assay kit (#23225, Pierce Chemicals, Rockford, IL).</p><p>For measurement of TNF&#x003b1; protein in small tissue samples, we used an ELISA kit (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) containing a monoclonal antibody that can detect both mouse and rat TNF&#x003b1; protein in the range of 10 pg/ml &#x02013; 10 ng/ml. To measure rat or mouse mRNA in small tissue samples, we extracted total RNA with the RNeasy Mini Kit and used the same Quantikine mRNA base kit described above. Quantikine rat TNF&#x003b1; mRNA probes and Calibrator Kit (#RN510) and Quantikine mouse TNF&#x003b1; mRNA probes and Calibrator Kit (#RN410) with Quantikine mRNA base kit (#RN000) of R &#x00026; D Systems were used to quantify mouse and rat TNF&#x003b1; mRNA. After completion of this assay, mouse or rat TNF&#x003b1; mRNA was quantified in attomoles/ml/1 &#x003bc;g total RNA and expressed as a ratio (mouse/rat TNF&#x003b1; mRNA).</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot analysis for TRADD protein</title><p>We measured expression of TRADD protein, derived upon interaction of active, soluble TNF&#x003b1; with p55/TNFR1, to demonstrate that TNF&#x003b1; protein retained biological activity in the ischemic brain of the TNF&#x003b1;-Tg rat. Micro-samples of brain tissue were homogenized and prepared as described for measurement of TNF&#x003b1; protein. The expression of TRADD protein was determined by western blot analysis using a monoclonal anti-TRADD antibody (BD Biosciences, USA). Aliquots of brain homogenate (30 &#x003bc;g of protein) were loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE gels for electrotransfer onto nitrocellulose membranes. After transfer, the membranes were blocked by incubation in 5% BSA in TRIS-buffered saline with 0.01% Tween-20 for one hour at room temperature and were washed three times (10 minutes each) with wash buffer (1 &#x000d7; TBS, 0.05% Tween-20). The membranes were then incubated with primary antibody (anti-TRADD monoclonal antibody; #610572, BD Biosciences Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) at a dilution of 1:250 for one hour at room temperature. The nitrocellulose membrane was then washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:1,000; #34080, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) for another hour at room temperature. After three additional washes in TBS/Tween-20, immunoreactive bands were developed using an ECL chemiluminescence substrate (#34080, Pierce). A densitometry image analysis system (Kodak 2000RT) was used for quantification of band intensities on X-ray film. To screen for gel loading errors, the western blots were stripped and reprobed with an antibody to &#x003b2;-actin, a constitutively expressed protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemical studies</title><p>For immunohistochemical studies confirming cell identity and intracellular expression of TNF&#x003b1;, we prepared 30-&#x003bc;m coronal brain slices and applied methods described in our previous publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. We used a rabbit polyclonal antibody to identify both rat and mouse TNF&#x003b1; (AMC3012, Biosource International, Camarillo, CA; 1:2000 dilution). We chose NeuN (MAB377, Chemicon International, Temecula, CA; mouse monoclonal; 1:1000 dilution) to immunolabel neuronal nuclear protein, anti-GFAP (anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein; MAB3402, Chemicon; mouse monoclonal; 1:1000 dilution) to identify astroglia, CD11b/OX-42 (MAB1405, Chemicon; mouse monoclonal; 1:1000 dilution) to label microglia and macrophages, and anti-APC/Ab-7 (anti-oligodendroglial cell body; OP80, Oncogene Research Products; mouse monoclonal; 1:1000 dilution) to identify oligodendrocytes. To identify what type of neural cell was expressing TNF&#x003b1; in the transgenic animal, co-localization studies were performed by incubating coronal brain sections with the anti-TNF&#x003b1; antibody and NeuN, anti-GFAP, CD11b/OX-42, or anti-APC/Ab-7 labeled with fluorophores.</p></sec><sec><title>Suture-occlusion model of focal cerebral ischemia</title><p>Because the murine TNF&#x003b1; gene was expressed within S-D rats, we chose the Zea Longa technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] for suture-occlusion of the MCA already validated in this animal strain. Male transgenic and non-Tg rats of 250&#x02013;350 gm body weight were subjected to one hour of suture-occlusion by our modification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] of the original Zea Longa method. Each animal was fasted overnight in preparation for surgery and then anesthetized by IP injection of chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg) and xylazine (4 mg/kg). Rectal and temporalis muscle temperatures were maintained at 36.5&#x02013;37.5&#x000b0;C by external warming. A suture-occluder prepared by the method of Belayev and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] was advanced retrograde through the external carotid artery and into the internal carotid artery to occlude the MCA. After one hour, the suture-occluder was withdrawn. In each rat, the left femoral artery was reversibly cannulated for assessment of mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) and blood gases before, during, and after suture-occlusion.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of infarct volume</title><p>Infarct volume was measured 24 hours or 7 days after removal of the suture-occluder from the MCA in ischemic animals. Rats prepared for measurement of infarct volume were re-anesthetized by IP injection of the same combined doses of chloral hydrate and xylazine used as anesthesia for surgery to achieve focal cerebral ischemia. For brain sampled after 24 hours of post-ischemic reperfusion, each anesthetized animal was euthanatized for staining of coronal brain sections with triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Total percent infarct volume was quantified using NIH Image v. 1.62 on a computer-assisted imaging system described in our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].

Each brain was removed <italic>en bloc </italic>and placed in 4% paraformaldehyde/0.1 M PBS at 4&#x000b0;C for 24 hours. The fixed brain specimen was then washed externally with PBS &#x000d7; 3 (10 minutes each) at 4&#x000b0;C. The brain specimen was blocked and immersed in 20% sucrose/0.1 M PBS at 4&#x000b0;C for 24 hours. The fixed, sucrose-protected brain was mounted on a metal chuck with cryostat embedding medium. The mounted brain was frozen in powdered dry ice and brought to ambient temperature within the cryostat (-21&#x000b0;C) before 80-&#x003bc;m coronal sections were cut to encompass the anticipated infarct volume. Every fifth section was mounted directly onto glass microscopic slides that were dried on a slide warmer at 40&#x000b0;C. The dried sections were defatted in xylene overnight before rehydration through gradient alcohol solutions to water. The resulting sections were then stained in 5% cresyl violet acetate for 2 minutes, rinsed in water, dehydrated through gradient alcohol solutions to xylene, and coverslipped. Total percent infarct volume was quantified using NIH Image v. 1.62 on the same computer-assisted imaging system used for quantifying 24-hour infarct volume, but without correction for tissue edema.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of neural cell death after focal cerebral ischemia</title><p>We employed both qualitative and quantitative methods to evaluate apoptotic cell death in the brains of TNF&#x003b1;-transgenic and non-Tg rats after ischemic injury. For qualitative determination of what cell type was undergoing caspase-3 activation after ischemia, we adapted the method of McEwen and Springer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] from its original application in experimental spinal cord trauma to our model of suture-occlusion of the MCA. Twenty-four hours after reversal of ischemia by withdrawal of the suture-occluder, each rat was re-anesthetized by IP injection of chloral hydrate/xylazine and perfused transcardially with 20 ml of cold, heparinized 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4), followed by 40 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The brain was removed <italic>en bloc </italic>and placed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4&#x000b0;C for one hour. The fixed brain specimen was then washed externally with PBS &#x000d7; 3 (10 minutes each) at 4&#x000b0;C. The brain specimen was then blocked and immersed in 20% sucrose-PBS at 4&#x000b0;C for 48 hours, before being frozen rapidly on dry ice and embedded in tissue freezing medium (Triangle Biomedical Sciences, Durham, NC). The frozen brain was then cut into 20-&#x003bc;m coronal sections on a cryostat (Microm Laborgerate, Walldorf, Germany). Consecutive sections taken from both TNF&#x003b1;-Tg and non-Tg rats were mounted in pairs on a series of charged glass slides (Superfrost Plus; Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA).</p><p>The sections were air-dried and stored at -20&#x000b0;C before preparation for fluorescence immunohistochemistry, all procedures for which were performed at room temperature except as noted. All sections were air-dried for 30 minutes after removal from cold storage, washed repeatedly in PBS for one hour, and pre-incubated for 30 minutes in a blocking solution comprised of 5% normal goat serum (NGS) and 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS. The blocking solution was removed and sections were incubated in a humidified chamber overnight at 4&#x000b0;C in PBS that contained 5% NGS and one of the following sets of primary antibodies: (a) rabbit anti-human/mouse activated caspase-3 IgG (polyclonal, 1:1,000; R &#x00026; D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), (b) mouse anti-neuronal nuclei (NeuN) IgG (monoclonal, 1:600; Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) to identify neurons, or (c) anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; monoclonal, 1:600; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) to localize astrocytes. To test for nonspecific staining by the secondary antibodies, additional slides were processed in a similar fashion with the primary antibodies excluded. All slides were then washed repeatedly in PBS for one hour before being incubated in the dark for a second hour in PBS that contained 5% NGS and the following fluorescent secondary antibodies: Cy-3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (polyclonal, 1:1,600; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) and AlexaFluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (monoclonal, 1:600; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The secondary antibody solution was removed and the slides were washed repeatedly in PBS for 10 minutes. Tissue sections were immediately coverslipped with ProLong Anti-Fade (Molecular Probes) and stored in the dark at 4&#x000b0;C to retard fading of the fluorescent labels. A Zeiss AxioPlan microscope (Zeiss; Oberkochen, Germany) was used to review the tissue sections after processing. Co-localization of immunoreactivity was performed with Photoshop (Adobe Systems; San Jose, CA) to superimpose paired images (40&#x000d7;) showing the fluorescent secondary antibodies identifying anti-active caspase-3 and the cell type of interest.</p><p>To determine if neural cell death was preceded by caspase-3 activation, we quantified the activity of this pro-apoptotic enzyme in ischemic brain. TNF&#x003b1;-Tg and non-Tg rats underwent MCAO by suture-occlusion for one hour. After 3 or 24 hours of post-ischemic reperfusion, each animal was re-anesthetized by IP injection of chloral hydrate and was perfused transcardially with 30 ml of 15% India ink (v/v) diluted in normal saline, as per our published method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The brain was removed <italic>en bloc</italic>, chilled, and cut into 2-mm sections. Normally perfused brain was darkened by the ink, whereas unreperfused tissue remained pale. The infarct core within each slice was dissected and snap-frozen, as was a thin rim of partially stained tissue at the interface between normal and unreperfused cortex that approximated the ischemic penumbra. The resulting tissue samples were prepared by the micro-sample method described above and caspase-3 activity was measured with a caspase-3 substrate AC-DEVD-AFC Fluorometric Assay Kit (R &#x00026; D Systems). All procedures were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal amounts of protein samples were mixed with caspase-3 reaction buffer containing the fluorescent peptide AC-DEVD-AFC, pipetted in duplicate in a 96-well microtiter plate, and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 180 minutes. Caspase-3 mediated cleavage of AC-DECD-AFC into free AFC was measured using a fluorescent micro plate reader (LS50B, Perkin Elmer) at a wavelength excitation of 400 nm and emission of 505 nm. Readings were obtained serially at 0, 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes. The change in fluorescence (&#x00394; fluorescence units) was calculated by subtracting the minimal (t = 0 minutes) from the maximal (t = 180 minutes) reading and the caspase-3 activity in each sample was calculated in &#x00394; fluorescence units/minute/100 mg protein.</p><p>To confirm that intracellular caspase-3 activation preceded apoptotic cell death, we performed a quantitative assay for DNA fragmentation after focal cerebral ischemia. For this technique, we adapted the method of Shimizu and colleagues for measurement of DNA fragmentation in ischemic gerbil hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. TNF&#x003b1;-Tg and non-Tg rats underwent MCAO by suture-occlusion for one hour.

The brain was removed <italic>en bloc</italic>, chilled, cut into 2-mm sections, and sampled as described in the preceding paragraph. Frozen tissue samples were homogenized with a glass tissue grinder in isolation buffer comprised of 215 mM mannitol, 75 mM sucrose, 0.1% BSA, 1 mM EGTA (pH 7.2), and 20 mM HEPES (pH:7.2). Each homogenate was then centrifuged at 3,000 &#x000d7; g for 5 min at 4&#x000b0;C to remove whole DNA within intact cellular nuclei. The resulting supernatant was recentrifuged at 13,000 &#x000d7; g for 10 min at 4&#x000b0;C to discard a crude mitochondrial pellet. The second supernatant enriched for cytosolic, fragmented DNA was aliquotted and stored at -80&#x000b0;C. Protein concentration in the second supernatant was measured with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce).</p><p>DNA fragmentation in the cytoplasmic supernatant was quantitatively assayed by antibody-mediated capture and detection of histone-associated DNA fragments (mono- or oligonucleosomes; Cell Death Detection ELISA Plus kit; Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). Briefly, a 20-&#x003bc;l aliquot of the cytoplasmic supernatant was used in the ELISA following the manufacturer's standard protocol. Optical density values of absorbance at 405 and 490 nm (reference wavelength) were determined with a microplate reader (SpectraMAX 340PC, Molecular Device) after incubation with a peroxidase substrate. Background values (incubation buffer alone) were subtracted from each sample. All samples were run in duplicate. The direct reading units of OD values were converted to mU (absorbance = 1000 mU). The results were shown as mU (arbitrary unit) per mg protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of regional cerebral perfusion and quantification of vascular density</title><p>We used laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF) to measure regional cerebral perfusion in TNF&#x003b1;-Tg rats or non-Tg controls during focal cerebral ischemia and post-ischemic reperfusion.

Male TNF&#x003b1;-Tg and non-Tg rats (n = 3 per group) that were not subjected to MCAO were anesthetized by IP injection of sodium pentobarbital (55 mg/kg) and underwent thoracotomy to gain access to the heart. After cross-clamping of the descending aorta, each animal was infused with 20 ml undiluted Higgins black waterproof India ink #4115 (Sanford, Bellwood, IL). The infusate was delivered through a 20-gauge needle inserted directly into the beating left ventricle, using hand-applied pressure. The infused animal was decapitated; the brain was then removed <italic>en bloc </italic>and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 hours. It was then cryoprotected in 20% sucrose (w/v) for three days under constant, mild agitation. Coronal sections of 50-&#x003bc;m thickness were cut with a freezing microtome throughout the rostral-caudal extent of a specified region of the cortex extending from the septal area (inter-aural level 10. 7) to the occipital region (inter-aural level -0.3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The Bioquant Image Analysis System (Nashville, TN) was used to analyze 12 equidistant sections taken from every animal. For each section, an unbiased method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] was employed to select a region of interest (ROI; 5.26 mm<sup>2</sup>) within the cortex. With the Bioquant device, a thresholding routine was used to estimate the percent area of the ROI occupied by ink-labeled blood vessels. The vascular percent areas within the ROIs in the 12 coronal sections were averaged to derive a mean value for each animal.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All physiological measurements, levels of TNF&#x003b1; mRNA and protein in brain, and infarct volumes by experimental group were expressed as means &#x000b1; SD.

Our results show that the high level of TNF&#x003b1; mRNA expressed constitutively in the brain of the transgenic animal is derived almost completely from the murine construct and not from the native rat gene. TNF&#x003b1; protein is increased selectively in the brain and by a statistically insignificant margin in the heart, kidney, and skeletal muscle, but remains low in serum and other external organs. TNF&#x003b1;-immunoreactive cells of neuronal morphology are present only in the neocortex of the transgenic animal. The distribution of the various cell populations in the brain of the TNF&#x003b1;-Tg rat appears no different than in the non-Tg animal, suggesting that the transgene has no measurable effect on the structural organization of the neocortex.</p><p>Our immunohistochemical studies indicate that the predominant cell type secreting TNF&#x003b1; in the brain of the transgenic rat is of neuronal lineage. This observation of constitutive neuronal expression differs importantly from previous studies showing that TNF&#x003b1; is frequently undetectable in quiescent neural cell populations, becoming upregulated in neurons and astroglial cells only after ischemic or post-traumatic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. In a comprehensive study of the evolution of TNF&#x003b1; expression in the brains of human patients with acute ischemic stroke, Sairanen and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] found that TNF&#x003b1; expression appeared in neurons located within the infarct core and in the adjacent border zone during 24 hours after the onset of infarction. Reactive astrocytes then expressed TNF&#x003b1; immunoreactivity in both the injured hemisphere and in the contralateral hemisphere, beginning within 24 hours of stroke and persisting for up to 18 days afterward. These findings indicate that multiple neural cell types have the capacity to express TNF&#x003b1;, thereby emphasizing that this proinflammatory cytokine participates in an evolving brain injury response culminating in delayed involvement of "unaffected" tissue.</p><p>The suture-occlusion model of focal cerebral ischemia is feasible in the TNF&#x003b1;-Tg rat and produces a larger mean volume of infarction than in non-Tg littermates. We speculate that the greater infarct volume observed in the transgenic animal resulted from chronic overexpression of TNF&#x003b1; protein within the brain, causing receptor-mediated caspase activation that promoted neuronal apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Binding of active, soluble TNF&#x003b1; to p55/TNFR1 will recruit TRADD, activate effector caspase-8, and cleave the executioner caspase-3 for activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Our observation that TRADD protein is expressed intensely within and outside of the ischemic focus in TNF&#x003b1;-Tg rat brain indicates that the cytokine produced in this animal is biologically active. We found significantly elevated levels of TNF&#x003b1; within ischemic tissue in the brain of the TNF&#x003b1;-Tg rat after 24 hours of post-ischemic reperfusion, but without corresponding increases in the component of mRNA transcribed from the murine TNF&#x003b1; gene. We speculate that the TNF&#x003b1;-Tg rat may have elevated TACE activity to facilitate synthesis of TNF&#x003b1; from its inactive precursor, thereby requiring no additional transcription of TNF&#x003b1; mRNA. Overall, our results suggest that it is soluble TNF&#x003b1;, not its membrane-bound precursor, which is active in the brain of the transgenic animal. Furthermore, our present findings allow us to conclude only that TNF&#x003b1; binds to p55/TNFR1 in the TNF&#x003b1;-Tg rat.</p><p>Our supposition that the pivotal mediator of increased lesion volume is the excess brain content of TNF&#x003b1; protein in the transgenic rat is corroborated by the work of Barone and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. To directly examine the role of early TNF&#x003b1; production in the evolution of secondary ischemic injury, these investigators administered exogenous TNF&#x003b1; by intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection 24 hours before MCAO to achieve permanent or transient focal ischemia in rats. They found that motor function, hemispheric edema, and infarct volume were affected adversely in a dose-dependent manner by TNF&#x003b1;. Furthermore, the specificity of the effect of higher doses of TNF&#x003b1; to cause progressively larger infarcts was confirmed by reduction of infarct volume after ICV injections of an anti-TNF&#x003b1; neutralization antibody or of soluble TNFR1 before and after MCAO. This relationship between lesion volume and ambient level of TNF&#x003b1; has been confirmed repeatedly in animal models of focal cerebral ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and has even been observed in human stroke victims. Montaner and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] found positive correlations between elevated blood levels of TNF&#x003b1; or interleukin-6 and the volume of hypoperfused brain observed after bolus-tracking perfusion MRI studies in stroke patients.</p><p>We examined brain perfusion by LDF to determine if the larger mean infarct volume in the TNF&#x003b1;-Tg rat was caused by an unanticipated effect of the constitutively expressed TNF&#x003b1; mRNA or translated protein on the cerebral circulation. We found that cortical perfusion within the infarct core in the brain of the TNF&#x003b1;-Tg rat fell to 20% of pre-ischemic baseline within 5 minutes after MCAO. Beyond the first 10 minutes of MCAO, there was no significant difference in cortical flow between transgenic and non-Tg animals for the remaining 50 minutes of focal ischemia and 30 minutes of post-ischemic reperfusion. This result suggests that constitutive upregulation of TNF&#x003b1; protein could accentuate brain response to focal circulatory arrest and may have contributed to the larger mean percent infarct volume observed in transgenic animals. However, the transience of the effect on LDF in the ischemic TNF&#x003b1;-Tg rat is self-evident and was not corroborated by underlying changes in micro-vascular anatomy, as was shown in our stereological analysis of cortical vascular density.</p><p>Our speculation of a link between elevated TNF&#x003b1; in brain and cortical perfusion is corroborated by Lavine and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] who found that pre-ischemic administration of an anti-TNF&#x003b1; neutralization antibody one hour before MCAO significantly improved perfusion in the infarct core and in the peri-infarct region after reversal of MCAO in non-Tg animals. Alternately, Savitz and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] showed that pre-ischemic administration of carvedilol, a mixed &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; adrenoreceptor antagonist, reduced TNF&#x003b1; mRNA copy number, infarct volume, and ischemic apoptosis after MCAO but had no effect on LDF. Recent studies suggest that TNF&#x003b1; may affect brain endothelial cell function or microvascular integrity, even if its influence on regulation of cerebral hemodynamic function after ischemia remains ambivalent. Kimura and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] reported that TNF&#x003b1; induced cleavage of caspase-3 and promoted apoptosis in cultured brain microvascular endothelial cells. Hosomi and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] found that TNF&#x003b1; may increase microvascular permeability after ischemia by upregulating matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). They observed that intravenous infusion of an anti-TNF&#x003b1; neutralization antibody immediately after reversal of MCAO inhibited upregulation of MMP-9 and membrane type 1-MMP, thereby lowering infarct volume and attenuating ischemic brain edema.</p><p>We have confidence that the unique cellular anatomy and the response to ischemic brain injury observed in our transgenic animal cannot be attributed to random genetic heterogeneity. Transgenic animals are often produced on a hybrid background and then backcrossed to optimize genetic homogeneity. The TNF&#x003b1;-Tg rats were produced on the outbred S-D rat strain. All subsequent generations of transgenic animals have been prepared by backcrossing onto this same strain. We have used non-Tg littermates as controls in all the assays we performed to quantify TNF&#x003b1; mRNA and protein levels and verify cellular anatomy. TNF&#x003b1;-Tg animals express a uniform phenotype that differs consistently from the non-Tg littermates. Therefore, we believe that the unique features of the TNF&#x003b1;-Tg rat must be attributed to segregation of the transgene allele.</p><p>With its chronic upregulation of TNF&#x003b1; in brain, the TNF&#x003b1;-Tg rat is a clinically relevant model of secondary inflammatory changes after cerebral infarction in humans. Although non-Tg animals show increased levels of endogenous TNF&#x003b1; in response to ischemia, the transgenic rat has greater research potential because of the ease with which signal transduction and pro-apoptotic pathways may be studied under conditions of prolonged activation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Even though TNF&#x003b1;-Tg mice share this asset, their role in the assessment of experimental therapeutic agents will be limited by small size, restricted vascular access, and constrained use in functional assessment of motor and cognitive behavior. The TNF&#x003b1;-Tg rat is a valuable new tool for the study of cytokine-mediated signal transduction paths in ischemic brain injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>David S.
