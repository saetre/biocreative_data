Among the central cytoskeletal regulators are actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin, which depolymerizes actin filaments, and twinfilin, which sequesters actin monomers and caps filament barbed ends. Both interact with actin through an ADF homology (ADF-H) domain, which is also found in several other actin-binding proteins. However, in the absence of an atomic structure for the ADF-H domain in complex with actin, the mechanism by which these proteins interact with actin has remained unknown. Here, we present the crystal structure of twinfilin's C-terminal ADF-H domain in complex with an actin monomer. This domain binds between actin subdomains 1 and 3 through an interface that is conserved among ADF-H domain proteins. Based on this structure, we suggest a mechanism by which ADF/cofilin and twinfilin inhibit nucleotide exchange of actin monomers and present a model for how ADF/cofilin induces filament depolymerization by weakening intrafilament interactions.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>V.O.

Despite the large number of proteins regulating actin dynamics, many of them interact with actin through a relatively small number of protein domains. Among the central actin-binding domains is the actin-depolymerizing factor homology (ADF-H) domain, which occurs in five functionally distinct classes of proteins: ADF/cofilin, twinfilin, Abp1/drebrin, coactosin, and glia maturation factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Paavilainen et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The founding member of this family, ADF/cofilin, binds both monomeric and filamentous actin, preferably in the ADP-bound form, and induces a structural rearrangement in the actin filament that leads to its disassembly. When bound to an actin monomer, ADF/cofilin inhibits spontaneous nucleotide exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carlier et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bamburg, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrianantoandro and Pollard, 2006</xref>). In cells, ADF/cofilin plays an essential role in various processes by promoting disassembly of aged actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Okreglak and Drubin, 2007</xref>). In contrast to ADF/cofilin, which consists of a single ADF-H domain, twinfilin is composed of two ADF-H domains separated by a short linker region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Paavilainen et al., 2004</xref>). Twinfilin binds ADP-actin monomers and filament barbed ends with high affinity, and prevents monomer assembly into filament ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ojala et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Helfer et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, yeast twinfilin induces filament severing at a low pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Moseley et al., 2006</xref>). Biochemical studies suggested that during barbed-end capping, twinfilin's N-terminal ADF-H domain interacts with the terminal actin subunit, whereas the C-terminal ADF-H domain binds to the side of an actin filament through a similar mechanism to that of ADF/cofilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Paavilainen et al., 2007</xref>). The exact functions of the Abp1/drebrin, coactosin, and glia maturation factor are less well understood, although also these proteins are linked to regulation of actin dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Hostos et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Quintero-Monzon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ikeda et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Although the biochemical activities and cellular functions of ADF-H domain proteins are rapidly being uncovered, the structure of an ADF-H domain in complex with actin has not been reported. Indirect structural methods have provided controversial results, and even the binding site of this domain on actin is not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wriggers et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kamal et al., 2007</xref>). Consequently, the structural mechanisms by which twinfilin and ADF/cofilin inhibit nucleotide exchange on actin monomers and how ADF/cofilin induces filament depolymerization/severing are unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>To reveal how ADF-H domain proteins interact with actin, we set out to crystallize the C-terminal ADF-H domain of twinfilin corresponding to residues 176&#x02013;316 (hereafter termed Twf-C) with ATP&#x02013; and ADP&#x02013;G-actin. Similarly to ADF/cofilins, isolated Twf-C binds actin monomers and filaments, preferring ADP-actin, and induces filament depolymerization, although with a lower efficiency. The structure of Twf-C is very similar to that of ADF/cofilin (C<sub>&#x003b1;</sub> rmsd 2.0 &#x000c5; for 130 superposed residues of yeast cofilin), and it interacts with actin through a very similar interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Paavilainen et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, Twf-C also serves as a good model for studying how ADF/cofilin interacts with actin.</p><sec><title>Structure of Twf-C in complex with ATP&#x02013;G-actin</title><p>Despite numerous attempts, we did not obtain crystals of Twf-C in complex with ADP-G-actin. However, crystals of the Twf-C/ATP&#x02013;G-actin complex were obtained from 15% PEG3350, pH 9.0, and the structure was determined by molecular replacement. The crystals contained one copy of Twf-C and ATP&#x02013;G-actin, and the final model was refined to a resolution of 2.55 &#x000c5; (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). Comparison of Twf-C structure in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Paavilainen et al., 2007</xref>) and in complex with G-actin demonstrates that the ADF-H domain does not undergo major conformational changes upon binding to actin monomer (C<sub>&#x003b1;</sub> rmsd 1.5 &#x000c5; for 139 superposed residues). The only significant structural change was observed in the two N-terminal residues of Twf-C (residues 176&#x02013;177), which are part of a flexible extension in most ADF-H domain structures without actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Paavilainen et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hellman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Quintero-Monzon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrianantoandro and Pollard, 2006</xref>), but become ordered in complex with actin and form an important part of the interaction surface (see following paragraph).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Crystal structure of the Twf-C&#x02013;actin monomer complex at 2.55 &#x000c5; resolution.</bold> (A) Twf-C (blue) binds between the actin (green) subdomains 1 and 3, and buries a surface area of &#x0223c;1,200 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>.

Three major sites of interaction can be distinguished: (1) the N-terminal extension of the domain (twinfilin residues 176&#x02013;181); (2) the long &#x003b1;-helix (twinfilin residues 266&#x02013;274); and (3) the region before the C-terminal helix of this domain (twinfilin residues 294&#x02013;302; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Within these regions, the most obvious contacts are made between residues Q176 of twinfilin (Twf) and the C-terminal F375 of actin, R267 (Twf) and S348 (actin), R269 (Twf) and A144 (actin), S273 (Twf) and Y143 (actin), K276 (Twf) and T148 (actin), K294 (Twf) and E167 (actin), and E296 (Twf) and T148 (actin; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). In addition, several residues are involved in hydrophobic contacts across the interface. These include V178 (Twf) and L346, L349, T351, F352, M355 (actin), F180 (Twf) and L349, T351 (actin), I266 (Twf) and E334, I341, I345 (actin), M270 (Twf) and A144, G342, I346, L346 (actin), and L271 (Twf) and L349 (actin). Additionally, 10 water molecules are found at the interface. With the exception of Q176, which is the first residue in the C-terminal ADF-H domain of twinfilin and can make a hydrogen bond with actin through its main-chain amide group and S274, these residues are highly conserved in ADF/cofilins and in both twinfilin domains (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Previous mutagenesis and biochemical studies revealed that these regions are critical for actin interactions in both ADF/cofilin and twinfilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lappalainen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Paavilainen et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grintsevich et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, recent cross-linking studies suggested that these regions are important for ADF/cofilin interactions in actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grintsevich et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, the Twf-C/G-actin structure provides a good structural model for the G-actin&#x02013;bound state of ADF/cofilin (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Conservation of the actin monomer binding site in ADF/cofilins and twinfilins.</bold> (A) Three major sites of interaction are present in the Twf-C&#x02013;G-actin structure: (left) The N-terminal extension of Twf-C, (middle) the long &#x003b1;-helix, and (right) the loop before the C-terminal helix.

However, these regions, and especially the long &#x003b1;-helix, are less conserved in coactosin and Abp1, which bind F-actin with relatively low affinity and do not interact with G-actin or induce filament disassembly (Table S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803100/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803100/DC1</ext-link>). Thus, we propose that the inability of the long &#x003b1;-helix of these proteins to interact tightly with the groove between actin subdomains 1 and 3 may be responsible for the lack of G-actin binding and the F-actin disassembly activities of coactosin and Abp1.</p><p>In 7-chloro-4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD)-actin and pyrenyl-actin, the fluorophores are attached to actin residues K373 and C374, which are located at the ADF-H domain binding interface.

These are: interaction of the loop before the C-terminal &#x003b1;-helix of Twf-C with actin subdomain 3 (left) and different interaction sites of N-terminal extensions of Twf-C and gelsolin S1 in actin (right).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1820051f04"></graphic></fig><p>However, although ADF-H domain and gelsolin segment-1 are structurally related, there are significant differences in the mechanisms by which they interact with actin. In both domains, the N-terminal region before the first &#x003b1;-helix is involved in actin binding, but these regions interact with different faces of helix-4 of actin. Although the loop before the C-terminal &#x003b1;-helix plays a central role in G-actin binding in the ADF-H domain, the corresponding region in gelsolin segment-1 does not contact actin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). Finally, although the long &#x003b1;-helix forms the major actin-binding site in both domains and incorporates to the groove between actin subdomains 1 and 3 in a nearly identical orientation, the actual contacts between this helix and actin are relatively poorly conserved between ADF-H and gelsolin domains. For example, the two basic residues (R267 and R269) that make important contacts with actin in the Twf-C/ATP&#x02013;G-actin structure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), which have been shown to be critical for actin interactions in ADF/cofilins and both twinfilin domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lappalainen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Paavilainen et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2007</xref>), are not conserved in gelsolin domains.</p></sec><sec><title>Inhibition of nucleotide exchange by ADF-H domain proteins</title><p>Twinfilin, ADF/cofilin, gelsolin, and WH2 domain proteins inhibit spontaneous nucleotide exchange when bound to an actin monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tellam, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bamburg, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hertzog et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Paavilainen et al., 2004</xref>). Also, the isolated C-terminal ADF-H domain of twinfilin binds G-actin with high affinity and efficiently inhibits G-actin nucleotide exchange (Fig. S1). In contrast, most profilins promote nucleotide exchange in actin monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Witke, 2004</xref>). Comparison of the actin conformation in complex with Twf-C, profilin, gelsolin-S1, and ciboulot WH2 domains (all of which were crystallized without DNase I bound to subdomains 2 and 4) reveals that in complexes that inhibit nucleotide exchange, the cleft between actin subdomains 2 and 4 is in a &#x0201c;closed&#x0201d; state. In contrast, in the profilin&#x02013;actin complex, the cleft between actin subdomains 2 and 4 is &#x0201c;open&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schutt et al., 1993</xref>), which may allow more rapid exchange of the nucleotide (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Thus, the differences in how these proteins interact with the groove between actin subdomains 1 and 3 may induce conformational changes in the actin molecule that control the accessibility of the nucleotide to the solvent through the cleft between subdomains 2 and 4.</p></sec><sec><title>Interaction of Twf-C and ADF/cofilins with actin filaments</title><p>ADF/cofilin binds to actin filaments in a cooperative fashion and induces filament disassembly, most likely via weakening of intramolecular contacts in the actin filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bamburg, 1999</xref>). Because Twf-C also binds actin filaments (although with lower affinity than ADF/cofilin) and induces filament disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Paavilainen et al., 2007</xref>), we decided to build a model for the Twf-C&#x02013;bound actin filaments. We first attempted to overlay the actin monomer from our crystal structure with an actin monomer from two different actin filament models. Neither the original fiber diffraction&#x02013;based model of naked actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holmes et al., 1990</xref>) nor the EM-based model of an ADF/cofilin-decorated actin filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Galkin et al., 2001</xref>) produced a good fit with the Twf-C&#x02013;G-actin complex. Although the conformation of the actin monomer in both filament models is nearly identical to that in our crystal structure, the orientation in the original <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holmes et al. (1990)</xref> model is such that the bound ADF-H domain clashes with the next actin monomer in the strand. A similar problem occurs with the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Galkin et al. (2001)</xref>, model; the ADF-H domain in their model is in a slightly different orientation compared with our crystal structure, which leads to severe clashes with the next actin monomer.</p><p>Cryo-EM analyses revealed that ADF/cofilin binding affects the actin filament conformation by stabilizing a filament state with a mean twist of 162&#x000b0; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McGough et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Galkin et al., 2001</xref>). We fitted the high-resolution Twf-C&#x02013;G-actin structure into the experimental EM-based electron density map from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Galkin et al., (2003)</xref>. Automatic docking procedure resulted in a good fit with the experimental map, resulting in a new ADF-H domain&#x02013;decorated actin filament model with a mean rotational angle of 162.2&#x000b0; and a mean translation of 27.7 &#x000c5; (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Additionally, a good fit with the Twf-C&#x02013;G-actin structure was obtained with the latest fiber diffraction&#x02013;based filament model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Holmes et al., 2003</xref>), which has significant domain movements compared with the G-actin structure. In the model, the so-called D-loop of actin (residues 38&#x02013;52) forms a helix, which binds between subdomains 1 and 3 of the next actin monomer. Fitting our structure into the EM electron density map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Galkin et al., 2003</xref>) and the filament model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Holmes et al., 2003</xref>) resulted in two similar ADF-H&#x02013;decorated filament models with 162&#x000b0; and 167&#x000b0; twists. The 162&#x000b0; model (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>) may represent the optimal filament for ADF/cofilin binding, whereas the 167&#x000b0; model (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803100/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803100/DC1</ext-link>) may correspond to an initial binding mode for ADF/cofilin.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>A hypothetical model for an ADF-H domain decorated actin filament.</bold> (A) A model of an ADF-H domain&#x02013;decorated actin filament obtained by docking the Twf-C&#x02013;G-actin structure in the 23-&#x000c5; electron density map of an ADF/cofilin-decorated actin filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Galkin et al., 2003</xref>). (B) Binding of Twf-C (and ADF/cofilin) in this model results in a large structural change of actin subdomain 2, where the so-called D-loop (shown in red) moves &#x0223c;17 &#x000c5; away from the actin hot spot cleft. (C) In the model, the structural rearrangement of actin subdomain 2 also affects the interaction between the two actin strands by weakening contacts involving the so-called actin &#x0201c;hydrophobic loop&#x0201d; (colored in orange). Together, these changes in inter- and cross-filament interactions could contribute to weakening of the actin filament and lead to filament depolymerization by Twf-C and ADF/cofilin.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1820051f05"></graphic></fig><p>Comparison of the filament models in the presence and absence of Twf-C suggests that interaction of the long &#x003b1;-helix of Twf-C with the groove between actin subdomains 1 and 3 forces the D-loop of the adjacent monomer to move &#x0223c;17 &#x000c5; away from the actin hot spot cleft (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Replacing Twf-C with yeast cofilin in the model suggests that the actin filament&#x02013;binding site of cofilin buries an area of &#x0223c;1500 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>. ADF/cofilin residues R80, K82, E134, R135, and R138, which were previously shown to be important for F-actin binding by mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lappalainen et al., 1997</xref>), are located at the interface (Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803100/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803100/DC1</ext-link>). This provides further evidence that the ADF-H domain&#x02013;binding mode observed in our crystal structure is also similar to the filament-bound form of ADF/cofilin. However, this region is not conserved between ADF/cofilin and Twf-C, which provides a possible explanation for the weaker F-actin&#x02013;binding and disassembly activities of Twf-C as compared with ADF/cofilins.</p><p>The model presented in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> is consistent with recent proteolysis, F&#x000f6;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET), and cross-linking experiments demonstrating that ADF/cofilin binding to actin filament results in a structural rearrangement of actin subdomain 2 and exposure of the D-loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bobkov et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Muhlrad et al., 2004</xref>). It should be noted that even though the actin subdomain 2 is involved in a crystal contact in our crystals, the D-loop does not contribute to these contacts. We propose that rearrangement of the D-loop upon ADF-H domain binding may result in weakening of the interfilament contacts between successive actin monomers. Additionally, the &#x0201c;hydrophobic loop&#x0201d; of actin (residues 262&#x02013;274), which mediates cross-filament interactions in the Holmes model, has been shown to be important for filament growth and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shvetsov et al., 2008</xref>). In our model, the structural rearrangement of the actin subdomain 2 in the filament decorated with the ADF-H domain (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref> and Videos 1 and 2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803100/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803100/DC1</ext-link>) appears to also weaken these cross-filament contacts, which may result in filament disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carlier et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrianantoandro and Pollard, 2006</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we show that ADF-H domains bind between actin subdomains 1 and 3 using a similar insertion of an &#x003b1;-helix into the hydrophobic cleft of actin as described previously for gelsolin and WH2 domains. Binding of ADF-H domain appears to lock the cleft between actin subdomains 2 and 4 in a closed conformation, which may provide a structural explanation for how ADF/cofilin and twinfilin inhibit nucleotide exchange in actin monomers. We also propose a model for how Twf-C and ADF/cofilin induce filament disassembly through weakening of both longitudinal and lateral contacts within the actin filament. It is important to note that the crystal structure used in our modeling was from the ADF-H domain/ATP&#x02013;G-actin complex, whereas at least ADF/cofilin binds ADP-actin with much higher affinity than ATP-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carlier et al., 1997</xref>). Although the structures of ATP&#x02013; and ADP&#x02013;G-actin were found to be similar to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Otterbein et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rould et al., 2006</xref>), further studies will be required to reveal the structural changes that occur in F-actin upon nucleotide hydrolysis and how they affect the interactions with ADF-H domain proteins.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cloning, protein expression, purification, and crystallization</title><p>The mouse twinfilin-1<sub>176-316</sub> (Twf-C) construct was cloned into NcoI&#x02013;HindIII sites of a pHAT2 vector.
