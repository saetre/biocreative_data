Fps/Fes was previously implicated in Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A)-induced growth cone collapse signaling in neurons from the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) through interaction with and phosphorylation of the Sema3A receptor component PlexinA1, and members of the collapsin response mediator protein (CRMP) family of microtubule regulators.

Fer also showed higher <italic>in vitro </italic>kinase activity toward tubulin, as an exogenous substrate; and this activity was higher when the kinases were isolated from perinatal relative to adult brain stages. CRMP2 was a substrate for both kinases <italic>in vitro</italic>, but both CRMP2 and PlexinA1 inhibited their autophosphorylation activities.

Furthermore, Fer plays a more prominent role than Fps/Fes in regulating the axon retraction response to Sema3A in DRG neurons. Therefore, Fps/Fes and Fer may play important roles in developmental or regenerative axon pathfinding through signaling from Sema3A to the microtubule cytoskeleton.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Fps/Fes (here after referred to as Fps) and Fer are the only two members of a subfamily of non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases. They are distinguished from all other tyrosine kinases by their unique N-terminal half, which consists of a Fps/Fes/Fer-Cdc42-interacting protein 4 (CIP4) homology (FCH) domain followed by an extended region of coiled-coils which collectively mediates their homotypic oligomerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The structures of the homologous domains in CIP4 and the related forming binding protein 17 (FBP17) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and FCH<sub>0</sub>2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] proteins display striking similarities to the membrane-binding BAR domains of Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs family members; and it has been proposed to describe this domain as an F-BAR or extended FCH (EFC) domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Fps and Fer kinases also contain a central Src-homology 2 (SH2) domain, involved in binding to phosphotyrosine-containing peptide sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]; and a highly conserved C-terminal kinase domain. The F-BAR domain of Fps and Fer kinases set them apart from all other tyrosine kinases. The conservation of these domains with a number of adaptor-like proteins involved in cytoskeletal functions, including FBP17, CIP4, PSTPIP1, PACSIN and cdc15p, as well as a subgroup of RhoGAPs, including the Slit-Robo GAPs, suggests that Fps and Fer kinases might regulate cytoskeletal and membrane reorganization associated with receptor endocytosis, secretion, vesicular trafficking, cell polarity and cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The role of Sema3A signaling in growth cone collapse has been extensively studied, however relatively little is known about how these signals lead to microtubule collapse and axon retraction. A complex of PlexinA1 and neuropilin 1 (NP1) was shown to act as a receptor for Sema3A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. More recent studies suggest that NP1 represses an PlexinA1/CRMP-mediated signaling pathway that leads to remodelling of both the actin and tubulin cytoskeletons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Other studies have implicated PlexinA3 and A4 in Sema3A signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and Sema6C and 6D in PlexinA1 signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Therefore, it is still unclear what degree of specificity or cross-reactivity exists between the numerous Plexin receptors and Sema ligands.</p><p>Fps was recently identified in a complex with microtubule-associated collapsin response mediator proteins (CRMPs and CRAM) in rat brain lysates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In Cos-7 cell co-transfection studies, Fps promoted the phosphorylation of both CRMP/CRAM proteins and the Semaphorin receptor signal transducing subunit PlexinA1; and Sema3A promoted the PlexinA1 association with, and phosphorylation by Fps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Transduction of DRG neurons with virus encoding kinase-dead Fps was also reported to inhibit Sema3A-induced growth cone collapse, but axon collapse was not investigated, nor was the potential involvement of the closely related Fer kinase in either process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Subsequently these same authors showed that Fps was present at sites of microtubule nucleation in embryonic fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Purified Fps has been reported to catalyze the tyrosine phosphorylation of tubulin dimers <italic>in vitro </italic>and promote microtubule polymerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Fer has also been shown to localize at peripheral microtubules in polarizing and migrating vascular endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and Fer has been implicated in regulating cortical actin dynamics downstream of cell-cell and cell-matrix receptor systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Together, these observations point to potential regulatory roles for Fps and Fer kinases in reorganization of both microfilaments and microtubules.</p><p>Here we show that Fer is more highly expressed and more active than Fps in the developing mouse nervous system. CRMP2 was a substrate for Fps and Fer; and both CRMP2 and PlexinA1 inhibited Fps and Fer activities <italic>in vitro</italic>. Using mice with targeted mutations in the <italic>fps </italic>and <italic>fer </italic>genes, we show that a Sema3A-induced axon collapse response was significantly compromised in Fer-deficient, but relatively normal in Fps-deficient DRG neurons. These novel observations provide genetic and biochemical evidence that the Fer kinase participates in signaling from Sema3A to microtubules, and might therefore play an important role in the microtubule collapse response associated with axon retraction.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Fps and Fer are expressed in the developing nervous system and Fer displays evidence of <italic>in vivo </italic>kinase activity during neonatal brain development</title><p>Fps and Fer were immunoprecipitated from neonatal brain lysates from: wild type mice (<italic>wt</italic>); mice targeted with a kinase-inactivating missense mutation in <italic>fps </italic>(<italic>fps</italic><sup><italic>KR</italic>/<italic>KR</italic></sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]; mice targeted with a kinase-inactivating and protein-destabilizing mutation in <italic>fer </italic>(<italic>fer</italic><sup><italic>DR</italic>/<italic>DR</italic></sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]; or compound mutant mice (<italic>fps</italic><sup><italic>KR</italic>/<italic>KR</italic></sup><italic>/fer</italic><sup><italic>DR</italic>/<italic>DR</italic></sup>). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed using an anti-Fps/Fer antibody that was previously shown to be equally cross-reactive toward these closely related kinases in both applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].

This reduction in Fer levels was expected because the <italic>fer</italic><sup><italic>DR </italic></sup>mutation causes a destabilization of the protein, in addition to abolishing its kinase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Fps protein levels remained constant across all genotypes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, lower panel) and there was no detectable anti-phosphotyrosine signal corresponding to the migration position of Fps in immunoprecipitates from any genotype (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, upper panel).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold><italic>In vivo </italic>expression and tyrosine phosphorylation status of Fps and Fer in neonatal mouse brains and DRGs</bold>.

Fps and Fer were immunoprecipitated from <italic>wt </italic>mouse brains of E18 embryos, neonates and adults. Immune complex kinase assays were then performed to assess the intrinsic autophosphorylation activity of these kinases, as well as their ability to phosphorylate the exogenously added substrate tubulin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Comparable amounts of Fps plus Fer were present in these three stages of development (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, lower), and similar levels of <italic>in vitro </italic>kinase autophosphorylation were apparent (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, upper). However, the <italic>in vitro </italic>activity of Fps plus Fer toward tubulin was significantly higher in the neonatal and E18 stages than in the adult brain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, lower). In these assays, the phosphorylation of tubulin might be due to the activity of Fps or Fer, or both kinases. Fps and Fer were not well resolved in these immunoprecipitates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), relative to the lysates in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. However, we reproducibly observed a fainter species migrating ahead of the major band in these immunoprecipitation experiments. This is consistent with a relatively greater amount of Fer to Fps, both in terms of mass amounts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, lower) and autophosphorylation activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, upper).

The apparent mass amounts of Fps and Fer in the anti-Fps/Fer immunoblots were also consistent with this interpretation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, lower), and support the conclusion that there is more Fer than Fps in neonatal brains. <italic>In vitro </italic>phosphorylation of exogenously added tubulin was comparable in <italic>wt </italic>and <italic>fps</italic><sup>-/- </sup>lysates, substantially reduced in <italic>fer</italic><sup><italic>DR</italic>/<italic>DR</italic></sup>, and abolished in <italic>fps</italic><sup><italic>KR</italic>/<italic>KR</italic></sup><italic>/fer</italic><sup><italic>DR</italic>/<italic>DR </italic></sup>lysates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, upper).</p><p>These assays were performed both in the presence and absence of ATP to control for the relatively low levels of <italic>in vivo </italic>tyrosine phosphorylation of Fps or Fer, which was not detectable under these conditions.

Since we detected substantially more Fer than Fps expression in the developing brain and DRG (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), we decided to investigate the relative involvement of Fer and Fps in the Semaphorin signaling pathway. PlexinA1 association with and phosphorylation by Fps or Fer were first examined in co-transfection studies. HEK293 cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding Myc-epitope tagged Fps or Fer, with or without VSV-tagged PlexinA1. Anti-Myc immunoprecipitates were prepared from the cell lysates and immunoblotted with anti-pY (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, upper). No tyrosine phosphorylated bands corresponding to the size of PlexinA1 were observed in these Myc immunoprecipitates (data not shown), and no association of PlexinA1 with Fps or Fer was found in these co-immunoprecipitation analyses (data not shown). However, co-expression of PlexinA1 correlated with reduced autophosphorylation of both Fps and Fer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, upper). In these <italic>in vitro </italic>assays, Fps was less active than Fer, but we could still see that Fps autophosphorylation activity was compromised by co-expression with PlexinA1.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>PlexinA1 inhibits <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>Fps and Fer autophosphorylation</bold>.

These results argue that PlexinA1 can interact in some way with Fps and Fer kinases and modify their kinase activities, but not necessarily by acting as a substrate. Consistent with our previous results, Fer showed much higher intrinsic autophosphorylation activity than Fps, which can be seen by comparing the anti-pY signal in <italic>wt </italic>and <italic>fps</italic><sup><italic>KR</italic>/<italic>KR </italic></sup>brain lysates with those from <italic>fer</italic><sup><italic>DR</italic>/<italic>DR </italic></sup>or <italic>fps</italic><sup><italic>KR</italic>/<italic>KR</italic></sup><italic>/fer</italic><sup><italic>DR</italic>/<italic>DR </italic></sup>mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, upper).</p><p>A "pull-down" assay using the GST-PlexinA1 cytoplasmic domain fusion was also performed to further test for possible association between PlexinA1 and Fps or Fer. HEK293T cells were transfected with Myc-epitope tagged Fps, FpsKR (kinase-dead), Fer or FerKR (kinase-dead) expression plasmids. Cell lysates from these cells were mixed with glutathione-agarose bound GST-PlexinA1 cytoplasmic domain or GST as a control. After washing, the specifically bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibody. No association between PlexinA1 and Fps or Fer was detected using this method (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>CRMP2 is a substrate for Fps and Fer, but inhibits their autophosphorylation activity</title><p>Fps was previously identified in a complex with CRMP2 and CRAM in neonatal rat brains; and in co-transfection studies, Fps was shown to phosphorylate all four CRMPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].

When HEK293T cells were co-transfected with Myc epitope-tagged CRMP2 together with Myc-epitope-tagged Fps or Fer, a band corresponding to tyrosine phosphorylated CRMP2 was observed in anti-Myc immunoprecipitates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>, upper). A comparison of the relative amounts of Fps and Fer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, lower) with the degree of CRMP2 tyrosine phosphorylation suggests that CRMP2 was a much better substrate for Fer than it was for Fps under these conditions.

This putative role of NGF was addressed in a second series of experiments. DRG cultures were again induced to grow axons overnight in the presence of NGF.

In a recent study by Mitsui and colleagues, Fps was identified in rat brain lysates in a complex with the microtubule regulating CRMP/CRAM complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Using transfection studies, they went on to show that Fps could interact with and phosphorylated the Sema3A receptor component PlexinA1; and that this stimulated the phosphorylation of CRMP/CRAM proteins. Virally transduced recombinant Fps could also regulate a growth cone collapse response to Sema3A in DRG neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Given the close sequence similarity between Fps and Fer, we investigated the possibility that both kinases might be involved in the Sema3A signaling pathway to CRAM/CRMP; and subsequent microtubule regulation. We have shown here that both Fps and Fer are expressed in the developing mouse brain and in isolated DRGs. Fer was expressed to higher levels than Fps, and Fer had higher <italic>in vitro </italic>kinase activity toward the exogenous substrate tubulin. Fer was also detectably tyrosine phosphorylated <italic>in vivo </italic>in mouse brains, which suggested that it was actively participating in signaling events in the developing nervous system. Finally, we showed a statistically significant defect in Sema3A-induced axon retraction in DRGs from Fer-deficient mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A,B,C</xref>). A statistically significant defect in the Sema3A response of Fps-deficient DRGs was also detected, but only under conditions were NGF was depleted prior to addition of Sema3A (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7F</xref>).</p><p>The study from Mitsui and colleagues used transfection studies to suggest a functional relationship between Fps and PlexinA1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and the biochemical studies we report here also relied upon over-expression in transfected cells to suggest regulatory interactions between Fps and Fer with PlexinA1 and CRMP2. However, it should be noted that E14 DRG explants cultured in NGF will largely consist of PlexinA3- and PlexinA4-expressing nociceptors; so it seems unlikely that PlexinA1 would be involved in transmitting Sema3A signals to this type of neuron <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. It would be interesting to test Sema3A responsiveness in Fps- and/or Fer-deficient DRG-derived proprioceptive neurons selected with NT3, which do express PlexinA1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Molecular analyses should also be extended to reconstituted Sema3A signaling pathways in cells transfected with different PlexinAs. This might reveal different specificities of Fps and Fer for interactions with the different PlexinAs.</p><p>In Cos-7 transfection studies, Mitsui and colleagues showed a Fps-mediated phosphorylation of PlexinA1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In similar transfection studies, we failed to observe PlexinA1 phosphorylation, induced by either Fps or Fer. However, consistent with Mitsui's report, we were able to demonstrate CRMP2 phosphorylation by Fps; but, we found that CRMP2 was a significantly better substrate for Fer than it was for Fps. Mitsui and coworkers also demonstrated that Fps co-immunoprecipitated with PlexinA1 in transfection studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]; however, we were unable to detect such an interaction, either in co-transfection studies, or using an <italic>in vitro </italic>pull-down assay with a purified GST-PlexinA1 fusion protein. Interestingly, Mitsui and coworkers did not detect an association between Fps and CRAM or CRMP in their Cos-7 transfection studies; but they did observe an anti-Fps immunoreactive protein in CRAM immunoprecipitates from rat brains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Although we were unable to detect physical interactions between PlexinA1 nor CRMP2 with either kinase, we observed that both PlexinA1 and CRMP2 inhibited the autophosphorylation activities of Fps and Fer. A similar phenomenon has recently been described for plectin, a cytoskeletal linker protein which acts as a substrate and binding partner for Fer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Given the apparent ability of PlexinA1 and CRMP2 to inhibit Fps and Fer autophosphorylation, we conclude that some interaction must have been occurring, but it failed to survive our immunoprecipitation protocol. In light of the recently solved crystal structure of the extended F-BAR domain from the adaptor-like proteins FBP17 and CIP4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and FCH<sub>0</sub>2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]; and the demonstration that these F-BAR domains can mediate oligomerization, a more intriguing possibility is that substrates like CRMP2 and PlexinA1 might interact with the F-BAR domains of Fps/Fer kinases, and thereby compromise oligomerization or trans-interactions required for kinase auto-phosphorylation. The CRAM-Fps association observed in anti-CRAM immunoprecipitates from rat brain lysates by Mitsui and colleagues was presumably a very strong interaction to have survived the biochemical purification steps leading to Fps identification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Since SH2-mediated associations with specific phosphotyrosine-containing peptides are typically high affinity interactions, it seems reasonable to speculate that such an interaction might have been involved in that association. However, while Mitsui and colleagues observed robust phosphorylation of CRAM and CRMPs when co-expressed in Cos-7 cells with Fps, they did not see co-immunoprecipitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. It is possible that the N-terminal Flag epitope tags on these recombinant CRAM/CRMP proteins were permissive of phosphorylation, but sterically interfered with subsequent binding by the SH2 domains. The Myc epitope tag on the CRMP2 protein used in our study might have allowed phosphorylation, but could have interfered with subsequent SH2-mediated association. Similarly, it is possible that the VSV epitope tag on the recombinant PlexinA1 used in our study was permissive of associations that compromised kinase autophosphorylation, but precluded PlexinA1 phosphorylation, and subsequent high affinity associations with Fps or Fer. The PlexinA1 construct used by Mitsui and colleagues were C-terminally tagged with the HA epitope; and in Cos-7 cell experiments, this protein was both a substrate and a binding partner for Fps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Among the most intriguing experiments performed in the Mitsui study were the reconstitutions of the Sema3A/NP1/PlexinA1/CRMP signaling pathway in transfected Cos-7 cells. Their observations are consistent with a model where NP1 restrains the cytoskeletal contraction signaling properties of a PlexinA1/Fps/CRMP pathway, while Sema3A relieves this NP1 inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Our studies in DRG cultures from Fps- and Fer-deficient mice are consistent with this model, but suggest that the Fer kinase might have an even more significant role in this pathway, relative to that played by Fps. In this regard, it is interesting to note that the two peptides originally identified in association with CRAM in rat brain lysates were compared to human and mouse Fps, with which they shared identical similarities (a collective 19 of 22 amino acids); but they were not compared to rat Fps and Fer. Interestingly, there is a slightly better conservation with rat Fer than rat Fps in these peptides (19/22 vs 18/22 amino acids). It will be important in future studies to compare the relative abilities of Fps and Fer to participate in this Cos-7 cell reconstituted Sema3A signaling pathway, and of course to evaluate the Sema3A collapse response in DRG cultures from compound Fps/Fer-deficient mice.</p><p>Kaibuchi and colleagues have shown that CRMP2 is involved in axonogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. CRMP2 is highly enriched in growing axons, over-expression of wild type CRMP2 induced formation of multiple axons, and over-expression of C-terminally truncated CRMP2 inhibited axon formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. CRMP2 binds to &#x003b1;&#x003b2;tubulin heterodimers and promotes microtubule assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], and it also interacts with Numb to promote its role in endocytosis of the neuronal cell adhesion molecule L1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. L1 is another component of the Sema3A receptor complex, and recycling of L1 is necessary for axon growth in DRG neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. CRMP2 is phosphorylated on threonine-555 by Rho kinase in response ephrinA5, and this blocked its tubulin binding and L1 endocytosis promoting properties, leading to growth cone collapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. It will be important to map the Fps and Fer tyrosine phosphorylation sites in CRMP2 and determine if these phosphorylations affect its ability to bind to tubulin or microtubule regulator proteins.</p><p>Given the initial observations that Plexin proteins could be phosphorylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], it is interesting to note that several kinases in addition to Fps have been implicated in Sema3A signaling. These include Fyn, a member of the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases; the Ser/Thr kinase glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3, and the Ser/Thr kinase cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5). PlexinA1 and PlexinA2 were shown to associate directly with Fyn, and indirectly through Fyn with Cdk5. Fyn was also shown to phosphorylate Cdk5 and the PlexinA2 cytoplasmic domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Sema3A induced the phosphorylation and activation of Cdk5 by Fyn, which was essential for the collapse of sensory growth cones by Sema3A. Axons from explanted E17 Fyn<sup>-/- </sup>DRGs showed an impaired response to Sema3A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. There is also evidence that Fyn might regulate Fps, and possibly Fer, as Fyn has been shown to phosphorylate a kinase-defective mutant form of Fps in Sf-9 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], Fer and Fyn cooperate in actin depolymerization-induced cortactin phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and the Fyn-related Lyn kinase regulates Fer phosphorylation in mast cells downstream of the IgE receptor engagement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. We have also found that Fyn is capable of phosphorylating kinase-inactive mutants of both Fps and Fer (data not shown). These observations suggest a potential regulatory relationship between Fps and Fer, and members of the Src family of kinases during Sema3A signaling. Since there are no obvious defects in the behaviour or activity of the Fer-, Fps- or compound Fer/Fps-mutant mice, we speculate that other kinases, perhaps members of the Src-subfamily like Fyn, might be able to compensate for loss of Fer/Fps kinases during development.</p><p>Fps has been shown to associate with microtubules by Takahashi and colleagues, who also observed Fps co-localizing with sites of microtubule nucleation and bundling in transfected Cos-7 cells; furthermore, the observed Fps co-localization with &#x003b3;-tubulin at sites of microtubule nucleation was dependent upon the Fps FCH domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Purified Fps was also reported to phosphorylate tubulin and promote its polymerization <italic>in vitro</italic>; and biochemical association between Fps and soluble tubulin was dependent upon the Fps FCH domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Fer has also been shown to localize with peripheral microtubules in polarizing and migrating vascular endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In early stage hippocampal neurons, cell permeable peptide-based disruption of the Fer-p120catenin interaction correlated with a cell polarity defect, characterized by a delay in axon formation from a dominant neurite; and this phenotype correlated with deregulation of both the microtubule and actin cytoskeletons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Interestingly, Fer has also been implicated in regulation of N-cadherin interactions in fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and cross-talk from N-cadherin to integrins in neural retina cells extending neurites on laminin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]; and in neuronal cell polarity and neurite development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Both Fps and Fer were able to phosphorylate tubulin <italic>in vitro</italic>, and we found that the <italic>in vitro </italic>activity of Fps and Fer toward tubulin was highest in mouse brain tissues from perinatal stages, and significantly reduced in the adult. Thus, the highest levels of Fps and Fer kinase activity correlated with the developmental stage when a great deal of axon pathfinding activity is occurring. In contrast, Fps and Fer activities were greatly diminished in adults, when neuronal connections have been largely consolidated. <italic>In vitro</italic>, Fer possessed much higher levels of intrinsic autophosphorylation activity compared to Fps; and the ability of Fer to phosphorylate tubulin was also greater than that of Fps. Since tubulin is the major structural component of microtubules, the potential of Fer and Fps to phosphorylate tubulin <italic>in vivo</italic>, and the role that might play in microtubule dynamics will certainly merit further study.</p><p>Biological responses to Sema3A signaling are generally focused upon the growth cone collapse which occurs within minutes of ligand addition. In preliminary experiments using 0.25 &#x003bc;g/mL of recombinant Sema3A, we did see DRG growth cone collapse, but there was no significant differential response between <italic>wt </italic>and Fer- or Fps-deficient DRG neurons (data not shown). When these experiments were repeated with twice the Sema3A concentration, we again observed growth cone collapse with similar apparent kinetics; however, the axon retraction response in <italic>wt </italic>and <italic>fer</italic><sup><italic>DR</italic>/<italic>DR </italic></sup>DRG neurons was significantly different. The <italic>fer</italic><sup><italic>DR</italic>/<italic>DR </italic></sup>axons retracted with a slower velocity than those from <italic>wt </italic>DRG neurons, and at later time points <italic>fer</italic><sup><italic>DR</italic>/<italic>DR </italic></sup>axons began to grow again, while <italic>wt </italic>axons continued to collapse. Our initial experiments were performed in the continuing presence of NGF, which presumably stimulated regrowth of <italic>fer</italic><sup><italic>DR</italic>/<italic>DR </italic></sup>axons. Tuttle and O'Leary have reported that BDNF, NT-3 and NGF altered the sensitivity of growth cones to collapse in response to Sema3A, and NGF was shown to have the strongest protective effect against Sema3A-induced collapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Similarly, Dontchev <italic>et al. </italic>found that the Sema3A-induced collapse of growth cones of NGF-responsive embryonic sensory neurons was inhibited by NGF in a dose-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Apparently, these same protective effects of NGF extend to the axon retraction response. Furthermore, our observations indicated that in the absence of Fer kinase activity, NGF-induced axon regrowth is enhanced. This suggests that Fer might also play some role in signaling interactions between the NGF and Sema3A pathways.</p><p>Fer-deficient neurons were also defective in Sema3A-induced axon retraction in the absence of NGF. The removal of NGF might have also contributed to axon retraction. Therefore, in subsequent experiments we tried to distinguish between Sema3A-induced axon retraction and retraction caused by removing NGF. The result indicated that the removal of NGF promoted an axon retraction response in both Fer-deficient and <italic>wt </italic>neurons. However, the Fer-deficient axons stopped collapsing earlier than <italic>wt </italic>axons, and subsequent addition of Sema3A promoted further collapse of <italic>wt </italic>but not Fer-deficient axons. These results further supported the conclusion that Fer was required for the Sema3A-induced axon retraction. However, because the response to removal of NGF was slightly altered in Fer-deficient relative to <italic>wt </italic>DRGs, Fer might also be involved in other microtubule dynamic changes and reorganization other than that induced by Sema3A.</p><p>The removal of NGF from the DRG cultures might have induced a Wallerian-like axon degeneration response; and ultimately lead to apoptosis caused by loss of NGF-mediated survival signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. The initial kinetics of axon retraction seen upon NGF removal were similar in <italic>wt </italic>and <italic>fer</italic><sup><italic>DR</italic>/<italic>DR </italic></sup>neurons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>), suggesting that Fer was not involved in an early Wallerian degeneration-like response. However, we did note that <italic>wt </italic>axons continued to retract after <italic>fer</italic><sup><italic>DR</italic>/<italic>DR </italic></sup>axons stabilized in the absence of NGF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). This suggests that Fer might be involved in signals contributing to axon retraction at these later times after NGF withdrawal. Since apoptotic signaling is also likely to be engaged by this time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], future experiments should explore the potential role of Fer in neuronal cell death and survival signaling. This is a very interesting possibility, especially in light of recent work showing that Sema3A signaling contributes to apoptosis in NT3-, BDNF- and NGF-dependent embryonic DRG neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].</p><p><italic>fps</italic><sup>-/- </sup>DRG neurons displayed only a slight, yet statistically significant, defect in their Sema3A-induced axon retraction response; but unlike the <italic>fer</italic><sup><italic>DR</italic>/<italic>DR </italic></sup>axons, no regrowth was observed in the presence of NGF. Axon retraction in response to removal of NGF was similar in <italic>fps</italic><sup>-/- </sup>and <italic>wt </italic>DRG cultures. However, the addition of Sema3A to the media promoted additional axon retraction of <italic>wt </italic>but not the <italic>fps</italic><sup>-/- </sup>axons. We therefore conclude that Fps is also involved in Sema3A signaling to microtubules. DRGs from Fps-kinase-inactive (<italic>fps</italic><sup><italic>KR</italic>/<italic>KR</italic></sup>) mutant mice were also studied, but we found no difference in the Sema3A-induced axon retraction response, relative to <italic>wt </italic>axons. Since a slight defect was seen in Fps-null but not Fps-kinase-inactive cells, the data suggest a kinase-independent role for Fps in the axon retraction response to Sema3A.</p><p>Fps has previously been implicated in signaling downstream from the NGF in the PC12 cell system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. We studied axon outgrowth in response to NGF in DRG neurons from Fps- and Fer-deficient embryos, however, both Fps-deficient and Fer-defective neurons extended axons with similar kinetics to <italic>wt </italic>cells. This demonstrated that in DRG sensory neurons, Fps and Fer are not required for NGF-induced axon outgrowth.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, the work presented here provides the first evidence implicating the Fer tyrosine kinase in a Sema3A-induced axon retraction response signaling pathway. Although no obvious neurological defects have been observed in Fps-, Fer-, or compound Fps/Fer-deficient mice, this study provides strong justification for further work to elucidate the physiological importance of Fps and Fer kinases in the sensory nervous system and to investigate if compound Fps/Fer-deficient mice are compromised in their ability to sense their environments. More biochemical analysis is also required to determine if CRMP/CRAM proteins are substrates of Fps or Fer <italic>in vivo</italic>, how Sema3A signaling might regulate that phosphorylation, which PlexinA receptors participate in this Sema3A signaling <italic>in vivo</italic>, and how tyrosine phosphorylation of CRMP/CRAM proteins might affect their ability to regulate microtubule dynamics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Expression constructs and transfections</title><p>Plasmids encoding Myc-tagged wild type Fer and Fps or kinase-inactive versions (FerKR and FpsKR) have been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].
