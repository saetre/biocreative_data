Here we show that transgenic mice carrying a truncated -164/+44 fragment of the alpha B-crystallin gene fused to the CAT gene expressed exclusively in the lens; by contrast mice carrying a -426/+44 fragment of the alpha B gene fused to CAT expressed highly in the lens, skeletal muscle and heart, and slightly in the lung, brain, kidney, spleen and liver. DNase I protection experiments indicated that the -147/-118 sequence is protected by nuclear proteins from alpha TN4-1 lens cell line, but not by nuclear proteins from myotubes of the C2C12 cell line. Site directed mutagenesis of this sequence decreased promoter activity in transiently-transfected lens cells, consistent with this sequence being a lens-specific regulatory region (LSR). We conclude that the -426/-257 enhancer is required for expression in skeletal muscle, heart and possibly other tissues, and that the -164/+44 sequence of the alpha B-crystallin gene is sufficient for expression in the lens of transgenic mice.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00031-0171-a" xlink:role="1283"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00031-0173-a" xlink:role="1285"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00031-0169.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1281"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00031-0170.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1282"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00031-0171.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1283"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00031-0172.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1284"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00031-0173.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1285"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00031-0174.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1286"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
