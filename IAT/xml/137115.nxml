Eukaryotic topoisomerase III was first identified as a gene required for suppression of recombination between repeated genes in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf531c1">1</xref>). Partially purified topoisomerase III was found to be much less efficient than yeast DNA topoisomerases I or II in causing relaxation of supercoiled DNA substrates. <italic>In vivo</italic> studies demonstrated that yeast topoisomerase III has, at most, a weak activity in relaxing negatively supercoiled intracellular DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf531c2">2</xref>). Null mutation of the <italic>top3</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> gene in budding yeast results in various phenotypes including slow growth, hyper-recombination between repetitive DNA sequences, and a defect in sporulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf531c3">3</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>S.cerevisiae sgs1</italic> mutant was isolated as a suppressor of the slow growth phenotype of the <italic>top3</italic> deletion mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf531c4">4</xref>). <italic>SGS1</italic> is a member of the RecQ helicase family which includes fission yeast <italic>rqh1</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> and human <italic>BLM</italic>, <italic>WRN</italic> and <italic>REQL4</italic> helicases which are implicated in Bloom&#x02019;s, Werner&#x02019;s and Rothmund&#x02013;Thomson syndromes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf531c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf531c8">8</xref>). RecQ-family helicases possess 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; helicase activity and are required for the maintenance of genomic stability. In <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>sgs1</italic> deletion mutants also show genomic instability including hyper-recombination of the rDNA locus and a reduced life span that correlates with the accumulation of extrachromosomal rDNA circles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf531c9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf531c12">12</xref>). Biochemically, Sgs1 physically interacts with Top3 and with Top2.</p><p>Several models have been postulated to explain the interactions between topoisomerase III and RecQ helicases: first, the Sgs1&#x02013;Top3 complex is proposed to act as a reverse gyrase with a helicase-like domain and a type I topoisomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf531c4">4</xref>). Secondly, topoisomerase III and RecQ helicase are thought play a role in recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf531c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf531c13">13</xref>) and thirdly, it has been suggested that the Sgs1&#x02013;Top3 complex acts at late stages of replication to facilitate the progression of the replication fork by combined unwinding activity of the helicase and decatenation activity of topoisomerase III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf531c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf531c15">15</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, <italic>top3</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> is essential for viability and plays a role in chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf531c14">14</xref>). The <italic>top3</italic>-deleted spores germinate and divide several times, but fail to maintain long-term growth. The <italic>S.pombe</italic> RecQ family helicase, <italic>rqh1</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup>, was initially isolated as a gene that complemented the <italic>rad12</italic> and <italic>hus2</italic> mutations (the latter found to be allelic), which showed sensitivity to both DNA-damaging agents and to the DNA synthesis inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU). The <italic>rqh1</italic> null mutant is defective in the reversible recovery from the S-phase arrest, and in tolerating DNA damage during S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf531c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf531c17">17</xref>). Deletion of the <italic>rqh1</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> gene suppresses the lethality of the <italic>top3</italic> mutant in <italic>S.pombe</italic>, a result reminiscent of the situation in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf531c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf531c18">18</xref>).</p><p>To further understand the functional roles of <italic>S.pombe</italic> topoisomerase III and its relationship to Rqh1 helicase, we generated <italic>top3</italic> temperature-sensitive (<italic>top3</italic>-ts) mutants. The <italic>top3</italic>-ts mutants are sensitive to DNA-damaging agents, show increased levels of &#x02018;cut&#x02019; (cell untimely torn) phenotypes and elevated rates of minichromosome loss following HU treatment. The viability of wild-type and <italic>rqh1-d</italic> mutant cells is sharply decreased by Rqh1 overproduction. The phenotypes of <italic>rqh1</italic>-overexpression strain are similar to those of <italic>top3</italic>-ts mutant. These results indicate that Top3 has an essential function in processing an intermediate DNA structure produced by Rqh1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Media and reagents</title><p>Complete and minimal growth media for fission yeast and chemical reagents were purchased from Difco and Sigma Aldrich.

DAPI-staining material was fragmented over time, spreading out into the cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf531f2">2</xref>A panels f and i). Consistent with the loss of nuclear integrity, cells accumulated with abnormal and multiple septa, and many anucleated cells or cells with misplaced nuclei were observed at later time points. These phenotypes are consistent with the previously reported phenotype of <italic>top3</italic> deletion spores following germination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf531c14">14</xref>). The kinetics of accumulation of various phenotypes were followed following the shift to the restrictive temperature (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf531f2">2</xref>B).

This response was also evident, and possibly slightly elevated, in an <italic>rqh1-d</italic> mutant background (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf531f3">3</xref>D). The DNA damage sensitivity of <italic>top3</italic>-ts mutants, combined with the DNA damage inducibility of the <italic>top3</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> transcript implies an involvement of <italic>top3</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> in the DNA damage response, possibly during repair. It is likely that Top3 and Rqh1 function in the same DNA damage response pathway(s) because the damage sensitivities of the <italic>top3rqh1</italic> double mutant is equivalent to that of the <italic>rqh1-d</italic> single mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf531c14">14</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The <italic>top3</italic>-ts mutant is defective in recovery from S-phase arrest by HU</title><p>A previous report demonstrated that the <italic>rqh1</italic> null mutant was HU sensitive and defective in recovery from S-phase arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf531c17">17</xref>). Therefore, we examined if the HU sensitivity of <italic>top3</italic>-ts mutants was similarly related to a recovery defect. Flow cytometry analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf531f4">4</xref>A) showed that the wild-type, <italic>rqh1-d</italic> mutant, and <italic>top3</italic>-ts mutant could resume and complete bulk DNA replication with similar kinetics following release from HU arrest at 37&#x000b0;C. However, subsequent chromosome segregation in both <italic>rqh1</italic> null and <italic>top3</italic>-ts mutants was defective, indicating that, while bulk DNA replication appeared complete, the chromosomes were either incompletely replicated or remained entangled (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf531f4">4</xref>B). At 140 min after HU release, both <italic>rqh1-d</italic> and <italic>top3</italic>-ts mutants showed an elongated cell morphology and an increased frequency of &#x02018;cut&#x02019; phenotypes when compared with either controls without HU treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf531f4">4</xref>B) or to <italic>top3</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup><italic>rqh1</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup>-treated controls (data not shown) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf531c17">17</xref>).</p><p>We also examined the <italic>top3rqh1</italic> double mutant in the same assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf531f4">4</xref>B). When released from HU arrest, the number of cells with the &#x02018;cut&#x02019; phenotype also increased with kinetics similar to the <italic>rqh1-d</italic>.

The <italic>rqh1-d</italic> mutant exhibited a 75-fold increased frequency of Ch<sup>16</sup> loss compared with wild-type controls.

Since <italic>rqh1-d</italic> and <italic>top3</italic>-ts mutants showed very low viability after the HU treatment and <italic>top3</italic>-ts cells lose viability after a temperature shift, the minichromosome loss rates probably underestimate the mis-segregation problem.</p></sec><sec><title>The viability of cells in S-phase slightly decreased with a rise in temperature</title><p>Because the <italic>top3-ts134</italic> mutant is sensitive to HU, defective in recovery after S-phase arrest and loses Ch<sup>16</sup> dramatically after HU treatment, we examined at which point in the cell cycle the <italic>top3</italic>-ts mutant cells lost viability. Cells were synchronized in G1-phase by nitrogen starvation and aliquots were transferred to 37&#x000b0;C for 2 h at 30 min intervals. The viability was plotted with the septation index of the unshifted culture (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf531f5">5</xref>A). In <italic>S.pombe</italic> there is a temporal correlation between septation and S-phase and so the septation index is taken as a measure of the number of replicating cells. The viability of the <italic>top3</italic>-ts mutant was modestly reduced by a transient temperature shift during G1&#x02013;S-phase, but not by a shift during G2. Although these differences are modest &#x0005b;which is not unexpected given the fact that <italic>top3</italic>-ts cells lose viability slowly following a shift of an asynchronous cell culture to 37&#x000b0;C (data not shown)&#x0005d;, these results are consistent with the lethality of the <italic>top3</italic>-ts mutant being due to defects during DNA replication.</p></sec><sec><title>Chromosome mis-segregation is not due to defects in the anaphase promoting complex (APC) or microtubules</title><p>Explanations for chromosome mis-segregation defects in <italic>top3</italic>-ts mutant cells could be that Top3 functions to maintain the architecture of the centromere, or that it affects microtubule interactions with chromosomes, and has an uncharacterized function in APC-catalyzed anaphase initiation.

A 12 h transient shift to the restrictive temperature similarly had little or no effect on <italic>top3</italic>-ts or <italic>rqh1top3</italic> double mutants in the presence of TBZ or TPCK. A modest decrease in viability was observed for <italic>rqh1</italic> null cells after this treatment in the presence of TPCK. These results provide strong evidence that the chromosome mis-segregation defect of <italic>top3</italic>-ts mutant is not due to defects in M-phase.</p></sec><sec><title>Rqh1 overexpression causes cell inviability</title><p>Rqh1 and Top3 are thought to function together, and to biochemically interact. Our data demonstrate similarities in some phenotypes when Rqh1 is lost or Top3 function is impaired. However, loss of the <italic>rqh1</italic> gene is not lethal, whereas loss of the <italic>top3</italic> gene is. Because the <italic>top3rqh1</italic> double mutant is viable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf531c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf531c18">18</xref>) and <italic>sgs1</italic> mutants suppress the slow growth of <italic>top3-d</italic> mutant in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, it has thus been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf531c4">4</xref>) that Top3 resolves potentially lethal DNA structures that are produced by Rqh1. If this is the case, we hypothesized that Rqh1 overexpression may itself be a lethal event, as it may perturb the balance of Rqh1&#x02013;Top3 functions, causing a phenotype similar to that seen with the loss of <italic>top3</italic> function. Indeed, when we expressed <italic>rqh1</italic> from an inducible exogenous promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf531f6">6</xref>A), both wild-type and <italic>rqh1-d</italic> mutants were unable to grow (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf531f6">6</xref>B). The morphology of <italic>rqh1</italic>-overexpressing cells was reminiscent of <italic>top3</italic>-ts mutant cells at the restrictive temperature (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf531f6">6</xref>C). They were elongated, had double or triple septa, abnormal nuclei and showed &#x02018;cut&#x02019; phenotypes. The percentage of &#x02018;cut&#x02019; cells was, however, slightly lower than that seen for <italic>top3</italic>-ts mutant cells at 37&#x000b0;C. The <italic>rqh1</italic>-overexpressing cells also showed an increase in &#x02018;cut&#x02019; cells when they were transiently treated with HU, reminiscent of <italic>top3</italic>-ts cells (data not shown). From these results, we suggest that Top3 has a role in the maintenance of an optimum level of Rqh1 activity or in resolving structures created by Rqh1 helicase, and may function downstream of Rqh1.</p><p>We also attempted to examine the sensitivity of <italic>rqh1</italic>-overproducing cells to DNA-damaging agents (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf531f6">6</xref>D). However, when <italic>rqh1</italic> was overexpressed from the pREP41 promoter in wild-type or <italic>rqh1-d</italic> mutant cells, viability was lost. When the <italic>nmt</italic> promoter was repressed by the addition of thiamine (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf531f6">6</xref>D, left panels), cells were viable and the DNA damage sensitivity of the <italic>rqh1</italic> null mutant disappeared. These results indicate that the low level expression of Rqh1 from the repressed <italic>nmt</italic> promoter could compensate for the damage sensitivity of the <italic>rqh1-d</italic> mutant.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Goodwin <italic>et al</italic>.

However, they were not able to directly examine the role of Top3 in DNA damage repair or chromosome stability because the only viable <italic>top3</italic> defective cells examined were, by necessity, also deleted for the <italic>rqh1</italic> gene. In our study, we have examined the phenotype of <italic>top3</italic> deficient cells by creating <italic>top3</italic>-ts mutants. Following a temperature shift to the restrictive temperature, we see morphological phenotypes that are very similar to those reported by Goodwin <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf531c14">14</xref>). The percentage of normal looking cells decreases within a few generations and an increase is seen in cells with an abnormal septum, mispositioned nuclei and &#x02018;cut&#x02019; nuclei. Cells also elongate and ultimately many cells appear to contain fragmented DAPI-staining material.</p><sec><title>Top3 is required for chromosome stability</title><p>By studying minichromosome stability in <italic>top3</italic>-ts mutants we have been able to demonstrate that <italic>S.pombe top3</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> is required for the fidelity of chromosome segregation. After a brief shift to the restrictive temperature, we found that minichromosome loss rates were significantly increased. Interestingly, both at the permissive temperature and a brief temperature shift to 37&#x000b0;C, the loss rate of the minichromosome was also increased following a transient incubation with HU, which arrests cells in S-phase. This result is reminiscent of the data from Stewart <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf531c17">17</xref>), who demonstrated increased chromosome loss in <italic>rqh1</italic> null cells after HU treatment. Because Stewart <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf531c17">17</xref>) concluded that <italic>rqh1-d</italic> mutant cells were unable to effectively recover viability following a transient arrest in S-phase, we examined this recovery response in more detail. Indeed, we observed that, like <italic>rqh1</italic> null cells, <italic>top3</italic>-ts cells at the restrictive temperature were ultimately able to complete bulk DNA synthesis, but that this did not represent intact, accurately or completely replicated DNA because the subsequent mitosis and cytokinesis were delayed and ultimately resulted in numerous mitotic defects.</p></sec><sec><title>Evidence for an essential function of Top3 during S-phase</title><p>On the basis of the sensitivity of <italic>top3</italic>-ts mutants to the S-phase inhibitor HU, we also examined the point in the cell cycle at which <italic>top3</italic>-ts cells lost viability at the restrictive temperature. Our data indicate that, if cells proceed through S-phase with impaired Top3 function, viability is modestly decreased. However, if Top3 function is impaired in G2 for several hours (by a transient temperature shift), viability is not lost. While these effects are quite subtle&#x02014;which is consistent with the fact that <italic>top3</italic>-ts cells continue cycling for several generations and lose viability quite slowly at the restrictive temperature&#x02014;we feel that, in concert with the HU sensitivity of <italic>top3</italic>-ts mutants and the fact that transient S-phase delay greatly increases minichromosome loss rates, these data point to an essential function for <italic>S.pombe</italic> Top3 in S-phase. A recent report revealed that <italic>top3</italic> deletion mutants were highly sensitive to HU and the level of <italic>TOP3</italic> mRNA peaked at late G1-phase in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, suggesting a specific role of Top3 in S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf531c24">24</xref>).</p><p>Minichromosome loss mutants fall into a number of classes, including DNA replication and repair genes, genes affecting centromere function and genes affecting the progress though mitosis such as those involved with the APC. In order to provide evidence to support our hypothesis that Top3 function is important in S-phase and not directly within mitosis, we examined the sensitivity of <italic>top3</italic>-ts mutants to microtubule polymerization inhibitor TBZ and to the proteosome inhibitor TPCK. Since <italic>top3</italic>-ts has increased minichromosome loss at the restrictive temperature, we reasoned that, should <italic>top3</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> be required for centromere architecture or have an uncharacterized role within mitotic progression, it should (like many mutants affecting mitotic processes) be significantly sensitive to either TBZ or TPCK. In fact, we found no evidence of such sensitivity at either the permissive temperature or combined with a transient temperature shift. We thus conclude that it is most likely that the essential function for <italic>top3</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> is during S-phase.</p></sec><sec><title>Top3 is involved in DNA repair</title><p>Both the <italic>top3</italic>-ts mutants were sensitive to the DNA-damaging agents UV and MMS at the restrictive temperature. This sensitivity is similar to that seen for the <italic>rqh1-d</italic> single mutant and for <italic>top3rqh1</italic> double mutants. Previously, in <italic>S.pombe</italic> it has not been possible to interpret the observation that <italic>rqh1-d</italic> single and <italic>rqh1top3</italic> double mutants have the same sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents because it was not known if a <italic>top3</italic> mutant alone was DNA damage sensitive. Our data demonstrate that this is the case, and thus allow the conclusion that Top3 is involved in DNA damage survival, that the <italic>top3</italic>-ts mutant is epistatic with the <italic>rqh1-d</italic> mutant and thus Top3 acts in the same DNA repair pathway(s) as Rqh1, as characterized by Murray <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf531c16">16</xref>). In support of the contention that Top3 has a significant role in the DNA damage responses, we also observed that <italic>top3</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> transcript levels were significantly induced by DNA-damaging agents. In addition, Chakraverty <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf531c24">24</xref>) demonstrated that <italic>top3</italic> deletion mutants were defective in Rad53 phosphorylation following DNA damage during S-phase in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, suggesting the role of Top3 in DNA damage response during S-phase.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Several models have been proposed to explain the function of the Top3&#x02013;Sgs1 complex in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>. One possibility is that the complex acts at the termination step of replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf531c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf531c25">25</xref>). Another possibility is that the Top3&#x02013;Sgs1 complex is involved in the processing of structures arising at stalled replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf531c26">26</xref>). Our results are consistent with both these possibilities, which are not themselves mutually exclusive. The high frequency of &#x02018;cut&#x02019; phenotypes and the elevated minichromosome loss rate we see in the <italic>top3</italic>-ts mutant after a transient temperature shift or following HU treatment support a role in the termination step of replication by implying that Top3 is involved in chromosome decatenation and separation. However, <italic>top3</italic>-ts and <italic>rqh1</italic> mutants are both sensitive to DNA-damaging agents, which is consistent with a role in the repair of stalled replication forks. It is, of course, possible that Top3&#x02013;Rqh1 play roles in both processes or that incorrect repair at sites of stalled replication forks can cause an irreversible catenation event in the absence of Top3. Significant further work to explore these possibilities will be necessary to understand the role of Top3 and Rqh1.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf531f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> (<bold>A</bold>) The growth comparisons of two <italic>top3</italic>-ts candidates. <italic>top3::ura4</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> haploids containing a mutated <italic>top3</italic> gene on a plasmid were compared at 25 and 37&#x000b0;C.
