Recent evidence suggests that anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family are overexpressed in melanoma and may contribute to melanoma's striking resistance to apoptosis. ABT-737, a small-molecule inhibitor of Bcl-2, Bcl-xl and Bcl-w, has demonstrated efficacy in several forms of leukemia, lymphoma as well as solid tumors. However, overexpression of Mcl-1, a frequent observance in melanoma, is known to confer ABT-737 resistance.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Here we report that knockdown of Mcl-1 greatly reduces cell viability in combination with ABT-737 in six different melanoma cell lines. We demonstrate that the cytotoxic effect of this combination treatment is due to apoptotic cell death involving not only caspase-9 activation but also activation of caspase-8, caspase-10 and Bid, which are normally associated with the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Caspase-8 (and caspase-10) activation is abrogated by inhibition of caspase-9 but not by inhibitors of the death receptor pathways. Furthermore, while caspase-8/-10 activity is required for the full induction of cell death with treatment, the death receptor pathways are not. Finally, we demonstrate that basal levels of caspase-8 and Bid correlate with treatment sensitivity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Our findings suggest that the combination of ABT-737 and Mcl-1 knockdown represents a promising, new treatment strategy for malignant melanoma. We also report a death receptor-independent role for extrinsic pathway proteins in treatment response and suggest that caspase-8 and Bid may represent potential markers of treatment sensitivity.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Over the past 40 years, the incidence of melanoma has increased more rapidly than any other type of cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006651-Chudnovsky1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Concordantly, down-regulation of Mcl-1 by genetic and chemical strategies restores treatment sensitivity.

Here we confirm this observation and further provide the first in-depth characterization of the combined effect of Mcl-1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) and ABT-737 in malignant melanoma. We examined the effects of both single agents and the combination treatment on the induction of cell death in six melanoma cell lines. While neither single agent induces a significant amount of death in all cell lines, the combination treatment is consistently effective in reducing overall viability and inducing apoptosis in melanoma cell lines. Furthermore, we observed that the combination treatment was accompanied by death receptor-independent activation of caspase-8, caspase-10, and Bid. Finally, we demonstrate correlations between steady-state levels of cleaved caspase-8 and Bid and sensitivity to the combination treatment suggesting their potential as markers for measuring treatment efficacy.

To reduce Mcl-1 protein levels, we used Dicer-substrate siRNA (DsiRNA).

When optimizing knockdown, we also examined levels of cleaved PARP as an indication of apoptosis induction.

In the present study, we have expanded these results using a tissue microarray. Mcl-1 expression increases with tumor depth and stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006651-g001">Figure 1A,B</xref>) suggesting that Mcl-1 is a critical obstacle to apoptosis induction in melanoma.</p><p>However, we report that reduction of Mcl-1 expression alone is not enough to significantly reduce survival in multiple melanoma cell lines. We therefore combined Mcl-1 knockdown with an inhibitor of other anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, ABT-737, and demonstrate a synergistic effect of the combination treatment. We found that Mcl-1 DsiRNA enhances the effect of ABT-737 in all cell lines examined, resulting in significant decreases in overall viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006651-g003">Figure 3</xref>) and increases in apoptosis induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006651-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, the combination therapy represents a promising new treatment strategy for malignant melanoma that calls for further investigation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>In initial mouse model studies, ABT-737 has been well-tolerated, with little effect on overall animal weight and no observed caspase activation in normal tissues such as liver, heart and intestine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006651-Oltersdorf1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

Future studies using mouse melanoma models will be required to assess both the anti-tumor activity and toxicity of our proposed combination therapy <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Many chemotherapeutic treatments act through activation of the death receptor pathway and subsequent cleavage of caspase-8 or -10 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006651-Debatin1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. However, death receptor independent caspase-8/-10 activation has been reported in response to several anti-cancer agents including camptothecin, paclitaxel (Taxol) and etoposide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006651-Filomenko1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006651-deVries1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006651-vonHaefen1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. In such instances, the active caspase is thought to function as part of a feedback loop to enhance the caspase cascade and amplify apoptotic signals. Loss or inhibition of caspase-8 or -10 significantly reduces the efficacy of these treatments. Thus death receptor-independent activation of caspase-8/-10 appears to be an important apoptotic mechanism for certain chemotherapeutic agents. Here we demonstrate death receptor-independent cleavage of caspase-8 and -10 as well as downstream target Bid following treatment with Mcl-1 DsiRNA and ABT-737 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006651-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Inhibition of either caspase-8 or caspase-10 (as well as caspase-8 knockdown) significantly reduces treatment efficacy suggesting that this downstream pathway may play an important role in the response of melanoma cells to the combination treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006651-g006">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>By identifying the genetic factors involved in the induction of cell death following treatment, the long-term goal is to tailor therapy to individual tumor characteristics. We therefore sought to identify factors that modify sensitivity of melanoma cells to the combination treatment of Mcl-1 DsiRNA and ABT-737. We found a correlation between low levels of Bid in cell lines with greater treatment sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006651-g008">Figure 8</xref>). While this appears paradoxical, as Bid is pro-apoptotic, our data is concordant with a report on cervical cancer demonstrating a correlation between high Bid expression and poor radiotherapy outcome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006651-Green1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. We propose that low levels of full-length Bid correspond to higher levels of cleaved Bid, although the cleavage product is difficult to detect owing to its short half-life. There are only slightly higher levels of full-length procaspase-8 in highly responsive cell lines; however, there is a strong, linear relationship between cleaved caspase-8 (p43/p41) and treatment response. Presumably, high levels of the intermediate cleavage products of caspase-8 correlate with high levels of the active protein (p17). Given that a caspase-8 dependent pathway appears to play an important role in treatment response, cell lines with high levels of active caspase-8 and Bid may therefore be better &#x0201c;primed&#x0201d; to die upon treatment with Mcl-1 DsiRNA/ABT-737. Thus, high levels of cleaved caspase-8 and, to a lesser extent, low levels of full-length Bid could potentially be used as predictors of response to ABT-737 and Mcl-1 knockdown.</p><p>There is currently no effective treatment for malignant melanoma. Here we present evidence that the combination of ABT-737 and Mcl-1 knockdown by DsiRNA efficiently induces cell death in multiple melanoma cell lines well over the effect seen with the individual treatments. Furthermore, our results indicate that a death receptor-independent pathway involving caspase-8, caspase-10 and Bid activation is important to combination treatment response. Further elucidation of the apoptotic pathways involved in treatment response will aid in the effective implementation of an ABT-737 and Mcl-1 knockdown-based therapy in malignant melanoma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The use of human skin tissues in this study was approved by the medical ethics committee of the University of Alberta and was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki Principles.
