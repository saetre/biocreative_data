The most interesting new members of the chromo superfamily are Drosophila male-specific lethal (MSL-3) protein involved in the X chromosome gene dosage compensation in the males and human retinoblastoma-binding protein RBP-1. We show that the chromo domain is duplicated in several chromatin-binding proteins and use this observation to interpret recent results on chromatin binding obtained with chimeric chromo domain-containing proteins. We hypothesize that the chromo domain may be a vehicle that delivers both positive and negative transcription regulators to the sites of their action on chromatin.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00021-0012-a" xlink:role="4230"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00021-0011.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4229"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00021-0012.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4230"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00021-0013.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4231"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00021-0014.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4232"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00021-0015.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4233"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
