Despite the immense potential of gene association studies, they have been challenging to analyze because most traits are complex, involving the combined effect of mutations at many different genes. Due to lack of statistical power, only the strongest single markers are typically identified. Here, we present an integrative approach that greatly increases power through marker clustering and projection of marker interactions within and across protein complexes. Applied to a recent gene association study in yeast, this approach identifies 2,023 genetic interactions which map to 208 functional interactions among protein complexes. We show that such interactions are analogous to interactions derived through reverse genetic screens and that they provide coverage in areas not yet tested by reverse genetic analysis. This work has the potential to transform gene association studies, by elevating the analysis from the level of individual markers to global maps of genetic interactions. As proof of principle, we use synthetic genetic screens to confirm numerous novel genetic interactions for the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>One of the most important problems in biology and medicine is to identify the genetic mutations that affect human traits such as blood pressure, longevity, and onset of disease. Currently, large scientific teams are examining the genomes of thousands of people in an attempt to find mutations present only in individuals with certain traits. Until now, mutations have been largely examined in isolation, without regard to how they work together inside the cell. However, large pathway maps are now available which describe in detail the network of genes and proteins that underlies cell function. Here we show how to take advantage of these pathway maps to better identify relevant mutations and to show how these mutations work mechanistically. This basic approach of combining genetic information with known maps of the cell will have wide-ranging applications in understanding and treating disease.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>A central challenge in genetics is to understand how interactions among different genetic loci contribute to complex traits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000782-Wilmes1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000782-1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. In model organisms such as yeast, genetic interactions are typically identified using reverse genetic approaches, in which different pairs of genes are systematically knocked out to create a collection of double mutants. Genetic interaction is indicated when the growth rate of the double mutant is slower than expected (e.g., synthetic sickness or lethality) or faster than expected (e.g., suppression) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000782-Tong1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000782-Boone1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000782-Collins2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.

Complex traits such as body weight or disease onset can be difficult to study in a cell-based assay, and null mutations are expensive to induce in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000782-Primrose1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Instead, interactions amongst loci have been largely mapped from data generated through forward genetic approaches, such as genome-wide linkage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000782-Huang1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> or genome-wide association studies (GWAS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000782-Evans1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000782-Marchini1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

The most basic approach is to perform an exhaustive two-dimensional (2D) scan, in which all pairs of genetic markers are tested for joint association with the phenotype. Because billions of marker pairs must be tested, 2D scans are computationally demanding and suffer from low statistical power due to multiple hypothesis testing. One method to partially mediate this problem is to initiate searches for pair-wise interactions only for markers with strong individual effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000782-Evans1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000782-Marchini1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

These results indicate a major role for genetic interactions in the heritability of complex traits. However, it is likely that the interactions uncovered to date represent only a fraction of the true genetic network.</p><p>Here, we show that both the power and interpretation of genetic interactions derived from association studies can be significantly improved through integration with information about the physical architecture of the cell. We apply this integrative approach to an association study conducted in yeast, yielding a genetic network that complements, extends, and validates networks assembled through reverse genetic methods.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Bi-clustering of marker pairs defines a network among genomic intervals</title><p>We analyzed a recent GWAS in yeast which analyzed a population of 112 segregants resulting from a cross of a laboratory <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strain with a wild isolate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000782-Brem1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

We reasoned that bi-clustering the marker pairs might provide two distinct advantages: First, it allows many statistically insignificant marker-marker interactions to reinforce a single interval-interval interaction. Second, it leverages the structure between neighboring marker pairs to identify with greater precision the interval of DNA underlying the variance in a given trait.</p><fig id="pgen-1000782-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000782.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Using genome-wide association data to identify natural genetic interactions.</title><p>(A) Two interacting interval pairs (green and blue) which represent significantly dense groups of marker-marker interactions are shown.

In this study, we have demonstrated that such challenges can be partly overcome by (1) accounting for bi-cluster structure in the data and (2) by integrating genetic interactions derived from GWAS with protein complexes and functional annotations. The result is a map of protein complexes and pathways interconnected by dense bundles of genetic interactions, which raises statistical power and provides biological context to the genetic interactions uncovered in natural populations.</p><p>Despite exhibiting some overlap (8.7&#x00025;), there was also much divergence between the natural and synthetic networks. Such divergence might be explained by a number of factors. First, the two types of genetic networks have major differences with respect to coverage and power. Natural networks are based on genome-wide variations and thus nearly all gene pairs are tested for pairwise interaction&#x02014; i.e., the coverage of gene pairs is practically complete. This large coverage comes at the price of low statistical power: gene association studies are limited by the number of individuals that can be surveyed which, in turn, limits the power of natural genetics to detect any given genetic interaction. On the other hand, a reverse genetic interaction screen explicitly tests the growth rate of gene pairs, with high power to detect interaction. However, the set of gene pairs that can be tested in a single study is limited by the throughput of the screening technology. The synthetic genetic network used here was a combination of four such studies which collectively cover approximately 5&#x00025; of yeast gene pairs. Future efforts may seek to complement the coverage of reverse genetic screens by using natural genetics, or to improve the power of gene association studies through focused reverse genetic analysis. Here, we have demonstrated this concept by expanding the coverage of the synthetic network around the INO80 complex, based on the conserved interactions we found for this complex in both types of networks.</p><p>Even with equivalent coverage and power, the two types of network would still likely diverge due to their different means of perturbation. The natural network is driven by variations in genome sequence including SNPs, repeat expansions, copy number variations, and chromosomal rearrangements which lead to a variety of effects on gene function such as hypo- and hypermorphic alleles, null alleles, and so on. In contrast, synthetic networks predominantly consist of complete gene deletion events, which are rarely experienced in nature and lead exclusively to null alleles.</p><p>A final difference is phenotype&#x02014; the natural and synthetic networks in this study differ markedly in the underlying phenotypic traits they have measured, relating to gene expression versus cell growth, respectively. It is important to note, however, that the differences in traits are specific to the currently available data sets. They are not inherent to either mapping approach, and in general one can imagine synthetic genetic interactions related to gene expression (see Jonikas <italic>et al</italic>. for a recent example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000782-Jonikas1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>) or natural interactions related to a single phenotypic trait such as cell viability or disease (which in fact describes the majority of GWAS data generated to-date for humans) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000782-1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Despite all of these differences, we did observe a significant number of natural and synthetic genetic interactions in common. It is tempting to speculate that these common interactions might share certain characteristics with regard to cellular function. In particular, we found that natural interactions also present in the synthetic network were linked to expression levels of ribosomal genes as well as to core components of respiration and cell cycle. Several studies have noted a correlation between the expression levels of ribosomal or mitochondrial genes and growth rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000782-Warner1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000782-Brauer1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the overlap between natural and synthetic interactions seems to occur among genes that strongly influence expression traits related to growth.</p><p>A common issue in association studies, known as the &#x0201c;fine mapping problem&#x0201d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000782-Schadt1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000782-Rockman1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, is that a strongly associated marker will fall near many candidate genes, leaving it ambiguous as to which of these candidates is the causal factor. Numerous methods have been developed to refine or prioritize these candidates, often through incorporation of orthogonal information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000782-Suthram1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. An extension of this problem applies to marker-marker interactions, which typically implicate one of many possible pairs of genes. Here, we have mitigated this problem by summarizing markers into protein complexes and functional terms. However, ambiguities can still arise in cases where several complex-complex interactions are supported by the same underlying set of marker pairs. Since it is likely that only one of these interactions is causally linked to phenotype, further work may be necessary to prioritize these candidates. It is important to note, however, that fine-mapping issues will be less of a concern in humans than in yeast, given the higher density of available markers which will improve the resolution in identifying causal genes.</p><p>In summary, we have demonstrated that the logical framework developed for analysis of synthetic genetic networks can also be readily applied to natural genetic networks. Biologically and clinically, the clear and immediate application is towards the analysis of genome-wide association studies in humans.
