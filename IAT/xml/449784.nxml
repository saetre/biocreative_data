In most cases, Wnt/Fz signal transduction leads to posttranslational stabilization of the intracellular protein &#x003b2;-catenin (&#x003b2;-cat) (&#x003b2;-cat or Armadillo &#x0005b;Arm&#x0005d; in <italic>Drosophila</italic>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Polakis1">Polakis 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Polakis2">2000</xref>). However, recent work has established that some Wnt ligands and Fz receptors can also signal through pathways independent of the Wnt/&#x003b2;-cat (Wg/Arm) cascade in certain contexts in vertebrates and invertebrates (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Mlodzik1">Mlodzik 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Veeman1">Veeman et al. 2003</xref>). In particular, the Fz/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway has been studied extensively in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Adler1">Adler 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Keller1">Keller 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Mlodzik1">Mlodzik 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Tada2">Tada et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Strutt2">Strutt 2003</xref>). PCP is easy to study and evident in all adult tissues in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. For example, in wing cells the PCP response is the formation of an actin spike (the wing &#x0201c;hair&#x0201d;) that points distally, and in the eye PCP is manifest in the regular ommatidial arrangement in the anteroposterior and dorsoventral axes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Adler1">Adler 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Mlodzik1">Mlodzik 2002</xref>). These distinct PCP manifestations are regulated by the same set of genes, the so-called primary polarity genes, of which Fz is the most prominent and best studied. Similarly, this noncanonical Fz/PCP pathway has been implicated in PCP establishment in vertebrates, with prominent examples including the polarization of the sensory epithelium in the inner ear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Curtin1">Curtin et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Dabdoub1">Dabdoub et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Montcouquiol1">Montcouquiol et al. 2003</xref>) and aspects of cell polarization in the convergent extension process during gastrulation (for a description of the similarities, pathway conservation, and specific readouts see reviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Keller1">Keller 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Mlodzik1">Mlodzik 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Veeman1">Veeman et al. 2003</xref>). Despite the increasing knowledge about the distinct pathways mediated by Wnt/Fz signaling, the regulation of Fz signaling specificity remains largely obscure.</p><p>Both pathways, Wnt/&#x003b2;-cat and Fz/PCP, signal via Disheveled (Dsh) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Boutros1">Boutros and Mlodzik 1999</xref>). This raises the intriguing question of how structurally very similar receptors can signal through a common protein into distinct downstream effector pathways. In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> Fz (for clarity we will refer to it as Fz1) and Fz2 are functionally redundant receptors for Wg, activating the canonical Wg/Arm cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Bhat1">Bhat 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Kennerdell1">Kennerdell and Carthew 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Bhanot2">Bhanot et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Chen1">Chen and Struhl 1999</xref>). In addition to this redundant role in canonical signaling, Fz1 has a specific nonredundant role in the Fz/PCP pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Vinson1">Vinson and Adler 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Vinson2">Vinson et al. 1989</xref>). Subdomains of Fz1 and Fz2 have been analyzed with respect to the functional similarities and differences of the two receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Boutros2">Boutros et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Rulifson1">Rulifson et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Strapps1">Strapps and Tomlinson 2001</xref>). These studies have suggested that signaling differences between Fz1 and Fz2 could lie in their different affinities for ligands (e.g., Wg has a 10-fold higher affinity for Fz2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Rulifson1">Rulifson et al. 2000</xref>) and in additional cytoplasmic sequences which govern distinct intrinsic signaling preferences between Fz1 and Fz2 for the canonical and Fz/PCP pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Boutros2">Boutros et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Strapps1">Strapps and Tomlinson 2001</xref>).</p><p>Signaling specificity could be regulated by distinct Wnt-Fz combinations that would activate either the canonical or noncanonical pathway. Although a PCP-specific Wnt ligand for Fz1 has not yet been identified in flies, in vertebrates specific Wnt(s)-Fz(s) combinations are associated with either canonical or Fz/PCP signaling. However, the specificity is not simple. For example, although Wnt5a and Wnt11 cause embryonic phenotypes associated with the Fz/PCP-like pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Heisenberg1">Heisenberg et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Tada1">Tada and Smith 2000</xref>), coexpression of Wnt5a with Fz5 causes axis duplications, a canonical Wnt/&#x003b2;-cat phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-He1">He et al. 1997</xref>). Similarly, vertebrate Fz7 receptors have been shown to affect both noncanonical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Djiane1">Djiane et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Medina1">Medina et al. 2000</xref>) and &#x003b2;-cat signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Kuhl1">Kuhl et al. 2000</xref>). These data suggest that signaling specificity is not necessarily associated with a particular Wnt ligand or Fz receptor. Wnt/Fz signaling specificity may be determined, in part, by the presence of distinct coreceptors. For example, the Arrow-LRP5/6 protein acts as a Wnt/Wg coreceptor and is only required for Wnt/&#x003b2;-cat signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Tamai1">Tamai et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Wehrli2">Wehrli et al. 2000</xref>). No coreceptor of Fz1 has been reported for Fz/PCP signaling. Clearly this is a complicated issue and is likely to be context and cell-type dependent.</p><p>Endogenous Fz2 is difficult to detect, but in the wing hinge region it is localized evenly in membranes along the apical&#x02013;basal axis (M. Strigini, unpublished data). Similarly, overexpressed Fz2 (under <italic>dppGal4</italic> control) is localized throughout the apical&#x02013;basal axis of larval imaginal disc epithelia, and extracellular Wg binds to Fz2 predominantly at the basolateral membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Strigini1">Strigini and Cohen 2000</xref>), suggesting indirectly that canonical Wg/&#x003b2;-cat signaling is initiated at the basolateral cell surface. The existing anti-Fz antibodies are, similarly, not sensitive enough to detect endogenous levels of Fz protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Krasnow1">Krasnow and Adler 1994</xref>), but green fluorescent protein (GFP)&#x02013;tagged Fz (Fz1-GFP) expressed under the control of a ubiquitous promoter shows apical localization in pupal wings and larval eye discs during PCP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Strutt1">Strutt 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Strutt3">Strutt et al. 2002</xref>). All PCP molecules analyzed (Dsh, Flamingo &#x0005b;Fmi; a.k.a. Starry Night&#x0005d;, Strabismus &#x0005b;a.k.a. Van Gogh&#x0005d;, Prickle, and Diego ) are also localized in the apical region of pupal wings and eye epithelia (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Strutt2">Strutt 2003</xref>). Importantly, the apical localization of many PCP genes is lost in mutants of Fz1/PCP signaling components, suggesting that Fz/PCP signaling regulates apical localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Axelrod1">Axelrod 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Feiguin1">Feiguin et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Shimada1">Shimada et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Strutt1">Strutt 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Bastock1">Bastock et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Jenny1">Jenny et al. 2003</xref>).</p><p>Thus, as Fz1 and Fz2 show different subcellular membrane localization within the apical&#x02013;basal axis, we have here extended our analysis of Fz1 and Fz2 to determine whether the specific subcellular localization is important for signaling readout and to identify the molecular aspects responsible for the localization differences. Our data indicate that localization to apical junction complexes promotes Fz/PCP signaling and inhibits canonical Wg/&#x003b2;-cat signaling, and that the subcellular localization of Fz receptors is mediated through sequences in the cytoplasmic tail (C-tail). In addition, we show that the seven-pass transmembrane region contains elements that are critical for PCP signaling. Based on our data, we propose a model in which subcellular localization, possibly through the association of Fz with other membrane proteins such as coreceptors, is a critical aspect in regulating the signaling readout and specificity within the Wnt/Fz signaling pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Different Subcellular Localization of Fz and Fz2 in Imaginal Disc Epithelia</title><p>To confirm that Fz1 is localized apically, we analyzed Fz1 distribution in third instar larval discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020158-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Similar to previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Strutt1">Strutt 2001</xref>), we found that a ubiquitously expressed Fz1-GFP is always enriched at apical junctions (although the expression in third instar larval discs is weaker than in pupal wings; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020158-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Expression of a Myc-tagged Fz1 under <italic>dpp-Gal4</italic> control also displays a strong enrichment in the apical region of the disc epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020158-g001">Figure 1</xref>C&#x02013;1F) and in some punctae that appear to be intracellular vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020158-g001">Figure 1</xref>F). There are only low levels of Fz1 detected basolaterally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020158-g001">Figure 1</xref>F; unpublished data). Apical Fz1 largely colocalizes with DE-Cadherin (DE-Cad; a marker for adherens junctions; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020158-g001">Figure 1</xref>D), whereas it only slightly overlaps with Discs large (Dlg) staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020158-g001">Figure 1</xref>E; Dlg is localized to septate junctions just basally to adherens junctions &#x0005b;reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Tepass1">Tepass et al. 2001</xref>&#x0005d;). This Fz1 localization pattern is very similar to the PCP factor Strabismus/Vang, which also largely colocalizes with DE-Cad, and only slightly with Dlg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Bellaiche1">Bellaiche et al. 2004</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these data suggest that Fz1 is mostly localized at adherens junctions.

As only Fz1 can signal effectively in the Fz/PCP pathway and other PCP proteins also show apical localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Strutt2">Strutt 2003</xref>), we speculate that apical Fz1 localization is an important feature of signaling specificity.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>The C-Tail of Fz Family Receptors Controls Subcellular Localization</title><p>As Fz1 and Fz2 show different subcellular localization, we wished to determine which domains or sequences within the receptors are responsible for the specific localization. To address this question, we examined the localization of Fz1/2 chimeric receptor proteins (expressed under the control of <italic>dpp-Gal4</italic>) in wing imaginal discs. Fz1 and Fz2 were subdivided into three parts: (1) the N-terminal Wnt-interacting cysteine-rich domain (CRD), (2) the remaining proximal extracellular domain and 7 transmembrane region and loop region (collectively referred to as 7-TM), and (3) the intracellular C-tail. All chimeric proteins were Myc-tagged between the CRD and 7-TM region (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) and labeled with three digits (separated by dashes) corresponding to the three domains of Fz1/2, with &#x0201c;1&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;2&#x0201d; reflecting Fz1 and Fz2 origin, respectively.</p><p>In all cases tested, the hybrid Fz1/2 proteins carrying the C-tail of Fz1 were enriched apically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020158-g002">Figure 2</xref>), comparable to wild-type Fz1, and colocalized with apical junctional markers (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020158-g001">Figure 1</xref>; unpublished data).

In summary, these data indicate that the C-tails of Fz receptors are responsible for their specific subcellular localization.</p><p>To address whether subcellular localization correlates with specific Fz signaling events, we tested the signaling preferences of the respective chimeric receptors. This was analyzed in adult wings by scoring for either a PCP or canonical Wg-signaling gain-of-function (GOF) phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020158-g003">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020158-t001">Table 1</xref>).

This is consistent with the notion that hairs point away from regions of higher Fz signaling levels in the PCP context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Adler2">Adler et al. 1997</xref>). Expression of the chimeric Fz receptors showed that the presence of the Fz1 C-tail is necessary for a strong PCP GOF phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020158-g003">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020158-t001">Table 1</xref>), suggesting that the apical localization of Fz is important for normal PCP signaling.

The protein sequences of the Fz1 and Fz2 C-tails are homologous over the first 29 amino acids (45&#x00025; identity), but Fz2 is longer by an additional 61 amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020158-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The apical localization sequence could thus be located either in the nonconserved stretches within the common 29 residues, or within the Fz2 C-tail extension. We addressed both possibilities systematically and analyzed the localization of the respective mutants and their effects in the functional GOF assay in the wing (see above).</p><p>First, we mutated several Fz1&#x02013;1-1&#x02013;specific residues to those of Fz2, or deleted conserved amino acid stretches within the Fz1&#x02013;1-1 C-tail (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020158-g004">Figure 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020158-t001">Table 1</xref> for specific mutations analyzed).

Whereas Fz1&#x02013;1-2 and Fz1&#x02013;2-2 are ubiquitously localized, both Fz1&#x02013;1-2S and Fz1&#x02013;2-2S localize apically to adherens junctions, in a manner indistinguishable from that of Fz1&#x02013;1-1 and Fz1&#x02013;2-1 (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020158-g004">Figure 4</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020158-g004">4</xref>D to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020158-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020158-g002">2</xref>E).

In wing epithelia with overexpressed Fz1&#x02013;1-1 or Fz2&#x02013;1-1, much more Dsh-GFP is recruited apically in cells expressing the Fz chimeras (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020158-g007">Figure 7</xref>E&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020158-g007">7</xref>H, posterior compartments). At the same time, Dsh-GFP levels are reduced in basolateral regions of these cells. These data suggest that Fz in adherens junctions (apical) is trapping Dsh there, depleting it away from Wnt/&#x003b2;cat signaling components located possibly more basally and thus reducing canonical Wnt signaling.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the effect of reducing <italic>dsh</italic> gene dosage in <italic>en-Gal4/UAS-fz1&#x02013;1-1</italic> flies, where wing notching and loss of marginal hairs is mild (21&#x00025; of wings have large areas of margin bristles missing; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020158-g007">Figure 7</xref>A; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020158-t002">Table 2</xref>).

As Fz1&#x02013;1-2 is ubiquitously localized along the apical&#x02013;basal axis, recruiting of Dsh by such chimeras should not have an adverse effect on canonical Wg signaling. In contrast, when Fz2&#x02013;1-1 and Fz2&#x02013;2-1 are expressed (with <italic>en-Gal4</italic>) we observe very strong wing notching effects and a general reduction of the posterior wing compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020158-g007">Figure 7</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020158-g007">7</xref>D; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020158-t002">Table 2</xref>). This can be explained as follows. As the Fz2 ligand-binding CRD has a much higher affinity for Wg than the Fz1 CRD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020158-Rulifson1">Rulifson et al. 2000</xref>), the strong dominant negative behavior of Fz2&#x02013;1-1 and Fz2&#x02013;2-1 can be explained by adverse effects on both Dsh and Wg: Fz2&#x02013;1-1 and Fz2&#x02013;2-1 have a high-affinity Wg-binding CRD (sequestering Wg efficiently) and can trap Dsh at junctional complexes as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020158-g007">Figure 7</xref>E&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020158-g007">7</xref>H), making large pools of Wg and Dsh unavailable for canonical signaling, and thus causing a strong dominant negative effect.</p><p>In summary, the dominant negative effect of the overexpression of Fz1&#x02013;1-1, Fz2&#x02013;1-1, and Fz2&#x02013;2-1 is caused by trapping Dsh into apical junctions, making it unavailable for canonical Wnt/&#x003b2;cat signaling, and, when present, the Fz2 CRD enhances this effect by also sequestering Wg to these complexes. These results suggest that a Fz-Dsh complex in the apical junctions is largely incapable of canonical &#x003b2;-cat signaling, suggesting that the subcellular localization of Fz receptors contributes significantly to the signaling outcome and specificity (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have shown that Fz1 and Fz2 have different subcellular localizations within the wing imaginal epithelium.

It is difficult to determine how much of Fz1&#x02013;1-2 is actually localized to this membrane region. Since the immunohistochemical staining indicates that it is not excluded apically, we assume that Fz1&#x02013;1-2 has enough apical localization to participate when PCP signaling is initiated.

Thus, although the absolute activity of Fz1&#x02013;1-2 is reduced (based on weaker GOF phenotypes and weaker rescue of <italic>fz<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> in the eye), the relative difference might be sufficient for the partial rescue.</p><p>In this context, it is worth noting that <italic>tub-fz1&#x02013;1-2</italic> rescues the <italic>fz<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> phenotype better in the wing than in the eye, whereas there is no apparent difference in rescue activity between the eye and the wing for <italic>tub-fz1&#x02013;1-1</italic> or <italic>tub-fz1&#x02013;1-2S</italic>.

Note that both chimeras localize apically (C and D), and Fz1&#x02013;1-2S shows a strong PCP GOF phenotype (H), very similar to Fz1&#x02013;1-1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020158-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). Fz1&#x02013;2-2S shows only a very weak PCP phenotype (G), mainly occurring at an anterior distal region of the wing (marked by arrow; the rest of the wing is wild-type). (E) Subcellular localization of Fz1&#x02013;1-1C2. Fz1&#x02013;1-1C2 is Fz1 with the addition of the Fz2-specific tail extension (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Note ubiquitous protein localization within the apical&#x02013;basal axis (E) and a much reduced PCP activity, as compared to wild-type Fz1&#x02013;1-1, in the functional assay (I). The phenotype is much weaker than in wild-type Fz1 (compare with &#x0005b;F&#x0005d; and &#x0005b;H&#x0005d; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020158-g003">Figure 3</xref>B).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0020158.g004"/></fig><fig id="pbio-0020158-g005" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Rescue of the <italic>fz<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> Eye Phenotype with <italic>tub</italic>-Promoter-Driven Fz Chimeras</title><p>Tangential eye sections with corresponding schematic in lower part of panel reflecting ommatidial polarity (respective genotypes are also marked below each panel).
