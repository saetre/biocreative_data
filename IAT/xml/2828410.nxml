They comprise membrane- and secretory-type proteins. We recently reported the gene and protein characterization of the bovine secreted protein of Ly-6 domain 1 (SOLD1). Bovine SOLD1 is expressed in trophoblast mononucleate cells (TMCs) and is localized in the cotyledonary mesenchyme. Here, we compared the expression and functionality of SOLD1 among the ruminants. We examined mRNA expression by chorionic fibroblasts as a measure of one of the SOLD1 functions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Ovine and caprine SOLD1 mRNAs have 303 bp open reading frames and encode for deduced SOLD1 proteins with 100 amino acids, including a 22-aa-long signal peptide at the N-terminal. Both of the SOLD1 amino acid sequences have high similarities with the bovine sequence. Both SOLD1 mRNAs were also expressed in TMCs of cotyledons and intercotyledonary membranes. The mature SOLD1 proteins were localized in the mesenchymal villi of cotyledons after secretion. Bovine, ovine and caprine SOLD1 affected gene expression in mesenchymal fibroblasts <italic>in vitro</italic>; nucleoredoxin expression was upregulated and BCL2-like 13 was downregulated. Thus, we suggest that SOLD1 acts as a modulator of cell proliferation and apoptosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Expressing cells and protein localization of SOLD1 coincided among the three ruminants. SOLD1 participated in regulating nucleoredoxin and BCL2-like 13 expression in chorionic fibroblasts. SOLD1 is produced specifically in the cotyledons and intercotyledonary membranes in ruminants and appears to be involved in the construction of the ruminant placenta.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>We recently reported bovine secreted protein of Ly-6 (lymphocyte antigen-6, Ly-6/urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor, uPAR) domain 1, SOLD1, as a lining protein that might participate in the formation of cotyledonary villi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Ruminants such as cattle, sheep and goats, have a cotyledonary placenta. Here we aimed to explore the expression of SOLD1 in sheep and goat placentas and to clarify its roles in the ruminant placenta. We examined gene regulation of chorionic fibroblasts cultured with SOLD1 <italic>in vitro</italic>. We also compared SOLD1 protein characterization and roles among sheep, goats and cattle.</p><p>The Ly-6 domain is a 70-100 amino acid (aa) long protein characterized by a conserved pattern of 8-10 cysteine residues with a defined pattern of disulfide bonding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The Ly-6 superfamily comprises membrane type glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins and secreted proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The secreted members lack a GPI-anchor, such as the secreted LY6/PLAUR domain containing 1 (SLURP1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], Ly6/neurotoxin 1 (LYNX1, SLURP2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], acrosomal vesicle protein 1 (ACRV1, SP10) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], protein expressed in prostate and testis (PATE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and secreted seminal vesicle Ly6 protein (Sslp-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Genes for these proteins are found mainly in male reproductive tissues, such as the prostate, testis and spermatozoa. In contrast, bovine SOLD1 is exclusively found in female reproductive tissues and was confirmed in the placenta and the intercotyledonary membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. No expression of SOLD1 orthologs has been reported in human or mouse placentas.

The sequence deduced from <italic>SOLD1 </italic>cDNAs had 100 aa. The <italic>N</italic>-terminal 22-aa-long regions of both SOLD1 proteins were rich in hydrophobic aa residues characteristic of a signal peptide (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The <italic>SOLD1 </italic>mRNA and deduced mature regions of aa sequences in the three ruminants (ovine, caprine and bovine) were highly homologous at 81-95% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The sequences had 10 cysteines (Cys) and this configuration was identified in all three proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). There was a range of 31-71% homology among SOLD1s with rat urinary proteins (Rup-1, Rup-2, Rup-3), rat spleen protein-1 (Rsp-1), porcine protein-1 (PIP-1), mouse Sslp-1 and the <italic>C</italic>-terminal regions of ACRV1 from some species, using domain alignment on data from the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) web site <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clustalw.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/top-e.html">http://clustalw.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/top-e.html</ext-link> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Although low homologies in the aa sequences were demonstrated between the Ly-6 domains, the characteristic Cys configuration was intact among all Ly-6 domains in these proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The numbers of potential <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation sites (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) of each ruminant SOLD1 differed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Thus, ovSOLD1 had two consensus sequences at positions 32-34 and 81-83. By contrast, caSOLD1 had only one consensus sequence at position 32-34 and bovine (bo) SOLD1 had three consensus sequences at positions 32-34, 60-62 and 81-83. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the ovine, caprine and bovine SOLD1 proteins and porcine PIP-1 were phylogenetic neighbors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>).

These expression features of the genes and proteins are identical to that found in the bovine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. We predict that the SOLD1 protein must have specific functions for ruminants, because no homologous protein has been found in the human or mouse to date. The cotyledonary mesenchyme is mainly composed of extracellular matrix, mesodermal fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells. We have reported that boSOLD1 is secreted to the basolateral surface in trophoblast and is mainly bound to a tetrapeptide of type I collagen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. It has been suggested that SOLD1 is an essential protein for cotyledonary formation. However, the physiological role of SOLD1 is still unknown. Here, we investigated the effect of SOLD1 on gene expression in BCFs. NXN is a thioredoxin (TRX) family protein and mainly suppresses the Wnt-beta-catenin pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Its effect is to suppress cell proliferation. BCL2L13 is a pro-apoptotic BCL2 family member [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and its expression promotes apoptosis. We found here that <italic>NXN </italic>expression was upregulated in BCFs by exposure to ovSOLD1, caSOLD1 or boSOLD1 and this is likely to suppress their proliferation. In contrast, <italic>BCL2L13 </italic>was downregulated in BCFs by exposure to ovSOLD1 or boSOLD1 and this is likely to suppress apoptosis. We suggest that SOLD1 acts as a modulator of proliferation and apoptosis in chorionic fibroblasts. We also expect that SOLD1 will show a similar role among the ruminants. It is known that Lypd6, SLURP1, LYNX1 and the PATE family are ligands of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) in the secreted Ly-6 family of several tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. This receptor regulates sodium and calcium ion channels. If SOLD1 acts as a ligand of nAChR it is likely that the expression levels of <italic>NXN </italic>and <italic>BCL2L13 </italic>are regulated via such ion channel pathways.</p><p>The trophoblast cells of the ruminant placenta are divided into BNCs and TMCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. BNCs account for approximately 20% of the total trophoblast cell population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. They are directly involved in modification of the uterine epithelium beginning at implantation and continuing until term. BNC products, such as placental lactogen, pregnancy-associated glycoproteins and steroid hormones, are not restricted in terms of their direction of secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Hence, the BNCs play a pivotal role in fetal-maternal communication in ruminants. TMCs are a source of interferon-tau (IFNT), which participates in the recognition of gestation during the peri-implantation period in ruminants. Thus the production of IFNT is a specific role of TMCs. However, other roles of placental TMCs are obscure. One function might be the production of SOLD1 proteins to develop villi. The matrix metalloproteinases, MMP2 and MMP9, are also produced by ruminant TMCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In the human syncytiotrophoblast, MMP2 and MMP9 are secreted to the basolateral surface of the cells and modify the basement membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This is similar to the secretion property of SOLD1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. TMCs have polarity and this might be related to the production of a protein involved in determining the direction of secretion.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we have identified two sheep and goat secreted proteins, ovSOLD1 and caSOLD1, each composed only of the Ly-6 domain and a signal peptide. Both types of <italic>SOLD1 </italic>mRNA appeared in TMCs throughout gestation and their proteins were localized in the mesenchyme of primary and secondary placental villi. Phylogenetic configuration, expression and protein localization were similar among the ruminant SOLD1 proteins and bovine SOLD1 orthologs are found in the sheep and goat. As for the physiological role of SOLD1, which is unknown for cattle, we examined the effects of SOLD1 on BCFs. SOLD1 might be one of the main factors for modulating and establishing the villous mesenchyme in ruminants through the regulation of <italic>NXN </italic>and <italic>BCL2L13 </italic>expression in chorionic fibroblasts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals and tissue collection</title><p>Placental tissues for cDNA cloning, mRNA quantitative expression, <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization and immunohistochemistry were collected from Corriedale sheep and Japanese Saanen goats.

The resulting relative increase in reporter fluorescent dye emission was monitored in real time using an Mx3000P QPCR system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). The relative differences in the initial amounts of each cDNA species were determined by comparing the threshold cycle (C<sub>T</sub>) values. Standard curves for each gene were generated by serial dilution of each plasmid containing the corresponding cDNA to quantify the mRNA concentrations. We confirmed the dissociation curve for detecting the SYBR Green-based objective amplicon, because SYBR Green also detects any double-stranded DNA including primer dimers, contaminating DNA and PCR products from misannealed primers.
