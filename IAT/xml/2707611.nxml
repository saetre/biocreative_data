The mortality rate would be reduced with an early detection marker. The folate receptor alpha (FR&#x003b1;) is one logical choice for a biomarker because of its prevalent overexpression in ovarian cancer and its exclusive expression in only a few normal tissues. In prior work, it was observed that patients with ovarian cancer had elevated serum levels of a protein that bound to a FR&#x003b1;-specific monoclonal antibody relative to healthy individuals. However, it was not shown that the protein detected was intact functional FR&#x003b1;. In the current study, the goal was to determine whether ovarian cancer patients (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;30) had elevated serum levels of a fully functional intact FR&#x003b1; compared to matched healthy controls (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;30).</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>FR&#x003b1; levels in serum were analyzed by two methods, immunoblotting analysis and a radiolabeled folic acid-based microfiltration binding assay. Using the immunoassay, we observed that levels of FR&#x003b1; were higher in serum of ovarian cancer patients as compared to controls. Similar results were also observed using the microfiltration binding assay, which showed that the circulating FR&#x003b1; is functional. Importantly, we also found that the levels of FR&#x003b1; were comparable between early and advanced stage patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results demonstrate that ovarian cancer patients have elevated levels of functional intact FR&#x003b1;.

The majority of patients with ovarian cancer present with advanced disease (stages III&#x02013;IV) and have a 5-year survival of typically &#x0003c;30&#x00025;. The fact that survival of patients with stages I&#x02013;II disease ranges from 60&#x00025;&#x02013;90&#x00025;, depending on tumor grade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006292-Jemal1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006292-Trimbos1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> suggests the potential for a high cure rate with earlier disease detection. Since physical symptoms are absent in early stages of ovarian cancer, efforts are being made to develop assays for blood or tissue biomarkers.</p><p>Although the serum CA-125, an ovarian cell surface glycoprotein (i.e. a mucin) of unknown biological significance, is elevated in &#x0003e;80&#x00025; of patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer, this marker has a positive predictive value of &#x0003c;10&#x00025; in early stage disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006292-Mor1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, CA-125 is also associated with various non-malignant conditions, such as pregnancy, endometriosis, adenomyosis, uterine fibroids, pelvic inflammatory disease, menstruation, and benign ovarian cysts. CA-125 is also associated with other malignant conditions such as pancreatic, breast, lung, gastric, and colonic cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006292-Cannistra1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Although the CA-125 is helpful in the follow-up of the patient's chemotherapy and in detecting early relapse in patients with already known ovarian cancers, it is not useful for identifying early stage disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006292-Fields1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The folate receptor &#x003b1; (FR&#x003b1;), a 38&#x02013;40 kDa molecule, is a well characterized member of the folate receptor (FR) family with high affinity for folates. FR&#x003b1; is anchored to cell membranes through a glycosylphosphatidylinositol moiety and transports folates via an endocytic process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006292-Kamen1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. FR&#x003b1; exhibits limited normal tissue distribution, with measurable expression restricted to the apical surfaces of a few epithelia, predominantly in the lung, kidney, and choroid plexus, but is overexpressed in a spectrum of solid tumors, including ovarian cancer, non small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, kidney cancer and in high-grade osteosarcoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006292-Bueno1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006292-Yang1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. This over-expression of high affinity FR&#x003b1; in some cancers may have arisen to meet cellular requirements for DNA synthesis and growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006292-Kelemen1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In addition to its cell surface localization, FR&#x003b1; can also be shed into the blood. Shedding was initially identified during the development of the folate radioligand binding assays which used purified cell-free FR as a binding protein. In these studies it was noted that there was often a large discrepancy in the assessment of total serum folate when assayed after heat extraction as compared to native serum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006292-Kamen2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. When shed, FR&#x003b1; will bind circulating folate, since the affinity is in the nM range. Now it is well understood that shedding complicates the interpretation of serum folate assays and possibly masks the presence of functional receptor unless an acid treatment is employed to release the endogenous folate and allow FR&#x003b1; saturation with the radiolabeled folic acid. This discrepancy in folic acid levels between native and heat extracted serum led to the identification of circulating FR&#x003b1; in some samples of umbilical cord blood and in some of the maternal serum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006292-Kamen3">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Importantly, FR&#x003b1; released from normal epithelial cells should not contribute to FR&#x003b1; levels in the serum, since the receptor is invariably localized to the apical surface of a polarized epithelium where its shedding will deliver the free receptor into a lumen that naturally drains from the body through its own orifice.</p><p>Recent studies suggest that FR&#x003b1; may also be shed into the blood from tumors, which offers an opportunity to access and measure it as a tumor marker of early stage cancer. The prevalent expression of FR&#x003b1; in ovarian cancer, among all stages, has stimulated interest in applying it as a therapeutic target and biomarker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006292-Kalli1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. The goal of the current study was to determine if intact functional FR&#x003b1; is shed into the circulation and to evaluate its potential as a circulating biomarker. This goal is supported by prior work which showed that ovarian cancer patients have elevated levels of a serum protein that react with anti-FR&#x003b1; antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006292-Mantovani1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. What remained to be answered was whether the antibodies detected whole FR&#x003b1; and whether the detected protein was a functional folate receptor (FR). Thus, in the present study, the levels of circulating FR&#x003b1; in the blood of patients with ovarian cancer were examined using a <sup>3</sup>H-FA-based microfiltration assay which was developed to detect functional FR&#x003b1;. Additionally, an immunoblot assay was employed to confirm the presence of the specific whole FR&#x003b1; protein. As will be shown, ovarian cancer patients demonstrate elevated levels of FR&#x003b1; in the circulation supporting its potential use as a disease biomarker.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The Mayo Clinic IRB approved the study and written informed consent was obtained from all the subjects.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Subjects</title><p>Each ovarian cancer case was first matched to a female control on blood draw within 6 months (all 30 cases matched successfully), and then age within 5 years.

As shown in a representative example experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006292-g001"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>, the microfilter assay could detect FA binding in a volume as little as 10 &#x000b5;l. However above 20 &#x000b5;l of serum, it was found that the microfilters did not always readily drain. Thus, a standard volume of 10&#x02013;20 &#x000b5;l was used for cases and controls.</p><p>Although prior work had used 30 KD cutoff filters for measuring FR&#x003b1; in tissue samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006292-Parker1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, there was a concern that some loss may have arisen as a consequence of a variation in pore size, resulting in the presence of some filter pores that would allow passage of the 38 KDa FR&#x003b1;. Therefore, tests were done comparing 30 KD and 10 KD cutoff filters. In general, there were only minor differences. For example, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006292-g001"><bold>Figure 1C</bold></xref>, there was no remarkable difference in the bound FA when using KB cell lysates of KB supernatants. In contrast, small increases were consistently observed in serum samples when using the 10 KD cutoff filters. Thus, the 10 KD cutoff was used to measure FR&#x003b1; in the sera of cases and controls.</p><p>In an effort to corroborate the microfiltration results, an immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting method was established. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006292-g001"><bold>Figure 1D</bold></xref>, FR&#x003b1; can be immunoprecipitated from sera (100 &#x000b5;l) and immunoblotted resulting in detection of the 38 KD FR&#x003b1;. Overall, these results show that the microfiltration assay can be used to detect FR&#x003b1; in small sera samples. Further, immunoblotting analysis reveals the presence of intact full-length FR&#x003b1;.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Patients with untreated ovarian cancer have elevated mean levels of circulating FR&#x003b1; as compared to matched controls</title><p>Patient (i.e. cases) characteristics are detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0006292-t001">Table 1</xref>.

However, of the three tumors (1 serous borderline and 2 mucinous borderline) with low tumor-associated FR&#x003b1;, only 1 mucinous borderline demonstrated low circulating FR&#x003b1; levels.

Hence, ovarian cancer presents at advanced stage in &#x0223c;70&#x00025; of patients. The biomarkers in use today are not adequate for detection of early stage cancer. Therefore, it is not surprising that ovarian cancer is the number one cause of death among all of the gynecological malignancies in recent years. Currently available markers CA-125 and proteomic profiles lack sensitivity, specificity and/or reproducibility. There is clear need for diagnostic markers to detect ovarian cancer at early stages. A molecule expressed nearly exclusively in pathogenic tissue would make an ideal biomarker and one such promising candidate is folate receptor (FR-&#x003b1;). FR-&#x003b1; is highly overexpressed in the vast majority of ovarian cancers but exhibits limited expression in tissues that are responsible for whole body retention of folates (e.g., the placenta, choroid plexus and kidney). In the current study, we tested whether it was feasible to detect circulating FR&#x003b1; in ovarian cancer patients and whether the circulating FR&#x003b1; was full-length and functional.</p><p>Our data show that patients with ovarian cancer have elevated levels of FR&#x003b1; relative to healthy controls. These results suggest that circulating FR&#x003b1; could potentially be developed as a biomarker. The increased levels of FR&#x003b1; in early stage disease indicates that upregulation of FR&#x003b1; may occur early in ovarian carcinogenesis in some patients. Indeed, Toffoli and colleagues found that nearly 79&#x00025; of patients with early stage (I and II) ovarian cancer overexpressed FR&#x003b1;, which was essentially identical to the proportion of advanced stage patients that had FR&#x003b1; expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006292-Toffoli1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. We observed in our studies that levels of circulating FR&#x003b1; in early stage patients was not different than advanced stage patients. However, Toffoli and colleagues found that while the proportion was similar, the levels of FR&#x003b1; on the tumor were significantly higher in the advanced stage patients. The lack of correlation may indicate that there are other factors regulating serum levels. For example, Mantovani and colleagues found that normal human urine samples were strongly positive for FR&#x003b1; immune reactivity, suggesting that there is a mechanism for its rapid kidney clearance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006292-Mantovani1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Since the proximal tubules of the kidney strongly express the protein, one might conclude that the kidney has a well developed strategy to eliminate FR&#x003b1; to prevent it from accumulating in the blood and preventing FA uptake into tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006292-Parker1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. This is supported in kinetic murine modeling studies which have shown that as the tumor progresses, rise in urine levels of FR&#x003b1; precede sera levels considerably <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006292-Mantovani1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Intact FR&#x003b1; is a 38 kDa protein and in our immunoblot assay, anti-MOv18/ZEL antibody detected a protein at the same molecular weight. Furthermore, we showed that the microfiltration assay detected functional protein, which taken together suggests that FR&#x003b1; shed by ovarian cancer is intact and functional. The presence of FR&#x003b1; in the circulation of patients has therapeutic significance as a number of therapies have been developed that target cell surface FR&#x003b1; in cancer patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006292-Low1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. These circulating FRs may bind and interfere with clinical efficacy. This might explain high failure rates observed in some FR&#x003b1;-directed immunotherapies in patients with ovarian cancer. For example, Kershaw and colleagues developed an approach in which autologous T cells from patients were gene-modified with a chimeric receptor that contained a FR&#x003b1;-specific single chain antibody coupled to the Fc receptor gamma chain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006292-Kershaw1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. While the cells secreted IFN-&#x003b3; in response to FR&#x003b1;, they failed to localize to tumor site, a failure that may be explained by circulating FR&#x003b1; which saturated the chimeric receptors. Therefore, analysis of circulating FR&#x003b1; in cancer patients might help in determining levels of anti-FR&#x003b1; targeted chimeric receptors needed for successful therapy. In addition, we also found that elevated circulating FR&#x003b1; was functional, suggesting potential interference with a number of folic acid-conjugated drug therapies that have been developed that require a functional binding site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006292-Low1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, One of the difficulties, however, in measuring serum levels of FR&#x003b1; is the lack of a quality assay. While our binding assays were able to detect a difference between cases and controls, the results obtained suggest that immunoblotting assay may be potentially more useful in detecting elevated levels. However, like with any blotting assay, the utility is limited by its technical complexity (i.e. immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting) and the results with this assay are only semi-quantitative.</p><p>In conclusion, our results demonstrate that ovarian cancer patients, including those with early disease, have elevated levels of functional intact FR&#x003b1; as compared to healthy controls. With further development, including larger early stage ovarian cancer sample sizes and improved assay performance, the use of FR&#x003b1; as a biomarker for ovarian cancer may be feasible.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Dr. Linda E.
