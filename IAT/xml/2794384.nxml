Previous work from our laboratory identified the PI3K/Akt pathway and SHIP as critical modulators of host resistance to <italic>Francisella</italic>. Here, we show that SHIP expression is strongly down-regulated in monocytes and macrophages following infection with <italic>F. tularensis novicida</italic> (<italic>F.n.</italic>). To account for this negative regulation we explored the possibility that microRNAs (miRs) that target SHIP may be induced during infection. There is one miR that is predicted to target SHIP, miR-155. We tested for induction and found that <italic>F.n.</italic> induced miR-155 both in primary monocytes/macrophages and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Using luciferase reporter assays we confirmed that miR-155 led to down-regulation of SHIP, showing that it specifically targets the SHIP 3&#x02032;UTR. Further experiments showed that miR-155 and <italic>BIC</italic>, the gene that encodes miR-155, were induced as early as four hours post-infection in primary human monocytes. This expression was dependent on TLR2/MyD88 and did not require inflammasome activation. Importantly, miR-155 positively regulated pro-inflammatory cytokine release in human monocytes infected with <italic>Francisella</italic>. In sharp contrast, we found that the highly virulent type A SCHU S4 strain of <italic>Francisella tularensis</italic> (<italic>F.t.</italic>) led to a significantly lower miR-155 response than the less virulent <italic>F.n.</italic> Hence, <italic>F.n.</italic> induces miR-155 expression and leads to down-regulation of SHIP, resulting in enhanced pro-inflammatory responses. However, impaired miR-155 induction by SCHU S4 may help explain the lack of both SHIP down-regulation and pro-inflammatory response and may account for the virulence of Type A <italic>Francisella</italic>.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Francisella tularensis</italic> is a highly infectious Gram-negative bacterium that infects phagocytic cells of the immune system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008508-Lofgren1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008508-Clemens1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Although Gram-negative, <italic>Francisella</italic> presents a modified form of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that only minimally activates TLR4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008508-Hajjar1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008508-Gunn1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

Understanding these host responses and how <italic>Francisella</italic> undermines them is critical for our ability to successfully prevent and treat infection.</p><p>One important response downstream of TLR stimulation is activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008508-Parsa2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008508-Rajaram1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Our laboratory has shown that PI3K/Akt activation is host-protective against <italic>Francisella</italic>, as mice expressing a macrophage-specific, constitutively-active form of Akt are protected from an otherwise-lethal challenge compared to wild-type littermates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008508-Rajaram1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Expectedly, the PI3K/Akt pathway is subject to negative regulation and one of the key regulators is SHIP, which we have also found to be important during <italic>Franciesella</italic> infection. Murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) lacking SHIP display increased NF&#x003ba;B activity and enhanced cytokine production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008508-Parsa2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, similar to the responses seen with constitutively active Akt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008508-Rajaram1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. More recently we have found that the loss of SHIP or constitutive activation of Akt promotes phagosome-lysosome fusion of <italic>Francisella</italic> in macrophages. Thus this pathway is important for intracellular control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008508-Rajaram2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008508-Santic1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Collectively, these findings implicate the PI3K/Akt pathway and SHIP as critical regulators of the host-response to <italic>Francisella</italic>.</p><p>While studying the role of SHIP during <italic>Francisella</italic> infection, we found that infection with the less virulent <italic>F.n.</italic> leads to SHIP down-regulation. In a search for mechanisms to explain this, we entertained the possibility that microRNAs may play a role. In fact during the preparation of this manuscript it was reported that SHIP is targeted by a microRNA, miR-155 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008508-OConnell1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. MiRs are a recently-discovered means of regulating both transcript and protein levels of specific genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008508-Carrington1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. They are processed yet non-translated RNA molecules of approximately 22 base pairs in length that primarily target the 3&#x02032;untranslated region (UTR) of mRNA transcripts in a sequence-specific manner. Recent reports show that treatment with TLR ligands can induce miR-146 and miR-155 expression within macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008508-Taganov1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008508-OConnell2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.

We used the online bioinformatics program TargetScan (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.targetscan.org">http://www.targetscan.org</ext-link>) to identify potential miRs that may regulate SHIP. The program identified miR-155 as the sole predicted miR to bind SHIP on its 3&#x02032; UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008508-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). To assess the ability of miR-155 to specifically target the 3&#x02032;UTR of SHIP we performed dual-luciferase reporter assays. For this, an <italic>f-luc</italic> luciferase reporter alone (psiCHECK) or the same reporter with the 3&#x02032;UTR of SHIP (psiCHECK-INPP5D) were separately transfected into chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine 2000. To control for differences in transfection efficiency a pRL-CMV <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase construct was co-transfected with the psiCHECK vectors. To test the effect of miR-155 on expression of the transfected SHIP 3&#x02032; UTR reporter, synthetic miR-155 or scrambled miR were co-transfected into the cells at concentrations ranging from 10 nM to 50 nM. At 48 hours post-transfection cells were washed and lysed. Dual-luciferase activity in the transfectants was then measured. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008508-g001">Figure 1E</xref>, the introduction of miR-155 suppressed the luciferase activity of psiCHECK-INPP5D but not of psiCHECK alone, indicating that miR-155 targeted the 3&#x02032; UTR of SHIP. As an additional control, cells were transfected with psiCHECK-INPP5D followed by a scrambled miR, and these showed no decrease in luciferase production.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>MiR-155 Is Induced In Vitro and In Vivo in Response to <italic>F.n.</italic> Infection</title><p>Having established that SHIP is down-regulated during <italic>F.n.</italic> infection and that miR-155 is a negative regulator of SHIP, we next examined whether mature miR-155 and <italic>BIC</italic>, the non-protein coding gene that encodes miR-155 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008508-Eis1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, mRNA were induced in infected cells.

Collectively, these results suggest that <italic>Francisella</italic>-induced miR-155 induction requires NF&#x003ba;B activation. This finding helps to explain why bacterial viability was required for maximal miR-155 induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008508-g003">Figure 3A&#x00026;B</xref>).

The earliest studies of pathogen-induced miR-155 expression examined the avian leukosis virus (ALV). It was found that ALV induced high levels of <italic>BIC</italic> expression in infected chickens and that this was highly correlated with B-cell lymphoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008508-Clurman1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008508-Tam1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the most intriguing relationship between miR-155 and viruses is that both the Kaposi's-scarcoma-associated herpes virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008508-Gottwein1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref> and the oncogenic Marek's disease virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008508-Zhao1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref> encode functional orthologs of miR-155. This suggests that miR-155 expression may actually benefit certain viruses, and one report has supported a role for miR-155 induction to maintain latent viral genomes through the negative regulation of an established miR-155 target, IKK&#x003b5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008508-Lu1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Deletion of miR-155 leads to system-wide changes in immune function. For example, B and T cell responses are compromised in mice genetically deleted for miR-155 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008508-Vigorito1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008508-Thai1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. MiR-155<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice vaccinated with tetanus toxin fragment C showed overall reduced IgM and switched antigen-specific antibody production from defects in B-cell function. MiR-155<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> T cells also showed impaired IL-2 and IFN&#x003b3; production after immunization. The T cells also exhibited a bias toward a T<sub>H</sub>2 response, possibly due to the targeting of <italic>c-Maf</italic>. Antigen presentation is also affected, as miR-155<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> dendritic cells were less able to activate T cells expressing a transgenic receptor for ovalbumin in the presence of that protein. Thus, miR-155 serves an essential role in multiple immune cell types.</p><p>Here, we examined the role of miR-155 in monocytes and macrophages within the context of host response to bacterial pathogens. Previous studies demonstrated that PI3K/Akt pathway is host-protective against <italic>Francisella</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008508-Rajaram1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> and the finding that SHIP negatively regulates this pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008508-Parsa2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> led us to study the intricacies of SHIP regulation during <italic>Francsiella</italic> infection. As the currently-known regulators of SHIP did not seem to account for all of the changes seen in SHIP expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008508-Mehta1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, we examined the possibility that microRNAs may play a role. We found that monocytes and macrophages express miR-155 in response to <italic>Francisella</italic> infection and that this down-regulated SHIP. During preparation of this manuscript it was reported by O'Connell et al. that miR-155 can directly target SHIP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008508-OConnell1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data are consistent with their findings, so the importance of miR-155 induction in response to <italic>Francisella</italic> is well supported.</p><p>Multiple TLR ligands are capable of inducing miR-155 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008508-OConnell2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, so it is logical that miR-155 induction in response to <italic>F.n.</italic> requires TLR2 and MyD88. This finding is of considerable interest because while there are additional receptors that are engaged and are of importance in the host response to <italic>Francisella</italic>, such as the complement receptor and mannose receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008508-BenNasr1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008508-Clay1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, it appears that MyD88 and the TLR pathway is of critical importance for miR-155 induction. Downstream of MyD88 activation we found that ERK and JNK were partly required for miR-155 induction, which supports the finding by Yiu et al that found ERK- and JNK-dependent BCR induction of miR-155. In contrast to Yiu et al. but in agreement with Gatto et al. 2008, who used a viral protein to induce miR-155 in B-cells, we found that activation of NF&#x003ba;B was absolutely required for miR-155 induction by <italic>Francisella</italic>. It is then fitting that inhibition of PI3K blocked miR-155 induction, as PI3K controls NF&#x003ba;B activation in response to <italic>Francisella</italic>. Hence, it appears as though cell type, cellular context and/or the nature of stimulus may affect the intracellular machinery involved with miR-155 expression.</p><p>TNF&#x003b1; and IFN&#x003b2; are at least two cytokines produced during <italic>Francisella</italic> infection that may contribute to miR-155 induction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008508-OConnell2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. However, it has already been shown that these cytokines work through the TNF&#x003b1; receptor, while direct TLR stimulation can induce miR-155 independently of TNFR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008508-OConnell2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. This is likely the case with <italic>Francisella</italic>, as it has been shown to activate TLR2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008508-Katz1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Cytosolic sensing of <italic>Francisella</italic> by the inflammasome triggers multiple host response events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008508-Gavrilin1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008508-Henry1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Given that neither bacterial internalization nor caspase-1 was clearly required for miR-155 induction, we are lead to conclude that the cytosolic sensing of <italic>Francisella</italic> is of marginal importance and that the extracellular sensing via the TLR pathway is the driving force in miR-155 induction.</p><p>It is important to note that <italic>F.t.</italic> has been well established to inhibit host immune response. It has been shown in the mouse that <italic>F.t.</italic> does not elicit any inflammatory cytokine production from dendritic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008508-Bosio1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. We have previously found that <italic>F.t.</italic> does elicit some inflammatory cytokine production from monocytes, but to a far lesser degree than <italic>F.n.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008508-Butchar1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Just recently it has been reported that the difference in the ability of <italic>F.t.</italic> to induce inflammatory cytokine production between human dendritic cells and monocytes is due to differences in CD14 expression on these cells. So that monocytes which have high CD14 expression are capable of eliciting some response whereas dendritic cells are not <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008508-Chase1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. In any case, the ability of host cells to mount an effective immune response to <italic>F.t.</italic> is impaired by its highly subversive nature.</p><p>Finding that the less virulent <italic>F.n.</italic> can strongly induce miR-155 and down-regulate SHIP whereas the highly virulent <italic>F.t.</italic> elicits a suboptimal miR-155 response and an inability to down-regulate SHIP makes miR-155 of compelling interest for studies of host response to microbial pathogens. We have recently examined the mechanisms by which <italic>F.t.</italic> subverts host response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008508-Butchar1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> and found that it preferentially down-regulates both TLR2 and components of the PI3K/Akt pathway, whereas <italic>F.n.</italic> does not. This suggests a mechanism by which <italic>F.t.</italic> may prevent miR-155 induction, as TLR2 and PI3K/Akt are components of the miR-155 induction pathway by <italic>Francisella</italic>.</p><p>In the current study we found that miR-155 positively regulates TNF&#x003b1; and IL-6 production in response to <italic>Francisella</italic>. Given that miR-155 has been shown to target the negative regulator SHIP and that SHIP negatively regulates NF&#x003ba;B activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, we conclude that miR-155 is pro-inflammatory within the context of <italic>Francisella</italic> infection. Indeed, SHIP has already been shown to negatively regulate neutrophil responses to TLR2 activation via peptidoglycan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008508-Strassheim1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref> and macrophage responses to <italic>Francisella</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008508-Parsa2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Further, miR-155 over-expressing mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008508-OConnell3">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref> develop a similar myeloproliferative phenotype to that of SHIP<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008508-Helgason1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence, it appears that as with miR-155 expression itself, numerous specific factors can influence the nature of response to miR-155.</p><p>In conclusion, this report demonstrates that miR-155 is induced by <italic>Francisella</italic> and that the host response against this pathogen is enhanced through the targeting of SHIP by miR-155. Further, the differential induction of miR-155 by virulent versus less virulent <italic>Francisella</italic> subspecies suggests that differences in miR responses may at least partially explain the highly pathogenic nature of <italic>F.t.</italic> versus <italic>F.n.</italic> Further studies are required to determine the exact cause(s) of this differential response, such as whether it is completely attributable to TLR2 and PI3K/Akt regulation and if so, how these are down-regulated by the virulent <italic>Francisella</italic>. To our knowledge, this is the first study to describe differential regulation of miR-155 by two bacteria of the same subspecies. We find that miR-155 induction inversely correlates with virulence in human monocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell and Reagents</title><p>THP-1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA) and cultured in RPMI-1640 (Gibco-BRL, Rockville, MD) supplemented with 5&#x00025; heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone, Logan, UT), L-glutamine, penicillin (10,000 U/ml) and streptomycin (10,000 &#x000b5;g/ml) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
