Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of central nervous system damage in different neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease (PD). Various mutations in the <italic>DJ-1 </italic>(<italic>PARK7</italic>) gene have been shown to cause the autosomal recessive form of PD. In the present study South African PD patients were screened for mutations in <italic>DJ-1 </italic>and we aimed to investigate the functional significance of a novel 16 bp deletion variant identified in one patient.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The possible effect of the deletion on promoter activity was investigated using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter assay. The <italic>DJ-1 </italic>5'-UTR region containing the sequence flanking the 16 bp deletion was cloned into a pGL4.10-Basic luciferase-reporter vector and transfected into HEK293 and BE(2)-M17 neuroblastoma cells. Promoter activity under hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress conditions was also investigated. Computational (<italic>in silico</italic>) <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory analysis of <italic>DJ-1 </italic>promoter sequence was performed using the transcription factor-binding site database, TRANSFAC via the PATCH&#x02122; and rVISTA platforms.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A novel 16 bp deletion variant (g.-6_+10del) was identified in <italic>DJ-1 </italic>which spans the transcription start site and is situated 93 bp 3' from a Sp1 site. The deletion caused a reduction in luciferase activity of approximately 47% in HEK293 cells and 60% in BE(2)-M17 cells compared to the wild-type (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.0001), indicating the importance of the 16 bp sequence in transcription regulation. The activity of both constructs was up-regulated during oxidative stress. Bioinformatic analysis revealed putative binding sites for three transcription factors AhR, ARNT, HIF-1 within the 16 bp sequence. The frequency of the g.-6_+10del variant was determined to be 0.7% in South African PD patients (2 heterozygotes in 148 individuals).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the first report of a functional <italic>DJ-1 </italic>promoter variant, which has the potential to influence transcript stability or translation efficiency. Further work is necessary to determine the extent to which the g.-6_+10del variant affects the normal function of the <italic>DJ-1 </italic>promoter and whether this variant confers a risk for PD.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The <italic>DJ-1 </italic>gene (<italic>PARK7</italic>; OMIM 602533) was first described about a decade ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and encodes a 189 amino acid protein which belongs to the DJ-1/Thi/PfpI protein super family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. It is ubiquitously expressed in a variety of mammalian tissues including the brain, and was initially described in association with oncogenesis and male rat infertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Later it was shown to be associated with autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. A few PD-causing mutations have been identified including exon deletions, truncations, homozygous and heterozygous point mutations, which predominantly result in loss of function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The expression of DJ-1 in the central nervous system (CNS) is not restricted to specific anatomical or functional systems and it is located in neuronal and glial cells within the substantia nigra [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p><italic>DJ-1 </italic>is proposed to play a role in protecting neurons from oxidative stress and protecting against mitochondrial damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Oxidative stress can be defined as an imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and the antioxidant capacity of a cell. Mitochondrial dysfunction leading to increased ROS can cause damage to various cellular components such as unsaturated lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, and this has been implicated in various neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Recent studies aimed at elucidating the function of DJ-1, have found that it is able to undergo self oxidation in order to eliminate hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and, in so doing, acts as a scavenger of ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. An increase in susceptibility to oxidative stress of mammalian cells in cases where DJ-1 was knocked down has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]; cells were more susceptible to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced cell death due to DJ-1 knockdown and over-expression of wild-type DJ-1 rescued the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. It has been reported that DJ-1 is oxidatively damaged in the brains of PD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Studies showed that under oxidative stress conditions, DJ-1 undergoes a shift in its isoelectric point which leads to the accumulation of acidic isoforms in PD frontal cortex tissue compared to age-matched controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Up-regulation of DJ-1 as well as the intracellular redistribution of DJ-1 to the mitochondria under oxidative stress conditions has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The mitochondria have a central role in free radical generation and it has been proposed that DJ-1 in the mitochondria may have a role in preventing mitochondrial injury or decreasing mitochondrial ROS production. Redistribution of DJ-1 to the mitochondria might be the neuronal cellular defence mechanism against oxidative insults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p><italic>DJ-1 </italic>is highly conserved across diverse species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and there have been limited reports of sequence variants. An 18 bp insertion/deletion polymorphism (g.168_185del) in <italic>DJ-1</italic>'s promoter region has been reported to not confer a risk for PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, a homozygous duplication of this 18 bp sequence (g.168_185dup), as well as a homozygous E163K mutation, have been identified in an Italian family with a Parkinsonism-Dementia-Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The duplication and the E163K variants were not found in 1,400 and 500 control chromosomes, respectively. It has been reported that the E163K mutation compromises the ability of DJ-1 to protect against oxidative stress induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. It is not known whether the phenotype in this family was due to the g.168_185dup mutation or the E163K mutation, or both.</p><p>In the present study, we investigated the functional significance of a novel 16 bp deletion which we identified in the promoter region of <italic>DJ-1 </italic>in a PD patient by means of luciferase functional expression studies. Unlike the 18 bp insertion/deletion variant, the 16 bp deletion occurs in a transcriptionally important region of the gene as it spans the transcription start site.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study participants</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the Committee for Human Research at the University of Stellenbosch, South Africa (Protocol number 2002/C059). In the initial part of the study 30 unrelated South African PD patients were recruited with informed written consent from the Movement Disorders clinic at Tygerberg Hospital in South Africa. The patients were examined by a movement disorder specialist (JC) and all met the UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank Research criteria for diagnosis of PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Inclusion criteria for recruitment of patients were early onset and/or positive family history of PD. The average age at onset (AAO) of the study group was 43 years and ranged from 17 years to 77 years. The percentage of males in our study group was 66%. Once the 16 bp deletion variant was detected, the frequency of the variant was determined in a total of 148 unrelated South African PD patients (average AAO = 52 years). Blood samples for 62 controls representing the mixed ancestry ethnic group were recruited from unrelated blood donors at the South African Western Province Blood Transfusion Service blood collection clinics. The controls had been 'de-identified' and had not been clinically assessed for signs of PD.</p></sec><sec><title>Genetic analysis</title><p>The single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis method was used to screen the 30 PD patients for genetic variations in all 7 exons and the 5' UTR of <italic>DJ-1</italic>. Samples exhibiting altered mobilities on mildly-denaturing polyacrylamide gels (containing 5% glycerol and 15% urea) were sequenced in order to characterize the sequence variation. Direct sequencing was performed using the BigDye Terminator Sequence Ready Reaction kit version 3.1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA) and analysis was conducted on a 3130 xl Genetic Analyser (Applied Biosystems).</p></sec><sec><title>Construction of luciferase vectors</title><p>Functional analysis of a novel 16 bp deletion identified in the 5'-UTR was performed using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.promega.com/pGL4"/>. In this assay, the activities of the firefly (<italic>Photinus pyralis</italic>; the experimental reporter gene) and the <italic>Renilla </italic>(<italic>Renilla reniformis </italic>or sea pansy; the internal control gene) luciferases are measured sequentially from a single sample. The firefly luciferase gene is present on the promoterless pGL4.10 [<italic>luc2</italic>] vector and the <italic>Renilla </italic>luciferase gene is on the phRL-SV40 vector. The pGL4 luciferase reporter vector was used in this study because it has been codon optimized for more efficient expression in mammalian cells. The reporter gene and the vector backbone have been engineered to reduce the number of consensus transcription factor binding sites, which leads to reduced background luminescence and the risk of anomalous transcription. In this experiment the pGL4.10 [<italic>luc2</italic>] and phRL-SV40 vectors are used to co-transfect mammalian cells and due to their distinct evolutionary origins the activity of two luciferases can be distinguished since they have different enzyme structures and substrate requirements.</p><p>The promoter region of <italic>DJ-1 </italic>containing sequence spanning the 16 bp deletion was PCR amplified from genomic DNA from the individual harbouring the deletion variant using primers containing restriction sites for cloning. Primers were designed to PCR amplify a fragment from position 1 to 2119 bp (GenBank accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AB045294">AB045294</ext-link>). It was decided to include the entire 5'UTR sequence in the luciferase assay to ensure that all sites important for transcription initiation and regulation, especially under hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress conditions, were present. A similar sized construct had previously been used successfully to assess promoter function of <italic>DJ-1 </italic>in a study done by Taira <italic>et al</italic>., 2001 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Two constructs were generated; wild-type [pDJ-1(wt)Luc] and a 16 bp deletion variant [pDJ-1(del)Luc]. Primer sequences used were: forward 5'-ATC GTA TCG CTC GAG GGA TCC TTC TAA GCT CAT TC-3' and reverse 5'-CAG AGC TCT TTT GGA AGC AAG CTT CGATACGAT-3'. PCR reactions were performed in a 2720 Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems). The 50 &#x003bc;l reactions contained 200 ng template DNA (wild-type or deletion), 20 pmoles of each primer, 75 &#x003bc;M dNTPs (Promega), 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1&#x000d7; NH4 buffer (Bioline), 5% DMSO and 0.5 units of BIOTAQ DNA polymerase (Bioline). The PCR cycling parameters entailed an initial denaturation step at 95&#x000b0;C for 7 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95&#x000b0;C for 30 sec, annealing at 50&#x000b0;C for 30 sec and extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 2 min, and a final extension step at 72&#x000b0;C for 10 min. The 2,151-kb sized PCR products (either wild-type sequence or 16 bp deletion sequence), as well as pGL4.10 [<italic>luc2</italic>] were digested with <italic>XhoI </italic>and <italic>HindIII </italic>(Fermentas) and purified (Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-up system, Promega). Vector arms were dephosphorylated (CIP, Promega) and ligated overnight to the digested PCR fragments. The pDJ-1(wt)Luc and pDJ-1(del)Luc constructs were subcloned into E. coli DH5&#x003b1; cells and single colonies were miniprepped (GeneJET plasmid miniprep kit, Promega). Insertion of the <italic>DJ-1 </italic>promoter sequence in-frame with the firefly luciferase gene in the pGL4.10 [<italic>luc2</italic>] vector was verified by direct sequencing using the BigDye Terminator Sequence Ready Reaction kit version 3.1 (Applied Biosystems) and analyzed on a 3130 xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).</p></sec><sec><title>PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis</title><p>PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis was used to screen 148 PD patients and 62 control samples for the presence of the 16 bp deletion variant. The control samples were of South African mixed ancestry descent which can be defined as an admixture of indigenous African populations and immigrants from mainly Western Europe, Madagascar, Malaysia and India. The following PCR primers were designed which span the 16 bp deletion: forward 5'-ACC CAG GGC TGT CCA GCT A-3' and reverse 5'-GTC CAG CAC AGG GAC ACC-3' and produced a PCR product of 321 bp and 305 bp for the wild type and deletion alleles, respectively. A total of 8 &#x003bc;l of the PCR product was digested overnight at 37&#x000b0;C with 5 units of <italic>KpnI </italic>(Promega) in a final volume of 20 &#x003bc;l. Thereafter, the digested products were electrophoresed on 12% polyacrylamide gels and the bands visualized by silver staining. Following the <italic>KpnI </italic>digest, the samples could be genotyped since the wild type allele produced two fragments of 129 bp and 192 bp whereas the 16 bp deletion allele produced two fragments of 129 bp and 176 bp.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) (Highveld Biological, Pty, Ltd, South Africa) and human dopaminergic neuroblastoma BE(2)-M17 cells (American Type Culture Collection, USA) were cultured separately under sterile conditions in Dulbecco-modified Eagle medium (LONZA BioWhittaker<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 &#x003bc;g/ml) in 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>humidified atmosphere at 37&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>Plasmid transfection and luciferase assay</title><p>Cultured HEK293 and M17 cells were plated 24 hrs prior to transfection into 6-well culture dishes at 80-90% confluence and maintained at an atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>at 37&#x000b0;C.

Both constructs contained the 18 bp of the polymorphic variant (g.168_185del). The results obtained are therefore likely to be due only to the presence or absence of the 16 bp sequence.</p><p>The linear mixed-effects model for log(RLU) values, showed a significant interaction between construct type and H<sub>2</sub>0<sub>2 </sub>concentration (p = 0.0010) and also between construct type and cell line (p = 0.0119). All three factors: cell line, construct type and H<sub>2</sub>0<sub>2 </sub>concentration, had highly significant effects (p &#x0003c; 0.0001) on log(RLU) after adjusting for the interactions and experiments. All the P-values presented in the present study come from this model and they are therefore adjusted for the differences between the individual experiments as well as all the other factors in the model [the cell line (HEK293 or M17), construct type (WT or deletion) and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>concentration (0, 25, 50 or 75 &#x003bc;M) as well as the interactions between Type and cell line, and between Type and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>concentration].

These results indicated that the model fitted the data well and we therefore have confidence in our results.</p><p>The wild-type construct produced consistently higher luciferase activity compared to the activity of a promoterless vector, which indicated that the insert contained a functional promoter (results not shown).

There was a significant difference between the wild-type and the deletion variant in the HEK293 cell line, after adjusting for experiments and all other factors.

The functionality of this particular motif is currently not known. Analysis of the 16 bp deletion sequence (using the TRANSFAC database via PATCH and rVISTA) revealed the over-representation of three putative <italic>cis</italic>-motifs that correlate to the transcription factors Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR; TRANSFAC Acc.

The core binding sequence for AhR and ARNT is 5'-CACGC-3' and for HIF-1 is 5'-RCGTG-3'. These transcriptional regulators control a variety of developmental and physiological events including metabolism of toxins and responses to hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and share regulatory cross-talk with many other transcription factors.

The deletion was shown to span the transcription start site, according to Taira <italic>et al. </italic>2001 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and is situated 93 bp downstream of a Sp1 transcription regulatory sequence which is essential for <italic>DJ-1 </italic>promoter activity. In addition, the g.-6_+10del variant is located 157 bp upstream from a known 18 bp duplication mutation (g.168_185dup). The duplication mutation has previously been reported to co-segregate, together with a homozygous E163K mutation, with early-onset Parkinsonism-Dementia-Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in an Italian family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Due to its location within the DJ-1 promoter, we hypothesised that the 16 bp deletion variant might influence the level of DJ-1 expression, the transcript stability or the translation efficiency.</p><p>Functional expression studies using the dual-luciferase reporter system found that the g.-6_+10del variant significantly reduced <italic>DJ-1 </italic>promoter activity in both HEK293 and neuroblastoma M17 cells, with the M17 cells exhibiting a higher reduction in activity. This indicates the possible importance of the 16 bp sequence in transcriptional regulation of <italic>DJ-1</italic>. Recent studies aiming to elucidate the function of DJ-1, have identified it as a scavenger of ROS due to its ability to undergo self oxidation in order to eliminate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. It was therefore decided to assess the effect of the deletion variant on <italic>DJ-1 </italic>promoter activity under H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress conditions using the neuroblastoma M17 cell line. In the present study it was shown that cells placed under oxidative stress conditions showed a dose-dependent moderate up-regulation in both wild-type and deletion variant's promoter activities with the deletion variant retaining its lower RLU values compared to the wild-type.</p><p>Furthermore, bioinformatic analysis identified binding sites for the transcription factors; Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), Ahr nuclear translocator (ARNT) and Hypoxia induced factor 1 (HIF-1) within the 16 bp deletion sequence. AhR and ARNT are known to dimerize to form an active transcription factor complex that binds defined DNA sequences, the xenobiotic-responsive element (XRE), with high affinity causing an increase in transcription of AhR-regulated genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The AhR/ARNT complex up-regulates cytochrome P450 enzymes that play diverse roles in metabolism of endogenous substances, environmental chemicals and various drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. AhR functions as the prime transcription factor and ARNT as a DNA binding partner. Transcriptional up-regulation during hypoxia is mediated principally by HIF-1 (a dimer of HIF-1&#x003b1; and ARNT). The anticancer property of curcumin has been shown to be due to inactivation of HIF-1 by degradation of ARNT via oxidation and ubiquitination processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. It was also shown that curcumin induces proteasomal degradations of both AhR and ARNT and this is mediated by oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. It is possible that the AhR/ARNT or HIF-1 complexes may interact with DJ-1's promoter thereby regulating its transcription and therefore indirectly influencing the transcription of various genes associated with oxidative stress, apoptosis and neurotoxicity that are regulated by DJ-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>Further analysis found that when the 16 bp sequence is deleted, a binding site for the E2F-class of transcription factors is created. E2F has been shown to induce transcription of pro-apoptotic proteins and repression of E2F-responsive genes is required for neuronal survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Recent studies found that the pRb/E2F cell-cycle pathway is activated in dopaminergic neurons in PD patients, as well as in a PD mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>DJ-1 is highly conserved at both the nucleotide and amino acid level, possibly due its important role in protection against oxidative stress. Mouse and human DJ-1 is 83% and 90% identical at the DNA and protein level, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Similarly, the conservation between porcine and human DJ-1 is 96% at the protein level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. There have been no reports however on the level of conservation of DJ-1's 5'-UTR sequence. We showed through multi-species comparative analysis that the promoter region of <italic>DJ-1 </italic>is highly conserved, as expected, between man and other primates as well as to a few other species. More importantly, the 16 bp deletion sequence is present in a highly conserved promoter region (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) indicating the possible significance of this sequence in higher order mammals and thus an evolutionarily retained functionality.</p><p>It would be interesting to determine the prevalence of the g.-6_+10del variant in other populations and to establish whether it plays a role in susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases such as PD. Further studies are necessary to determine whether endogenous levels of DJ-1 are affected by the 16 bp deletion and whether an alternative transcriptional start site is present. In addition, introducing point mutations into the predicted transcription factor binding sites within the 16 bp sequence to determine the effect on DJ-1's transcription and the cell's response to oxidative stress would be of interest.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We report a novel sequence variant in the highly conserved DJ-1 gene. Functional expression studies found that this variant significantly reduced <italic>DJ-1 </italic>promoter activity in two separate mammalian cell lines, which indicates the possible importance of the 16 bp sequence in transcriptional regulation of <italic>DJ-1</italic>. In addition, the activity of three transcription factors with recognition sites within the deletion sequence might be influenced by the g.-6_+10del variant.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>RJK performed the laboratory work and drafted the manuscript.
