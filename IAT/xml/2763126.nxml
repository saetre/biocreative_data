Transcription of the PspF regulon (<italic>pspABCDE</italic> and <italic>pspG</italic>) in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is induced upon stresses that dissipate the proton motive force (pmf). Using GFP fusions we have visualized the subcellular localizations of PspA (a negative regulator and effector of Psp) and PspG (an effector of Psp). It has previously been proposed that PspA evenly coates the inner membrane of the cell. We now demonstrate that instead of uniformly covering the entire cell, PspA (and PspG) is highly organized into what appear to be distinct functional classes (complexes at the cell pole and the lateral cell wall). Real-time observations revealed lateral PspA and PspG complexes are highly mobile, but absent in cells lacking MreB. Without the MreB cytoskeleton, induction of the Psp response is still observed, yet these cells fail to maintain pmf under stress conditions. The two spatial subspecies therefore appear to be dynamically and functionally distinct with the polar clusters being associated with sensory function and the mobile complexes with maintenance of pmf.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The <underline>p</underline>hage <underline>s</underline>hock <underline>p</underline>rotein (Psp) response helps maintain the proton motive force (pmf) in cells under pmf-dissipating stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Kleerebezem <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Jovanovic <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). The Psp response is found in many Gram-negative bacteria including several pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Darwin, 2005</xref>) where Psp proteins are implicated in infectious processes. This presents a potential antibacterial drug target. For example, <italic>pspC</italic> mutants of <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica</italic> are severely attenuated for virulence during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Darwin and Miller, 1999</xref>) and <italic>psp</italic> genes are amongst the most highly upregulated genes in <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> during macrophage infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Eriksson <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). Psp is also upregulated during swarming in <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>) and during biofilm formation in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Beloin <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). The Psp response and PspA homologues have recently been found among Gram-positive bacteria, cyanobacteria, archea and higher plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Darwin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bidle <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Vrancken <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>) suggesting a fundamental role for Psp in maintaining cell envelope integrity throughout all three domains of life.</p><p>Transcription of the <italic>psp</italic> genes is driven via &#x003c3;<sup>54</sup>-dependent promoters and requires activation by the enhancer binding protein PspF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Model <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Darwin, 2005</xref>). The activity of PspF (and thus the PspF regulon) is regulated by PspA, which specifically interacts with PspF under non-inducing conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Model <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Darwin, 2005</xref>). Upon induction, the interaction between PspA and PspF is disrupted, allowing activation of <italic>psp</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Lloyd <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Darwin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Jovanovic <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Psp is strongly induced by the outer membrane (OM) secretin protein IV (pIV) from filamentous phage f1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Brissette <italic>et al</italic>., 1990</xref>), bacterial secretins and inner membrane (IM) stresses including conditions that block or reduce the efficiency of the protein export apparatus, extreme heat shock, hyper-osmotic shock and uncouplers of pmf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Model <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Darwin, 2005</xref>).</p><p>PspA is a peripheral protein at the cytoplasmic face of the IM. It has been shown <italic>in vitro</italic> that PspA can directly interact with phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylglycerol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Kobayashi <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). PspG is predicted to be an integral IM protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Lloyd <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>) and is not known to have any major involvement in Psp transcription regulation. Instead, PspG, as well as PspA, are effectors of the Psp response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Jovanovic <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Recently, work with <italic>E. coli</italic> IM vesicles and liposomes demonstrated that higher molecular-weight oligomers of PspA mitigate proton loss across membrane bilayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Kobayashi <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Transcription profiling of cells overexpressing PspA and PspG suggest these proteins cause a subtle switch towards anaerobic respiration and fermentation as well as a downturn of pmf consuming cellular processes such as motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Jovanovic <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Although substantial progress has been made in understanding the regulation and function of the Psp response, its precise mechanisms as well as the spatial organization of Psp proteins within the living cell are still unknown. Although lacking the confined cellular compartments of eukaryotes, <italic>in vivo</italic> localization studies using fluorescence microscopy have revealed a remarkable organization within the bacterial cell. Based on asymmetric protein distribution, rod-shaped cells such as <italic>E. coli</italic> can be divided into different subcellular domains: the polar, lateral and septal regions. Correct spatial localization of proteins within these regions is often crucial for the functioning of cellular processes. Furthermore, members of interrelated pathways often colocalize, hence studying the spatial organization of a protein can provide insights into its role within the complex network of cell physiology. We have therefore visualized PspA and PspG in <italic>E. coli</italic> using a bright variant of the green fluorescent protein, GFPmut2 (herein termed GFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Cormack <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>). Our subcellular studies allow us to probe the mode of action and the relationship between the Psp response and other cellular proteins and processes. Based on localizations of PspA and PspG and the determinants required for their correct localization, we identified different classes of Psp molecules associated with different roles in the Psp response and a link to cytoskeletal features of the cell. Additionally, we show, for the first time, that PspA forms higher-order oligomers <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>GFP&#x02013;PspA and PspG&#x02013;GFP are functional</title><p>GFP&#x02013;PspA was created by fusing PspA to the C-terminus of GFP in pDSW209 (plasmid pEC1), and PspG&#x02013;GFP was created by cloning <italic>pspG</italic> into pDSW210 (plasmid pGJ7) for an N-terminal fusion. To confirm their native state and to rule out artefacts due to accumulation of fluorescent aggregates or proteolytic cleavage products within inclusion bodies caused by overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Ventura and Villaverde, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Bardy and Maddock, 2007</xref>), we tested the stability, functionality and the extent of inclusion body formation.</p><p>Immunoblotting demonstrated that the expression level of GFP&#x02013;PspA is very similar to that of the native PspA protein upon pIV-induced membrane stress (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref> and Fig. 1SA) and hence the fusions represent native Psp protein levels. Furthermore, the fusions appeared stably expressed. Neither MG1655&#x00394;<italic>pspA</italic>/GFP&#x02013;PspA nor MG1655&#x00394;<italic>pspG</italic>/PspG&#x02013;GFP cells contained detectable amounts of free PspA, PspG or GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref>). PspA is a bifunctional protein (negative regulator and effector of Psp). The negative regulator function of GFP&#x02013;PspA was tested using &#x003b2;-galactosidase assays in MG1655&#x00394;<italic>pspA</italic>/GFP&#x02013;PspA cells containing pSJ1 (&#x003c6;<italic>pspA-lacZ</italic> transcriptional reporter fusion) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>) and immunoblotting with PspC-specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>). GFP&#x02013;PspA behaves very similarly to wild-type PspA when produced <italic>in trans</italic>, in partially inhibiting PspF activity and reducing PspC expression (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>). The effector function of GFP&#x02013;PspA was tested using a motility assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1C</xref>) because over-production of PspA in wild-type MG1655 or MG1655&#x00394;<italic>pspF</italic> cells resulted in decreased motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Jovanovic <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Importantly, GFP&#x02013;PspA in MG1655&#x00394;<italic>pspF</italic> cells also caused decreased cell motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1C</xref>), demonstrating that GFP&#x02013;PspA retains its effector functionality. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Lloyd <italic>et al</italic>. (2004</xref>) identified PspG as an additional effector of the Psp response; over-production of PspG in wild-type MG1655 or MG1655&#x00394;<italic>pspF</italic> cells also decreased cell motility. In line with this, expression of PspG&#x02013;GFP in MG1655&#x00394;<italic>pspF</italic> cells also resulted in decreased cell motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1C</xref>) demonstrating that the effector function of PspG&#x02013;GFP is maintained.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>GFP&#x02013;PspA and PspG&#x02013;GFP are stable and functional. A. The stability of GFP&#x02013;PspA and PspG&#x02013;GFP fusion proteins were tested by immunoblotting with antibodies against PspA and GFP. Proteins corresponding to GFP&#x02013;PspA (53 kDa, lane 6), PspG&#x02013;GFP (37 kDa, lane 1), GFP (28 kDa) and PspA (25 kDa) are indicated. The PspA antibody cross-reacts with a 35 kDa <italic>E. coli</italic> protein (labelled cross-reacting protein). B. The negative regulatory function of GFP&#x02013;PspA was (i) analysed by &#x003b2;-galactosidase assays in MG1655&#x00394;<italic>pspA</italic> cells containing a <italic>pspA-lacZ</italic> transcriptional reporter fusion and (ii) by immunoblotting with PspC-specific antibodies, where GFP&#x02013;PspA over-production causes a decrease in PspC levels (indicated by an arrow).

To test inclusion body formation of GFP&#x02013;PspA and PspG&#x02013;GFP we performed Triton X-100 based cell fractionations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Russel and Kazmierczak, 1993</xref>). Proteins from MG1655&#x00394;<italic>pspA</italic>/GFP&#x02013;PspA and MG1655&#x00394;<italic>pspG</italic>/PspG&#x02013;GFP cells were separated into soluble (periplasmic and cytoplasmic proteins) (Sol), IM, OM and aggregated fractions. Subsequently, the subcellular location of GFP&#x02013;PspA and PspG&#x02013;GFP was inferred via immunoblotting using GFP-specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1D</xref>). GFP&#x02013;PspA can be detected in soluble and IM fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1Di</xref>, Sol and IM), consistent with previous observations that PspA is a peripheral IM protein at the cytoplasmic face of the IM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Brissette <italic>et al</italic>., 1990</xref>). <italic>In silico</italic> predictions suggest PspG is an integral IM protein with two <italic>trans</italic>-membrane helixes and both the N- and C-terminus in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). In agreement with this, PspG&#x02013;GFP was only found in the IM fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1Dii</xref>, IM), similarly to wild-type PspG (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>) and neither GFP&#x02013;PspA nor PspG&#x02013;GFP showed any detectable aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1Di and ii</xref>, Agg, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>). We conclude that GFP&#x02013;PspA and PspG&#x02013;GFP are stably expressed, retain detectable levels of activity and are not located in inclusion bodies indicating that they are suitable for all localization studies.</p></sec><sec><title>GFP&#x02013;PspA and PspG&#x02013;GFP are localized to the cell poles and traffic between both poles</title><p>In line with their previously established topologies as peripheral (PspA) and integral IM proteins (PspG), GFP&#x02013;PspA in MG1655&#x00394;<italic>pspA</italic> and PspG&#x02013;GFP in MG1655&#x00394;<italic>pspG</italic> cells can be visualized as green fluorescent foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A</xref>) localized proximal to the IM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A</xref>, red). Epifluorescence microscopy indicates that both, GFP&#x02013;PspA and PspG&#x02013;GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A</xref>, green) appear to accumulate at the cell poles. To quantify these localization patterns we divided 20 cells (of each strain used) into six equally sized cross-sections each covering similar membrane areas in the terminal and lateral sections (approximating the cell poles as hemispheres and assuming an average cell-length of 3 &#x003bc;m and a cell-diameter of 1 &#x003bc;m) and measured the intensity of the fluorescence signal in each segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2B</xref>).

The MinCDE system is required to maintain the placement of the divisome in mid-cell thereby resulting in two equally sized daughter cells after cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Lutkenhaus, 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2C.i</xref>). Cells lacking the MinCDE system are characterized by two different cell types, rod-shaped cells and minicells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2C</xref>), due to the inappropriate placement of the division site close to one pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2Ci</xref>, differential interference contrast, arrow). Hence, minicells represent a polar segment of the parental cell harbouring polar localized proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Lai <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). Using confocal microscopy, we detected fluorescence in minicells using either MC1000&#x00394;<italic>minCDE</italic>&#x00394;<italic>pspA</italic>/GFP&#x02013;PspA (data not shown) or MC1000&#x00394;<italic>minCDE</italic>&#x00394;<italic>pspG/</italic>PspG&#x02013;GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2Ci</xref>). As it is possible to separate minicells from rod-shaped cells by differential centrifugation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Lai <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2Cii</xref>) we reasoned that detection of GFP&#x02013;PspA and PspG&#x02013;GFP in minicells by immunoblotting would further validate their polar localization. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2Cii</xref>). Consistent with our earlier microscopy observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2Ci</xref>) that GFP&#x02013;PspA and PspG&#x02013;GFP are concentrated at the cell poles, both fusion proteins can be found in the minicells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2Cii</xref>).</p><p>Although fluorescence intensity measurements across the cell indicated that a significant amount of fluorescence is located in the two segments at the ends of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2B</xref>, and 1/6 and 6/6), we still detected fluorescence between the poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2B</xref>, 2/6&#x02013;5/6). Additionally GFP&#x02013;PspA and PspG&#x02013;GFP were also present in the rod-shaped MC1000&#x00394;<italic>minCDE</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2C</xref>), implying that GFP&#x02013;PspA and PspG&#x02013;GFP may also be present laterally between the cell poles, just not easily visualized. Therefore, we examined MG1655&#x00394;<italic>pspA</italic>/GFP&#x02013;PspA and MG1655&#x00394;<italic>pspG</italic>/PspG&#x02013;GFP strains using an epifluorescence microscopy equipped with a tuneable argon ion laser in order to improve the resolution of the localization data.

This loss of pole to pole trafficking is specific to A22 treatment and cannot be attributed to overnight cell growth as the localization pattern in these cells is unchanged and similar to untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>, untreated, 12 h). In agreement with A22 affecting the MreB polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Iwai <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Gitai <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>), we observed formation of spherical cells after 24 h growth in the presence of A22, confirming that the MreB helical structure is disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>, A22 treated, 24 h). Our findings indicate that both PspA and PspG not only show two spatially (polar and lateral) distinct localizations, but also the mechanisms behind the positioning of the polar and lateral complexes may differ. While the polar complexes appear to be A22 resistant and therefore MreB independent, the mobile lateral spots delocalize upon A22 treatment. Hence, PspA and PspG might rely directly upon the MreB cytoskeleton to properly form lateral complexes and move between the cell poles, and the organization of the MreB cytoskeleton could explain the predominantly curved profile of that route (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>).

Pair-wise interactions of the two proteins of interest were assessed by measuring the &#x003b2;-galactosidase (LacZ) activity. An interaction was scored as positive if the LacZ activity was twofold higher (approximately 252 MU) than the negative control, pUT18C + pKT25 (84 &#x000b1; 13 MU). MreB is known to interact with itself, thereby forming a helical polymer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Jones <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>), which was used as a positive control to score for the functionality of the MreB fusion proteins (T18-MreB and T25-MreB) and was measured as a significant increase in the LacZ activity (1653 &#x000b1; 75 MU). Consistent with the subcellular delocalization of PspA, in the presence of A22 and in MC1000&#x00394;<italic>mreB</italic> cells, the average LacZ activity of cells expressing T18-PspA and T25-MreB (559 &#x000b1; 183 MU) was well above the twofold threshold over the negative control value. Co-expression of T18-MreB and T25-PspB also significantly increased the LacZ activity (521 &#x000b1; 195 MU). Hence, the data indicate that PspA and PspB associate with MreB, potentially interacting directly or as part of a complex containing additional factors. However, PspC (147 &#x000b1; 17 MU) and PspG (75 &#x000b1; 13 MU) do not appear to directly interact with MreB. PspG has been observed to co-purify with PspA (L.J.

In contrast to pIV secretin, A22 does not cause a drop in pmf in cells deleted for PspF (MG1655&#x00394;<italic>pspF</italic> A22) but rather causes an increase in pmf. This suggests that some targets of A22, including the Psp effector proteins, will function in pmf homeostasis. When Psp proteins are induced by pIV, in cells treated with A22 or deleted for <italic>mreB</italic> (each a condition where lateral Psp proteins will be lacking) pmf is significantly decreased. This decrease in pmf is strikingly similar to MG1655&#x00394;<italic>pspF</italic> cells expressing pIV, which are unable to mount a Psp response. The pmf drop in pIV expressing cells lacking the lateral Psp complexes implies that the loss of helical Psp trafficking is important for maintaining pmf under pIV-induced stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6B</xref>). Interestingly, cells deleted for <italic>pspF</italic> show a significant increase in pmf upon A22 treatment compared with wild-type cells, which may further relate to the absence of lateral Psp protein complexes.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>PspA forms two oligomeric subclasses <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>According to gel-filtration chromatography profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Kobayashi <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>) and structural studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Hankamer <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>), PspA can form high-order oligomers <italic>in vitro</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Kobayashi <italic>et al</italic>.

These chemoreceptors are part of super-molecular complexes located in the IM at the cell pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Maddock and Shapiro, 1993</xref>) where they sense environmental cues such as attractants or repellents and co-ordinate the chemotactical behaviour of the cell by adjusting the response of the pmf-consuming flagellar motor.

(2008</xref>) proposed that local differences exist in the pH gradient across the IM cristae in mitochondria. According to their model, although a constant electrochemical potential exists along the entire IM surface, the local pH gradient, and hence the &#x00394;pH contribution to the pmf, is significantly higher in regions of high-membrane curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Strauss <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Applied to bacteria, this model suggests that both poles in rod-shaped cells might serve as proton sinks due to the increased pH gradient in this area. Protons leaking into the cytoplasm as a result of impaired IM integrity due to envelope stress might therefore preferentially accumulate at the cell poles. As the contribution of &#x00394;pH to the pmf appears to be higher in this region, even small changes in the &#x00394;pH might have a stronger effect on pmf at the poles than lateral regions of the cell. Hence, the poles might be the most sensitive part of the cell to measure changes in the electrochemical gradient. Polar localization of Psp proteins could therefore be important to perceive subtle changes in pmf and subsequently allow for a quick response to IM stress. Importantly, when we use A22 to disrupt the lateral complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>) we demonstrate that the polar complexes alone are sufficient to mount a &#x02018;Psp response&#x02019; in terms of signalling, sensing and release of PspA from PspF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6A</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>MreB-dependent lateral complexes and the trafficking of GFP&#x02013;PspA and PspG&#x02013;GFP</title><p>In addition to the polar localization of GFP&#x02013;PspA and PspG&#x02013;GFP, fluorescence intensity measurement across the cell and their detection in rod-shaped <italic>E. coli</italic> MC1000&#x00394;<italic>minCDE</italic> cells indicated the presence of PspA and PspG along the length of the cell. Due to the movements they displayed, we reasoned that the MreB cytoskeleton might be involved in the lateral organization of PspA and PspG. Using A22 and an <italic>E. coli</italic> strain lacking MreB, we demonstrated that lateral GFP&#x02013;PspA and PspG&#x02013;GFP complexes were no longer visible, implying MreB assists lateral Psp complexes, possibly through their formation, maintenance and potentially movements. The latter is reflected in the path taken (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>) which resembles the MreB cytoskeletal structure. Although BACTH and <italic>in vivo</italic> cross-linking analyses could not establish strong stable direct interactions between Psp proteins and MreB, our data do clearly indicate that PspA as well as PspB might interact weakly/transiently or indirectly with MreB. We propose that the mobility of the lateral complexes of GFP&#x02013;PspA and PspG&#x02013;GFP could be one consequence of these weak/transient interactions with the MreB cytoskeleton, which could serve as a scaffold supporting rapid trafficking across the entire cell. As MreB is thought to have a role in cell wall biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Kruse <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>) and the trafficking of Psp proteins appears MreB-dependent, we suggest that Psp effectors may also have a role in cell envelope biosynthesis. This view is supported by findings showing that Psp is induced upon inhibition of lipid biosynthesis in <italic>E. coli</italic>: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Bergler <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>) and by cell wall biosynthesis defects in a <italic>glmS</italic> mutant of <italic>Y. enterocolitica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Maxson and Darwin, 2004</xref>).</p><p>High-order oligomers of PspA have been proposed to evenly coat the cytoplasmic face of the IM to restore membrane integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Kobayashi <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Our subcellular localization studies of PspA, however, do not entirely support all aspects of this model. Although our results establish for the first time that PspA forms oligomers <italic>in vivo</italic>[broadly in line with previously reported <italic>in vitro</italic> data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Hankamer <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Kobayashi <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Standar <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>)], PspA does not evenly coat the IM of the live cell. Instead of uniformly covering the entire cell, PspA (and PspG) is highly organized into what appear to be distinct functional classes (polar and lateral complexes). Together they may maintain the pmf of the cell by regulating pmf consuming processes such as motility and cell envelope biogenesis, as well as by directly restoring membrane integrity. The PspA and PspG complexes display a dynamic character when in association with the IM, and presumably make interactions with cellular components, in addition to lipids, extending activities beyond their role of binding lipids to &#x02018;plug&#x02019; holes within the IM.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains, media and growth conditions</title><p>Bacterial strains and plasmids are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>.
