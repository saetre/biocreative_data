Dps (<underline>D</underline>NA-binding <underline>p</underline>rotein in <underline>s</underline>tarved cells) mutants of <italic>E. coli </italic>have reduced acid tolerance when compared to the parent strain although the role of Dps in acid tolerance is unclear. This study investigated the mechanism by which Dps contributes to acid tolerance in <italic>E. coli </italic>O157:H7.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The results from this study showed that acid stress lead to damage of chromosomal DNA, which was accentuated in <italic>dps </italic>and <italic>recA </italic>mutants. The use of <italic>Bal</italic>31, which cleaves DNA at nicks and single-stranded regions, to analyze chromosomal DNA extracted from cells challenged at pH 2.0 provided <italic>in vivo </italic>evidence of acid damage to DNA. The DNA damage in a <italic>recA </italic>mutant further corroborated the hypothesis that acid stress leads to DNA strand breaks. Under <italic>in vitro </italic>assay conditions, Dps was shown to bind plasmid DNA directly and protect it from acid-induced strand breaks. Furthermore, the extraction of DNA from Dps-DNA complexes required a denaturing agent at low pH (2.2 and 3.6) but not at higher pH (&#x0003e;pH4.6). Low pH also restored the DNA-binding activity of heat-denatured Dps. Circular dichroism spectra revealed that at pH 3.6 and pH 2.2 Dps maintains or forms &#x003b1;-helices that are important for Dps-DNA complex formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Results from the present work showed that acid stress results in DNA damage that is more pronounced in <italic>dps </italic>and <italic>recA </italic>mutants. The contribution of RecA to acid tolerance indicated that DNA repair was important even when Dps was present. Dps protected DNA from acid damage by binding to DNA. Low pH appeared to strengthen the Dps-DNA association and the secondary structure of Dps retained or formed &#x003b1;-helices at low pH. Further investigation into the precise interplay between DNA protection and damage repair pathways during acid stress are underway to gain additional insight.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The extreme acidity (~pH 2.0) within the stomach presents a formidable hurdle for bacteria whose primary niche is in the lower intestinal tract of warm-blooded animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Low pH is detrimental to microbes due to the denaturation of essential macromolecules, like proteins, and the acidification of the cytoplasm that disrupts enzymatic reactions and membrane potentials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Human enteric pathogens, like <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>O157:H7 and <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>, are able to tolerate acidic conditions for a period of time through membrane exclusion of protons, pH homeostasis systems, and the protection and/or repair of essential cellular macromolecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In addition to an organism's innate acid tolerance, extrinsic factors like the presence of the organism in a food as well as the composition of the food can impact survival through the gastric barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>One protein that contributes to the acid tolerance of <italic>E. coli </italic>O157:H7 is the <underline>D</underline>NA-binding <underline>p</underline>rotein in <underline>s</underline>tarved cells (Dps), which is expressed at low levels during late exponential growth and becomes the most abundant protein in stationary-phase cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In addition to its participation in acid tolerance, Dps plays an important role in survival during other stress, including starvation, near-UV and gamma irradiations, thermal stress, metal toxicity, and oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. DNA is the common target of Dps protection regardless of the stress through physical association and/or sequestration of reactants that produce free radicals. Some of the mechanisms by which Dps protects <italic>E. coli </italic>from starvation and oxidative stress have been defined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], but its precise role in acid stress tolerance has not been determined. In starved cells, biocrystals formed by Dps-DNA interactions have been observed and a protective role of these structures has been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Aside from its role in stress protection, Dps has also been implicated in gene regulation based on analyses of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis patterns of proteins from a <italic>dps </italic>mutant of <italic>E. coli </italic>and the parent strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Further, highly ordered nucleoprotein complexes capable of altering gene expression patterns are observed when Dps binds DNA in some conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. All of these observations of Dps-DNA interactions were made under circum-neutral pH conditions. Since acidification of the cytoplasm during acid stress alters the internal pH of cells, it is not clear if Dps employs these same mechanisms of protecting DNA during acid stress.</p><p>To begin unraveling the mechanism by which Dps contributes to acid tolerance in <italic>E. coli </italic>O157:H7, both <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>approaches were used to demonstrate that Dps protects DNA from acid stress damage. Acid challenge of whole O157:H7 cells resulted in chromosomal DNA damage that increased with exposure time and was more prominent in a <italic>dps </italic>mutant. Based on the evidence of DNA damage, a <italic>recA </italic>mutant was generated and was found to exhibit significantly reduced acid tolerance. <italic>In vitro </italic>studies demonstrated that the association of Dps with DNA protected the DNA from acid damage. Circular dichroism spectroscopy demonstrated that at low pH (2.2 and 3.6) Dps formed or maintained an &#x003b1;-helix conformation that is associated with Dps binding to DNA. Low pH was also observed to influence the stability of Dps-DNA complexes and restored the DNA-binding activity of heat-denatured Dps by an unknown mechanism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains, plasmids, and primers</title><p><italic>E. coli </italic>strains (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) were grown aerobically in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] at 37&#x000b0;C with shaking (150 rpm).

At the 0 min sample point (15 min of exposure due to centrifugation step), a single, condensed band of chromosomal DNA was recovered from cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Chromosomal DNA extracted from cells that were not exposed to acidic LB also resulted in a single condensed band similar to results from the first sample point (data not shown). No significant differences were detected between cells incubated for 60 min or 120 min when compared to cells harvested at the 0-min sample point. However, with longer incubation times (180 and 240 min), the primary chromosomal DNA bands became broader, less intense, and exhibited tailing which is indicative of DNA degradation and fragmentation. The visual examination of the DNA patterns was corroborated by the densitometric measurements (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), where the peaks for cells incubated for 180 min and 240 min had broader bands with lower relative intensities than DNA extracted from cells incubated for shorter exposure times. Also, the decrease in the relative quantity of high-molecular weight DNA retained in the loading wells with increased time of exposure of cells to acid suggested that acid stress resulted in the deterioration of chromosomal integrity.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Chromosomal DNA from acid-challenged cells</bold>.

First, the binding of Dps to DNA with varying concentrations of Dps was examined to determine the Dps:DNA ratio that bound all plasmid DNA under the assay conditions employed. The results from gel mobility shift assays showed that Dps completely bound pUC18 DNA (300 ng) at a ratio of approximately 33:1 (w/w) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Using this ratio, purified Dps and plasmid DNA were incubated in solutions of varying pH.

Results showed that plasmid incubated with Dps remained in the supercoiled form at all challenge pH values, with little detectable nicking (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). In contrast, when Dps was omitted from the assay, the plasmid was nicked and/or linearized at pH 3.6 and at pH 2.6.

We have shown in a previous study that <italic>dps </italic>contributes to acid tolerance in the human pathogen <italic>E. coli </italic>O157:H7 by an unknown means [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The present study advances our understanding of the detrimental effects of acid stress by demonstrating that DNA damage occurred during exposure to acid stress and that the integrity of DNA was maintained through physical protection with Dps and by RecA-mediated repair.</p><p>Previous studies investigating the role of Dps in oxidative-stress protection found that the binding of Dps to DNA is not solely responsible for its ability to prevent damage. For instance, Dps-1 from <italic>Deinococcus radiodurans </italic>binds to DNA but does not provide protection from oxidative damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], while Dps from <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens </italic>does not bind to DNA but protects DNA from oxidative-stress damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. This disparity in the mode of oxidative stress protection by Dps homologs is likely a consequence of the bi-modal protection of DNA described in <italic>E. coli </italic>where both the physical association and the ferroxidase center, which cages Fe<sup>2+ </sup>ions and prevents formation of hydroxyl radicals by Fenton chemistry, protect DNA from oxidative damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. To determine if iron influenced acid tolerance, parent and <italic>dps </italic>strains were pre-incubated for 30 min with 100 &#x003bc;M deferoxamine methanesulfonate (DFOM), an iron chelator, before being subjected to acid challenge. No statistically significant difference was observed in either the parent and <italic>dps </italic>strains incubated with or without DFOM (data no shown). These results suggested that iron and the ferroxidase center did not play a role in acid tolerance.</p><p>The analysis of chromosomal DNA extracted from <italic>E. coli </italic>O157:H7 exposed to pH 2.0 found signs of damage (formation of DNA fragments as evidenced by tailing) that increased with exposure time. Based upon these findings and as another approach to confirm the presence of DNA damage from acid stress, the role of RecA was investigated due to its role in recombinational repair of DNA. Chromosomal DNA from <italic>recA </italic>and <italic>dps recA </italic>mutants contained more strand breaks, as determined by results from <italic>Bal</italic>31 digestions, than either the <italic>dps </italic>mutant or the parent strains. Not surprisingly, this increase in acid-induced DNA damage in <italic>recA </italic>and <italic>dps recA </italic>mutants significantly reduced survival during acid stress. Notably, the acid tolerance of the <italic>recA </italic>mutant was significantly lower than that of the <italic>dps </italic>mutant and parent strain. These findings suggest that DNA repair might play a heretofore undervalued role in acid tolerance. Depurination and depyrimidination of DNA has been attributed to acidic pH. While both reactions occur at neutral pH in a temperature dependent manner, the rate constant of depurination/depyrimidination increases linearly with decreasing pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Therefore, acid stress will accelerate DNA damage due to the drop in internal pH regardless of the final cytoplasmic pH. Even when pH homeostasis systems are induced, like glutamate and arginine decarboxylases, the internal pH drops to 4.2&#x02013;4.7 when acid challenged at ca. pH 2.5. In the absence of the respective amino acid substrates for these decarboxylases, internal pH drops further to around 3.6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In addition to accelerating the rate of depurination/depyrimidination of DNA, acid stress is likely to exert an additional effect on DNA damage by reducing the efficiency of RecA, since RecA activity has a pH optimum of 6.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The lack of discernable differences in <italic>Bal</italic>31 digestion patterns of DNA between the <italic>recA </italic>and <italic>dps recA </italic>strains following acid challenge was reflected in the survival of the respective strains. Noticeably, the <italic>recA </italic>mutant exhibited lower survival than either <italic>dps </italic>or the parent strain, suggesting a critical role for DNA repair in response to acid stress. Other genes in the DNA-repair pathway, such as <italic>recB </italic>and <italic>recD</italic>, or in other DNA repair pathways, will be examined in future studies for their effects on acid tolerance. Also, it is probable that cross protection to acid occurs by exposure to other stresses that activate DNA repair pathways, such as brief exposure to UV irradiation, which will be examined to understand the integrated networks of stress tolerance in this pathogen.</p><p>Similar to the findings with chromosomal DNA from whole cells, <italic>in vitro </italic>studies demonstrated that plasmid DNA was protected from acid damage in the presence of Dps. To standardize <italic>in vitro </italic>assays, the Dps:DNA binding ratio (w/w) used was 33:1 (or ~1:1 mole/mole) and was set at this ratio based upon the hindrance of DNA migration into the agarose gel, although lower ratios provided some protection to the DNA from acid damage (data not shown). Prior reports estimate that in stationary phase, <italic>E. coli </italic>contains approximately 200,000 Dps molecules (19 kDa) per cell which equals approximately 3.8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>kDa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. With an estimated genome size of 5.5 Mb for <italic>E. coli </italic>O157:H7 and 660 daltons per nucleotide pair, the genome is estimated at 3.6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>kDa that results in a ratio of Dps:DNA <italic>in vivo </italic>of 1:1 (w/w), or 3:1 mole/mole. Several factors may contribute to the need for fewer Dps molecules to protect DNA in the <italic>in vitro </italic>condition than <italic>in vivo</italic>. First, not all the Dps molecules <italic>in vivo </italic>may be bound to DNA. Second, the presence of other DNA-binding proteins, like IHF, in stationary-phase cells that contribute to the nucleoid architecture and/or the protection of genomic DNA may affect how Dps interacts with the chromosome <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Finally, the <italic>in vitro </italic>data reported here may be a result of other factors specific to the experimental system, e.g. the use of Tris resuspension buffer (pH 6.3) containing EDTA, the plasmid DNA, or other unidentified conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The optimal binding ratio of Dps:DNA reported here differs from a previous reported value of 8:1 (mole/mole) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The discrepancy may be a result of differences in experimental set up, where Ceci <italic>et al</italic>. (2004) employed linear double-stranded DNA of 500 bp and we used super-coiled plasmid DNA 2,686 bp in size.</p><p>After incubation of the Dps-DNA mixture and subsequent exposure to acid, it was noted that the quantity of DNA recovered from acid exposed Dps-DNA complexes using non-denaturing extraction [phenol:chloroform (1:1)] decreased proportionately with a reduction in the pH. When denaturing conditions were used for extraction [chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1) with 2% SDS], the quantity of DNA extracted did not change regardless of the challenge pH. These observations suggested that the association of Dps with DNA was influenced by pH. Additional support for the influence of low pH impacting Dps structure or interactions with DNA was obtained from control samples containing heat-denatured Dps. Heat denaturation (15 min, 75&#x000b0;C) of Dps nearly eliminated all binding of Dps to DNA at pH 4.6&#x02013;7.0 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). However, incubation of heat-denatured Dps with DNA at pH 2.2&#x02013;3.6 restored its ability to complex with DNA and to protect DNA from acid damage. These findings suggested that low pH facilitated changes in heat-denatured Dps that restored DNA- binding and protection activities.</p><p>Dps protein is believed to self-associate as dodecamers to establish a three-dimensional hexagonal structure in which the lysine-rich N-terminal regions of Dps subunits are involved in both DNA binding and Dps-Dps self aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Further, reports have shown that the Dps-DNA complex forms a coral reef structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], resulting in biocrystals in starved cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Since Dps has no DNA binding motifs and the surface of the Dps dodecamer is dominated by negative charges, Mg<sup>2+ </sup>has been proposed to act as a bridge between Dps and negatively charged DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Ceci et al. (2004) reported that both self-aggregation and DNA condensation required protonation of the N-terminus lysines (at least Lys-10), but the minimum pH tested in this study was 6.3. Thus, the lower pH values tested in our study provide additional data to support the idea that protonation of the N-terminus lysines and possibly other surface residues on the protein contribute to self-aggregation and/or DNA condensation. In DpsA and DpsB from <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic>, the N-terminal regions are also known to form surface-exposed &#x003b1;-helices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. We demonstrated by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy that at low pH (3.6 and 2.2) Dps secondary structure contained an alpha-helix conformation. Collectively, results from this study demonstrated that pH influences Dps-DNA complex formation and possibly structure, which is important to the protection of cellular DNA from the deleterious effects of acid damage.</p><p>Dps is known to participate in acid stress protection in <italic>E. coli</italic>, but it was unknown whether this occurs through a direct or an indirect mechanism. Results from this study showed that Dps protected DNA by direct interaction. Studies of chromosomal DNA from acid-stressed cells revealed more extensive DNA damage in <italic>dps </italic>and <italic>recA </italic>mutants. Results also suggested that the decrease in cytoplasmic pH could also influence the formation and/or stability of Dps-DNA complexes. Since Dps is abundant in stationary phase cells, and since the binding of Dps to DNA under acidic conditions is rapid and energy-independent, Dps is well placed to combat acid stress. Both Dps and the <italic>recA</italic>-mediated DNA repair pathway contribute to the maintenance of DNA integrity under acid stress conditions. Investigation into the precise interplay between DNA protection and damage repair pathways during acid stress are underway to gain additional insight on acid tolerance in human intestinal pathogens, like <italic>E. coli </italic>O157:H7.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>KCJ and KFH constructed and confirmed mutants, collected and analyzed data, and contributed to the drafting of this manuscript.
