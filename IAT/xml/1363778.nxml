These two components of the SAGA/ADA chromatin remodelling complexes are expendable for the basal transcription of <italic>MET16</italic> but are mandatory for its full transcription induction. Despite their influence on transcription neither protein induces major changes in <italic>MET16</italic> chromatin structure, but some minor ones occur. Repair at the coding region of the transcribed strand is faster than repair at non-transcribed regions in all strains and either growth condition. Moreover, the more <italic>MET16</italic> is transcribed the faster the repair. The data show that by changing the transcription extent the rate of repair at each DNA strand is altered in a different way, confirming that repair at this locus is strongly modulated by its chromatin structure and transcription level. Deletion of <italic>GCN5</italic> or <italic>ADA2</italic> reduces repair at <italic>MET16</italic>. The results are discussed in light of the current understanding of Gcn5p and Ada2p functions, and they are the first to report a role for Ada2p in the nucleotide excision repair of the regulatory and transcribed regions of a gene.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The genomic DNA in eukaryotes is wrapped around octamers of histone proteins forming the nucleosomes, the first order of chromatin organization. Additionally, the arrays of nucleosomes are further organized into higher-order chromatin structures with increasing levels of complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). This compact state makes the DNA less accessible, hence the activity of important cellular processes including transcription, replication and DNA repair is influenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>).</p><p>Eukaryotic nucleotide excision repair (NER) is a complex mechanism that requires over 30 proteins to remove DNA damage from naked DNA, let alone chromatin. Two pathways for NER exist. It is well documented that the transcribed strand (TS) of transcriptionally active genes is repaired more rapidly than non-transcribed sequences; this is termed transcription coupled repair (TCR) [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>)]. In the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, TCR has been shown to operate via two alternative sub-pathways mediated by Rad26p and the RNA polymerase-II Rpb9 subunit, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). On the other hand, global genome repair operates on non-transcribed regions and strands and is slower than TCR.</p><p>More recently there is evidence from a number of laboratories that the non-transcribed regions, especially those of the upstream regulatory sequences, are also faster repaired when genes are transcriptionally active. Here at the <italic>MET17</italic> gene chromatin structure was thought to be an influential factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Concordantly, the structure of the nucleosome has been shown to modulate the rate of NER in the non-transcribed strand (NTS) of the <italic>URA3</italic> gene of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). Furthermore, the wrapping of DNA around a nucleosome has been shown to inhibit the efficiency of NER <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>).</p><p>Eukaryotic cells regulate the accessibility to nucleosomal DNA by using an intricate group of ATP-dependent remodelling complexes and DNA-binding proteins as well as several factors that covalently modify the histone proteins, including histone acetyltransferases (HATs), deacetylases, phosphorylases or methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). Several studies have shown that some proteins belonging to these groups, like Swi/Snf, Gcn5p or Cbf1p, influence the rate of repair <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>).</p><p>Among the different HATs present in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> Gcn5p is one of the best documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). This protein was initially identified as a transcriptional activator required to promote maximum transcription levels of genes dependent on the general transcription factor Gcn4p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). In yeast, Gcn5p forms part of at least three chromatin acetylating complexes, the ADA, SAGA and SLIK complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Another component of the ADA and SAGA complexes, the transcriptional adaptor Ada2p, interacts with Gcn5p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>) and the acidic activation domain of Gcn4p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). Ada2p is required to recruit the TATA-box-binding protein to Gcn5p-dependent promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>MET16</italic> gene of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> encodes the enzyme 3&#x02032;-phospho 5&#x02032;-adenylylsulfate reductase of the methionine biosynthetic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). Its level of transcription is low at 0.3&#x02013;0.7 transcripts per cell when methionine is available [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>); Mark Gerstein's Lab website, <ext-link xlink:href="bioinfo.mbb.yale.edu" ext-link-type="uri"/>]. <italic>MET16</italic> is mainly regulated by a methionine specific pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>) which depends on the binding of a complex of Cbf1p, Met28p and Met4p to the CDE1 site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We have shown that repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) by NER at <italic>MET16</italic> is affected by both its chromatin structure and its transcription level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). In that report we focused on how the Cbf1p chromatin-binding factor influenced transcription, chromatin structure and repair in the upstream regulatory region and the beginning of the coding region of <italic>MET16</italic>.</p><p><italic>MET16</italic> transcription is also regulated by the general control of amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>) that relies on the binding of Gcn4p to the AP-1 site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), although it requires Cbf1p to be fully functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). Here we have taken advantage of the dependence on Gcn4p for full transcription of the <italic>MET16</italic> gene to further study how transcription, nucleosome positions and the NER of CPDs are influenced by two proteins involved in chromatin remodelling, namely Gcn5p and Ada2p, that interact to promote transcription as described above. Events were studied in both strands of the <italic>MET16</italic> promoter and transcribed regions in relation to the transcriptional activity of <italic>MET16</italic> (repressed and derepressed). This has facilitated comparisons between the modulation of chromatin structure and how they impinge on NER.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast strains, growing conditions and UV irradiation</title><p>Cells from the haploid isogenic strains of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, <bold>PSY316</bold>: (MAT&#x003b1;, leu2-3, leu2-112, ura3-52, ade2-101, &#x00394;his3-200, lys2, trp1), <bold>PSY316-gcn5&#x00394;</bold>: (MAT&#x003b1;, leu2-3, leu2-112, ura3-52, ade2-101, &#x00394;his3-200, lys2, trp1, gcn5&#x00394;) and PSY316-ada2&#x00394;: (MAT&#x003b1;, leu2-3, leu2-112, ura3-52, ade2-101, &#x00394;his3-200, lys2, trp1, ada2&#x00394;) were grown at 30&#x000b0;C in complete (YPD) medium to early logarithmic phase. <italic>MET16</italic> repression and derepression were achieved by growing the cells for 2 h in minimal medium supplemented with either 1 mM or 10 &#x000b5;M methionine, respectively, plus the other required amino acids.

Pyrimidine tracts and groups of bands too close to be individually determined were quantified as a single band. The rate of repair at each CPD position was calculated as the T<sub>50%</sub> value; i.e. the time required to repair 50% of the lesions present immediately after treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). T<sub>50%</sub> values higher than the 4 h repair interval used in these experiments were extrapolated up to 10 h.

Since these MNase sensitive regions are located at exactly the same regions as in the two yeast strains analysed in our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>), the three strains employed here will also have two nucleosomes positioned around the <italic>MET16</italic> start of transcription; i.e. the first one (nucleosome &#x02212;1) between the CDE1 site and the start of the coding region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, bands A and C) covering the TATA-box region, and the second one (nucleosome +1) inside the transcribed region between bands C and D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>In spite of the general similarities between the three strains after MNase mapping, two small differences dependent on the growth condition are detected.

In contrast, repair in the promoter region of the TS and along the whole NTS is more variable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, bottom), being comparatively slow (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.001), with an average T<sub>50%</sub> of 5.2 and 6.7 h, respectively.</p><p>In comparison, the two mutant strains show less, but statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.01), differences in repair between the CPDs at the coding and promoter regions of the TS, i.e. 1.3- and 1.4-fold faster repair in the coding region of the <italic>ada2&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>gcn5&#x00394;</italic> strains than in their respective promoter regions.

When compared with the wild type, repair of the group of CPDs within the coding region of the TS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>, top) is severely impaired in <italic>gcn5&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>ada2&#x00394;</italic> cells (2.8- and 2.3-fold, respectively, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.001), whereas repair in the promoter region of this strand is moderately delayed (1.6- and 1.3-fold slower repair on average, <italic>P</italic> &#x02265; 0.01).

In contrast to the TS, repair in the NTS of <italic>gcn5&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>ada2&#x00394;</italic> cells is statistically homogeneous.</p></sec><sec><title>CPD repair in repressing conditions</title><p>When <italic>MET16</italic> transcription is repressed, the three strains show similar differences between repair at the coding and the respective promoter region of the TS; i.e. 1.3- to 1.5-fold faster repair in the coding region, <italic>P</italic> &#x02265; 0.05 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, top). At the NTS, repair in the three strains is 1.5- to 2.1-fold less efficient than in the respective coding region of the TS (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.001).</p><p>The repair trends along the NTS in the three strains exhibit a wave pattern supported by best fitness examination using curve analysis software (CurveExpert). There are three regions of fast repair, the Gcn4p-binding site, the first 30&#x02013;70 nt of the coding region and from +170 to +225 nt positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, bottom). Repair at the TS follows a similar although less obvious pattern. Since NER is less efficient at the centre of the nucleosomes cores, the data for this strand indirectly indicate nucleosomes cores can be assigned approximately to the regions between &#x02212;100 to &#x02212;25 nt positions, between +100 to +125 nt positions and a third nucleosome core would possibly be located over the CPD at +225 position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). These regions are coincident with the corresponding ones in the NTS and they are similar to those nucleosome locations reported in wild type and <italic>cbf1</italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to derepressing conditions, repair along the NTS of the wild type is more variable and inefficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>); in this strand 43% of the CPDs require 10 h to repair half of the lesions. Similarly, repair at this strand in <italic>gcn5&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>ada2&#x00394;</italic> cells is also highly variable. However, while on average the CPDs in the <italic>ada2&#x00394;</italic> mutant are less efficiently repaired than in the wild type (<italic>P</italic> &#x02265; 0.01), repair in the <italic>gcn5&#x00394;</italic> mutant is not statistically different from that in the wild type. Intriguingly, several CPDs present in three regions of the MspI fragment (around the &#x02212;200 nt position, from -8 to +49 and from +121 to +193, are more efficiently repaired in <italic>gcn5&#x00394;</italic> cells than in the wild type. These regions correspond to those that are primarily MNase-sensitive. Furthermore, although repair at the promoter region of this strand is more homogenous in <italic>gcn5&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>ada2&#x00394;</italic> cells, CPD repair in the coding region is more efficient in <italic>gcn5&#x00394;</italic> cells (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.001).</p><p>With respect to the rate of CPD repair along the TS, the three strains show similar trends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, top), although repair in the wild type at both the coding and promoter regions is slightly more efficient than in <italic>gcn5&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>ada2&#x00394;</italic> cells (<italic>P</italic> &#x02265; 0.05). At the promoter region of this strand repair is faster in <italic>gcn5&#x00394;</italic> than in <italic>ada2&#x00394;</italic> cells (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.01). However, repair at the coding region is statistically homogeneous in the two strains.</p></sec><sec><title>The level of transcription influences the rate of CPD repair</title><p>Together with the differences in CPD repair due to Gcn5 and Ada2 proteins, the rate of CPD removal is also influenced by the level of <italic>MET16</italic> transcription and the extent of this effect is quite different in each yeast strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Our results show that the highest differences in repair between the two growth conditions occur in the wild type strain. This is especially true for the CPDs induced in the TS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, top); primarily these are repaired faster in derepressing than in repressing conditions (<italic>P</italic> &#x02265; 0.05). In this strand, the highest contrast is obtained in the region around the ATG codon, where repair is 5.1-fold faster in derepressing conditions. Downstream the differences in repair start to decrease, reaching a plateau for the last 150 nt (1.5-fold difference). In contrast, the differences in repair along the NTS of the wild type (<italic>P</italic> &#x02265; 0.05) follow a wave pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, bottom). Here, repair at the proposed linker regions (see above) does not exhibit marked differences between the two transcription conditions, although surprisingly repair is somewhat more efficient in repressing conditions. Most CPDs at the nucleosome cores are repaired faster in derepressing methionine conditions.</p><p>Unlike in the wild type, repair of both strands in either mutant is little affected by changing the growing conditions, although the two strains show interesting differences. Repair in the NTS of the <italic>ada2&#x00394;</italic> strain is not statistically different in the two growth conditions, while repair at the TS is slightly faster in derepressing than in repressing conditions (<italic>P</italic> = 0.05). On the contrary, CPDs at the TS and the coding region of the NTS of the <italic>gcn5&#x00394;</italic> strain are repaired faster in repressing than in derepressing conditions (<italic>P</italic> &#x02265; 0.05).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Gcn5 and Ada2 proteins modulate the full induction of <italic>MET16</italic> transcription</title><p>When transcription of <italic>MET16</italic> is repressed by growing the cells in complete medium, similar transcription levels are obtained independently of the Gcn5p or Ada2p status, suggesting that neither protein is essential for the basal transcription of <italic>MET16</italic>. On the contrary, in derepressing conditions <italic>MET16</italic> transcription is induced 11- and 19-fold less in the <italic>gcn5&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>ada2&#x00394;</italic> strains, respectively. This indicates that both Gcn5p and Ada2p are strongly required to obtain the full induction of this gene.</p><p>These results show that in spite of the fact that <italic>MET16</italic> transcription is mainly regulated by Cbf1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>), Gcn5 and Ada2 proteins also play an important role in modulating <italic>MET16</italic> transcription and that their effect is highly dependent on the growth condition. This is in agreement with the known dependence of <italic>MET16</italic> transcription on the general control of amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>) since this mechanism relies on the binding of Gcn4p to the AP-1 sequence, which results in the recruitment of the SAGA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). Gcn5p is required for transcription of Gcn4p-dependent genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>) and Ada2p interacts with the activation domain of Gcn4p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). It is necessary for the HAT activity of Gcn5p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>) and to recruit the TATA-box-binding protein to Gcn5-dependent promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). The results are in accord with previous data showing that mutations in <italic>ADA2</italic> reduce the activity of Gcn4p and that extracts from the <italic>ADA2</italic> mutant exhibit normal basal transcription levels but are defective in responding to Gcn4p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Gcn5 and Ada2 proteins have little effect on <italic>MET16</italic> nucleosome positions as determined via MNase digests</title><p>We showed previously that when <italic>CBF1</italic> is deleted, although the number and general position of the two nucleosomes present around the start of the <italic>MET16</italic> coding region does not change, the MNase accessibility to the TATA-box region is strongly dependent on Cbf1p, i.e. in the presence of this protein the TATA-box is accessible, while the same region is protected in its absence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). The three strains used here, all of them wild type for <italic>CBF1</italic>, show the intranucleosomal MNase-sensitive region at the TATA-box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, band B) and bands A, C and D are located at similar positions to those present in other strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). Hence, the wild type, <italic>gcn5&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>ada2&#x00394;</italic> cells employed here also have two nucleosomes positioned around the <italic>MET16</italic> ATG starting codon.</p><p>Although the position of the nucleosomes is preserved in the three strains and either growth condition, small changes in the structure of the nucleosomes cannot be excluded. Two differences dependent on the growth medium are observed in the pattern of MNase digestion in the three strains. The internal MNase-sensitive area present at the TATA-box (band B) is more intense in the three strains in derepressing than in repressing methionine conditions. This suggests that the TATA-box region is, as expected, more accessible when <italic>MET16</italic> is actively transcribed. In addition, in derepressing conditions the MNase-sensitive area C shows a doublet of bands instead of the single one present in repressing conditions. This may represent a transitory structure because they are resolved as a single band when the cells are incubated for longer in derepressing conditions (data not shown).</p><p>As happened in other yeast strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>) the MNase-sensitive area D shows differences in the number and intensity of the bands that do not correlate with the strain or growth condition. Differences at this area could not be confirmed when the nucleosomes were mapped at high resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>), suggesting that they could also represent transient nucleosome structures.</p><p>These results show that in spite of the important differences detected in the level of <italic>MET16</italic> transcription among the three strains neither Gcn5p nor Ada2p induce large changes in the chromatin structure at the <italic>MET16</italic> locus. This is similar to what happens at <italic>MET16</italic> in the absence of Cbf1p, namely transcription is extensively affected but nucleosome positions are not markedly disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). Therefore, for <italic>MET16</italic> regulation both the Cbf1p-mediated mechanism and that for the general control of amino acids have similar outcomes on nucleosome positioning.</p></sec><sec><title>Nucleosome structure modulates CPD repair at the <italic>MET16</italic> locus</title><p>In repressing methionine conditions the repair trend along the NTS is strongly influenced by the position of the nucleosomes in the three strains, i.e. repair is fast at the linker regions and slow towards the nucleosome cores. This is similar to that in two different yeast strains at the same locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>) or at the <italic>URA3</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>).</p><p>This nucleosome modulation is not obvious in derepressing conditions in any of the three yeast strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, bottom). However, in the two mutant strains the regions where repair is fast are concordant with the equivalent ones in repressing conditions, so the presence of nucleosome modulation cannot be completely discarded here. In contrast, in the wild type this nucleosome modulation seems to be primarily abolished. This is similar to in the wild type strain used to examine the role of Cbf1p in NER, where the nucleosome modulation obtained in the same derepressing medium was also less obvious than in the repressing condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>).</p><p>Although the modulation by the nucleosomes is not evident in the TS, it is interesting to note that in repressing conditions, when the effect at the NTS is strongest, repair of the TS shows small patches of slow repair coincident with the nucleosome cores. So, in contrast to other genes like <italic>URA3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>) or <italic>MFA2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>), it seems that in this growth condition the fast repair at the coding region of the <italic>MET16</italic> TS cannot completely overcome the effect imposed by the nucleosomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Transcription coupled repair is stimulated in high <italic>MET16</italic> transcription conditions</title><p>Despite the fact that the extent of <italic>MET16</italic> transcription varies about 50-fold between the growth conditions and the strains employed, repair of CPDs at the coding region of the TS is always more efficient than in the respective non-transcribed regions. This fast repair constantly starts between 30 and 40 nt upstream of the start of translation as happens in other yeast strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>) or the <italic>RPB2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>).</p><p>With the exception of the wild type strain grown in derepressing conditions, where <italic>MET16</italic> transcription is strongly activated, this gene is otherwise lowly transcribed and shows less than a 5-fold variation among the different conditions and strains. In spite of these differences in transcription, the faster repair at the coding region of the TS is detected at a similar relatively low level in all of them; repair at the coding region of the TS is 1.3- to 1.5-fold faster than in the promoter region. In the wild type grown in derepressing conditions, fast repair is more evident and repair at the coding region is &#x0223c;2.5-fold faster than in the promoter region. However, this activation is not a general phenomenon and is mainly due to the more efficient repair of the CPDs induced around the starting ATG codon, where repair is induced up to 5-fold.</p><p>These results are concordant with our previous work where even when <italic>MET16</italic> is not transcribed, the CPDs at the coding region of the TS are also repaired 1.3- to 1.5-fold faster than those in the promoter region and the biggest differences in repair were obtained when the level of transcription was highest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>).</p><p>Our results indicate that when transcription of <italic>MET16</italic>, and possibly other lowly transcribed genes, is absent or is transcribed at very low levels, the more efficient repair of the CPDs induced at the coding region of the TS would be mainly a consequence of the chromatin structure change as suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). However, when transcription is highly activated and reaches a certain threshold, the efficiency of this fast repair is further enhanced. This could be a consequence of the higher number of RNA-polymerases stalled at CPDs, together with the presence of changes in the chromatin structure that leave the DNA more accessible to enzymes involved in DNA repair. The extent of this enhanced repair depends on the action of Gcn5p and Ada2p, but this may merely reflect the extents of transcription in the presence or absence of these proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>The level of transcription influences the rate of CPD repair</title><p>Comparison of the repair rate in each strain between the two growth conditions shows that the biggest differences occur in the wild type, especially in the TS around the ATG starting codon. Here, repair in derepressing conditions is up to 5-fold faster than in repressing conditions. The fact that the differences in repair are bigger in the wild type than in the two mutant strains is concordant with the differences in transcription, which is highest in the wild type. Moreover, this seems mainly related to the change in the transcription extent and especially to the steps of transcription initiation and the beginning of transcription elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). On the contrary, the differences in repair in the wild type NTS run in parallel to the position of the nucleosomes. Here, the CPDs at the nucleosome cores show more differences in repair than those at the linker regions. It is clear that at the <italic>MET16</italic> locus the change in the transcription extent can result in very different outcomes in the rate of repair of the two DNA strands. This suggests that in the wild type we are detecting the effect of two different factors; the change in repair at the TS would be mainly affected by the transcription extent, whereas the changes detected in the NTS would be mainly due to the nucleosome structure.</p><p>In the two mutant strains the differences in transcription between the two growth conditions are small and concordantly, repair is quantitatively less affected. However, the effect is quite different in each strain. Repair in the <italic>ada2&#x00394;</italic> mutant is only affected at the TS, where the CPDs are repaired as expected slightly, but statistically, faster in derepressing conditions. In contrast, repair in <italic>gcn5&#x00394;</italic> cells at both the TS and the coding region of the NTS is faster in repressing conditions. The results in this strain are contrary to what one might expect as transcription in derepressing conditions is about 5-fold higher than in repressing conditions, but repair is less efficient. This suggests a separate role for Gcn5p in NER at the <italic>MET16</italic> locus when its transcription is activated by growth in low methionine conditions. This result supports the role of Gcn5p in NER identified at the repressed <italic>MFA2</italic> locus, where Gcn5p-mediated histone H3 acetylation is induced by UV outside of any transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The absence of Gcn5p or Ada2p delays the rate of CPD repair</title><p>We show that deletion of either <italic>GCN5</italic> or <italic>ADA2</italic> alters the efficiency of CPD removal at the <italic>MET16</italic> locus and that the extent of the effect is different depending on the growth condition and the DNA strand.</p><p>In general, the influence of these two proteins is more intense when <italic>MET16</italic> is derepressed. In this condition, the reduction in repair is least for the CPDs in the non-transcribed regions and highest for those in the coding region of the TS. Here, although the absence of either protein has a similar qualitative effect in repair, the defect along the TS is quantitatively more pronounced by deletion of <italic>GCN5</italic> than by deletion of <italic>ADA2</italic>. This is in contrast to what is expected as transcription in this growth condition is 1.7-fold higher in <italic>gcn5&#x00394;</italic> than in <italic>ada2&#x00394;</italic> cells. The repair data obtained at the <italic>MET16</italic> locus in the <italic>gcn5&#x00394;</italic> mutant grown in derepressing conditions are concordant with those obtained at the <italic>MFA2</italic> gene in the corresponding <italic>gcn5&#x00394;</italic>-<italic>MATa</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). Repair at the NTS of both genes is highly inefficient in the <italic>gcn5&#x00394;</italic> mutant and repair at the <italic>MFA2</italic> coding region of the TS was shown to be 2- to 3-fold slower in the <italic>gcn5&#x00394;</italic> mutant than in the wild type, while repair at the equivalent region of <italic>MET16</italic> shows a 2.8-fold reduction.</p><p>In contrast to derepressing conditions, the effect of Gcn5 and Ada2 proteins on CPD repair when <italic>MET16</italic> transcription is repressed is much less at both DNA strands. This is concordant with the small differences detected in transcription in this growth condition. Although the effect is quite similar in the two mutant strains, repair at the non-transcribed regions is slightly more efficient in <italic>gcn5&#x00394;</italic> than in <italic>ada2&#x00394;</italic> cells.</p><p>Together, the results in the two mutant strains indicate that both Ada2 and Gcn5 proteins are required for efficient repair of CPDs at both strands of the <italic>MET16</italic> locus and that they could have overlapping effects on the rate of repair when transcription of <italic>MET16</italic> is activated by changing the growth conditions. One of these effects would be dependent on Ada2p, and so probably depends on the SAGA/ADA complexes. Upon <italic>MET16</italic> transcription induction, the activity of Ada2p is required for more efficient repair at the <italic>MET16</italic> TS and NTS. This may reflect the influence of this protein in creating a more relaxed chromatin state (a change small enough to be undetected by MNase mapping). The second effect would be dependent on Gcn5p and is more dramatic as this protein is required for more efficient repair at both strands of <italic>MET16</italic> and the repair efficiency is decreased upon transcription induction.</p><p>In conclusion, our results support the fact that Gcn5p influences the rate of NER, and at another locus, namely <italic>MET16</italic>, where the regulation of transcription is completely different from that at the <italic>MFA2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). However, this is another local effect on NER via Gcn5p as NER in the genome overall is not detectably reduced nor is it diminished at the <italic>RPB2</italic> locus, where Gcn5p has no role in transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, we have uncovered here a role for Ada2p in NER at the <italic>MET16</italic> locus; <italic>ada2&#x00394;</italic> cells also have locally reduced NER, so it is possible that both proteins could act in conjunction, pointing to a role in facilitating efficient NER for some of the complexes that contain both proteins.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by The Wellcome Trust (056922/A/99/Z/BS/DC) and by an MRC award to R.W. renewed in 2004 (G99 00118).
