These findings were in line with primary GBM samples, in which protein expression patterns were down-regulated as compared to the normal tissue.

Therefore, we investigated how GBM cells survive in a high glutamate environment while the normal surrounding neural cells undergo excitotoxic cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005953-Takano1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005953-Ye1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. We show that down-regulation of AMPAR expression and mislocalization of these receptors enables the cells to survive in this neurotoxic environment. In addition, we found no influence of these receptors in proliferation of the GBM cells, since complete blocking of the electrophysiological function by NBQX did not result in growth inhibition. To substantiate that these receptors may not be functional in GBM we performed several pilot experiments where the glutamate induced currents were measured using whole cell voltage clamped measurements. In all GBM cell lines tested (e.g. VU-028, VU-78, VU-119, VU-121, VU-122, VU-147, VU-154 and U87-MG) we could not detect any proper current response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005953.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Due to these negative results in all cells measured so far (&#x0003e;100 cells) at two different laboratories these experiments were not pursued. To fully prove this lack of ion channel function, a more thorough study is warranted including fresh tumor slices. Our results however again suggest lack of AMPAR function in the GBM cells.</p><p>Our findings regarding the down-regulated expression of AMPAR are supported by <italic>in silico</italic> analyses that show down-regulated mRNA expression of all ionotropic (NMDA- and non-NMDA) glutamate receptors in primary GBM samples.

Besides low and mislocalized expression of AMPA receptors we could not find evidence for ion channel functionality of GBM cells by lack of any depolarization using patch-clamp recordings and lack of growth inhibition after exposure to the AMPAR inhibitor NBQX. These results suggest that stimulation of AMPA receptors - and probably other ionotropic receptors - is not required for GBM cell growth.</p><p>Mislocalization of glutamate receptors could be a result of defective trafficking of these receptors. Several proteins are involved in this process.

Down-regulation of ionotropic NMDA and non-NMDA glutamate receptors in GBM might allow for the escape of glutamate-mediated toxicity and might facilitate survival in a self-created glutamate rich microenvironment. By imposing excitotoxic cell death on normal neurons and not themselves, GBM cells may manipulate their environment. Based on these findings we speculate that normal neurons might be protected against the high glutamate microenvironment by specific inhibitors of ionotropic receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005953-Chen1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005953-Catarzi2">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, but further research is warranted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title><italic>In silico</italic> analysis</title><p>Oncomine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005953-Rhodes1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, a compendium and data-mining application, was used to analyze ionotropic glutamate receptor expression in a transcriptome profile dataset of 77 glioblastoma multiforme samples (WHO grade IV) compared to normal, non-neoplastic brain tissue (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;23), astrocytoma (WHO grade II) (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;26) and oligodendroglioma (WHO grade II) (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;50), as described in the data by Sun <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005953-Sun1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Patient samples</title><p>For immunohistochemistry, 37 cases of adult glioblastoma multiforme were included.
