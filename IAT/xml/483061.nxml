In previous studies, exposure of primary human central nervous system tissue cultures to gp120 led to a simplification of neuronal dendritic elements as well as astrocytic hypertrophy and hyperplasia; neuropathological features of HIV-1-associated dementia. Gp120 and proinflammatory cytokines upregulate inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), an important source of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrosative stress. Because ascorbate scavenges reactive nitrogen and oxygen species, we studied the effect of ascorbate supplementation on iNOS expression as well as the neuronal and glial structural changes associated with gp120 exposure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Human CNS cultures were derived from 16&#x02013;18 week gestation post-mortem fetal brain. Cultures were incubated with 400 &#x003bc;M ascorbate-2-O-phosphate (Asc-p) or vehicle for 18 hours then exposed to 1 nM gp120 for 24 hours. The expression of iNOS and neuronal (MAP2) and astrocytic (GFAP) structural proteins was examined by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence using confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Following gp120 exposure iNOS was markedly upregulated from undetectable levels at baseline. Double label CSLM studies revealed astrocytes to be the prime source of iNOS with rare neurons expressing iNOS. This upregulation was attenuated by the preincubation with Asc-p, which raised the intracellular concentration of ascorbate. Astrocytic hypertrophy and neuronal injury caused by gp120 were also prevented by preincubation with ascorbate.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Ascorbate supplementation prevents the deleterious upregulation of iNOS and associated neuronal and astrocytic protein expression and structural changes caused by gp120 in human brain cell cultures.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Patients with HIV-1/AIDS have a high frequency of neurological complications during the course of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. These complications include opportunistic infections and neoplasms. HIV-1-associated dementia (HAD) is a common neurodegenerative disease in AIDS and occurs independent of opportunistic infections or neoplasms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. HIV-1 associated dementia is associated with HIV-1 encephalitis and a high brain viral burden. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The pathological hallmarks of HIV-1 encephalitis include reactive astrocytosis, myelin pallor and the presence of multinucleated giant cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Recent evidence suggests that pruning of neuronal dendrites and synaptic contacts are correlates of dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Other studies have demonstrated a correlation between neuronal loss and dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>HIV-1 enters the brain early, within days of the initial viremia. The virus gains access via CD4+ macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], which migrate across the blood-brain barrier. The infection then spreads to neighbouring microglia, the only host to productive infection in the brain. Most evidence points to the main pathway of neuronal injury as being indirect, through the release of toxins by activated microglia and astrocytes. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Factors such as cytokines and shed viral proteins such as glycoprotein 120, released by infected cells, can further activate microglia and astrocytes. Glycoprotein 120 (gp120) is the HIV-1 surface glycoprotein responsible in part for HIV-1 binding to target cells and is implicated as a causative factor in AIDS-related neurotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Very high concentrations of gp120 are required for direct neuronal injury, much higher than the actual levels of the protein believed to be present <italic>in vivo</italic>, lending further support to the theory that the neurotoxicity of gp120 is largely indirect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Moreover in HAD, apoptotic neurons do not co-localize with infected microglia. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], further implicating a multicellular pathogenesis. Macrophage and astrocyte activation results in elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and endothelial adhesion molecules. Activated microglia also release glutamate and other excitatory amino acids such as quinolate and cystine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Overstimulation of glutamate receptors leads to excessive calcium influx and to the formation of free radicals such as nitric oxide (NO) in neurons and astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Nitric oxide is produced from the conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline by nitric oxide synthases (NOS) and is involved in a number of vital physiological processes including vasodilation and neurotransmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. There are three isoforms of the NOS enzyme; inducible NOS (iNOS), endothelial NOS (eNOS), and neuronal NOS (nNOS). Both the neuronal and endothelial isoforms of NOS are activated by calcium and calmodulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, iNOS activity is independent of calcium. Moreover, iNOS can produce greater amounts of NO (&#x003bc;M rather than pM produced by the constitutively expressed isoforms). Nitric oxide combines with the superoxide anion to form the neurotoxic oxidant, peroxynitrite. Peroxynitrite and other reactive oxygen species are scavenged by low molecular weight reductants such as ascorbate but nitrosative stress occurs when these reductants have been depleted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Nitric oxide can also bind to cytochrome oxidase, the terminal complex of the mitochondrial respiratory transport chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. By competing with O<sub>2</sub>, NO reversibly inhibits cytochrome oxidase, prevents cellular respiration and may lead to the increased generation of superoxide anion and peroxynitrite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, inhibition of mitochondrial oxygen uptake leads to elevation of cytosolic calcium. It has been suggested that the elevation of cytosolic calcium facilitates mitochondrial transition pore opening and the release of pro-apoptotic proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Other authors have provided evidence that nitric oxide may mediate cytotoxicity through a number of other pathways including DNA damage and activation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated fragmentation, vacuolation, varicosities, and pruning of neuronal dendrites following exposure of primary mixed CNS cultures to gp120 (Iskander <italic>et al</italic>.: Human CNS cultures exposed to HIV-1 gp120 reproduce dendritic injuries of HIV-1-associated dementia. <underline><italic>J Neuroinflammin</italic></underline>, 2004, 1:7). These neuronal injuries were accompanied by astrocytic hypertrophy and hyperplasia, which is consistent with neuropathological observations in HAD. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The relevance of iNOS following gp120 exposure comes in part from studies that have shown that inhibitors of iNOS mitigate some of the effects of gp120. Many studies have reported increased plasma cortisol levels in HIV-1 patients, in correlation with the clinical progression of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. It was demonstrated that gp120 is able to activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis through the release of corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. However, in the presence of a nonselective NOS inhibitor, L-NAME, gp120 exposure was no longer sufficient to induce CRF production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Moreover, an upregulation of membrane CD23 protein was detected in primary human astrocyte cultures exposed to gp120. This upregulation resulted in the production of NO and interleukin-1-beta (IL-1&#x003b2;), which was prevented with the use of the iNOS inhibitor, aminoguanidine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Glutamate receptor antagonists, NOS inhibitors, and superoxide dismutase have also been shown to protect primary neuronal cultures from gp120 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has met with success in the treatment of HIV-1/AIDS, yet the effect on the prevalence of HAD is uncertain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Furthermore, 95% of the world's HIV/AIDS patients reside in third world nations where HAART is prohibitively expensive and plagued by barriers to distribution. We have focused our attention on the potential therapeutic capacity of inexpensive, readily available, non-toxic reductants such as ascorbate (vitamin C). Post-mortem studies of patients with HAD have revealed decreased ascorbate levels in homogenates of the frontal cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In a model of septic encephalopathy, our studies with rat astrocytes have demonstrated a protective effect of intracellular ascorbate against iNOS upregulation following exposure to bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccaride (LPS) and interferon-gamma (IFN-&#x003b3;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>We report that iNOS upregulation accompanies neuronal injury and astrocytic hypertrophy in primary human CNS cultures following gp120 exposure. Furthermore, treatment of cultures with ascorbate-2-O-phosphate (Asc-p) prior to exposure to gp120 attenuates the upregulation of iNOS and protects against neuronal and astrocytic injuries.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Biotinylated secondary antibodies; Avidin-Biotin complex; and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated horse anti-mouse (F1-2000) were from Vector Laboratories (Chicago, IL, USA).

Primary human CNS cultures were prepared as previously described. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] from 16&#x02013;18 week gestational age fetal forebrain, which was transported in ice cold transport media (DMEM with 5% penicillin-streptomycin and 5% fetal bovine serum). The tissue was dissected, separated from meninges and triturated to a single cell suspension in fresh antibiotic and serum supplemented DMEM, centrifuged and resuspended in NPBM. Cultures were maintained as monolayers at a density of 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells/cm<sup>2 </sup>on poly-ornithine and laminin coated slides for confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM) studies or as free-floating aggregates in uncoated flasks at a density of 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml for all other experiments. The cultures were fed biweekly by half media exchange and were incubated in a 37&#x000b0;C humidified chamber at 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>for four weeks prior to exposure to antioxidants and gp120. The cultures were then exposed to 1 nM gp120 for 24 hours. Paired cultures were pre-treated with media supplemented with 400 &#x003bc;M Asc-p or with media alone for 18 hours prior to gp120 exposure in the continued presence of Asc-p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Asc-p was used in place of ascorbic acid because of greater stability in culture medium. It has been demonstrated that cell culture media can catalyze the oxidation of compounds including ascorbate as reviewed by Halliwell. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], resulting in cellular effects attributable to the oxidation products. Asc-p is taken in by the cells and converted to ascorbate intracellularly thereby avoiding this potential confounder. Cultures were run in triplicate.

The University of Western Ontario Animal Ethics Review Committee approved the procedures. C57BL/6 wildtype mice and iNOS knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). The iNOS knockout mice were backcrossed onto the C57BL/6 strain for 10 generations to obtain congenic knockout mice. One-day-old mice were used as tissue donors. Primary cultures of cerebral astrocytes were prepared as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Briefly, the areas superficial to the lateral ventricles of the cerebral hemispheres of 10 brains were dissected and the meninges were removed. The neopalliums were placed in 6 ml of MEM, minced with scissors and washed 3 times in MEM. The tissue was then triturated using a 10 ml serological pipette, vortexed and passed twice through nylon sieves (pore size of 10 &#x003bc;m). Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with horse serum (20%) was used to dilute the cell suspension (12 ml for each mouse neopallium). Three millilitres of the diluted suspension was distributed to each 60 mm culture dish and was incubated at 37&#x000b0;C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The media was replaced every four days with MEM supplemented with 10% horse serum. The monolayer cultures grew to confluence within two weeks and were then used for experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoperoxidase</title><p>Both monolayer and aggregate cultures were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 minutes at room temperature. Fixed aggregates were suspended in 2.5% agar, and embedded in paraffin. After deparaffinization, rehydration and PBS rinses, 5 &#x003bc;m sections were incubated at room temperature in 3% hydrogen peroxide to quench endogenous peroxidase activity. Immunohistochemistry for iNOS in paraffin sections required antigen retrieval to adequately expose antigenic sites. Briefly, slides were boiled for 11 minutes in a citrate buffer in a 1100W microwave (GoldStar, MS-104YC) on high, followed by 11 minutes on medium. The citrate buffer consisted of 2.1 g anhydrous citric acid dissolved in 900 ml distilled water with its pH adjusted to 6.0. Following three 5-minute washes in PBS, slides were incubated in antibody diluent composed of PBS containing 5% serum and 1% Triton X-100 for 30 minutes. Sections were incubated with primary antibodies dissolved in antibody diluent for 2 hours at room temperature. In the case of iNOS detection, this incubation proceeded overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. Antibody dilutions were as follows: iNOS (polyclonal) at 1:250, GFAP (polyclonal) at 1:1000, MAP2 (monoclonal) at 1:500, CD68 (monoclonal) at 1:5000 and caspase-3 (polyclonal) at 1:500. Three 5-minute PBS washes followed incubation with the primary antibodies. Secondary antibodies were applied at a dilution of 1:200 in the antibody diluent for one half hour. Following another wash with PBS, Avidin-biotin complex was applied for one half hour before washing with PBS. Diaminobenzidine (DAB) was applied for 5&#x02013;10 minutes followed by washing with PBS. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin in some cases, before being dehydrated and mounted using Permount (Xylene based mounting medium). Negative controls underwent the same procedure, but without the primary antibody.</p><p>Monolayers were processed for immunohistochemistry in a similar fashion. Following fixation, monolayers were washed three times with PBS and incubated in 3% hydrogen peroxide to quench endogenous peroxidase activity before being incubated in the above mentioned antibody diluent for 30 minutes. Cultures were then incubated for 2 hours with primary antibody dissolved in antibody diluent. The primary antibody dilutions for the monolayers were the same as those used for the paraffin embedded aggregate sections. Monolayers were then washed in PBS, incubated with secondary antibodies, Avidin-biotin complex, and DAB as done with the paraffin embedded sections. Following DAB incubation, monolayers were rinsed in PBS and coverslipped with glass coverslips and fluorescence-preserving mounting media.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>Monolayers were fixed for 30 minutes in 4% paraformaldehyde. Following three 5-minute washes with PBS, the cells were blocked for 15 minutes in antibody diluent. Cultures were incubated for 2 hours with primary antibodies in antibody diluent. MAP2 (monoclonal) was diluted 1:500, GFAP (monoclonal) 1:100, and iNOS (polyclonal) 1:250 dilution. Following washing with PBS, the monolayers were incubated in the dark for half an hour with Texas Red conjugated goat anti-rabbit and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated horse anti-mouse each diluted 1:200 in antibody diluent. Following a final PBS wash, the monolayers were mounted directly onto glass slides with fade resistant mounting media.</p><p>Slides were imaged on a Zeiss LSM 410 equipped with a Krypton/Argon laser, dichroic beam splitters and barrier emission filters needed for triple labelling. Texas Red was excited at a wavelength of 568 nm and collected through a long pass filter (590LP). FITC was excited with a wavelength of 488 nm and collected with a narrow band filter (515-540BP). Texas Red and FITC were assigned to the red and green channels respectively of the generated RGB image.</p></sec><sec><title>Measure of intracellular ascorbate</title><p>To determine the amount of ascorbate accumulated by the cells following Asc-p preincubation, three wells of one culture were treated with 400 &#x003bc;M Asc-p supplemented media for 18 hours and three additional wells were treated with media alone.

The nuclei were counted manually and the average number of nuclei per field was calculated for each condition. There was no significant difference in cell density between conditions. Serial sections were subsequently stained for MAP2 or GFAP without counterstaining. Digital images were collected from ten random high power fields for each antigen from each condition. Images were converted to greyscale and SigmaScan Pro 5 software was used to establish an intensity threshold to quantify the total number of MAP2 and GFAP positive pixels. For image analysis of iNOS expression, counterstained slides were first thresholded to eliminate hematoxylin counterstaining after which images were analyzed as for MAP2 and GFAP. The average area stained per condition per field was calculated for the iNOS, MAP2 and GFAP stained sets. In the case of caspase-3 stained sets, the number of caspase-3 positive cells and the number of nuclei in each field were counted manually. Statistical analysis of these data was accomplished by one-way ANOVA using StatView software followed by a Fisher's Protected Least Significant Difference post-hoc test.

This study is novel for the use of primary human mixed CNS culture to demonstrate the upregulation of iNOS in response to gp120 exposure and supports the previous findings of iNOS upregulation in human glial cultures exposed to gp120. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p><p>The expression of iNOS by microglia and astrocytes is well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that astrocytic markers co-localize with iNOS in the setting of HIV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Our co-localization studies using confocal microscopy also identified astrocytes as a major source of iNOS. The co-localization of MAP2 and iNOS, although rare, also implies that iNOS may be produced in select neurons. A recent study conducted by Hori <italic>et al</italic>., suggested that astrocytes were responsible for the dysregulated overproduction of NO from iNOS rather than monocyte-derived macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], but did not address neuronal iNOS production, which would presumably be additionally deleterious.</p><p>Not only has neuronal expression of iNOS been identified <italic>in vitro </italic>and in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>], but it has also been associated recently with other human neurodegenerative diseases. For instance, iNOS was upregulated in degenerated anterior horn neurons in the setting of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. In a study by Vodovotz <italic>et al</italic>., neurons with neurofibrillary tangles in affected brain regions in patients with Alzheimer disease, expressed iNOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Moreover, cytokines known to induce iNOS have been shown to be elevated in the brains of patients with Alzheimer disease, along with an increase in nitrotyrosine staining indicative of the presence of excessive levels of NO or peroxynitrite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Although the presence of iNOS immunoreactivity in neurons has been demonstrated in Alzheimer disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>], it has not been documented in the setting of HAD.</p><p>Nitrosative and oxidative stress have been implicated in the pathogenesis of HAD and a number of other inflammatory and neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinson disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. In such diseases, cellular damage can be attributed to the nitrosation or oxidation of vital cellular components such as lipids, proteins and DNA by reactive nitrogen and oxygen species (RNS and ROS). Relevant defence mechanisms include the scavenging of RNS and ROS and their precursors, binding of metal ions needed for catalytic formation of ROS, and up-regulation of endogenous defences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. The role of the reductant ascorbate includes the regeneration of vitamin E from its radical and inhibition of the peroxidation of membrane phospholipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. Evidence has been presented to suggest that brain ascorbate levels are decreased in the setting of HAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. In addition to causing cellular damage directly, ROS have also been implicated as being key intermediates in signalling cascades under both normal and aberrant cellular conditions. Hydrogen peroxide has been demonstrated to be involved in several signal transduction pathways, stimulate mitogenesis, endothelial migration and capillary tube formation, and has also been demonstrated to enhance cellular survival at low concentrations as reviewed by Stone and Collins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. In addition, of relevance to this research, studies have shown that endothelial NOS is activated by hydrogen peroxide through defined pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>].</p><p>Inducible NOS upregulation occurs in a wide range of neurological disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>] and conditions including sepsis, Alzheimer dementia. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>], Parkinson disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>], and in response to traumatic brain injury. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. Both iNOS mRNA and protein were increased in the brains of AIDS patients that died with severe dementia compared to those with less severe dementia or no dementia at all [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>]. These <italic>in vivo </italic>observations correlate with our <italic>in vitro </italic>model of HAD in which iNOS was upregulated in cultures treated with gp120. Our understanding of the mechanism of neuroglial injury in this setting and the factors involved remains unfinished [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>]. The present study implicates a role for iNOS and ROS.</p><p>There have been no previous studies that have demonstrated the protective capacity of ascorbate in the setting of HIV-1 gp120 induced neurotoxicity and iNOS upregulation. This study establishes the ability of intracellular ascorbate to attenuate the upregulation of iNOS associated with gp120 exposure and the capacity of intracellular ascorbate to prevent gp120 induced astrocytic hypertrophy and neuronal dendritic injury. It is worth noting that others have demonstrated that ascorbate increased nitrite and nitrate production in a mouse macrophage-like cell line activated with LPS and IFN-&#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>]. However, ascorbate alone exhibited no inductive activity in the iNOS pathway. In our own experience with human and murine CNS culture models of inflammation and sepsis ascorbate supplementation has been consistently associated with decreased iNOS expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>].</p><p>The exact mechanism by which ascorbate is able to reduce the upregulation of iNOS is unknown. A recent study by Wu <italic>et al</italic>. using rat microvascular endothelial cell cultures demonstrated that inhibition of iNOS induction by intracellular ascorbate was attributable to the reduction of intracellular oxidant stress, associated with attenuation of interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>]. Interferon regulatory factor-1 and NF&#x003ba;B are transcription factors with binding sites in the promotor region of the rat iNOS gene. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">84</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">85</xref>]. However, Wu <italic>et al</italic>. showed that ascorbate had no effect of on LPS and LPS+IFN-&#x003b3; induced activation of NF&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>]. Moreover, in cultured RAW 264.7 monocyte/macrophages, antioxidants were able to blunt the DNA binding activity of IRF-1, which mediates iNOS induction by LPS and IFN-&#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">86</xref>]. Additional studies have demonstrated a strong association between NF&#x003ba;B activation and iNOS upregulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">87</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">93</xref>].</p><p>The neuroprotective capacity of antioxidant drugs in the setting of neurodegenerative disease has been both encouraging and variable. In the case of AIDS related dementia, the antioxidant thiol thioctic acid (&#x003b1;-lipoic acid) was not successful. However, deprenyl was effective in improving cognitive function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B94">94</xref>]. The exact mechanism by which deprenyl protects cognitive function is not known but this monoamine oxidase-B inhibitor has been demonstrated to scavenge hydroxyl and peroxyl radicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>] and increase the activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B95">95</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">97</xref>]. No previous studies have addressed the protective capacity of ascorbate in a human <italic>in vitro </italic>model of HAD. We feel that it is important to explore the capacity of inexpensive, non-toxic and more accessible therapeutic agents for all patients with HIV-1/AIDS but especially for the vast majority of patients that cannot afford antiretroviral therapy. We have demonstrated that intracellular ascorbate attenuates the upregulation of iNOS, as well as the reduction in dendritic complexity and astrocytic hypertrophy associated with gp120 exposure. The effectiveness of ascorbate in the prevention and treatment of HAD awaits further study in a clinical setting.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present studies demonstrate that ascorbate supplementation is able to prevent the deleterious upregulation of iNOS and associated neuronal and astrocytic protein expression and structural changes caused by gp120 in primary human CNS cultures.</p><p>Ascorbate is a safe, readily available and inexpensive antioxidant and is therefore potentially beneficial to all patients, especially those in impoverished countries.
