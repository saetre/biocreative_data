TTF-I plays a dual role in rDNA regulation, being involved in both activation and silencing of rDNA transcription. The N-terminal part of TTF-I contains a negative regulatory domain (NRD) that inhibits DNA binding. Here we show that interactions between the NRD and the C-terminal part of TTF-I mask the DNA-binding domain of TTF-I. However, interaction with TIP5, a subunit of the nucleolar chromatin remodeling complex, NoRC, recovers DNA-binding activity. We have mapped the protein domains that mediate the interaction between TTF-I and TIP5. The association of TIP5 with the NRD facilitates DNA binding of TTF-I and leads to the recruitment of NoRC to the rDNA promoter. Thus, TTF-I and NoRC act in concert to silence rDNA transcription.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Transcription of rRNA genes is efficiently regulated in response to metabolic and environmental challenges [for review, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c1">1</xref>)]. rRNA genes are present in multiple copies, and therefore, rRNA synthesis could be modulated by varying the transcription rate per gene or by varying the number of active genes. Although in yeast both of these mechanisms may operate under certain conditions [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c2">2</xref>)], in vertebrates the level of cellular rRNA is regulated by changing the rate of transcription initiation at active rRNA genes rather than by activating silent transcription units. <italic>In vivo</italic> psoralen-crosslinking studies, which can distinguish between transcriptionally active and inactive genes have revealed that even in exponentially growing mammalian cells that synthesize high levels of pre-rRNA, only half of the rRNA genes are transcriptionally active and maintained in an &#x02018;open&#x02019; chromatin conformation. The other half that corresponds to inactive gene copies resides in a compact, heterochromatic structure. Previous studies have demonstrated that the transcription termination factor (TTF)-I plays a key role in the establishment of both the active and inactive state of rDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c7">7</xref>). A terminator element, known as T<sub>0</sub>, is located immediately upstream of the ribosomal RNA gene promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c8">8</xref>). Binding of TTF-I to the promoter-proximal terminator triggers ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling which correlates with efficient transcription initiation on otherwise repressed nucleosomal rDNA templates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c6">6</xref>). This suggested that TTF-I activates transcription by recruiting remodeling factors that alter the chromatin structure at the rDNA promoter and allow transcription factor binding and initiation complex formation.</p><p>A search for proteins that interact with TTF-I revealed TIP5 (TTF-I interacting protein 5), a 205 kDa nucleolar protein that shares several domains with the large subunits of the human ACF, CHRAC and WSTF chromatin remodeling complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c9">9</xref>). TIP5 was shown to be tightly associated with SNF2H in a complex, termed NoRC (<italic>n</italic>ucle<italic>o</italic>lar <italic>r</italic>emodeling <italic>c</italic>omplex). NoRC is localized within the nucleolus and mediates transcriptional silencing of rDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c7">7</xref>). Like other members of ISWI-containing remodeling machines, NoRC can induce nucleosome sliding along a DNA fragment in an ATP-dependent and histone H4 tail-dependent fashion.</p><p>TTF-I exhibits a modular structure, consisting of a C-terminal DNA-binding domain and a central domain that is required for transcription termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c10">10</xref>), transcriptional activation on chromatin templates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c6">6</xref>) and replication fork arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c12">12</xref>). Interestingly, the DNA-binding activity of murine TTF-I is masked in the full-length protein. Removal of the N-terminal part of TTF-I enhanced DNA-binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c14">14</xref>), indicating that a negative regulatory domain (NRD) within the N-terminus of TTF-I inhibits the interaction of TTF-I with DNA <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, both full-length TTF-I and N-terminal deletion mutants terminated transcription with similar efficiency in crude cell extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c14">14</xref>), suggesting that cellular proteins may modify TTF-I or induce conformational alterations that facilitate DNA binding and transcription termination.</p><p>In this study, we analyzed in detail the interaction between TTF-I and TIP5 and studied the molecular mechanism modulating TTF-I binding. We demonstrate that the N-terminal NRD interacts with the C-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD) and this protein&#x02013;protein interaction inhibits the DNA-binding activity of TTF-I. Significantly, DNA binding of TTF-I is restored by interaction with TIP5. The results suggest a synergistic function of TTF-I and NoRC in rDNA silencing. By interacting with the NRD, NoRC unmasks the DNA-binding domain of TTF-I and facilitates TTF-I binding to the promoter-proximal terminator T<sub>0</sub>. TTF-I, on the other hand, is required for the recruitment of NoRC to rDNA. Thus, TTF-I and NoRC cooperate in targeting to the rDNA promoter, which, in turn, is the first step in rDNA silencing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>Expression vectors encoding TTF-I, TIP5 and the respective mutants have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c15">15</xref>).

As TTF-I-mediated functions are known to require binding of TTF-I to the &#x02018;Sal box&#x02019; target sites upstream and downstream of the rDNA transcription unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c22">22</xref>), the disparity between DNA-binding activity and TTF-I function was obscure. To investigate the mechanism underlying masking of DNA-binding activity, full-length TTF-I and TTF&#x00394;N210 were expressed in insect cells and the DNA-binding activity of affinity-purified proteins was compared in electrophoretic mobility assays (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh732f1">1</xref>). Consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c14">14</xref>), TTF&#x00394;N210 efficiently bound to its target sequence, whereas almost no DNA&#x02013;protein complexes were observed with full-length TTF-I (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh732f1">1</xref>A). Limited digestion with protease V8 yielded a distinct DNA&#x02013;protein complex whose amount and mobility was similar in full-length TTF-I and TTF&#x00394;N210. The finding that both proteolytic clipping and deletion of the N-terminus unmasked DNA binding of TTF-I indicates that sequences within amino acids 1&#x02013;209 act as a negative regulatory domain that inhibits DNA-binding and may control TTF-I function.</p><p>It is conceivable that binding of full-length TTF-I to DNA may not be revealed in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. We therefore compared DNA binding of wild-type and mutant TTF-I on Southwestern blots. TTF-I and two deletion mutants (TTF&#x00394;N210 and TTF&#x00394;N348) were separated on SDS&#x02013;polyacrylamide gels, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane.

Again, the deletion mutants, but not full-length TTF-I, bound to rDNA, demonstrating the role of the N-terminus in masking the DNA-binding domain of TTF-I.</p></sec><sec><title>The NRD does not impair the sequence specific functionsof TTF-I in <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> transcription assays</title><p>As truncation of the N-terminus recovers the DNA-binding activity of TTF-I, we hypothesized that inhibition of DNA binding could be mediated by a direct interaction between the N- and C-terminal part of TTF-I. To examine whether the N-terminus can interact with the DNA-binding domain of TTF-I, pull-down assays were performed using <sup>35</sup>S-labeled TTF-I<sub>1&#x02013;209</sub> and immobilized GST-TTF&#x00394;N348, a fusion between GST and the C-terminal half of TTF-I harboring the DBD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh732f2">2</xref>A, lanes 1&#x02013;3). Clearly, TTF-I<sub>1&#x02013;209</sub> interacted with GST-TTF&#x00394;N348 but not with GST alone. In a reciprocal approach, <sup>35</sup>S-labeled TTF&#x00394;N348 was retained by both bead-bound TTF-I<sub>1&#x02013;209</sub> and TTF-I<sub>1&#x02013;340</sub> (lanes 4&#x02013;9). These results indicate that the NRD interacts with the DBD of TTF-I and suggests that this interaction inhibits DNA binding.</p><p>We have previously shown that TTF-I efficiently terminates transcription in crude extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c14">14</xref>). No proteolytic cleavage of TTF-I could be detected, indicating that intact TTF-I is capable of binding to DNA in the presence of auxiliary cellular proteins. To analyze the capability of full-length TTF-I to activate rDNA transcription in chromatin, an rDNA minigene was assembled into chromatin and transcription on the nucleosomal template was compared with transcription on naked DNA. A transcription extract was used [DEAE-280 fraction; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c19">19</xref>)] that contains all factors required for transcription but lacks TTF-I. On naked DNA templates, long read-through transcripts were synthesized in the absence of exogenous TTF-I (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh732f2">2</xref>B). In the presence of full-length TTF-I and TTF&#x00394;N210 specifically terminated transcripts were synthesized (lanes 2 and 3), though the efficiency of termination was lower in TTF-I compared to TTF&#x00394;N210. In chromatin, binding of TTF-I to the promoter-proximal terminator T<sub>0</sub> is required to counteract repressive chromatin structures and activate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c23">23</xref>). Nevertheless, chromatin-mediated transcriptional repression was relieved with similar efficiency both by TTF&#x00394;N210 and TTF-I (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh732f2">2</xref>B, lanes 4&#x02013;6), indicating that in this assay the NRD did not impair TTF-I binding to rDNA. The observation that full-length TTF-I-mediated transcription termination and transcriptional activation in chromatin suggests that the transcription extract contains activities that facilitate sequence-specific binding of TTF-I to DNA.</p><p>To compare the activity of TTF-I and TTF&#x00394;N210 <italic>in vivo</italic>, transient transfection assays were performed.

This result indicates that sequences within the NRD of TTF-I are required for the interaction with TIP5.</p><p>To demonstrate a physical interaction between the N-terminus of TTF-I with TIP5 in pull-down assays, binding of <sup>35</sup>S-labeled TTF-I derivatives to GST-TIP5<sub>332&#x02013;726</sub> was analyzed. The results in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh732f3">3</xref>B confirm the results obtained in the two-hybrid screen in that all TTF-I mutants that harbor the NRD bound to GST-TIP5<sub>332&#x02013;726</sub>, whereas mutants that lack the NRD did not. This demonstrates that the NRD of TTF-I interacts with the part of TIP5 harboring amino acids 332&#x02013;726.</p><p>To pinpoint the region that mediates the interaction with TIP5, we assayed several NRD mutants for their ability to interact with TIP5. There are five 25 amino acid repeats within the N-terminal part of TTF (amino acids 30&#x02013;154), all of which are required for efficient binding of TTF-I to TIP5. Deletion of 3.5 or all 5 repeats in the NRD led to a progressive loss of the interaction between TTF-I and TIP5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh732f3">3</xref>C). This result indicates that TTF-I interacts with TIP5 via the repeats within the NRD, each repeat contributing to the efficiency of binding.</p></sec><sec><title>Interaction of TTF-I with TIP5 restores the DNA-binding activity of TTF-I</title><p>The results above revealed that the part of TIP5 that interacts with TTF-I harbors the evolutionary conserved TAM (TIP5&#x0002f;ARBP&#x0002f;MBD) domain as well as two AT-hooks. To narrow the region of TIP5 that mediates the interaction with TTF-I, pull-down experiments were performed with the immobilized NRD of TTF-I (GST-TTF<sub>1&#x02013;209</sub>) and <sup>35</sup>S-labeled TIP5 derivatives. The results in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh732f4">4</xref>A demonstrate that all constructs harboring residues 611&#x02013;723 interact with the NRD of TTF-I. This suggests that an internal region that includes the AT-hooks mediates the interaction between TTF-I and TIP5.</p><p>The interaction between the N-terminus of TTF-I and TIP5 may serve as a molecular switch that unmasks the DNA-binding domain of TTF-I, thereby facilitating TTF-I binding to rDNA. To examine whether interaction with TIP5 would enable TTF-I to bind to DNA, we used electrophoretic mobility assays to analyze the DNA-binding activity of TTF-I in the absence and presence of TIP5<sub>611&#x02013;723</sub> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh732f4">4</xref>B). Noteworthy, in the presence of TIP5<sub>611&#x02013;723</sub> full-length TTF-I was capable of binding to rDNA (lanes 4&#x02013;6). The DNA-binding activity of TTF&#x00394;N210, on the other hand, was not affected by TIP5<sub>611&#x02013;723</sub> (lanes 12 and 13). This result demonstrates that the NRD-mediated inhibition of DNA binding of TTF-I is relieved by interaction with TIP5. Switching TTF-I from the inactive- to the active DNA binding form may also be induced by the NoRC complex. The interaction of TTF-I with TIP5 would unmask the TTF-I DNA-binding site and co-target TTF-I and NoRC to the rDNA promoter.</p></sec><sec><title>NoRC-mediated repression of Pol I transcription requires the interaction of TIP5 with TTF-I</title><p>Next, we monitored the interaction of TTF-I and TTF&#x00394;69-153 with reconstituted NoRC, using TTF&#x00394;N348 as an internal control in pull-down assays. The results in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh732f5">5</xref>A reveal that the part of TTF-I that mediates the interaction with TIP5 is also required for the interaction with the reconstituted NoRC complex (lanes 1&#x02013;10). Moreover, we analyzed whether the TIP5 mutants were able to interact with SNF2H, forming the NoRC complex. TIP5&#x00394;599-703 that lacks the TTF-I interaction domain was still able to interact with SNF2H, forming a functional NoRC complex (data not shown). In contrast, the N-terminal part of TIP5 (TIP5<sub>1&#x02013;731</sub>), failed to interact with SNF2H, but still contains the TTF-I interaction domain and was shown to interact with Dnmt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c3">3</xref>).</p><p>NoRC has been shown to play an essential role in rDNA silencing. Overexpression of TIP5 represses transcription of both endogenous rDNA repeats and co-transfected Pol I reporter plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c7">7</xref>). To analyze the effect of TIP5&#x00394;599-703 on Pol I transcription, NIH3T3 cells were co-transfected with the reporter plasmid and expression vectors encoding TIP5 or TIP5&#x00394;599-703. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh732f5">5</xref>B, transcription of the reporter plasmid was reduced by overexpression of TIP5. In contrast, transcription was not affected by TIP5&#x00394;599-703, indicating that the interaction of TIP5 with TTF-I is required for transcriptional repression <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>A similar result was obtained with a luciferase reporter that contains an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) downstream of the human rDNA promoter, allowing translation of a Pol I transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c17">17</xref>). Consistent with the results obtained in the northern blot assay, TIP5 but not TIP5&#x00394;599-703 repressed rDNA transcription (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh732f5">5</xref>C, lanes 1&#x02013;3). To verify whether rDNA transcriptional repression depends on the molecular switch in TTF-I, or repression is mediated by TIP5, we analyzed TIP5<sub>1&#x02013;731</sub> in the rDNA luciferase reporter assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh732f5">5</xref>C, lanes 4 and 5). Overexpression of this construct did not repress rDNA transcription, suggesting that switching TTF-I to its DNA-binding mode by interaction with TIP5 is required, but not sufficient for rDNA repression. Direct or indirect effects mediated by the C-terminus of TIP5 play an important role in transcriptional repression of the rDNA genes.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we have investigated the molecular mechanisms that regulate the DNA-binding activity of TTF-I and the role of TTF-I in NoRC-mediated repression of rDNA transcription. Previous studies have established that TTF-I does not bind to the &#x02018;Sal box&#x02019; target sequence <italic>in vitro</italic> unless the N-terminus has been deleted or DNA binding was &#x02018;activated&#x02019; by limited protease treatment. This suggested that the DNA-binding activity of TTF-I is masked in the full-length protein and the N-terminal part of TTF-I prevents DNA binding. This indicated that the N-terminus of TTF-I inhibits DNA binding via interaction with the C-terminus. Consistent with this, the N-terminal 209 amino acids of TTF-I can form stable oligomers in solution and repress DNA binding when fused to a heterologous DNA-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c14">14</xref>), indicating that the N-terminal negative regulatory domain of TTF-I represses both its own and heterologous DNA-binding activity. Remarkably, full-length TTF-I is functionally active in crude extracts, i.e. it binds to its target sequence and terminates Pol I transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c14">14</xref>). This suggests that either modifications of the NRD, interaction with cellular proteins or intracellular proteolytic cleavage may unmask DNA binding. We exclude the latter possibility, because we failed to detect N-terminally truncated TTF-I in cell lysates and never observed proteolysis of TTF-I in crude extracts. With regard to post-translational modifications, TTF-I is phosphorylated at multiple sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c24">24</xref>), and TTF-I is modified by acetylation (A. N&#x000e9;meth, unpublished data). Though the significance of these modifications for TTF-I function remain to be investigated, our results are consistent with the NRD interacting with the C-terminal part of TTF-I, and this interaction blocks binding of TTF-I to DNA.</p><p>Several other transcription factors have been shown to be subject to autoinhibition by intramolecular masking of their DNA-binding domain. These include c-Myb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c25">25</xref>), numerous Ets family members [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c26">26</xref>)], basal RNA polymerase III transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c27">27</xref>), Swi4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c28">28</xref>) and POZ domain proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c29">29</xref>). Like TTF-I, the DNA-binding activity of c-Myb is inhibited by intramolecular protein interactions and truncation leads to activation of the c-Myb protein. Only truncated versions of c-Myb are able to efficiently transform cells or induce tumors in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c30">30</xref>). In this study, we have used a variety of protein&#x02013;protein interaction assays to show that the NRD of TTF-I interacts both with the C-terminal part of TTF-I harboring the DNA-binding domain, and with TIP5, a subunit of the nucleolar SNF2H-containing chromatin remodeling complex NoRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c9">9</xref>). Interaction with TIP5 counteracts the repressive function of the NRD. The NRD contains five repeated 25 amino acid sequence elements that mediate protein&#x02013;protein interactions. Progressive deletion of these repeats impairs the interaction between TTF-I and TIP5 and abrogates NoRC-mediated repression of rDNA transcription. The data suggest that the interaction with TIP5 alters the structure of TTF-I, unmasking the DNA-binding domain and co-targeting a TTF-I-NoRC complex to the rDNA promoter. We have previously shown that the TTF-I-NoRC interaction is required for specific chromatin binding of TTF-I, nucleosome remodeling and transcriptional repression of the rDNA promoter <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c4">4</xref>).</p><p>Switching TTF-I from the inactive to the active DNA binding form by TIP5 is not sufficient to repress rDNA transcription. The C-terminal deletion TIP5<sub>1&#x02013;731</sub>, harboring the TTF-I interaction region did not repress rDNA transcription in the reporter assay. The results suggest that TTF-I targets NoRC to the rDNA promoter and that the C-terminal part of TIP5 mediates transcriptional repression. The C-terminus of TIP5 interacts with SNF2H and was previously shown to interact with HDAC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c7">7</xref>). Together with the observation that the molecular motor SNF2H requires the histone H4 tail for nucleosome remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c31">31</xref>) and that the NoRC mediated repression requires the histone H4 tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c9">9</xref>), we suggest that nucleosome remodeling and histone modification are crucial steps in transcriptional silencing (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh732f6">6</xref>).</p><p>Besides the effect of TIP5 on TTF-I function, TTF-I serves an essential role in the recruitment of NoRC to rDNA. Since distinct nucleosome remodeling events lead to activation and repression of rDNA transcription in chromatin, this mechanism presents an elegant way to target nucleosome remodeling activities to a specific site. Targeting of chromatin remodeling complexes to gene promoters appears to be a common theme. In yeast, Ume6-dependent targeting of the ISW2 chromatin remodeling complex was shown to repress transcription of early meiotic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c32">32</xref>). Similarly, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Nurf complex was shown to be recruited by specific interactions of the Nurf301 subunit with the transcription factors GAGA and HSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c33">33</xref>). In mammals, the transcription factor EKLF specifically recruits the SWI&#x0002f;SNF complex to the &#x003b2;-globin promoter, generating specific DNase I hypersensitive sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c34">34</xref>).</p><p>TTF-I is a multivalent protein which plays an essential role both in transcription termination of RNA polymerase I and in transcription activation on chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c6">6</xref>). TTF-I plays a dual role in rDNA transcription. On the one hand, it is required to activate rDNA transcription on chromatin templates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c6">6</xref>). On the other hand, TTF-I plays an essential role in NoRC-mediated repression of rDNA transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c4">4</xref>). Moreover, TTF-I has been shown to be a polar contrahelicase that causes pausing of replication forks and blocks replication fork progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh732c12">12</xref>). Given the multiple functions of TTF-I in rDNA transcription and replication, it is conceivable that other cellular proteins interact with the NRD, unmask the DNA-binding domain and facilitate DNA binding of TTF-I. In this scenario, interaction with specific proteins would be a means to regulate the DNA-binding activity and hence the role of TTF-I in Pol I transcription and DNA replication.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh732f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> The negative regulatory domain masks the DNA activity of TTF-I.
