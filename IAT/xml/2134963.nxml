Unlike most previous genomic methods for pseudogene identification, this analysis is able to differentiate losses of well-established genes from pseudogenes formed shortly after segmental duplication or generated via retrotransposition. Therefore, it enables us to find genes that were inactivated long after their birth, which were likely to have evolved nonredundant biological functions before being inactivated. The method was used to look for gene losses along the human lineage during the approximately 75 million years (My) since the common ancestor of primates and rodents (the euarchontoglire crown group). We identified 26 losses of well-established genes in the human genome that were all lost at least 50 My after their birth. Many of them were previously characterized pseudogenes in the human genome, such as <italic>GULO</italic> and <italic>UOX</italic>. Our methodology is highly effective at identifying losses of single-copy genes of ancient origin, allowing us to find a few well-known pseudogenes in the human genome missed by previous high-throughput genome-wide studies. In addition to confirming previously known gene losses, we identified 16 previously uncharacterized human pseudogenes that are definitive losses of long-established genes. Among them is <italic>ACYL3</italic>, an ancient enzyme present in archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes, but lost approximately 6 to 8 Mya in the ancestor of humans and chimps. Although losses of well-established genes do not equate to adaptive gene losses, they are a useful proxy to use when searching for such genetic changes. This is especially true for adaptive losses that occurred more than 250,000 years ago, since any genetic evidence of the selective sweep indicative of such an event has been erased.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>One of the most important questions in biology is to identify the genetic changes underlying evolution, especially those along the lineage leading to the modern human. Although counterintuitive, losing a gene might actually bring a selective advantage to the organism. This type of gene loss is called adaptive gene loss. Although a few cases have been characterized in the literature, this is the first study to address adaptive gene losses on a scale of the whole human genome and a time period of up to 75 million years. The difficulty of identifying adaptive gene losses is in part the large number of pseudogenes in the human genome. To circumvent this problem, we used two methods to enrich the process for the adaptive candidates. The first is a novel approach for pseudogene detection that is highly sensitive in identifying single-copy pseudogenes that bear no apparent sequence homology to any functional human genes. Second, we used the length of time a gene is functional before loss as a proxy for biological importance, which allows us to differentiate losses of long-established genes from mere losses due to functional redundancy after gene duplication.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Zhu J, Sanborn JZ, Diekhans M, Lowe CB, Pringle TH, et al.

However, in certain scenarios, a loss of function can also bring a selective advantage. The best-known examples are losses of cell surface receptors to confer pathogenic resistance, such as the inactivation of the <italic>DUFFY</italic> gene contributing to malaria resistance &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d; and homozygosity for a null allele of chemokine receptor <italic>CCR5</italic> conveying resistance to infection by various pathogens, including HIV &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, the loss of an existing biological component can open new developmental opportunities. The human-specific loss of a myosin heavy chain isoform expressed in the masticatory muscles has been linked to the weakening of human jaw muscles, possibly allowing the increase of cranial capacity in humans, although this is still quite speculative &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. Adaptive gene loss is the type of genetic change that leads to better fitness for an organism by inactivating a functional gene. As argued by the &#x0201c;less-is-more&#x0201d; hypothesis, gene losses may be an important engine of evolutionary innovation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In addition to adaptive evolution, gene losses can play an important role in human diseases where conditionally advantageous mutations improve fitness in a particular environment. For example, deleterious mutations affecting hemoglobin and other red blood cell proteins are common in many human populations due to a heterozygote advantage in malaria epidemic environments. This improved fitness comes at a cost for those born with deleterious mutations on both alleles, since the homozygous state causes anemia including sickle cell disease &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b005">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. Other human diseases such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d; and cystic fibrosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d; have also been associated with the heterozygote advantage.</p><p>Despite the apparent importance of adaptive gene loss, we know surprisingly little about its contribution and significance at the genomic level and over a broad time scale. Most research on adaptive evolution in mammals focuses on new genes or regulatory elements as well as on modifications to known genes, such as amino acid substitutions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;.

Methods for detecting amino acid or DNA signatures left by natural selection are not generally applicable for identifying adaptive gene loss &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. An inactivated gene is no longer maintained through the forces of natural selection, and secondary mutations begin to accumulate at the neutral rate. Therefore, methods based on sequence conservation or ratio of synonymous versus nonsynonymous mutations are not suitable to detect adaptive gene losses &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b019">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. Recent adaptive losses can be detected by the distinct DNA signatures left by positive selection; however, those signatures only persist for a narrow evolutionary window of at most 250,000 years &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b022">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. To detect adaptive gene losses further back into the evolutionary past, it is reasonable to assume that a nonredundant gene that was functional for a long time and then inactivated is a good candidate for adaptive gene loss. While not every loss of a well-established gene is adaptive, searching for those candidates can be used to enrich for adaptive gene losses.</p><p>Gene loss normally leaves behind a pseudogene. However, the vast majority of pseudogenes in a genome did not bring a selective advantage to the organism. Most pseudogenes arise through a gene copying operation of either retrotransposition (reverse-transcribing a processed mRNA back to DNA, which is reinserted in the genome at a different location) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;, or by segmental or tandem duplication of a genomic region &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. These are called processed or unprocessed pseudogenes, respectively. While processed pseudogenes in general have a single exon and a polyadenine tail, unprocessed pseudogenes typically have multiple exons and preserve the intron&#x02013;exon structures of the parental gene. The vast majority of processed pseudogenes are &#x0201c;dead on arrival,&#x0201d; due to the lack of complete coding regions or necessary transcription and translation signals in the new genomic location. Even when a functional gene is formed by segmental duplication, one copy often becomes silenced by degenerative mutations due to functional redundancy &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. In contrast, adaptive gene losses arise from degradation of genes with well-established functions, which often do not have close homologs in the genome. Taking advantage of the genomic signatures left behind by retrotransposition or gene duplication, several genomic surveys identified tens of thousands of pseudogenes in the human genome using sequence homology to a functional parental gene &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b028">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. However, because they lack close homologs, many losses of well-established genes were missed by these studies. More importantly, these analyses focused on cataloging pseudogenes in the human genome, but not on addressing whether the pseudogenizations played a role in evolution.</p><p>This study identified losses of well-established protein-coding genes in the human lineage since the common ancestor of euarchontoglires (primates, lemurs, tree shrews, rodents, and lagomorphs such as rabbits). We applied a novel comparative genomic method to identify pseudogenes by syntenic mapping of gene structures between the human&#x02013;mouse&#x02013;dog trio of genomes. This approach is able to systematically detect the sequence signature left by losses of well-established genes, distinguishing true losses from mere loss of redundant genes following duplication or retrotransposition. Our analysis was able to differentiate the losses of well-established genes from the large background of human pseudogenes. Twenty six losses of well-established genes were identified in the human lineage since the common ancestor of euarchontoglires, approximately 75 million years ago (Mya). Sixteen of those were previously uncharacterized gene losses in the human genome, such as the loss of acyltransferase 3 during great ape evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Detecting Gene Losses Using Gene Structure Conservation</title><p>After a mutation inactivates a functional gene, the signature of the intron&#x02013;exon structure can still be detected for some time before neutral decay erases it from the genome. Based on the observation that mammalian gene structures are typically conserved between species, a gene prediction program called TransMap was developed that exploits the large-scale conservation of gene order and orientation on mammalian chromosomes to map gene structures between genomes. TransMap is essentially a cross-species mRNA alignment grogram (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030247-sd001">Text S1</xref>) that relies upon the &#x0201c;syntenic&#x0201d; alignments produced by the BLASTZ program &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. TransMap is highly sensitive in detecting gene structures for both genes and pseudogenes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030247-st002">Table S2</xref>). Unlike most existing pseudogene detection methods &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b034">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;, TransMap does not rely on sequence homology to a parental gene from the same genome; therefore, it is well-suited for detecting losses of well-established genes whose functional precursor has not been recently duplicated. To identify gene losses, the mapped coding region is conceptually translated and scanned for ORF-disrupting mutations. A TransMap prediction is a candidate for gene loss if any of the following ORF-disrupting mutations are detected in the mapped coding regions: stop codons, frameshifts, a splice junction that is not GT-AG, or when less than 50&#x00025; of the coding region can be mapped to the target (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030247-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). To decrease the number of false positives, a valid conceptual translation is required in an outgroup genome. For example, if a mouse mRNA TransMaps from mouse to the dog genome with a valid conceptual translation, but fails to do so from mouse to the human genome, the gene is a candidate for a human gene loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030247-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pcbi-0030247-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Algorithm for Identifying Losses of Well-Established Genes in the Human Lineage Since the Common Ancestor of Euarchontoglires</title><p>TransMap predicts (pseudo)genes in the human and dog genomes by syntenically mapping mouse mRNA gene structures to the target genomes through genome alignments and then transferring over the corresponding genomic coordinates. The predicted coding regions are conceptually translated and scanned for ORF-disrupting mutations. In this example, a stop codon (labeled with an &#x0201c;&#x0002a;&#x0201d;) is detected in the first coding exon mapped to the human genome, which has also experienced an insertion.

A visual examination of an alignment of the mouse mRNA sequence, mouse, human, and dog genomic sequences and their three-frame translations further reduced the number of candidates to 72, eliminating 18 that we are not confident represent true pseudogenes in the human genome.

The dynamics of gene clusters make it difficult to unambiguously discern ortholog/paralog relationships among species and analyze the evolutionary history of the lost genes. Therefore, we focused on the remaining 35 (non-OR, non-cluster) candidates that were confirmed by visual inspection, which we referred to as the &#x0201c;definite&#x0201d; losses in the human lineage.

Ten genes were found to be lost during the period between the human&#x02013;chimp split and the divergence of old world monkeys from the human lineage. Among the ten genes, seven were observed to have independent ORF-disrupting mutations in the rhesus lineage that are not shared with humans or chimps. Seventeen genes were determined to be lost prior to the divergence of old world monkeys from the human lineage and after the common ancestor of euarchontoglires. Due to insufficient sequence information in the rhesus genome, two genes could only be determined to be lost at some point during the 70 million years (My) prior to the human&#x02013;chimp split and after the common ancestor of euarchontoglires. To refine the timing of the gene losses, we extracted trace sequences from several additional primates (orangutan, marmoset, tarsier, galago) and tree shrew. Using these trace sequences, we were able to narrow down 50&#x00025; of gene losses to a much more precise branch on a phylogenetic tree. For example, the timing of gene losses for <italic>GUCY2D</italic>, <italic>NEPN</italic>, and others (number 19 to 22) was narrowed down to the period of approximately 25 to 40 Mya, between the dates when old world and new world monkeys split off from the human lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030247-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>In addition to identifying previously unknown gene losses in the human genome, our analysis refined the timing of several previously known gene losses.

The method of syntenically mapping gene structures to both a target and outgroup genome is likely to filter out almost all processed pseudogenes. However, TransMap does not fully eliminate those genes that were silenced soon after duplication, which we referred to as duplication-induced pseudogenes. To identify duplication-induced gene losses, we need to determine when the duplication occurred.</p><p>Recent segmental duplications can be detected by within-genome sequence homology.

We determined when the duplications had occurred by tracing along the human lineage through a seven-species syntenic alignment (human, chimp, rhesus, mouse, rat, dog, opossum) to determine the origin of each duplicate in the best self-alignment (the one with the highest alignment score recorded in the UCSC genome browser). If a gene and its duplicate trace back to a single region in an outgroup genome, the duplication was determined to have occurred on the branch immediately after the outgroup split off from the human lineage. If the gene and its duplicate consistently traced back to different regions through the series of outgroups all the way back to opossum, the duplication was determined to occur prior to the common ancestor of human and opossum. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030247-g004">Figure 4</xref>A is a schematic illustration of this procedure.

To narrow down the timing of gene birth on the long branch between dog and opossum, we included scaffold assemblies of the elephant, tenrec, and armadillo genomes.

If the lower estimation of functional time length is greater than 50 My, the candidate is classified as a loss of a well-established gene.

Using losses of well-established genes as the proxy for adaptive gene losses, we focused on identifying a class of pseudogenes that were once functional and retained this function through tens of millions of years of evolution. We confidently identified 26 losses of well-established genes, including 16 that were not previously known in the literature. The highlight of this analysis is the ability to automatically detect losses of genes bearing no significant homology to any functional paralog in the human genome. Their functional precursors had an ancient origin, but enough evolutionary time has elapsed to erase any significant homology with other genes in the human genome. These genes were functioning for hundreds of millions of years and silenced recently within the past 75 My.</p><p>It has been proposed that the majority of pseudogenes are either dead-on-arrival &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b058">58</xref>&#x0005d; or inactivated quickly after duplication &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore, it is not surprising that we have identified a much smaller number of pseudogenes as compared to the thousands identified by previous whole genome analysis that aimed to catalog the human genome for unprocessed pseudogenes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b064">64</xref>&#x0005d;.

We found limited overlap between the losses identified in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030247-t001">Table 1</xref> with both pseudogene sets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030247-st004">Table S4</xref>).

Neither database has <italic>GULO</italic>, Cardiotropin 2, or many others listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030247-t001">Table 1</xref> (see note b). A recent genome scan identified 67 human-specific gene losses, including 36 ORs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b058">58</xref>&#x0005d;. Excluding ORs, only one out of the six human-specific gene losses identified in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030247-t001">Table 1</xref>, Gpr33, was also discovered in that study &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b058">58</xref>&#x0005d;. Another possible overlap is Ugt2b1, which belongs to a tandem cluster of Ugt2B genes on Chromosome 4. The limited overlap in part reflects the difference in methodology used to identify the pseudogenes, but also makes apparent that none of these methods in their present state are able to form the complete set of losses of genes with ancient origins. It also confirms that we have identified some unprocessed pseudogenes derived from functional precursors of ancient origin, where evolution has erased any significant homology to their current functional paralogs.</p><p>The gene loss candidates shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030247-t001">Table 1</xref> are by no means a complete list of losses of well-established genes in the human lineage during the past 75 My. TransMap gene model prediction methodology is not perfect, many factors can introduce prediction errors including uncertainties in sequence alignments, errors generated by the gene model prediction and evaluation procedures, and evolutionary changes of the gene structures across mammalian species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030247-sd001">Text S1</xref>). For example, the well-known human specific loss of <italic>CMAH</italic> (a CMP-sialic acid hydroxylase) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b066">66</xref>&#x0005d; was not found by this analysis due to the strictness of TransMap gene model predictions, causing a valid <italic>CMAH</italic> gene model in the dog genome to be excluded because it featured a noncanonical GC-AG splice junction. However, the use of an outgroup genome and the mRNA filter makes the analysis far more likely to produce false negatives than false positives. Several other factors also contribute to this incompleteness. First, our method using human&#x02013;mouse&#x02013;dog comparison relied upon well-defined mouse genes to seed the search and valid dog predictions for outgroup confirmation. Problems in either one will return a false negative result. Our analysis missed <italic>MYH16</italic> because it is not in mouse RefSeq, which could be due to an independent loss or a misannotation. We further investigated its absence and found that the <italic>MYH16</italic> syntenic region is not present in the mouse genome, indicating an independent loss in mouse via genomic deletion. Our analysis required a valid conceptual translation in the dog genome, which may fail to occur due to TransMap prediction errors, sequencing gaps, or an independent loss in dog. However, the chance of producing a valid mapping increases if multiple outgroups, such as the opossum genome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b067">67</xref>&#x0005d; or a computationally reconstructed ancestral genome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b068">68</xref>&#x0005d;, were used and the resultant gene loss predictions were combined. For example, the previously documented human specific loss of Htr5b &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b069">69</xref>&#x0005d; can be identified using a reconstructed boreoeutherian genome as the outgroup (Haussler lab, unpublished data). Our analysis can also be improved by extending our seed mRNAs to include those from other species and by using multiple outgroup genomes. For example, using chimpanzee <italic>MYH16</italic> mRNA as a seed could have found this pseudogene in human.</p><p>Our analysis may not identify human polymorphic gene losses. For example, the human-specific loss of <italic>CASP12</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b058">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b059">59</xref>&#x0005d; was not identified by our analysis because the latest human genome assembly (NCBI release 36) has the functional allele. Several other human polymorphic losses were also missed by our analysis for the same reason &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b070">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b071">71</xref>&#x0005d;. These polymorphic null alleles are potentially crucial to human diseases, e.g., <italic>CASP12</italic> in sepsis and <italic>CCR5</italic> in HIV infection. Incorporating human EST and mRNA information, as was done by Hahn et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b070">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b071">71</xref>&#x0005d;, or the human SNP dataset &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b072">72</xref>&#x0005d;, could help our method identify human polymorphic gene losses. Overlapping those alleles with human disease loci, such as those documented in OMIM database &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b073">73</xref>&#x0005d; or identified by genetic association studies, might lead to the identification of new human disease associated genes. Another factor that may cause the method to overlook gene losses is related to segmental duplication. After a gene is duplicated, both the ancestral copy (the copy in the original genomic context) and the daughter copy (the copy duplicated in the new genomic context) are equally subject to degenerative mutations. Since our analysis evaluates based on the status of the ancestral copy, if evolution silences the daughter copy, it will not be identified by our method. However, this type of false negative is quite limited in our results because it only applies when a segmental duplication occurred after the boreoeutherian common ancestor. Treating the daughter copy in the same way as the ancestral copy will solve this problem, except in the case of a tandem segmental duplication, where it is difficult to distinguish the ancestral copy from the daughter copy.</p><p>Among the 26 losses of well-established genes, six were identified to be lost independently in the human and old world monkey lineages (numbers 8, 11, 12, 13, 15, 25 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030247-t001">Table 1</xref>). This can be interpreted as a confirmation for adaptive evolution, if we believe that a common selection pressure forced these genes to be lost in separate clades. Other known independent losses such as Caspase15 and Gpr33 seem to confirm this hypothesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b074">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b075">75</xref>&#x0005d;. An alternative interpretation is that the gene function is no longer needed, such as the loss of <italic>GULO</italic> in guinea pigs and humans &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. However, it is also quite probable that the original loss did not occur independently on different lineages, but rather a common mutation that was missed by the analysis might have occurred earlier on a shared ancestor to inactivate the gene. This might have been a mutation in a noncoding region, or a mutation that was erased by secondary mutations such as genomic deletions. For example, a prior, noncoding mutation in any of the six cases we found could have disrupted the transcription, translation, or regulatory signals of the gene in the common ancestor of old world monkeys and apes, rendering the gene effectively inactive at the time that these lineages split. Since the gene is no longer under selective pressure to maintain its integrity, secondary ORF-disrupting mutations could follow, occurring independently in the separate lineages, as observed by our analysis.</p><p>To identify genes that are truly lost, we have focused on regions lacking any reported mRNA evidence, including in cell lines derived from cancer cells. A large number of candidates with differential mutational status in the human and dog gene predictions (918 out of 1,008) were filtered out because they overlap with some mRNA evidence in humans. The majority of these are likely to be TransMap prediction errors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030247-sd001">Text S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030247-st001">Table S1</xref>). However, some pseudogenes still generate transcripts if the transcription signal is intact, and these would be overlooked by our method. An example of a transcribed pseudogene in the human genome that appears on this list is <italic>CATSPER2</italic> (chr15: 41815434&#x02013;41825788), represented by GenBank mRNA BC066967, and BC047442. The mammalian gene collection annotates it as a transcribed pseudogene. If a pseudogene is transcribed and spliced, its mRNA transcript with ORF-disrupting mutations (i.e., premature stop codon) is targeted and degraded by the cell's RNA surveillance pathway of nonsense mediated decay &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b076">76</xref>&#x0005d;, although this process may not be complete. Only with time will these pseudogenes will be completely silenced at the level of transcription. In addition, studies have shown that occasionally a pseudogene, like Makorin1, not only transcribes but also plays a vital biological role in stabilizing the mRNA of its homologous coding gene &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b077">77</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus it is difficult to prove that a transcribed pseudogene is completely nonfunctional.</p><p>Theories of molecular evolution suggest three outcomes for new genes arising from gene duplication: degeneration due to functional redundancy, evolution into a new function, or function sharing by both copies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. The expected time that elapses before a gene is inactivated is thought to be relatively short &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. Lynch and Conery estimated the half-life of a new duplicate to be around 16 My in the human lineage &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b078">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b079">79</xref>&#x0005d;. Using this estimate, after our cutoff of 50 My, 11&#x00025; of redundant genes caused by duplications are expected to be intact by chance. After 60 My (the shortest estimation that passes the cutoff in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030247-t002">Table 2</xref>), only 7.5&#x00025; will be left. Twenty-six candidates in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030247-t002">Table 2</xref> are classified as losses of established genes using the 50 My cutoff, and many have an estimated functional period after duplication that is much longer than 50 My. This suggests that they are likely to have evolved independent functions before pseudogenization and thus likely to be true losses of well-established genes. In addition, our method used the lower-bound estimation for the functional time length for this classification. Although the higher-bound estimations for four candidates (<italic>PFPL</italic>, <italic>ABCA14</italic>, <italic>LOC344492</italic>, <italic>BC018465</italic> in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030247-t002">Table 2</xref>) satisfy the 50 My cutoff, their low estimations do not. As complete genome sequences for additional mammals become available in the future, the timing of duplication and pseudogenization can be greatly refined, potentially classifying some of these four candidates as losses of established genes as well.</p><p>It is nontrivial to determine whether these losses we have found were truly adaptive. It is very likely that neutral losses at dispensable loci account for a subset of our results. For example, <italic>GULO</italic>, a vitamin C biosynthesis gene, is thought to have been lost in primates because primates have ample dietary supply of ascorbic acid, reducing or removing the selective pressure that maintains this gene. In general, it is difficult to differentiate between neutral loss due to removal of selective pressure, as proposed by the &#x0201c;use it or lose it hypothesis,&#x0201d; and positively selected adaptive loss, as by the &#x0201c;less is more&#x0201d; hypothesis, without knowing the gene's precise biological functions. Given our current knowledge of human genes, identifying the losses of established genes seem to be the best strategy in the search for more ancient (before 250 Mya) adaptive gene losses on a genomic scale. The resulting list is a much more enriched set of candidates.</p><p>In summary, our analysis identified a set of losses that are highly enriched for well-established genes in the human genome against a large background of pseudogenes. Expanding these results to include genes and genomes from the entire mammalian clade will generate a more accurate and comprehensive picture of adaptive gene losses in human evolution. From a theoretical standpoint, it will provide insight into the role that loss of functional genes plays in evolutionary adaptation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030247-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;.
