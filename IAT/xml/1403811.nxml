In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, the switch to increased stress resistance to promote survival through periods of starvation is regulated by the DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor. Reduction-of-function mutations in AGE-1, the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans </italic>Class IA phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), increase lifespan and stress resistance in a <italic>daf-16 </italic>dependent manner. Class IA PI3Ks downregulate FOXOs by inducing their translocation to the cytoplasm. However, the circumstances under which AGE-1 is normally activated are unclear. To address this question we used <italic>C. elegans </italic>first stage larvae (L1s), which when starved enter a developmentally-arrested diapause stage until food is encountered.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We find that in L1s both starvation and <italic>daf-16 </italic>are necessary to confer resistance to oxidative stress in the form of hydrogen peroxide. Accordingly, DAF-16 is localised to cell nuclei after short-term starvation. However, after long-term starvation, DAF-16 unexpectedly translocates to the cytoplasm. This translocation requires functional <italic>age-1</italic>. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>treatment can replicate the translocation and induce generation of the AGE-1 product PIP<sub>3</sub>. Because feeding reduces to zero in ageing adult <italic>C. elegans</italic>, these animals may also undergo long-term starvation. Consistent with our observation in L1s, DAF-16 also translocates to the cytoplasm in old adult worms in an <italic>age-1</italic>-dependent manner.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>DAF-16 is activated in the starved L1 diapause. The translocation of DAF-16 to the cytoplasm after long-term starvation may be a feedback mechanism that prevents excessive expenditure on stress resistance. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>is a candidate second messenger in this feedback mechanism. The lack of this response in <italic>age-1(hx546) </italic>mutants suggests a novel mechanism by which this mutation increases longevity.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>A widely held view in ageing research is that the rate of ageing is influenced by the division of resources between growth rate and reproduction on one hand, and somatic maintenance on the other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. This theory proposes that evolution sets the level of somatic maintenance to be just sufficient to prevent damage that would interfere with growth and reproduction but not waste energy that could be otherwise used to produce offspring or increase the rate of development. Thus, rather than being an active programme, ageing results from the eventual failure of the somatic maintenance set by this balance. However, the balance of resources between somatic maintenance and reproduction must also be responsive to the environment because external conditions affect growth and development and can vary considerably. Understanding this plasticity may help us understand how ageing is regulated and is subject to external interventions.</p><p>In the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16 plays a major role in mediating changes in resource allocation in response to environmental change. Firstly, DAF-16 is required for entry into the diapausal (developmental and growth arrested) dauer stage under conditions of starvation and overcrowding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Formation of this stress-resistant alternative to the normal third larval stage (L3) involves several morphogenetic and metabolic changes and upregulation of somatic maintenance genes. Dauer larvae can survive for several months until they find food, upon which they resume normal development into adults that have a normal lifespan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Secondly, outside its role in dauer formation, DAF-16 activity is associated with increased stress resistance and survival and reduced reproductive fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Most studies of DAF-16 have focussed on its role in mediating the phenotypes of mutants of the <italic>C. elegans </italic>insulin/IGF like signalling (IIS) pathway. Activation of this pathway leads to the translocation of DAF-16 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. When this pathway is disrupted by mutations such as reduction-of-function mutants of the <italic>daf-2 </italic>insulin-like receptor or the <italic>age-1 </italic>Class IA phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), the propensity to form dauers, stress resistance and adult lifespan are all increased as a result of DAF-16 activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Studying gene expression in these mutants has led to the identification of many genes upregulated by DAF-16 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. These genes are involved in several processes that may increase lifespan, including those clearly involved in somatic maintenance such as heat shock proteins and antioxidant proteins. Consistent with the cost of DAF-16 activation, long-lived <italic>daf-2 </italic>animals show reduced fertility and cannot compete with the wild type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, overexpression of DAF-16 using transgenes slows development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and <italic>daf-16 </italic>reduction of function by RNAi or mutation causes worms to reach reproductive adulthood slightly before wild type animals ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], unpublished observations), suggesting that even in the wild type, DAF-16 acts to slow development.</p><p>In contrast to <italic>daf-2 </italic>mutants, the long-lived <italic>age-1(hx546) </italic>mutant is able to compete with the wild type over several generations when the two strains are mixed under standard culture conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, the <italic>age-1(hx546) </italic>mutant loses the ability to compete with the wild type if the mixed population is exposed to repeated cycles of starvation and feeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. These competition experiments are very sensitive to small changes in fitness and suggest that the <italic>age-1(hx546) </italic>mutation does not cause constitutive activation of DAF-16 but interferes with the ability of the worm to adapt to changing conditions. In agreement with this conclusion, a study of DAF-16 localisation reported no effect of the <italic>age-1(hx546) </italic>mutation under normal culture conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. <italic>age-1(hx546) </italic>is a reduction-of-function mutant rather than a null mutation and its molecular nature is unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Interestingly, only with age do <italic>age-1(hx546) </italic>mutants become resistant to hydrogen peroxide and show elevated levels of superoxide dismutase and catalase activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In summary, the <italic>age-1(hx546) </italic>mutation appears to affect the animal only during starvation and in ageing adults, so understanding how AGE-1 regulates DAF-16 during these conditions may reveal how this mutation causes increased longevity.</p><p>In this study, we focus on the starvation-induced first larval stage (L1) diapause [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional File 1</xref>]. Like the dauer stage, the L1 diapause allows <italic>C. elegans </italic>to survive periods of long-term starvation. Starved L1s survive several weeks and time in this condition has no effect on subsequent adult lifespan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, unlike the dauer diapause, there are no obvious morphological changes in the starved L1 that might protect the larvae from external stresses. We investigated how L1 larvae respond to oxidative stress and have shown that starvation induces resistance to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>in a <italic>daf-16</italic>-dependent manner. Consistent with these results, DAF-16 was localised in cell nuclei after short-term starvation. However, after long-term starvation, DAF-16a::GFP translocated to the cytoplasm and this translocation was absent in the <italic>age-1(hx546) </italic>mutant. We show that a similar effect occurs in old worms as they become starved with age. These data suggest a novel mechanism underlying longevity in weak <italic>age-1 </italic>mutants and reveals an unexpected negative regulation of FOXO transcription by Class IA PI3Ks in response to starvation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>To investigate the function and regulation of DAF-16 under conditions in which <italic>C. elegans </italic>encounter starvation, we turned to the L1 diapause. This diapause state is entered once larvae hatch from their eggshells in the absence of food. These larvae arrest in development and are viable without food for weeks, re-entering normal development when food is encountered. Unlike the dauer diapause, the L1 diapause can be entered (and exited) by mutants lacking functional <italic>daf-16</italic>. This property makes the L1 diapause a physiologically relevant model for studying DAF-16 function and regulation in response to starvation and other stresses.</p><p>Most studies of <italic>daf-16 </italic>function have been carried out in the context of its role in the stress-resistance and extend lifespan of IIS mutants. Under standard growth conditions, mutation of <italic>daf-16 </italic>alone only slightly increases susceptibility to stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, in this study we find that in the L1 diapause, mutation of <italic>daf-16 </italic>has a dramatic effect on the response of larvae to an acute treatment of hydrogen peroxide. For these experiments, we isolated L1s hatched in the absence of food in an aqueous phosphate buffer and exposed them to a range of concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>for 45 minutes (see Methods). We then washed away the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>and transferred the worms to agar plates containing bacterial food to reinitiate development and assess the long-term effects. The short-term effect of the treatment was to inhibit movement, but the major long-term effect was to cause an abnormal developmental arrest. For example, wild type larvae assessed two days after a treatment of 1 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>remained permanently at a size corresponding to L2 or L3 stage and displayed very sluggish, uncoordinated movement. Starved L1s with loss-of-function mutations in <italic>daf-16 </italic>were very sensitive to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>treatment: 0.25 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>caused over 80% permanent arrest of <italic>daf-16(m27) </italic>or <italic>daf-16(mu86) </italic>mutants compared to no permanent arrest for the wild type (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B, F</xref>). The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>sensitivity of <italic>daf-16 </italic>mutants was fully rescued by a transgene expressing a DAF-16a::GFP fusion protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), confirming the role of <italic>daf-16 </italic>in conferring H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>resistance.</p><p>To investigate the role of starvation, we tested the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>resistance of L1s hatched in the presence of food on agar plates. In contrast to starved larvae, these fed larvae showed high sensitivity to 0.25 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>(Figure ID) and it made little difference whether fed L1s were mutant for <italic>daf-16 </italic>or not (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). These results demonstrate that <italic>daf-16</italic>-dependent protection of larvae from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>depends on environmental conditions and is consistent with the hypothesis that DAF-16 is only activated when its transcriptional targets are needed for survival.</p><p>Mutation of the AGE-1 PI3K/Akt pathway affects <italic>daf-16 </italic>activity in dauer formation and lifespan. To test whether mutation of this pathway regulates the ability of <italic>daf-16 </italic>to protect starved L1s against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, we quantified the resistance of mutants in the pathway using the assay described above. In order to assess how conditions and genotype affect H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>resistance, we used H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>concentrations that resulted in developmental arrest of a quantifiable proportion of the test population. For example, after treatment with 0.5 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>approximately 30% of wild type larvae were permanently arrested at the L2/L3 stage, 20% were unaffected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, F</xref> and data not shown) and approximately 50% were temporarily delayed in development because they reached adulthood approximately one day later than did untreated controls.</p><p>Under these conditions, L1s with <italic>age-1(hx546) </italic>mutation showed increased resistance to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>). We next tested a gain-of-function mutation in the downstream kinase <italic>akt-1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and a reduction-of-function mutation in <italic>daf-18 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], the PIP<sub>3 </sub>3-phosphatase PTEN. These mutations activate the AGE-1 pathway and, in comparison to the wild type, they caused starved L1s to be more sensitive to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>). We also used a lower concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>(0.25 mM &#x02013; which had no effect on the wild type) to differentiate these hypersensitive mutants further (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>). Thus, mutation of the AGE-1 pathway affects the ability of DAF-16 to protect worms from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Although useful for identifying genes involved in a process, genetic analysis such as described above does not provide information on where, when or how genes are acting. To try to answer some of these questions, we investigated the subcellular localisation of DAF-16 because control of the presence of FOXO in the nucleus, where it acts as a transcription factor, is thought to be a major mechanism of its regulation. DAF-16 has been shown to translocate to the cell nucleus in response to heat stress, certain oxidative stresses and starvation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. To investigate how starvation and oxidative stress influence DAF-16 activity in our system, we examined DAF-16 localisation in L1 larvae, using a strain previously characterised in a study by Lin et al. in 2001 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This strain contained the transgene <italic>muIs71</italic>, an integrated DAF-16a::GFP construct that rescues <italic>daf-16 </italic>activity. In L1s hatched in the presence of food, we found that, as previously reported, DAF-16a::GFP was located in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). However, in over 70% of L1s hatched in liquid culture and starved for one day, DAF-16a::GFP was localised solely to the nucleus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B, E</xref>). This result is consistent with the idea that localisation of DAF-16 in the nucleus is the mechanism by which starvation confers oxidative stress resistance.</p><p>However, in L1s starved for two days or more, we found that DAF-16a::GFP translocates back to the cytoplasm and was distinctly excluded from the nucleus in over 70% of larvae (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). This translocation of the DAF-16 transcription factor to the cytoplasm upon long-term starvation might be expected to lead to a decrease in the transcription of target genes and therefore an increased sensitivity to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced arrest. However, when we tested this hypothesis using the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>resistance assay described above, we found that after three days of starvation larvae displayed levels of resistance similar to if not greater than those of larvae starved for one day (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This resistance was still dependent on <italic>daf-16 </italic>activity because <italic>daf-16 </italic>mutants were still hypersensitive to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>after three days (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). These results suggest that even though DAF-16 translocates to the cytoplasm upon prolonged starvation, sufficient <italic>daf-16 </italic>dependent transcription and translation of somatic maintenance genes has already occurred to provide long-term stress resistance. Thus, one possibility is that translocation to the cytoplasm after long term starvation prevents excess expenditure of resources on somatic maintenance processes.</p><p>A likely mechanism for the translocation of DAF-16 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is the activation of the AGE-1 pathway. To test this possibility, we examined DAF-16a::GFP in starved L1s with the <italic>age-1(hx546) </italic>mutation. In these larvae DAF-16a::GFP remained in the nucleus, both on day one and during subsequent days of starvation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D, E</xref>). Continuous localisation of DAF-16 to the nucleus in the <italic>age-1(hx546) </italic>mutants may increase allocation of resources to stress resistance. This increased expenditure might explain why this mutant is unable to compete with the wild type during cycles of feeding and starvation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The <italic>age-1 </italic>dependent DAF-16 translocation we have discovered also suggests that long-term starvation activates AGE-1, which is a surprising conclusion considering current models proposing that Class IA PI3Ks are downstream targets of insulin-induced signalling in response to feeding. Recently a starvation-dependent, PI3K-dependent gene target has been identified in a human cancer cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. One possibility is that long-term starvation relieves a nutrition-induced feedback mechanism that downregulates PI3K signalling in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p><italic>age-1</italic>-dependent DAF-16 translocation in response to prolonged starvation might be a consequence of endocrine stimulation or might occur through the upregulation of a cellular signal. One candidate for such a signal is H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>itself, which has been shown to act as an intracellular second messenger. This molecule can activate the PI3K/AKT pathway to cause FOXO3a to translocate to the cytoplasm of mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. To explore whether this response was conserved in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we treated larvae starved for one day with increasing concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. We found that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, like long-term starvation, caused DAF-16a::GFP to translocate from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A, B</xref>). In a previous study, oxidative stress in the form of the superoxide producer juglone had been shown to cause DAF-16 to translocate to nucleus in fed L2 larvae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. We found that, in L1s starved for one day, neither juglone nor paraquat, another superoxide producer, had any significant effect on DAF-16a::GFP localisation (data not shown), possibly because DAF-16 is already mainly nuclear in these larvae. Thus, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>has a different effect from superoxide producers on DAF-16 localisation.</p><p>Importantly, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced translocation of DAF-16a::GFP was ablated in the <italic>age-1(hx-546) </italic>mutant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>), suggesting that AGE-1 mediates DAF-16 translocation to the cytoplasm upon H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>treatment. To test the involvement of AGE-1 further, we developed techniques to determine whether phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) trisphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>), the lipid product of AGE-1, is actually produced in <italic>C. elegans </italic>in response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. We found that, as in mammals, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>did indeed stimulate PIP<sub>3 </sub>production in starved <italic>C. elegans </italic>L1s (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). No PIP<sub>3 </sub>was produced in <italic>age-1(mg44) </italic>null mutants that were made viable by the <italic>daf-16(m27) </italic>loss-of-function mutation, demonstrating that PIP<sub>3 </sub>generation requires the AGE-1 Class IA PI3K. Next, we tested the long-lived <italic>age-1(hx546) </italic>mutant for PIP<sub>3 </sub>production. Despite the uncertainty about the molecular nature of this mutant, we found that no detectable PIP<sub>3 </sub>was produced in <italic>age-1(hx546) </italic>larvae after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>stimulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Thus, in starved L1s, the <italic>hx546 </italic>mutation blocks the ability of the AGE-1 Class IA PI3K to produce PIP<sub>3 </sub>in response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Although it is technically difficult to test whether H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>is the endogenous signal that causes DAF-16 translocation to the cytoplasm after prolonged starvation, there have been several studies that make it a good candidate. Reactive oxygen species have been shown to increase upon serum or glucose starvation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>can stimulate receptor tyrosine kinase signalling through its inhibitory effect on receptor tyrosine phosphatases. In addition, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>can inhibit PTEN activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], stimulate the association of mammalian Class IA PI3Ks with Ras [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and activate Type I PIP kinase dependent PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>-5-kinase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. All the above mechanisms could lead to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced PIP<sub>3 </sub>synthesis. Alternatively there could be a direct upregulation of IIS signalling in response to DAF-16 activation. A number of potential insulin-like ligands are upregulated in <italic>daf-2 </italic>mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and a recent study demonstrated that the <italic>Drosophila </italic>insulin receptor homologue was dramatically upregulated in flies overexpressing activated dFOXO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>As worms age, their pharyngeal pumping rate slowly reduces to zero [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. We wondered whether this reduction of food intake causes long-term starvation and therefore investigated whether DAF-16 translocates to the cytoplasm of cells in old adult worms. The data published by Henderson and Johnson using a DAF-16::GFP fusion transgene suggest that in adults under standard laboratory conditions without starvation, the nuclear localisation of DAF-16 is not sufficient to discern nuclei. However, in the strain used in their study, DAF-16::GFP is expressed at noticeably higher levels than the strains used in this study, and they recently been reported that their transgene contains a missense mutation in the DAF-16 sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Consistent with the initial description of the transgenes used in our study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], we found that in reproductively active three day old adults raised at 20&#x000b0;C, DAF-16 was localised to both the cytoplasm and nuclei of cells with nuclei visible as distinct spots (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>).</p><p>However, as worms aged we found that nuclei became progressively less distinct, indicating a translocation to the cytoplasm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). In three day old worms carrying the <italic>age-1(hx546) </italic>mutation, DAF-16 localisation was similar to that seen in wild type worms of the same age, although nuclei were slightly more distinct than seen in the wild type (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). However, in older <italic>age-1(hx546) </italic>mutants, DAF-16 became more nuclear and there was no translocation to the cytoplasm. Even in very old worms that were close to death as assessed by age, movement and appearance, cell nuclei were visible as distinct spots of GFP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Thus, there is an <italic>age-1</italic>-dependent translocation of DAF-16 to the cytoplasm in old worms. The lack of this age-dependent translocation in <italic>age-1(hx546) </italic>mutants may result in increased DAF-16 activity and hence explain the increased resistance to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>and antioxidant activities observed in these mutants as they age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Mice lacking the adaptor protein p66Shc, which binds to receptor tyrosine kinases, have an extended lifespan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Interestingly, in cells derived from these mice, there is a defect in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced translocation of FOXO3a to the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. We have demonstrated a physiological whole-organism situation in which a FOXO transcription factor translocates to the cytoplasm and shown that this response is defective in worms carrying the <italic>age-1(hx546) </italic>mutation, which has a strong effect on DAF-16 localisation only after prolonged starvation or ageing. Like this mutant, the p66Shc mutant mouse has increased stress resistance without obvious deleterious effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. We propose a model whereby in these mutants, an evolutionarily-conserved response to prolonged starvation is traded for increased longevity.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>DAF-16/FOXO is nuclear-localised and active in the starved L1 diapause to enhance stress resistance but translocates back to the cytoplasm after long-term starvation in a manner dependent on <italic>age-1/PI3K </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). We propose this response is a negative feedback mechanism that prevents overexpenditure on resources during starvation. A similar effect is observed in adult worms. Disruption of this translocation may explain how the increased longevity of the <italic>age-1(hx546) </italic>mutant has no detrimental effects apart from the cost of competiveness during cycles of starvation and feeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Nematode culture and strains</title><p>Worms were cultured at 20&#x000b0;C on standard nematode growth medium (NGM), either using the <italic>E.

Gravid adult worms in an excess of bacterial food were washed from 9 cm NGM agar plates into an Eppendorf tube using M9 buffer (41 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 22 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 86 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>). Adults were allowed to settle for a few minutes and the supernatant was removed until there was a volume of approximately 200 &#x003bc;l in the tube. 150 &#x003bc;l of bleach solution (7:8 sodium hypochlorite: 4 M NaOH) was added. The tube was shaken and monitored continually until the adults had dissolved (usually after 4 to 5 minutes). To stop the bleaching, the tube was filled up with M9 and centrifuged for one minute at 660 g. The supernatant was removed completely and replaced with fresh M9. The pellet was disassociated by rigorous shaking and the wash step repeated. The resulting eggs were left to hatch in liquid culture: 350&#x02013;500 &#x003bc;l M9 buffer in a 24-well tissue culture plate. To make fed L1s, the eggs were spotted on NGM agar plates with a spot of OP50-1 <italic>E. coli </italic>food and used as soon as the majority of eggs had hatched (usually after 12&#x02013;14 hours). Starved L1s in were used approximately 20 hours after bleaching. For the acute exposure to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, 100&#x02013;200 larvae were exposed to various concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, dissolved in total volume of 500&#x003bc;l M9 in a 24-well plate. After approx 30 minutes, larvae were transferred to Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 2500 rpm for one minute. The supernatant was removed and replaced with M9, precisely 45 minutes after initial exposure to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The worms were sedimented again by centrifugation, the supernatant removed, and the worms placed on a spot of OP50-1 on NGM agar and placed in a 20&#x000b0;C incubator. Two days later the larvae were assessed for developmental stage. At this time point, untreated worms reached the L4 stage so effects on development could be assessed without the complication of adults producing progeny. L3 and L4 worms were scored as not permanently arrested (L3s at this time point are usually temporally arrested). Smaller worms were scored as permanently arrested.</p></sec><sec><title>Visualising DAF-16a::GFP</title><p>To visualise DAF-16a::GFP in live L1 larvae, they were placed, after treatment, on a chilled agar pad on a microscope slide, covered with a glass coverslip and left for 10 to 30 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C to reduce movement. The slides were then examined under inverted fluorescence imaging. For each experiment we captured several images of the neurons in the head region where the subcellular localisation of DAF-16a::GFP was clear. These images were used to quantify differences in localisation between test populations. Adult worms were kept in cohorts to determine age and examined using inverted fluorescence imaging without anaesthetics.</p></sec><sec><title>Detecting PIP<sub>3 </sub>in <italic>C. elegans </italic>larvae</title><p>Starved L1 larvae (prepared as described above starting with several large plates of adults) were washed into the phosphate-free "worm HEPES buffer (WHB)" (50 mM HEPES pH7.2, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>) and pooled so that there were 1&#x02013;2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4 </sup>larvae in a 500 &#x003bc;l volume in a single well of a 24-well tissue culture dish. <sup>32</sup>P orthophosphate (0.5 mCi, Amersham Biosciences) was added and the larvae were incubated at room temperature with gentle shaking for 4 hours. Larvae were transferred to tubes and washed twice with 15 ml WHB, resuspended in 250 &#x003bc;l WHB and put into a fresh 24 well plate in a total volume of 500 &#x003bc;l WHB with the appropriate concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. After the treatment, larvae were centrifuged in Eppendorf tubes and the supernatant removed to leave a total volume of approx 50 &#x003bc;l. Forty-five minutes after addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, larvae were stopped with150 &#x003bc;l 2.4N HCl, 500 &#x003bc;l methanol and 250 &#x003bc;l chloroform containing lipid carrier (Folch Type I extract (Sigma) and 0.05% neomycin-purified lipids from Folch fraction). This single phase extraction was performed at room temperature with intermittent vortexing for 30 minutes. The contents of each tube were added to a 2 ml tube containing 250 &#x003bc;l chloroform/carrier, 100 &#x003bc;l 2.4N HCl and 150 &#x003bc;l H<sub>2</sub>O, and centrifuged. The bottom phase was removed and washed with theoretical upper phase. The lipids were extracted a second time with 500 chloroform/carrier and dried down. Lipids were deacetylated with methylamine and resolved on PEI cellulose plate using 0.45 M HCl as a solvent as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3 </sub>standard was generated by phosphorylating PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2 </sub>with recombinant human p110alpha in the presence of <sup>32</sup>P&#x003b3; ATP. Higher concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>were needed to generate PIP<sub>3 </sub>reproducibly than were used to induce a developmental arrest in previous experiments because approximately 50 times more larvae were used for the biochemical analysis. These larger numbers of larvae required higher concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>to induce developmental arrest (data not shown), probably because the larvae buffer H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. We have observed PIP<sub>3 </sub>production with as low as 1 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>(data not shown) and increased PIP<sub>3 </sub>production with increasing H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>PI3K &#x02013; phosphoinositide 3-kinase, PIP<sub>3 </sub>&#x02013; phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) trisphosphate, WHB &#x02013; worm HEPES buffer, PtdIns -phosphatidylinositol</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>DW conceived of, designed and performed all the experiments and drafted the manuscript.

The first stage larva hatches from the eggshell. In the presence of food the larva continues through four larval stages until it becomes a fertile adult. If the larva hatches in the absence of food it will enter the L1 diapause without undergoing the cell division cycles that normally occur in the L1 stage. When food is encountered, the larva will re-enter normal development. If there is a lack of food and/or overcrowding at the end of L1, the larva will enter a developmental program that results in entry into the dauer stage, a morphologically distinct alternative to L3. When food is re-encountered, the dauer larvae will enter L4, resuming normal development.</p></caption><media xlink:href="1741-7007-4-1-S1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for file</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Cynthia Kenyon and the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center for strains.
