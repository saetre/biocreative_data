Protein kinase CK2 plays multiple roles in the regulation of gene expression and cell proliferation. Here, we show that PRH interacts with the &#x003b2; subunit of CK2 <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> and in cells and that CK2 phosphorylates PRH. Phosphorylation of PRH by CK2 inhibits the DNA binding activity of this protein and dephosphorylation restores DNA binding indicating that this modification acts as a reversible switch. We show that phosphorylation of the homeodomain is sufficient to block DNA binding and we identify two amino acids within this the domain that are phosphorylated by CK2: S163 and S177. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrates that mutation of either of these residues to glutamic acid partially mimics phosphorylation but is insufficient to completely block DNA binding whereas an S163E/S177E double mutation severely inhibits DNA binding. Significantly, the S163E and S177E mutations and the S163E/S177E double mutation all inhibit the ability of PRH to regulate transcription in cells. Since these amino acids are conserved between many homeodomain proteins, our results suggest that CK2 may regulate the activity of several homeodomain proteins in this manner.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Phosphorylation of transcription factors forms a link between signal transduction pathways and the expression of genes. Phosphorylation can control the activity of transcription factors by altering their DNA-binding affinity, sub-cellular compartmentalization, stability or ability to form protein&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Protein kinase CK2 (formerly casein kinase II) is a ubiquitously expressed kinase that regulates multiple proteins involved in transcription, signalling, cell proliferation and DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). In general, CK2 has growth promoting and oncogenic properties. CK2 is a tetramer consisting of &#x003b1; and &#x003b1;&#x02032; subunits (forming the catalytic domain) and a &#x003b2; subunit dimer (forming the regulatory domain). CK2 usually phosphorylates serine and threonine residues and the consensus phosphorylation site is (S/T)XXD/E where X represents any amino acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). The CK2&#x003b2; subunit is important in the assembly of CK2, enzyme stability and enzyme activity. It can interact with modulators of CK2 activity as well as with CK2 substrates and is thought to be required for the selection of substrates. CK2&#x003b2; also has roles that are independent of CK2 enzymatic activity and these include the negative regulation of cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>A number of homeodomain proteins that control transcription are regulated by CK2 including the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homeodomain proteins Antennapaedia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), Eve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) and En (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) and the mammalian homeodomain proteins Hoxb-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), Cut/CDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), Csx/Nk2.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) and SIX1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Phosphorylation of homeodomain proteins by CK2 at sites outside the homeodomain has been shown to influence protein&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), DNA-binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) and protein trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). In some cases CK2 phosphorylation of these proteins has an effect on cell-cycle progression. For example, Six1 plays a role in regulation of the G2/M cell-cycle checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Phosphorylation of Six1 by CK2 at sites located outside the homeodomain occurs during interphase and mitosis. Phosphorylation inhibits the DNA-binding activity of Six1 and this may contribute to regulation of the G2/M checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Few homeodomain proteins are phosphorylated by CK2 at sites within the homeodomain. However, the Csx/Nk2.5 protein is phosphorylated at a consensus CK2 site located within the homeodomain and this site is conserved in the Nk and Six class homeodomain proteins. CK2 phosphorylation at this site increases the DNA-binding activity of Nk2.5; however, the outcome of phosphorylation on transcriptional activity is not clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p>The proline-rich homeodomain (PRH) protein (also known as Hex) regulates both cell differentiation and cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). PRH is critical for many processes in embryonic development including embryonic patterning, formation of head, forebrain, thyroid and liver and heart and development of the vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17 B18">15&#x02013;18</xref>). PRH also has a number of functions in the adult including that of a regulator of haematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19 B20 B21 B22 B23 B24">19&#x02013;24</xref>). Exogenous expression of PRH inhibits cell proliferation and cellular transformation of haematopoietic cells of myeloid lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). However, PRH can also function as an oncoprotein in haematopoietic cells of T-cell lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Interestingly, PRH can both activate and repress transcription and regulate mRNA transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Our recent work has shown that PRH is oligomeric <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> and in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). The protein appears to consist of three domains: an N-terminal domain that is 20% proline, a central homeodomain that mediates binding to DNA, and an acidic C-terminal domain. The N-terminal domain is required for oligomerization and for the inhibition of myeloid cell proliferation and cell transformation by PRH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). The N-terminal domain contains a region that interacts with the promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) RING-finger protein and a region that interacts with eIF4e in PML nuclear bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). The interaction between PRH and eIF4E inhibits the transport of some mRNAs involved in growth regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). The N-terminal domain also contains two regions that confer the ability to repress transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). An Eh1 motif located within the first 46 amino acids of this domain mediates the binding of PRH to members of the Groucho/TLE family of co-repressor proteins and thereby allows PRH to recruit TLE co-repressor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Binding of PRH to TLE proteins results in the increased phosphorylation and nuclear retention of TLE proteins resulting in transcriptional repression by the PRH-TLE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). A second region within the N-terminal domain (amino acids 46&#x02013;131) is able to repress transcription in the absence of the first 46 amino acids although with less efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). The PRH homeodomain can repress transcription independently of the N-terminal domain by binding to TATA&#x000a0;box&#x000a0;sequences and competing with the TATA&#x000a0;box&#x000a0;binding protein for these sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). PRH can also bind to TBP and this may also inhibit transcription by blocking assembly of the pre-initiation complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). In addition, PRH can repress transcription by binding to proteins that would otherwise activate transcription. For example, PRH binds to c-jun and blocks the ability of c-jun to activate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Similarly, PRH binds to GATA-2 and prevents this protein from activating transcription although in this case, PRH inhibits the binding of GATA-2 to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). The C-terminal domain of PRH has been less intensively characterized but is reported to be required for the activation of transcription by PRH in haematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>).</p><p>Here we demonstrate that PRH interacts with CK2&#x003b2;. We show that CK2 phosphorylates PRH <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> and in cells and that phosphorylation inhibits the DNA-binding activity of PRH <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic>. We map two sites of CK2 phosphorylation in the PRH homeodomain and we show that phosphorylation of these sites blocks the DNA-binding activity of PRH <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> and inhibits transcriptional repression by PRH in cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast two hybrid screen</title><p>A human Erythroleukaemia Matchmaker cDNA library prepared from K562 cells in pACT2 was obtained from Clontech and amplified once before screening. pACT2-CK2&#x003b2; was isolated from the library and encodes the CK2&#x003b2;cDNA (amino acids 1&#x02013;215) cloned in frame with GAL4 activation domain (AD). pAS2-1-HPRH (1&#x02013;271), pAS2-1-PRH<sub>N1&#x02013;132</sub> and pAS2-1-PRH<sub>N1&#x02013;98</sub> encode the full-length human PRH protein and truncated PRH proteins fused to GAL4 DBD and have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>).

The nucleotides encoding amino acids S163 and S177 within the pTrcAHisPRH HD construct were mutated using a QuikChange Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. This created pTrcAHisPRH-HD S163E, pTrcAHisPRH-HD S177E and the double mutant pTrcAHisPRH-HD S163E/S177E. pBSKS-CK2&#x003b2;<sub>20-215</sub> was created by subcloning an EcoRI&#x02013;XhoI fragment that encodes CK2&#x003b2; (amino acids 20&#x02013;215) from pACT2-CK2&#x003b2; into pBSKS (Stratagene).

The plasmid pCS2-HA-Hex expresses HA-tagged murine PRH and was a kind gift from Dr. Josh Brickman (University of Edinburgh). The pMUG1-Myc-PRH S163E plasmid was constructed by digesting pMUG1-Myc-PRH with StuI and PstI to release an StuI&#x02013;PstI PRH fragment.

After digestion with StuI and PstI the PCR fragment was inserted into the cut pMUG-Myc-PRH plasmid. The pMUG1-Myc-PRH S177E and S163E/S177E double mutant plasmids were constructed using a QuikChange Mutagenesis kit to introduce the S177E mutation into pMUG1-Myc-PRH and pMUG1-Myc-PRH S163E, respectively. All of the mutants were fully sequenced to confirm the sequence changes.

This screen utilized a human erythroleukaemia matchmaker cDNA library derived from K562 cells and a plasmid that expresses PRH fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (DBD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Yeast cells that express both PRH and a protein that interacts with PRH were identified on the basis of &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity and histidine prototrophy (data not shown). The screen resulted in the isolation of five different cDNA clones. Sequence analysis identified one of the five positive clones as the regulatory &#x003b2; subunit of protein kinase CK2. In order to confirm that PRH interacts with CK2&#x003b2;, we made use of constructs in which amino acids 1&#x02013;132 or 1&#x02013;98 from PRH are fused to the GAL4 DBD and a construct in which CK2&#x003b2; is fused to the GAL4 activation domain (AD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A). None of these constructs alone is capable of inducing &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity in yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>B, columns 1&#x02013;3). However, co-expression of the constructs expressing PRH fusion proteins and CK2&#x003b2; fusion proteins in yeast cells produces significant levels of &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>B, columns 4 and 5). Similarly, the constructs expressing the GAL4 PRH fusion proteins produce significant &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity when co-expressed with a fusion protein consisting of the co-repressor protein TLE1 fused to GAL4 AD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>B, columns 7 and 8). We conclude that amino acids 1&#x02013;98 within the N-terminal domain of PRH are sufficient to interact with CK2&#x003b2; in yeast cells and that this interaction is comparable to the previously characterized interaction between the PRH N-terminal domain and the co-repressor protein TLE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1.</label><caption><p>PRH interacts with CK2&#x003b2; in yeast and <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic>.

These data suggest that CK2&#x003b2; can bind independently to the PRH N-terminal domain and the PRH homeodomain.

In western blotting experiments, the rabbit antisera are able to detect a 37-kDa protein present in K562 nuclear extracts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp197/DC1">Figure&#x000a0;S2A</ext-link>). We confirmed that this protein is PRH by over-expressing HA- and Myc-tagged PRH proteins and showing that the tagged proteins are also detected by the rabbit antisera (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp197/DC1">Figure&#x000a0;S2A</ext-link>, lanes 2 and 3).

We then tested the ability of the rabbit and mouse antisera to recognize PRH that has been incubated with CK2 and ATP or CK2 and ATP followed by CAP. As expected, both antisera recognize purified PRH; this is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>B where a membrane was first probed with the mouse antisera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>B, top panel), and then stripped and reprobed with the rabbit antisera (middle panel). However, the mouse antisera fail to bind, or bind very poorly, to PRH that has been incubated with CK2 and ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>B, top panel, lane 2). Incubation with CAP restores binding of the mouse antisera and induces a slight increase in the mobility of the PRH band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>B, top panel, lane 3). Conversely, the rabbit anti-PRH antisera bind to PRH that has been incubated with CK2 and ATP but does not bind to PRH that has been incubated with CAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>B, middle panel, lanes 2 and 3). These data indicate that the mouse and rabbit anti-PRH antisera preferentially bind to different forms of PRH. The mouse antisera appear to bind preferentially to unphosphorylated PRH, whereas the rabbit antisera appear to bind preferentially to CK2-phosphorylated PRH. It would seem unlikely that the rabbit antisera are phosphospecific since it also recognizes PRH produced in bacterial cells. More likely, these antisera differentially recognize conformational states of PRH that are altered or produced by phosphorylation.</p><p>We next used the mouse and rabbit anti-PRH antisera to examine effects of two CK2 inhibitors on PRH in cells. We incubated K562 cells with the CK2 inhibitors DMAT and TBB for 24&#x02009;h. The cells were then harvested and used to prepare whole-cell extracts for western blotting. Treatment with either inhibitor had no effect on the levels of PRH detected in these extracts using the mouse antisera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>C, top panel). However, both DMAT and TBB significantly reduced the amount of PRH detected after stripping the blot and reprobing with the rabbit antisera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>C, middle panel). Further stripping and reprobing with a LaminA/C antibody confirms equal protein loading in each lane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>C, bottom panel). Since we have shown that the rabbit antisera bind preferentially to CK2-phosphorylated PRH, we conclude that endogenous PRH is phosphorylated by endogenous CK2 in K562 cells.</p><p>To determine the functional consequence of the phosphorylation of PRH by CK2 in cells, we looked at the effect of DMAT on a PRH target gene.

Incubation of cells with DMAT results in a significant decrease in neuropilin-1 gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>D, column 4). Since this gene is a target for repression by PRH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>), we conclude that the loss of PRH phosphorylation by CK2, results in more transcriptionally active PRH being present in the cell and, as a consequence, decreased expression of this PRH target gene.</p></sec><sec><title>Phosphorylation by CK2 inhibits PRH DNA-binding activity</title><p>To determine whether phosphorylation by CK2 has an effect on DNA binding by PRH, we purified full-length human and avian histidine-tagged PRH and performed EMSA after incubation of the proteins with CK2 and ATP.

Incubation of PRH with CK2 alone or with ATP alone prior to EMSA, results in a slight decrease in the DNA-binding activity of PRH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>, lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, incubation of PRH with both CK2 and ATP prior to EMSA results in the almost complete loss of DNA-binding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>, lane 5). If, however, the PRH protein treated with CK2 and ATP is incubated with CAP prior to EMSA, full DNA-binding activity is restored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>, lane 6). Identical results were obtained for the avian PRH protein (data not shown). We conclude that phosphorylation by CK2 acts as a reversible switch for the DNA-binding activity of PRH.

These two serine residues (highlighted in bold) appear to be phosphorylated adding a mass of 160&#x02009;Da (2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;80 for the phosphoryl group) to the non-phosphorylated peptide (2672.21) and giving a total mass of 2832.2&#x02009;Da, which is very close to the measured peak 2829.5 (with a deviation of 2.7). Virtual phosphorylation of other potential tryptic peptides from PRH did not produce any masses close to the observed value of 2829.5&#x02009;Da. Taken together, these data suggest that CK2 phosphorylates PRH on both S163 and S177. Phosphorylation of either or both of these amino acids could be responsible for the abrogation of DNA-binding activity by CK2.</p></sec><sec><title>Phosphorylation of S163 and/or S177 inhibits DNA binding</title><p>To examine the effects of phosphorylation at S163 and S177 on PRH, we mutated these positions to alanine to prevent phosphorylation, or glutamic acid to mimic phosphorylation, either individually or in combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure. 5</xref>A). The mutations were initially produced in the context of the PRH-HD protein construct using site-directed mutagenesis. These mutated proteins were then expressed in bacteria and purified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). However, in each case, mutation to alanine resulted in very low yields of the homeodomain protein and consequently very low levels of DNA binding. We will therefore present data obtained using the glutamic acid mutants. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;5.</label><caption><p>Mutation of S163 or S177 to glutamic acid inhibits DNA binding.

In each case, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>) is untreated PRH, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) is PRH pre-incubated with CK2 and ATP and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) is PRH pre-incubated with CK2 and ATP and then treated with CAP.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkp197f5"/></fig></p><p>Equal amounts of the wild-type and mutated proteins were incubated with CK2 and ATP and then examined by SDS&#x02013;PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>B). The resulting gel was stained with Pro-Q Diamond Phosphoprotein Stain to assess protein phosphorylation followed by staining with Coomassie blue to assess the amount of protein loaded in each lane. Coomassie staining indicates that equal amounts of protein were loaded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>B, bottom panel). Staining for phosphoproteins reveals that the wild-type PRH HD is phosphorylated by CK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>B, top panel, lane 2). However, the S163E and S177E proteins are less strongly stained suggesting that they are partially phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>B, top panel, lanes 3 and 4). This implies that each single mutant is phosphorylated by CK2 at the unmutated site. In contrast, the S163E/S177E double mutant is very poorly stained suggesting that this protein is not phosphorylated. These data suggest that there are no additional CK2 sites within the homeodomain or that if any additional sites are present they are dependent on phosphorylation of S163 and/or S177. To confirm that phosphorylation is reversible we incubated the wild-type and mutated proteins with CK2 and ATP and then treated the phosphorylated proteins with CAP. Treatment with CAP brings about dephosphorylation of the wild-type PRH HD protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>B, top panel, lane 7). Interestingly the phosphorylated S163E and S177E mutants appear to be only partially dephosphorylated after treatment with CAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>B, top panel, lanes 8 and 9). It is possible that in each case the introduced glutamic acid residue might impair the ability of CAP to dephosphorylate the neighbouring serine residue.</p><p>To investigate the DNA-binding activity of the mutated proteins, increasing equivalent amounts of each were added to a labelled DNA carrying a PRH-binding site and the free and bound DNA separated as described above. As expected, the wild-type protein binds to the labelled DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>C, lanes 2&#x02013;4). In contrast, there was poor binding of PRH HD S163E protein to this DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>C, lanes 5&#x02013;7). The PRH HD S177E protein and the double mutant PRH HD S163E/S177E did not bind DNA under the conditions used in these experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>C, lanes 8&#x02013;13). These data suggest that phosphorylation at S177 abolishes DNA binding while phosphorylation at S163 only partially blocks DNA binding. However, it is possible that the S163E mutation does not accurately mimic the effects of phosphorylation due to the flexibility of the glutamic acid side chain. Furthermore, it is also possible that the S177E mutant and the S163E/S177E double mutant are unstable or unfolded. In order to discount the latter possibility, we examined the folding of all four proteins using CD. The CD spectra obtained were identical indicating that each protein has similar secondary structure (data not shown).</p><p>In order to determine whether the DNA-binding activity of the mutated proteins could be stabilized we increased the protein concentration, formed the complexes at 4&#x000b0;C and ran the EMSA gels at low temperature. Under these conditions, the S163E and S177E protein are able to bind to the PRH site albeit less efficiently than the wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>D, lanes 5 and 8). These data confirm that the S177E mutation is not sufficient to completely block DNA binding and suggest that phosphorylation at this position also results in the partial inhibition of DNA binding. These data also show that the S163E mutation does not totally abolish DNA binding suggesting that phosphorylation at S163 is also not sufficient to completely block DNA binding. In each case, treatment with CK2 and ATP significantly reduces this residual DNA-binding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>D, lanes 6 and 9). This experiment confirms that phosphorylation at both positions contributes to the inhibition of DNA binding and that phosphorylation at both positions is required to completely block DNA binding.</p></sec><sec><title>Mutation of S163 and/or S177 inhibits the repression of transcription by PRH</title><p>We next set out to examine the effects of the S163E and S177E mutations on the ability of PRH to repress transcription. In order to do this, the S163E and S177E mutations and the S163E/S177E double mutation were introduced into the full-length PRH protein in the context of Myc-PRH fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>A). The wild-type and mutated full-length proteins were then expressed in K562 cells along with a reporter plasmid carrying the luciferase gene under the control of the TK promoter and five PRH-binding sites. Western blotting shows that wild-type and mutated proteins are expressed at equivalent levels in the transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>A). However, although wild-type PRH represses reporter activity to around 30% of the unrepressed level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>B, column 2), the S163E and S177E mutants and the S163E/S177E double mutant have greatly reduced repression activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>B, columns 3&#x02013;5). We conclude that these mutations inhibit the DNA-binding activity of PRH in cells resulting in a reduction in the ability of these proteins to repress transcription. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;6.</label><caption><p>Mutation of S163 or S177 inhibits transcription repression by PRH.

Moreover, we have demonstrated that there is a decrease in PRH target gene expression in the presence of an inhibitor of CK2. This suggests that a functional consequence of phosphorylation of PRH by CK2 is the inhibition of transcriptional repression by PRH. We have shown that CK2 phosphorylates PRH at two sites within the homeodomain. Phosphorylation at these sites inhibits the DNA-binding activity of PRH <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> and inhibits the transcription repression function of this protein in cells. Although several other homeodomain proteins are substrates for CK2, in these cases phosphorylation generally occurs outside the homeodomain. The cooperative binding to DNA of homeodomain proteins Antennapaedia and Extradenticle, for example, is regulated by CK2 phosphorylation of Antennaepaedia at multiple sites outside the homeodomain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Similarly, Engrailed is phosphorylated by CK2 at sites outside the homeodomain but in this case phosphorylation results in increased DNA-binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) and the inhibition of inter-cellular trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). In contrast, phosphorylation of Csx/Nk2.5 by CK2 occurs within the homeodomain at a consensus CK2 site ([S/T]XX[E/D]) conserved among all NK class homeodomain proteins and identified here as a phosphorylation site S163 in PRH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). However, in the case of Csx/Nk2.5 phosphorylation results in increased DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), S163 is located at the start of the second helix of the PRH homeodomain and this residue is not thought to be involved in binding to DNA. However, model building suggests that this amino acid in PRH could be in close approach to the phosphate backbone in the PRH&#x02013;DNA complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>A). Phosphorylation at this position in PRH would thus place a negative charge close to the DNA phosphate backbone and this would be expected to result in decreased DNA binding. Our mutagenesis data shows that the replacement of S163 with glutamic acid to mimic phosphorylation decreases the DNA-binding activity of PRH but is not sufficient to completely block DNA binding. Surface exposed glutamic acid residues can occupy several positions due to the flexibility of the side chain, and this might explain why DNA binding is reduced but not abolished by this substitution. <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;7.</label><caption><p>Molecular models of S163 and S177. A molecular model of the PRH homeodomain&#x02013;DNA complex based on a 3D alignment of the PRH homeodomain structure (PDB 1WQ1) and the homeodomain protein&#x02013;DNA complexes (PDB 1ENH, 1HDP and 1IG7) was made using 3D-superimpose in Strap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>) and visualized using PyMOL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>).

This site occurs within the motif SERQ and this sequence is present at the same position in a number of other homeodomain proteins, including HoxD4, HoxD3, FTZ, HoxA6 and others. Model building suggests that S177 is located at the start of the recognition helix in close proximity in space to Q180 and allowing the formation of two hydrogen bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>B). The OH group of the S177 side chain can donate a hydrogen to the O group of Q180 side chain, the NH group of the S177 main chain can also donate a hydrogen to the Q180 O group. The NH2 group of the Q180 side chain contacts the phosphate backbone of the opposing DNA. Together, these interactions keep the side chain of Q180 in place to contact the phosphate backbone of DNA and form a hydrogen bond network that links S177 to DNA via residue Q180. Phosphorylation of S177 would disrupt this hydrogen-bond network and place a negative charge close to the DNA backbone phosphate. Phosphorylation of S177 would thus be expected to reduce DNA binding. We have shown that the replacement of S177 with glutamic acid inhibits the DNA-binding activity of PRH although the mutant is still able to bind DNA, albeit with severely reduced affinity. This could be due to the fact that this substitution does not accurately mimic the effect of phosphorylation or it might mean that phosphorylation at both S163 and S177 is required to completely block DNA binding. Certainly, phosphorylation of the S177E mutant blocks DNA binding and the S163E/S177E double mutant fails to bind DNA to any significant extent. Since other homeodomain proteins contain potential phosphorylation sites at positions equivalent to S163 and S177 in PRH, it would seem likely that CK2 could regulate the DNA-binding activity of other proteins in a similar manner.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp197/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="gkp197_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="gkp197_1.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="gkp197_nar-00695-x-2008-File004.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>The Royal Society, The Wellcome Trust and the Biological Sciences Research Council.
