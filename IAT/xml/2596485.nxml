Myelinating the axons increases the speed of nerve conduction and demyelination contributes to the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Oligodendrocyte differentiation is specified early in development by the expression of the basic-helix-loop-helix transcription factor <italic>Olig2</italic> in the ventral region of the neural tube. Understanding how <italic>Olig2</italic> expression is controlled is therefore essential for elucidating the mechanisms governing oligodendrocyte differentiation. A method is needed to identify potential regulatory sequences in the long stretches of adjacent non-coding DNA that flank <italic>Olig2</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>We identified ten potential regulatory regions upstream of <italic>Olig2</italic> based on a combination of bioinformatics metrics that included evolutionary conservation across multiple vertebrate genomes, the presence of potential transcription factor binding sites and the existence of ultraconserved elements. One of our computational predictions includes a region previously identified as the <italic>Olig2</italic> basal promoter, suggesting that our criterion represented characteristics of known regulatory regions. In this study, we tested one candidate regulatory region for its ability to modulate the <italic>Olig2</italic> basal promoter and found that it represses expression in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>The regulatory region we identified modifies the expression regulated by the <italic>Olig2</italic> basal promoter in a manner consistent with our current understanding of <italic>Olig2</italic> expression during oligodendrocyte differentiation. Our results support a model in which constitutive activation of <italic>Olig2</italic> by its basal promoter is repressed in undifferentiated cells by upstream repressive elements until that repression is relieved during differentiation. We conclude that the potential regulatory elements presented in this study provide a good starting point for unraveling the cis-regulatory logic that governs <italic>Olig2</italic> expression. Future studies of the functionality of the potential regulatory elements we present will help reveal the interactions that govern <italic>Olig2</italic> expression during development.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Oligodendrocytes are glial cells that myelinate axons, forming the myelin sheaths in the central nervous system.

We kept only clones with intact target sequences, resulting in 28 <italic>P-clones</italic> 48 <italic>UP-clones</italic> and 26 <italic>PGK-clones</italic>. These clones were grown on STO feeder cells and then assayed by flow cytometry to measure GFP expression. To distinguish ES cells from these STO cells in each culture, we incubated all cells with a monoclonal antibody to mouse SSEA-1 (Stage-specific embryonic antigen-1), which is expressed on the surface of ES cells, but not on STO cells. The binding events of SSEA-1 antibody were detected using an anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 555. The fluorescent levels of GFP and the Alexa Fluor 555 antibodies for each clone, along with the sizes of individual cells, were simultaneously detected on a flow cytometer. We included four wells of STO cells and four wells of ES cells as controls. These controls were used to build a statistical model to distinguish ES cells from non-ES cells in <italic>PGK-clones</italic>. We built a logistic regression model to predict cell type (ES vs non-ES) with three variables: antibody fluorescence, cell granularity measured by side scatter values, and the plate in which the clone was located.

We also used a similar logistic regression to differentiate between ES and non-ES cells in <italic>P-</italic> and <italic>UP-clones</italic>.

To narrow down the conserved regions in this set of alignments, the percent identity for each base found in the mouse genome was calculated using the following scoring scheme: a percent identity of zero was assigned to a base if fewer than three species, other than mouse, contained a nucleotide in that position; otherwise, the percent identity is calculated by dividing the total number of species having the major allele by the total number of species having a non-gap base in that position.

After each round of randomization, the frequencies of lengths of perfectly matched sequences were recorded. Ten complete randomizations were done across all alignable regions of the three genomes and the resulting frequencies were averaged to create the empirical length distribution of perfectly conserved sequences. We selected the threshold length, 38 bp, by using a false positive rate of 0.05 derived from comparing the expected distribution with the observed. A false positive rate was calculated as the number of expected segments divided by the number of observed segments of the same length.

Each set of three control wells contained either STO cells, RW4 cells, or <italic>PGK-clone</italic> cells, in that order. The <italic>PGK-clone</italic> was used as a positive control. Each clone with approximately four to five million cells were washed with PBS, dissociated with 380 uL 0.25&#x00025; Trypsin-EDTA, and recovered with 1.6 mL CM. Each clone was then spun down at 1200rpm for 5 min, resuspended in 100 uL PBS, and transferred into a well on a 96-well plate. Each clone was washed with 100 uL PBS twice. The cells were then incubated at 4&#x000b0;C with 50 uL of unconjugated mouse SSEA-1(Stage-specific embryonic antigen-1) antibodies for 20 minutes (Millipore, 1:50 dilution). SSEA-1 is present only on the cell surface of ES cells, but not STO cells. After incubation, the cells were washed twice with 100 uL PBS. We then stained with 50 uL of anti-mouse IgM antibodies (Invitrogen, 1:100 dilution) for 20 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C. These secondary antibodies were conjugated to Alexa Fluor 555.

The Alexa Fluor 555 antibodies bind to SSEA-1 primary antibodies, which recognize the antigens that are present only on the surface of ES cells. To select only the undifferentiated ES cells from each well, the fluorescence values of antibodies gathered from the RW4 cells and STO cells in all the control wells were used to construct a logistic regression model, which gives the probability of a cell being an ES cell. With the assumption that majority of the RW4 cells were undifferentiated and STO cells were not ES cells, we expected the RW4 cells and STO cells to show different distributions of antibody fluorescence values. We chose the best model, based on the lowest Akaike information criterion (AIC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003946-Akaike1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, to predict the membership of each cell (a ES cell or non-ES cell).

Sensitivity was defined as the number of correctly predicted ES cells divided by the total number of true ES cells. Specificity was defined as the number of correctly predicted non-ES cells divided by the total number of true non-ES cells. We chose a threshold value for selecting ES cells based on the sum of sensitivity and specificity values. To investigate whether the location of each clone on a plate affects the fluorescence levels of cells, models built using only three sets of the STO-RW4 control wells were used to predict the cell types of cells in the set of control wells that were not included in the models. The sensitivity and specificity of the predictions were then compared among the four different sets of wells. The appropriate logistic regression model was used to select the undifferentiated cells from each clone on the plates.
