Evidence exists for rapid, cyclic recruitment of coregulatory complexes upon activation of nuclear receptors. RIP140 is a NR coregulator that represses the transactivation of agonist-bound nuclear receptors. Previously, we showed that RIP140 is inducible by all-<italic>trans</italic> retinoic acid (RA) and mediates limiting, negative-feedback regulation of retinoid signaling.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology and Findings</title><p>Here we report that in the continued presence of RA, long-paced oscillations of retinoic acid receptor (RAR) activity occur with a period ranging from 24 to 35 hours. Endogenous expression of RIP140 and other RA-target genes also oscillate in the presence of RA. Cyclic retinoid receptor transactivation is ablated by constitutive overexpression of RIP140. Further, depletion of RIP140 disrupts cyclic expression of the RA target gene HOXA5. Evidence is provided that RIP140 may limit RAR signaling in a selective, non-redundant manner in contrast to the classic NR coregulators NCoR1 and SRC1 that are not RA-inducible, do not cycle, and may be partially redundant in limiting RAR activity. Finally, evidence is provided that RIP140 can repress and be induced by other nuclear receptors in a manner that suggests potential participation in other NR oscillations.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions and Significance</title><p>We provide evidence for novel, long-paced oscillatory retinoid receptor activity and hypothesize that this may be paced in part, by RIP140. Oscillatory NR activity may be involved in mediating hormone actions of physiological and pathological importance.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The retinoids are derivatives of vitamin A that influence development, differentiation and homeostasis and are pharmacologically valuable in the prevention and treatment of select neoplasms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007639-Niles1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007639-Buletic1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

The TRANSFAC algorithm indicated that this region contains sequences matching half or full consensus site response elements for several NRs including ERR, FXR, LXR, ROR, GR and also a consensus ERa/Sp1 type ER responsive element.</p><p>We cloned a 550 bp fragment of this region into a thymidine kinase (tk)-luciferase construct and cotransfected this plasmid along with an ER&#x003b1; expression plasmid in COS-1 cells.

Oscillations in NR activity may allow for control of hormone responses through continual monitoring of ligand availability and enable NR signaling to be poised to appropriately adjust to rapid fluctuations. The temporal complexity of differentiation suggests that elucidation of the timing of gene expression in tumor cells is important to understand the basis of the therapeutic effects of RA. The periodic nature of RA signaling may be an important consideration for the more efficacious use of retinoids, for example in conjunction with targeting coregulators like RIP140.</p><p>The past decade has revealed that NR activation is highly dynamic. Periodic activation of NR binding, coregulator recruitment, preinitiation complex assembly, and gene transcription in the constant presence of ligand has been described for ER, GR, and VDR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007639-Perissi1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007639-Shang1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007639-Metivier2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007639-Nagaich1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007639-Reid1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.

We provide evidence for an additional, extended oscillation of retinoid receptor activation and RA target gene expression in the constant presence of RA that is long timed (24&#x02013;35 hours) suggestive of a transcriptional-translational loop. Oscillatory retinoid receptor activity was evident in both proliferating and nonproliferating cells, in human and murine cell lines, with RA and RAR/RXR selective agonists, and in cell models dependent on endogenous as well as episomal and stably integrated promoters. In addition, the long paced cycles were partially perturbed by overexpression and depletion of the ligand-dependent corepressor, RIP140. Since RIP140 is acutely inducible by RA and represses ligand bound RAR activity we speculate that it is poised to potentially pace or fine-tune the frequency or amplitude of these cycles.</p><p>Of note, endogenous levels of HOXA5 and to a lesser extent RARB, tended to increase with each oscillation in the continued presence of RA in the absence and presence of RIP140 siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007639-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007639-g004">Figure 4</xref>). While accumulation of mRNA may be expected to occur with each cycle, it is not clear why hnRNA would increase with each cycle unless the rate of transcription was also increasing with each oscillation. Further studies are necessary to understand these findings.</p><p>It has been shown previously that short-paced oscillations of ER, GR, and AR activity correlate with cyclic recruitment of coregulators, (including RIP140) to the promoters of NR target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007639-Perissi1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007639-Shang1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007639-Metivier2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007639-Nagaich1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007639-Reid1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the temporal nature of coregulator recruitment to RARs and other class II receptors that are resident at promoters in the absence of ligand has been less well characterized. It is currently unclear whether the long paced oscillations we have observed are specific for RARs or coexist with short paced cycles that have been shown for ER, GR and AR. Although not addressed in the current study, it is conceivable that each short-term cycle of coregulator recruitment (20&#x02013;60 min) affords the opportunity to monitor the relative ratios of coregulators changing over a macro time scale subject to long-term changes in environmental conditions. Thus it will be important in the future to carefully monitor the recruitment of coregulators in our system using techniques such as chromatin immunoprecipitation. Interestingly, Wang <italic>et al</italic>. showed that in contrast to ER complexes which form within minutes and recycle hourly, complexes at AR promoters slowly form over 16 hours and then slowly decline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007639-Wang1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Although RA is required for proper maintenance of epithelial tissues, the binary nature of RA-induced differentiation, in which cells commit to differentiate upon a defined time interval, may not be the ideal setting for the characterization of long-paced oscillations of NR activity. However, the dynamic patterns we have uncovered may be particularly relevant to other NRs that receive constant signals such as orphan NRs (for example, ERRs), steroid receptors that receive fairly constant hormonal stimulus over days (ER, AR and PR), and NRs that receive signals from the diet or intracellular metabolism (PPARs, FXRs, LXRs). It is noteworthy the we and others have shown that RIP140 is induced by a number of NRs including RAR, ER, PPAR&#x003b3;, AR and ERR and that RIP140 can in turn repress these and other NRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007639-g007">Figure 7</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007639-White1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007639-Lin1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007639-Treuter1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007639-Debevec1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>.

It will be of interest to discover in the future if other long-paced NR oscillations exist and whether they integrate with rhythmic biological processes known to involve NRs, for example, the menstrual cycle, the circadian clock and digestive and metabolic cycles.</p><p>Although we have provided evidence that RIP140 may influence long-paced oscillations in NR activity, it is unclear whether RIP140 is required for these oscillations or rather is involved in fine-tuning their timing, frequency and amplitude. Further, the precise timing of the oscillations differs depending on the cell system (integrated versus episomal reporter) and assay (real time PCR versus reporter) which may reflect differences in the precision inherent with each technique. A more thorough understanding of the dynamics of RIP140 expression and processing would further support this model. RIP140 is known to be extensively modified posttranslationally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007639-Huq1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We have previously identified selectivity of RIP140 in the regulation of RA target genes by employing microarrays on a genome-wide scale at a 24-hour time point <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007639-Heim1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistent with our microarray results, RARB and HOXA5 induction was robustly potentiated by RIP140 depletion while RARA induction was unaffected. Similar results were obtained in two different cancer cell lines using both transient siRNA and stable shRNA. The molecular basis of this selectivity remains unknown. The well-characterized RAREs in the RARA and RARB promoters are highly similar, both consist of tandem direct repeat half sites separated by 5 bp (DR5) and only one base differs across the entire 12 bp consensus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007639-deTh1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007639-Leroy1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. It is reasonable to speculate that chromatin structure at different promoters may underlie RIP140 binding selectivity. RIP140 has been shown to be recruited to the RARB promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007639-Chen1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007639-Hu1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>, but no studies have yet to investigate whether RIP140 is recruited to the RARA promoter. Alternatively, RIP140 may differentially affect retinoid receptor subtypes. Selective gene regulation by RIP140 suggests that RA target genes may undergo distinct patterns of dynamic gene expression relevant to the growth suppressive and differentiating effects of RA.</p><p>In summary, we have shown that RAR activity and RIP140 and RA target gene expression undergo long-paced oscillations in the constant presence of RA. Further we provide evidence to allow us to speculate a potential modulatory role for RIP140 in pacing and fine-tuning these low-frequency cycles of NR activity. Tumor cell differentiation is a highly dynamic process, and as RIP140 limits the effectiveness of RA-mediated differentiation, further characterization of the role of RIP140 in RA signaling dynamics will afford a more accurate understanding of the beneficial therapeutic actions of retinoids. The regulation of RIP140 by diverse hormonal signals and its general corepression of NRs suggest that RIP140 oscillations may be relevant to the temporal regulation of other hormone signaling events in distinct physiologic and pharmacologic contexts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0007639.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Primers for PCR.
