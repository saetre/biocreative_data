Recent studies examining the origin of pancreatic cancer have revealed that molecular alterations, including changes in tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes involved in multiple cellular signaling pathways, may have a significant role in the multistage carcinogenesis of pancreatic cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands is the major epigenetic modification of mammalian genomes and is required for gene regulation and genome stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Aberrant DNA methylation, especially the hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes, has been reported to be associated with the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes and tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Methyl-CpG binding domain protein 1 (MBD1) is a mammalian protein that binds methylated CpG islands symmetrically and couples DNA methylation to transcriptional repression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This biological property suggests a role for MBD1 in the silencing of tumor suppressor genes that may contribute to tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. We have previously reported that MBD1 is over-expressed in human pancreatic carcinomas and that over-expression of MBD1 correlated significantly with lymph node metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, the role of MBD1 in the development of pancreatic cancer is still unknown.</p><p>In this study, we silenced MBD1 expression in the pancreatic cancer cell line BxPC-3 using the RNA interference (RNAi) technique. We used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) to detect differential protein expression in the BxPC-3/MBD1-siRNA and control BxPC-3/vector cell lines. The differential expression patterns between the two cell lines were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Our data provide some insight into the functional mechanism of MBD1 in the development of pancreatic cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines and culture</title><p>The human pancreatic cancer cell line, BxPC-3, was purchased from Shanghai Institutes for Biological Science (China).

A powerful transcriptional repression domain (TRD) at the C terminus of MBD1 can actively repress transcription at a distance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Thus, MBD1 may have an important role in the silencing of tumor suppressor genes that are hypermethylated at their promoter CpG islands in cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Previously, we have shown that the gene expression of MBD1 is significantly increased in pancreatic carcinomas compared to normal pancreatic tissue, with a simultaneous decrease in the expression of some tumor suppressor genes (<italic>CDH1, RB</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. We also found that the protein and mRNA expressions of MBD1 in pancreatic carcinoma were significantly higher than in normal tissues. Furthermore, the expression of MBD1 correlated with lymph node metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, the role of MBD1 during the development of pancreatic cancer is still unknown.</p><p>The present study combined a proteomic approach with RNAi technology to identify proteins associated with MBD1 function in pancreatic cancer. We successfully used RNAi technology to construct a recombinant MBD1-siRNA plasmid that stably knocked-down <italic>MBD1 </italic>gene expression in the BxPC-3 human pancreatic cancer cell line. We identified 14 differentially expressed protein spots between the two cell lines using MALDI-TOF-MS.</p><p>MBD1 affect gene expression according to the status of DNA methylation. Fujita N et al indicated that MBD1 acts as a transcriptional regulator depending on the density of methyl-CpG pairs through the cooperation of MBD, CXXC, and TRD sequences. MBD1v1 represses transcription preferentially from both unmethylated and sparsely methylated promoters, while MBD1v3 inhibits densely methylated but not unmethylated promoter activities. Moreover, they also found that MBD1 enhanced transcription from the some methylated promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In our study, 9/14 proteins were downregulated and 5/14 proteins were upregulated after MBD1 knock-down, maybe related with different transcriptional regulation way of MBD1.</p><p>Among the 14 MBD1-associated proteins identified in this study, vimentin was found to be down-regulated 20-fold in the BxPC-3/MBD1-siRNA cell line compared to the control BxPC-3/vector cell. Vimentin, a major intermediate filament protein of mesenchymal cells, was found to be over-expressed in some human cancer tissues and associated with prognostic indicators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Vimentin exon-1 sequences are methylated in most of colon cancer tissues and aberrant methylation of vimentin has become a novel molecular biomarker of colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In the short term RNAi experiment, the mRNA level of vimentin was also down-regulated after MBD1 knock-down, indicated that MBD1 may involve in DNA methylation of vimentin and mediate the expression of vimentin in pancreatic cancer.</p><p>We also found that several members of the HSP family (GRP78 and HSP A8) were down-regulated in the absence of MBD1. GRP78 promotes tumor proliferation, survival, metastasis, and resistance to a wide variety of therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Indeed, it has been shown that cancer cells adapt to chronic stress in the tumor microenvironment by inducing the expression of GRP78 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Studies show that Heat shock proteins are methylated in mammalian cells and HSPs expressions are associated with aberrant methylation of promoter CpG islands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In this study, the down-regulation of both GRP78 and HSP A8 after MBD1 knock-down, suggest that MBD1 may affect the expression of HSPs in pancreatic cancer through DNA methylation.</p><p>Many of the proteins that were found to be down-regulated by the knock-down of MBD1 have been shown to be over-expressed in certain cancers. For example, stathmin, a microtubule-destabilizing protein, is expressed at high levels in a wide variety of human cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Inhibition of stathmin expression in malignant cells has been shown to interfere with cell cycle progression and abrogates the transformed phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. hnRNP K, involved in regulating transcription, mRNA shuttling, RNA editing and translation, has been reported to be overexpressed in several human cancer tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In colorectal cancer, patients who presented with hnRNP K-positive tumors had a poorer survival outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. EIF3 plays an essential role in the rate-limiting initiation phase of translation, and increased mRNA and protein levels have been detected in several human tumors. Furthermore, over-expression of eIF3 is reportedly a prognostic biomarker for poor clinical outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Cofilin 2, an actin-depolymerizing factor that is mainly expressed in smooth muscle cells of collateral arteries, has been associated with angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Most of these proteins play an important role in tumorigenesis, some of them are prognostic biomarkers for human malignant tumors, and some were involved in methylation. For instance, different methylation sites in hnRNP K have been identified and shown to influence protein-protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Stathmin also presents aberrant methylation in prostate cancer cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Down-regulation of these tumor-related proteins after MBD1-knock-down suggests that MBD1 may play a significant role in pancreatic cancer through regulating methylation.</p><p>Among the five proteins that were up-regulated, ER-60 protease and P4 hb are multifunctional proteins that belong to the protein disulfide isomerase family that is a chaperone protein and related with tumor cell migration and invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Tubulin beta2, the subunit protein of microtubules, is present in the cell nuclei of a variety of cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In colorectal cancer research, methylated DNA sequence within tubulin was identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Since these proteins were up-regulated after knock-down of MBD1, they might be novel MBD1-associated proteins in pancreatic cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We established a MBD1 knock-down BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer cell line using a stable RNAi method. The comparative proteomic approach is a useful strategy of proteomics to analyze and compare the differentially expressed proteins and identify novel target molecules in unknown pathways. These differential proteins may be associated with the function of MBD1, our findings provide some insight into the functional mechanism of MBD1 in the development of pancreatic cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>MBD1: Methyl-CpG binding domain protein 1; RNAi: RNA interference; 2-DE: two-dimensional gel electrophoresis; MALDI-TOF: matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization time-of-flight; MS: mass spectrometry; SDS-PAGE: sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel; NCBI: National Center for Biotechnology Information.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>CL, YC, CJ, JX, JL, DF and HJ made substantial contributions to conception, design, analysis, acquisition, interpretation of the data, as well as drafting and approving the final manuscript.
