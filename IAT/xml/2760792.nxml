Lsm1 is over-expressed in multiple tumor types, including over 80% of pancreatic tumors, and increased levels of Lsm1 protein have been shown to induce carcinogenic effects. Therefore, understanding the perturbations in cell process due to increased Lsm1 protein may help to identify possible therapeutics targeting tumors over-expressing Lsm1. Herein, we show that <italic>LSM1</italic> over-expression in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> inhibits growth primarily due to U6 snRNA depletion, thereby altering pre-mRNA splicing. The decrease in U6 snRNA levels causes yeast strains over-expressing Lsm1 to be hypersensitive to loss of other proteins required for production or function of the U6 snRNA, supporting a model wherein excess Lsm1 reduces the availability of the Lsm2-7 proteins, which also assemble with Lsm8 to form a complex that binds and stabilizes the U6 snRNA. Yeast strains over-expressing Lsm1 also display minor alterations in mRNA decay and demonstrate increased susceptibility to mutations inhibiting cytoplasmic deadenylation, a process required for both 5&#x02032;-to-3&#x02032; and 3&#x02032;-to-5&#x02032; pathways of exonucleolytic decay. These results suggest that inhibition of splicing and/or deadenylation may be effective therapies for Lsm1-over-expressing tumors.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Tumors of the pancreas pose a critical problem in eliminating mortality due to cancer in that incidence and morbidity rates for this disease are nearly equal (NCI SEER database, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/pancreas.html">http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/pancreas.html</ext-link>). Even with recent technological advances in genomic analysis, the overall relative 5-year survival rate of pancreatic tumors from 1996 to 2004 was 5.1%, and trend analysis of the period from 2003 to 2005 revealed no significant changes in mortality rate (NCI SEER database, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/pancreas.html">http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/pancreas.html</ext-link>). Given that the current prognosis for patients with these tumors is dismal, it is vital that we search for novel therapeutics targeting this disease.</p><p>In 1997, Lsm1 was identified through subtractive hybridization cloning in pancreatic cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>) and was shown to be over-expressed in 87% of pancreatic cancers. Subsequently, its over-expression has been described in 40% of prostate cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), a subset (15&#x02013;20%) of breast cancers that are amplified at the 8p11-12 region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) and most recently in lung cancers and mesotheliomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). The direct involvement of Lsm1 in carcinogenesis in these tissues has been demonstrated through analyses of Lsm1's effects on growth and anchorage dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), contact inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), autocrine activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) and tumor establishment and metastases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). The increase in Lsm1 levels in these tumors is moderate (about 2- to 5-fold) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), suggesting that subtle changes in the levels of Lsm1 can affect the growth properties of mammalian cells. Thus, it is important to elucidate the processes affected by <italic>LSM1</italic> over-expression in order to provide new targets for therapeutic development against pancreatic and other Lsm1-over-expressing cancers.</p><p>Lsm1 over-expression could affect cellular metabolism in several manners. For example, Lsm1 over-expression has been suggested to destabilize certain tumor suppressor transcripts, allowing for carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). This model is based on the fact that Lsm1 in yeast and humans assembles with the Lsm2-Lsm7 proteins to form a heteroheptameric Lsm1-7 complex that binds mRNAs, components of the decapping machinery, and promotes mRNA decapping and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12 B13 B14">10&#x02013;14</xref>). Alternatively, Lsm1 over-expression might inhibit the function of the related Lsm2-8 complex, wherein the Lsm1 protein is replaced by the Lsm8 protein. The Lsm2-8 complex binds the 3&#x02032;-end of the U6 snRNA protecting it from degradation and thereby allowing normal rates of pre-mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17">15&#x02013;17</xref>). Consistent with Lsm1 over-expression affecting the nuclear Lsm2-8 complex, over-expression of <italic>LSM1</italic> in budding yeast increased the cytoplasmic localization of Lsm7p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Hence, over-expression of <italic>LSM1</italic> may actually reduce U6 levels and selectively influence splicing, allowing for carcinogenesis.</p><p>To understand how Lsm1 over-expression influences cell processes, we took advantage of the conservation of Lsm1 function in both budding yeast and humans to determine how Lsm1 over-expression affects RNA metabolism in yeast. We found that over-expression of <italic>LSM1</italic> in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> leads to defects in pre-mRNA splicing, which is caused by decreased levels of the U6 snRNA. The splicing defect causes yeast strains over-expressing Lsm1 to be hypersensitive to loss of other components required for maintaining levels of U6 snRNA. Moreover, yeast strains over-expressing Lsm1 are more susceptible to mutations inhibiting cytoplasmic deadenylation, which is normally a prerequisite for mRNA decay. These results suggest that inhibition of splicing and/or deadenylation may be effective therapies for <italic>LSM1</italic>-over-expressing tumors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast strains, growth conditions and plasmids</title><p>The genotypes of the strains used are listed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp572/DC1">Supplementary Table S3</ext-link>.

First, since the Lsm1-7 complex functions in the control of mRNA decapping, over-expression of <italic>LSM1</italic> might alter the stoichiometry of components of the decapping complex, enhancing or inhibiting mRNA decapping and thereby affecting growth. Alternatively, increased levels of Lsm1p could deplete the nuclear Lsm2-8 complex, thus affecting cell growth through inhibition of splicing. To consider these possibilities, we first examined the effects of Lsm1 over-expression from the <italic>GAL CEN</italic> plasmid in <italic>lsm7&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>lhp1&#x00394;</italic> strains, which are both compromised for U6 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29 B30 B31 B32">29&#x02013;32</xref>). We observed that over-expression of Lsm1 strongly limited the growth of both <italic>lsm7&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>lhp1&#x00394;</italic> strains, with the strongest effect seen with <italic>lsm7&#x00394;</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, lower panels).</p><p>In order to extend this genetic analysis, we decided to over-express Lsm1 from the <italic>GAL</italic> promoter on a multicopy 2 &#x003bc; plasmid, thereby increasing the probability of us detecting additional genetic interactions. We observed that over-expression from the <italic>GAL 2 &#x003bc;</italic> plasmid gave a stronger inhibition of growth than the <italic>GAL</italic> centromere plasmid (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C uppermost panel and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A), although the cells do still grow at a reduced rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Using this system of expressing <italic>LSM1</italic> from the <italic>GAL 2</italic> &#x003bc; plasmid, we then examined Lsm1 over-expression in a variety of yeast strains lacking non-essential proteins that function in pre-mRNA splicing or mRNA degradation.

The enhanced toxicity of Lsm1 over-expression in the <italic>ccr4&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>pop2&#x00394;</italic> strains suggests that mRNA decay might be altered when Lsm1 is over-expressed, increasing the relative requirement for deadenylation.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>LSM1</italic> over-expression induces defects in splicing</title><p>Since strains lacking <italic>LSM7</italic>, <italic>LHP1</italic>, and <italic>SNU66</italic> are defective for U6 or U4/U6/U5 snRNP function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), we hypothesized that <italic>LSM1</italic> over-expression might further interfere with splicing in these deletion strains. To assess the effects of Lsm1 over-expression on splicing we examined the accumulation of the intron-containing precursor to the U3 snoRNA, which is a sensitive measure of splicing in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). In this analysis, we also included the <italic>ccr4&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>pop2&#x00394;</italic> strains, in case these mutations had some previously unobserved effect on splicing. For this experiment, cells containing the <italic>GAL-LSM1 2</italic> &#x003bc; plasmid, or a vector control, were continuously grown in galactose, cells were harvested at mid-log, and the RNA was analyzed on northern blots for the U3 snoRNA.</p><p>We observed that over-expression of Lsm1 in a wild-type strain did not lead to accumulation of the intron-containing precursor to the U3 snoRNA (pre-U3 snoRNA). However, over-expression of Lsm1 in an <italic>lsm7&#x00394;</italic> strain, increased the accumulation of the pre-U3 snoRNA seen in this strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, compare lanes 3 and 4). Similarly, a <italic>snu66&#x00394;</italic> strain accumulated small amounts of the pre-U3 snoRNA, and these levels increased with <italic>LSM1</italic> over-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, compare lanes 7 and 8). In an <italic>lhp1&#x00394;</italic> strain, no pre-U3 snoRNA was evident, and small amounts accumulated with Lsm1 over-expression, which were visible on longer exposures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, compare lanes 5 and 6). Finally, <italic>ccr4&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>pop2&#x00394;</italic> strains failed to accumulate pre-U3 snoRNA with or without <italic>LSM1</italic> over-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, examine lanes 9 through 12).

These results indicate that Lsm1 over-expression can lead to defects in splicing, even at moderate levels of over-expression as observed in tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), which are most easily revealed in strains lacking proteins affecting U6 snRNA biogenesis or function. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><italic>LSM1</italic> over-expression inhibits splicing by affecting U6 snRNA.

This hypothesis predicts that the levels of U6 snRNA should be reduced by Lsm1 over-expression. To test this prediction, we examined the levels of U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6 snRNAs in both wild-type and various mutant strains over-expressing Lsm1.</p><p>We observed that over-expressing <italic>LSM1</italic> on a <italic>GAL 2</italic> &#x003bc; plasmid had little effect on U1, U2, U4 and U5 snRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C and data not shown), but U6 levels were decreased in all cells over-expressing <italic>LSM1</italic>. Specifically, in wild-type cells over-expressing <italic>LSM1</italic> on a <italic>GAL 2</italic> &#x003bc; plasmid, U6 snRNA levels decreased by an average of 2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, compare lane 2 to 1 and histogram), and this level of U6 depletion was also observed when moderately over-expressing <italic>LSM1</italic> on a <italic>GAL CEN</italic> plasmid (data not shown). Moreover, and consistent with the genetic interactions, U6 levels were most depleted (4.5-fold less on average, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C histogram) in an <italic>LSM7</italic> deletion background over-expressing <italic>LSM1</italic> on a <italic>GAL 2</italic> &#x003bc; plasmid when compared to wild-type expressing a vector control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, examine lanes 3 and 2 and histogram). In these two instances, the results imply that <italic>LSM1</italic> over-expression exerts its inhibition of growth through a reduction of U6 levels, yielding an inhibition of splicing. However, the levels of U6 snRNA in <italic>lhp1&#x00394;</italic>, <italic>snu66&#x00394;</italic>, <italic>ccr4&#x00394;</italic>, and <italic>pop2&#x00394;</italic> strains over-expressing <italic>LSM1</italic> on a <italic>GAL 2</italic> &#x003bc; plasmid were not consistently lower than that of a wild-type strain over-expressing <italic>LSM1</italic>. These results suggest that the consequences of Lsm1 over-expression on growth can be made more significant without further reductions in the U6 level. In the case of the <italic>snu66&#x00394;</italic>, this effect may be due to the assembly of a defective U4/U6/U5 tri- snRNP, whereas the growth inhibition in the <italic>ccr4&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>pop2&#x00394;</italic> strains may be due to defects in mRNA decay (see &#x02018;Discussion&#x02019; section).</p></sec><sec><title>Depletion of U6 is responsible for synthetic growth and splicing defects in wild-type, <italic>lsm7&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>lhp1&#x00394;</italic> strains over-expressing <italic>LSM1</italic></title><p>The decrease in U6 snRNA levels with Lsm1 over-expression suggests that the inhibition of growth in wild-type and possibly various mutant strains could be due to the decreased U6 snRNA levels. This hypothesis predicts that the growth and splicing defects due to Lsm1 over-expression should be reversed by increasing levels of U6. To test this possibility, we introduced a high-copy plasmid expressing U6 snRNA into each strain and examined its effects on growth and splicing in the presence and absence of Lsm1 over-expression from a <italic>GAL 2</italic> &#x003bc; plasmid.</p><p>Our results revealed that at least some of the growth defects due to <italic>LSM1</italic> over-expression are attributable to low levels of U6 snRNA. First, over-expression of U6 snRNA suppressed the growth defect seen in wild-type cells due to Lsm1 over-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, uppermost panel). Second, consistent with its severe growth defects and U6 snRNA reduction, <italic>lsm7&#x00394;</italic> over-expressing <italic>LSM1</italic> was nearly completely rescued by the increased U6 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) and U6 snRNA over-expression suppressed the splicing defect seen with Lsm1 over-expression in this strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, compare lanes 5, 6 and 7).

We speculate that the synthetic growth defects in the <italic>snu66&#x00394;</italic> strain may be due to the assembly of a U6 snRNA that is compromised in function due to loss of both the Snu66p and the Lsm2-8 complex. Consistent with that possibility, over-expression of U6 snRNA did not suppress the splicing defect seen in the <italic>snu66&#x00394;</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, compare lanes 9, 10 and 11). This suggests that in the absence of the Snu66 protein, the Lsm2-8 complex may contribute directly to U6 snRNP function (see &#x02018;Discussion&#x02019; section).</p><p>We observed that the <italic>ccr4&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>pop2&#x00394;</italic> strains were partially rescued by over-expression of U6 snRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). This suggests that the growth defects in these strains is in part due to reduced U6 snRNA levels and in part due to alterations in deadenylation, which might affect some aspect of mRNA decay.</p></sec><sec><title>Lsm1 over-expression does not globally alter mRNA decay</title><p>The strong synthetic growth defects seen in the <italic>pop2&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>ccr4&#x00394;</italic> strain with over-expression of Lsm1 on a <italic>GAL 2</italic> &#x003bc; plasmid led us to hypothesize that Lsm1 over-expression could also alter mRNA decay in some manner. This was also supported by the fact that the strong synthetic growth defects in <italic>ccr4&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>pop2&#x00394;</italic> over-expressing <italic>LSM1</italic> was only partially rescued by increasing U6 levels. To test if Lsm1 over-expression affects decapping, we examined the effects of <italic>LSM1</italic> over-expression on mRNA decay in a wild-type strain using the <italic>MFA2pG</italic> mRNA, which is a commonly used reporter for mRNA decapping in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). In order to analyze the decay of <italic>MFA2pG</italic> mRNA, we expressed it as a low-copy, galactose-inducible promoter fusion along with our <italic>GAL-LSM1 2</italic> &#x003bc; plasmid. Cells were grown in galactose and transcription was repressed by the addition of 4% dextrose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), with samples taken for RNA analysis over a brief time course to avoid impacting the pool of Lsm1 protein whose half-life has been reported to be 76 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). We observed no significant change in the decay rate of the <italic>MFA2pG</italic> mRNA in a wild-type strain over-expressing Lsm1 as compared to a vector control (t1/2 less than 5&#x02032; for both). Similarly, over-expressing Lsm1 at moderate levels on a <italic>GAL-LSM1 CEN</italic> plasmid did not affect the decay profile of the <italic>MFA2pG</italic> mRNA (data not shown). This indicates that Lsm1 over-expression does not have a strong effect on the decay of all mRNAs although it remains possible that Lsm1 over-expression affects the decay of a subset of mRNAs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Lsm1 over-expression alters pre-mRNA splicing</title><p>In this work, we provide several lines of evidence that Lsm1 over-expression can inhibit cell growth in budding yeast by affecting the biogenesis and/or function of the U6 snRNA. First, over-expression of Lsm1 inhibited growth and decreased the levels of the U6 snRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Second, the toxicity of the Lsm1 over-expression, and in certain strains its impact on splicing, was increased in the <italic>lsm7&#x00394;</italic>, <italic>lhp1&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>snu66&#x00394;</italic> strains, all of which impact in some manner on the function/biogenesis of the U6 snRNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Third, over-expression of the U6 snRNA rescued growth and the splicing defect in some strains mutant for U6 snRNP function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The simplest interpretation of these observations is that Lsm1 over-expression impacts on U6 snRNA by depleting the levels of the Lsm2-8 complex due to competition between Lsm1 and Lsm8 for the Lsm2-7 complex members. This interpretation is also consistent with synthetic growth defects, as well as depletion of U6 snRNA levels, seen when <italic>LSM1</italic> was over-expressed in an <italic>lsm8-1</italic> mutant and with the observation that <italic>LSM1</italic> over-expression increases the concentration of Lsm7p in cytoplasmic foci, presumably reflecting an increased formation of the Lsm1-7p complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).</p><p>Our results suggest that Lsm1 over-expression can impact on the U6 snRNP in two manners depending on other alterations in the strains. In the <italic>lsm7&#x00394;</italic> strain, the primary effect is on the levels of the U6 snRNA, and over-expression of the U6 snRNA can suppress the growth defect seen in these cases. This is consistent with other observations that in an otherwise wild-type strain the predominant role of the Lsm2-8 complex is to enhance the stability of the U6 snRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). However, in the <italic>snu66&#x00394;</italic>, over-expression of the U6 snRNA fails to suppress the Lsm1 growth and splicing phenotypes resulting from Lsm1 over-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The simplest interpretation here is that when Snu66, a component of the U4/U6/U5 tri-snRNP, is missing, the Lsm2-8 complex now plays a more important role in the tri-snRNP's function in splicing. Thus, even when U6 snRNA is over-expressed any resulting U4/U6/U5 complex lacking both the Snu66 and Lsm2-8 proteins would be defective for function.</p><p>A clear implication of these observations is that changes in Lsm1 levels might impact on splicing in pancreatic tumors. Our studies reveal that when Lsm1 is over-expressed in yeast at moderate levels comparable to that observed in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), splicing is altered due to a depletion in U6 snRNA levels. In this light, it is notable that alterations in the splicing machinery have been previously described in human pancreatic tumors and transgenic mouse models. For instance, a serine/arginine protein kinase involved in splicing, <italic>SRPK1</italic>, has been shown to be upregulated in pancreatic tumors and its downregulation correlated to decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis in these tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). In addition, an analysis of genomic changes in an Ela-<italic>c-myc</italic> transgenic mouse model for pancreatic cancer revealed that splicing factors and spliceosome-related genes were part of a major class of genes upregulated in primary tumors and liver metastatic regions as compared to normal pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Hence, it is possible that <italic>LSM1</italic> over-expression also contributes to changes in splicing patterns by altering the stoichiometry of the spliceosomal machinery, allowing for carcinogenesis to occur in pancreatic cells. An implication of this analysis, and the increased toxicity of Lsm1 over-expression in yeast strains compromised for U6 snRNA function, is that therapies directed at reducing U6 snRNA biogenesis and/or function might be effective therapies for any tumor over-expressing Lsm1.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>LSM1</italic> over-expression decreases cell viability when deadenylation is inhibited</title><p>We also provide evidence that Lsm1 over-expression leads to a change in the cells&#x02019; requirement for different mRNA decay factors. Specifically, we observed that the toxicity of the Lsm1 over-expression was increased in <italic>ccr4&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>pop2&#x00394;</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C), which are compromised for the predominant cytoplasmic deadenylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Moreover, the synthetic growth defects in these deadenylase mutants could only be partially rescued by increasing U6 snRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Overall, these results indicate that some process of mRNA decay is altered by Lsm1 over-expression, perhaps due to the assembly of mRNA decay complexes that are defective in function. However, since we did not observe an alteration in the <italic>MFA2pG</italic> mRNA, any alterations in degradation must be limited to subsets of mRNAs.</p><p>Prior studies in human cells do suggest that alterations in the decay of subsets of mRNAs may exist in Lsm1 over-expressing cancers. Array analyses of how Lsm1 over-expression affects the transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) have demonstrated that increased Lsm1 expression alters levels of certain transcripts, some of which encode factors important in carcinogenesis. However, only one example is published providing an mRNA decay analysis. The p21/Cip1 mRNA, encoding a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>), was shown to be stabilized by targeted reduction of Lsm1 in a cancer cell line, yet this did not correspond to an increase in its protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Thus, it is still unclear whether therapeutic effects achieved with Lsm1 targeting in cancer cells are due to altering the decay of specific transcripts. Nevertheless, the synthetic lethality of Lsm1 over-expression in strains defective in mRNA deadenylation implies that therapeutic agents targeting deadenylase activity could be possible mechanisms for the treatment of tumors with over-expression of Lsm1.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp572/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="gkp572_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel" xlink:href="gkp572_nar-01033-a-2009-File008.xls"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p><funding-source>National Institutes of Health</funding-source> [<award-id>R37 GM45443 to R.P.</award-id>]; <funding-source>National Institutes of Health</funding-source> [<award-id>T32 CA09213 to N.L.</award-id>].
