Second, we examined the development of the corridor of Islet1-expressing cells that guides thalamic axons through ventral telencephalon and found that it was broader and less dense than normal in conditional mutants.

Thalamic axons initially grow antero-ventrally through the diencephalon before turning sharply laterally, avoiding ventral diencephalic regions containing the hypothalamus and forming the internal capsule in ventral telencephalon. After exiting the internal capsule, axons turn dorsally to reach cortex from about E13.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Previous studies have indicated two major mechanisms likely to guide advancing thalamic growth cones into and through ventral telencephalon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. First, several studies have suggested that a transient group of ventral telencephalic neurons project pioneer axons to the thalamus by E12.5, providing guidance for reciprocal thalamocortical axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Second, work by Lopez-Bendito <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] showed that cells migrate from the lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE) to form a ventral telencephalic permissive corridor marked by expression of the transcription factor Islet1, through which thalamocortical axons grow.</p><p>Many transcription factors well-known for their functions in early patterning of the developing nervous system also have important functions in subsequent regulation of axonal navigation, by influencing the responses of growing axons and/or the deployment of guidance cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Pax6 is one such factor. In mice lacking Pax6, thalamic axons fail to navigate correctly in the ventral telencephalon and a normal internal capsule does not form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The mechanism of action of Pax6 in thalamocortical axonal development is unknown.</p><p>A critical step towards understanding how Pax6 regulates thalamocortical development is to define its site(s) of action. Comparing Pax6's spatio-temporal pattern of expression with the timetable of thalamocortical tract formation indicates that Pax6 could influence guidance by actions at the origin of the tract and/or in its target and/or in intermediate tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Pax6 is expressed in the embryonic thalamus before thalamic axons develop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Previous experiments using a co-culture approach have indicated that Pax6 is required in the thalamus for thalamocortical axons to navigate through ventral telencephalon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Pax6 is expressed in the cerebral cortex from before the time when thalamic axons reach it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. A recent study by Pinon <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] reported normal thalamocortical tract development following targeted deletion of <italic>Pax6 </italic>specifically in cerebral cortex from before the time of thalamocortical development, suggesting that Pax6 is not required in the cortex for thalamic axonal guidance. Pax6 is expressed by some ventral telencephalic cells in the vicinity of the internal capsule at the time when thalamocortical axons are navigating through this intermediate region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Its functions in these ventral cells are unknown; a logical extension of previous work is to investigate whether Pax6 in this region contributes to the generation of normal thalamocortical projections and, if so, how. These issues form the focus of the present study.</p><p>We addressed the possibility that normal expression of Pax6 in ventral telencephalic cells around the internal capsule is required for normal thalamocortical development. We generated a new floxed allele of <italic>Pax6 </italic>and crossed it with a strain of mice in which Cre recombinase expression is restricted to a very specific Pax6-expressing region of ventral telencephalon around the future internal capsule from before E12.5. This resulted in an early depletion of Pax6-expressing cells in this region and caused many thalamic axons to take aberrant routes. We tested possible mechanisms for these axonal defects and found that the Islet1-expressing corridor that normally guides thalamocortical axons failed to develop normally in conditional mutants.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Generation of the floxed <italic>Pax6 </italic>allele</title><p>In the floxed allele of <italic>Pax6 </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), <italic>loxP </italic>sites flank exons 5, 5a and 6, which encode the paired domain and are essential for Pax6 function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].

A cluster of Pax6-expressing cells was located in ventral MGE in a similar position to the hPLAP staining (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, white arrowhead). This was separate from a more lateral population of Pax6-expressing cells derived from the pallium and forming part of the lateral cortical stream (LCS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B, C</xref>, black arrows). The LCS comprises pallial- and subpallial-derived neural progenitor cells derived from the pallial-subpallial border (PSPB) that migrate to the developing structures of the ventral telencephalon, including the piriform cortex and amygdala. By E14.5, hPLAP-expressing cells were detected more widely throughout not only the MGE but also the LGE, still mainly ventral to the internal capsule (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>) in a region containing many Pax6-expressing cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>).

We calculated the average number of Pax6-expressing cells per section in the ventral MGE at E12.5 and ventral MGE and LGE at E14.5 for cKOs and controls (n = 4 embryos in each group). In E12.5 cKOs, there was a greater than 50% reduction in the density of Pax6-expressing cells in the ventral domain of the MGE close to the region where thalamic axons turn into the ventral telencephalon to form the internal capsule (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F&#x02013;H</xref>; <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01, Student's <italic>t</italic>-test).

First, a transient group of ventral telencephalic neurons projecting from the vicinity of the future internal capsule to the thalamus might provide guidance for thalamocortical axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Second, a set of Islet1-expressing cells derived from the LGE migrates to form a permissive corridor in the ventral telencephalon, through which thalamocortical axons grow forming the internal capsule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Work described above showed that the transient group of ventral telencephalic neurons projecting to the thalamus was present at an appropriate age in cKOs. We assessed the size of the group. Counting individual neurons was not sufficiently accurate since the DiI labeling was cytoplasmic and the cells were so densely packed with numerous processes that they could not be resolved. We counted all labeled pixels above a threshold (set to remove background) from each of a series of sections through these groups of cells in four cKO and three control embryos. This provided, for each embryo, a measure of the total area of the retrogradely labeled cells, which we assume to be proportionate to the number of cells since cell sizes appeared similar in the two genotypes. We found no significant difference in the average areas between the two genotypes (control, 621 &#x000b1; 146 (standard error of the mean) &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>, n = 3; cKO, 493 &#x000b1; 114 &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>, n = 4; <italic>P </italic>= 0.51, Student's <italic>t</italic>-test).</p><p>It remains possible that these pioneer neurons have molecular defects preventing their normal guidance of thalamic axons. The likelihood of this would have been enhanced if these transient projections normally expressed Pax6. To address this possibility, we combined immunohistochemistry for Pax6 with DiI labeling of control brains at E12.5. We found no overlap between the populations of cells expressing Pax6 in the ventral MGE (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A, B</xref>; the population labeled with white arrowheads corresponds to that indicated by the white arrowhead in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) and projecting to the thalamus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, yellow arrowheads). This suggests that if these projections in cKOs do have molecular defects preventing them fulfilling their guidance role, it would have had to have been generated either indirectly, as a result of loss of Pax6 in other cells, or as a consequence of Pax6 loss earlier in these cells' lineage (assuming that they did express Pax6 earlier and that <italic>Six3</italic><sup><italic>A1A2</italic></sup>-<italic>Cre </italic>caused loss of any such expression, which are formal but uncertain possibilities).</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Ventral telencephalic pioneer neurons do not express Pax6</bold>. <bold>(A, B) </bold>Coronal vibratome sections from E12.5 control mice injected with DiI in the dorsal thalamus.

In E12.5 control embryos we observed the previously described distribution of Islet1-expressing cells densely corralled into a well-defined corridor traversing the mantle zone of the MGE (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A, C</xref>). In cKO mice, Islet1-expressing cells were also distributed in a corridor running in a similar position through the MGE but they appeared more broadly distributed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>). This difference was quantified in four control and four cKO E12.5 embryos. A series of sampling bins was laid across the centre of the corridor, starting from the pial surface (as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>), in two non-adjacent sections from each embryo. Numbers of Islet1-expressing cells at each depth from each embryo were averaged to give the density profiles shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>. Although the overall numbers of Islet1-expressing cells in the entire sampling area were no different in controls and cKOs (mean for controls, 117.0 cells per 10 bins; mean for cKOs, 116.2 cells per 10 bins), the peak densities seen in the center of the corridor were lower in cKOs. The distribution of Islet1-expressing cells was broader in the ventral direction in cKOs: double-headed arrows in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref> indicate the widths of the distributions at half peak values. These data suggest that normal numbers of Islet1-expressing cells migrate from the LGE but they are more scattered into ventral MGE in cKOs, where Pax6-expressing cells are depleted. This disruption of the corridor might account for the thalamic axonal navigation defects observed in cKOs.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Broadening of the Islet-1-expressing corridor in E12.5 conditional knockouts</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>Coronal section of the telencephalon of an E12.5 control embryo showing immunohistochemistry for Islet1; the arrangement of bins used for counting Islet1-expressing cells across the corridor in control and conditional knockout (cKO) embryos is marked. <bold>(B) </bold>Graph shows the distributions of Islet1-expressing cells across the corridor: values plotted are mean densities per bin &#x000b1; standard error of the mean (n = 4 embryos for both control and cKO data); black error bars and grey shading are for control data; red error bars and broken line without shading are for cKO data; double-headed arrows indicate the widths of the distributions at half their peak values (black arrow for control data, red arrow for cKO data). <bold>(C, D) </bold>Illustration of the finding: in cKO embryos Islet1-expressing cells spread more broadly from the corridor towards the ventral surface of the brain (at the bottom left of each panel) than in controls.

Since in cKOs some thalamic axons are derailed before they reach the region ventral to the PSPB where they would interact with descending corticofugal axons, it seemed possible that an interaction between the populations of thalamocortical and corticofugal axons might be suboptimal, resulting in some descending cortical axons taking aberrant trajectories. Following injections of DiI into the thalamus of E14.5 and E16.5 cKOs, we observed retrogradely labeled cell bodies in the cortex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>), indicating that corticothalamic projections are present. We then injected DiI and DiA into the cortex at E16.5, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>: this would result in both the retrograde labeling of thalamocortical axons and the anterograde labeling of corticofugal axons, thereby allowing any aberrantly routed corticofugal trajectories to be identified. Labeling of the axons between somatosensory cortex and thalamus appeared normal (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8D, F</xref>) but, while we observed many axons labeled from the visual cortex in the internal capsule of both controls and cKOs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C, E</xref>), some were seen in the lateral telencephalon of cKOs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8E, G, G'</xref>) but not of controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref>). These axons could be followed to the pial surface of the lateral telencephalon (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8G, G'</xref>) but not beyond.

They become misrouted as they cross into ventral telencephalon. Many extend aberrantly into the hypothalamus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Others enter the internal capsule but then exit it to enter the future amygdala in the ventral part of the ventral telencephalon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]; thalamic axons were also observed taking this route when grown into <italic>Pax6</italic><sup>-/- </sup>ventral telencephalic slices <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].

In the cKOs described here, we found evidence for less extreme versions of these defects: although many thalamic axons navigated through the internal capsule, others deviated ventrally towards the hypothalamus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B"</xref>); some of those that had deviated ventrally towards the hypothalamus later projected laterally into the ventral part of the ventral telencephalon (green arrowheads in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C, D</xref>); some axons that did turn into the internal capsule then exited it in a ventral direction towards the amygdala (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E"</xref>). These findings indicate that at least some of the defects of thalamocortical navigation reported in <italic>Pax6</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos are caused by loss of Pax6 from ventral telencephalon.</p><p>It would be interesting to discover whether the degree of Pax6 depletion in the region ventral to the developing internal capsule influences the proportion of thalamic axons that navigate correctly. Testing this possibility was not possible here since the <italic>Six3</italic><sup><italic>A1A2</italic></sup>-<italic>Cre </italic>allele produced a depletion that was highly consistent from embryo to embryo, as shown by the tight error bars on the data in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2H, K</xref>, and so there was no opportunity to correlate a variable level of depletion with the phenotype. The development of a new Cre-expressing line in which an inducible form of Cre recombinase is expressed by all cells restricted to the tissue ventral to the internal capsule might allow this possibility to be tested, although finding a suitable promoter will be a challenge. Nevertheless, our data do show a clear requirement for normal Pax6 expression in this region for normal thalamic axonal navigation.</p><p>While it is conceivable that complete removal of Pax6 from the region ventral to the developing internal capsule might reproduce the <italic>Pax6</italic><sup>-/- </sup>phenotype in its entirety, previously published work indicates that the <italic>Pax6</italic><sup>-/- </sup>thalamic axonal phenotype is more likely to arise from a combination of thalamic and ventral telencephalic defects. Two studies have applied methods to examine the effects of loss of Pax6 selectively in cortex or thalamus on thalamocortical development. While recent work with mice carrying a cortex-specific deletion of Pax6 showed that Pax6 is not required in the cortex for thalamocortical formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], earlier work suggested that loss of Pax6 in thalamic cells prevents its axons from responding appropriately to ventral telencephalic guidance cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. It seems most likely, therefore, that ventral telencephalic defects in the deployment of guidance cues combine with defects in the ability of thalamic axons to respond to any cues that may be present in embryos lacking Pax6 to give the full thalamic axonal phenotype of the <italic>Pax6</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryo.</p></sec><sec><title>Mechanisms of aberrant thalamocortical axonal navigation in <italic>Pax6 </italic>cKO embryos</title><p>The axons in cKOs that fail to turn through the internal capsule but stray ventrally, roughly parallel to the diencephalic-telencephalic border, follow a route taken not only by thalamic axons in <italic>Pax6</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mutants, but also by at least some thalamic axons in <italic>Emx2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], <italic>Mash1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], <italic>Foxg1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and <italic>Lhx2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] mutants. It is possible that this is a default pathway taken by thalamic axons that fail to be attracted into the region of the future internal capsule. In these mutants, it has been suggested that the failure of attraction is due to defects of reciprocal projections from the region of the internal capsule that would normally act as guidance cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. In the case of <italic>Pax6</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mutants the dorsal thalamus is not innervated by pioneering axons from ventral telencephalon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Our present results show that, in normal embryos, this pioneering population does not express Pax6 at the time when it might provide guidance to thalamic axons, although we can not exclude the possibility that it is derived from cells that expressed Pax6 previously, and that it does still innervate the thalamus in cKOs with depletion of Pax6 only in ventral telencephalon. It is possible that in full <italic>Pax6</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mutants the absence of these pioneer projections occurs because thalamus, which normally expresses Pax6 and is defective, does not attract these axons, whereas in <italic>Pax6 </italic>cKOs the thalamus (which is normal) does attract the pioneer projections. Overall, our findings argue against the possibility that a ventral telencephalic function of Pax6 is to regulate the development of pioneer projections from ventral telencephalon to thalamus. They suggest that presence of these pioneer projections is not sufficient to ensure that all thalamic axons are routed normally.</p><p>We then looked for defects of the other major feature of the ventral telencephalon that guides thalamocortical axons, the Islet1-expressing corridor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. We found a diluted and broadened distribution of corridor cells at E12.5, the age at which thalamic axons are first turning towards this corridor region. The fact that the <italic>Six3</italic><sup><italic>A1A2</italic></sup>-<italic>Cre </italic>allele did not remove Pax6 from the proliferative zone of the LGE (which expresses Pax6) is important since this is the region from which the Islet1-expressing corridor cells migrate (green arrows in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). We can conclude, therefore, that the cells destined for the corridor in the <italic>Pax6 </italic>cKOs were normal and that the cause of their abnormally broadened distribution into a ventral region that expresses Pax6 is almost certainly a result of the depletion of Pax6 in that region. The cells of the corridor migrate at around E12.5, by which stage Pax6 was already depleted in the mantle zone of the MGE in cKOs, implicating Pax6 in the regulation of the final distribution of the immigrant cells. It is possible that Pax6-expressing cells ventral to the corridor exert a repulsive influence on the incoming Islet1-expressing LGE-derived cells. The reason that many thalamic axons failed to enter the corridor in <italic>Pax6 </italic>cKOs might have been the reduced peak-densities of corridor cells. The reason that a proportion of the thalamic axons that did successfully enter the corridor and began to travel along it exited by taking a ventral turn might have been the abnormal ventral dispersal of cells that should have migrated into the corridor, thereby providing a more permissive environment for these axons in ventral tissue.</p><p>A fruitful focus for further work would be an analysis of the molecular mechanisms by which the transcription factor Pax6 normally constrains the migration of corridor cells. At present we do not understand how cells are guided from the LGE into the corridor but it is likely that differential cell-cell adhesion, allowing the migrating corridor cells to enter some regions but keeping them out of others, plays a critical role. Pax6 is known to regulate the expression of cell adhesion molecules and regulate cell migration elsewhere in the developing telencephalon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], increasing the likelihood that its effects in the ventral telencephalon are mediated via its control over the expression of these types of molecule.</p><p>It is possible that depletion of Pax6 in ventral telencephalon might affect thalamic axonal navigation relatively directly through defective expression of one or more of a potentially large number of cell surface molecules that might affect the navigation of thalamic axons into and through the internal capsule (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]). Indeed, the effects of ventral Pax6 depletion on corridor and thalamic axonal development might be parallel results of the same molecular changes and defects of the corridor might not be the cause of thalamic axonal defects. Thus, while it is tempting to link causatively the defects of corridor development to those of thalamic axonal navigation in <italic>Pax6 </italic>cKOs, much more work will be needed to establish or refute this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Defects of corticofugal axons in <italic>Pax6 </italic>cKOs</title><p>We found evidence that some corticofugal axons, specifically from the visual cortex, are misrouted and descend laterally in the telencephalon rather than entering the internal capsule. It is possible that this is caused by the defect in the population of ascending thalamocortical projections. Previously it has been suggested that the intermingling of ascending thalamocortical axons with descending corticofugal axons in the ventral telencephalon is important for the guidance of each set [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. It seems highly plausible, therefore, that a diminished population of ascending thalamic axons might be unable to provide guidance for all descending cortical axons, causing some to deviate laterally. A possible reason for a specific effect on axons from the visual cortex is that these axons might arrive at the point of interaction with ascending fibers last, since they come from the caudal cortex that is further from the internal capsule and whose development lags behind that of more rostral cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Their late arrival might disadvantage their ability to locate and/or interact with guidance partners in the diminished ascending population. Clearly, other explanations are possible: for example, Pax6 might be needed to regulate the expression of molecules around the internal capsule that attract visual corticofugal axons through this region. Whatever the cause, it can not be an autonomous effect in the corticofugal cells themselves since cortical expression of Pax6 is unaffected in these cKOs.</p><p>It is conceivable that in cKOs defects of the descending corticofugal axons, caused directly by misregulation of expression around the internal capsule, might contribute to the defects of the ascending thalamic axons. Previous studies have suggested that descending corticofugal axons, on crossing the PSPB at about E14.5, interact and help guide ascending thalamocortical axons across the PSPB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This mechanism might contribute to defects of thalamic axons within the internal capsule; it seems a less likely explanation for early defects of thalamic axons around the diencephalic-telencephalic boundary.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings indicate an important novel function of Pax6 along the ventral aspect of the ventral telencephalon, constraining migrating LGE cells to form a tight Islet1-expressing cell-dense corridor and providing normal guidance cues for developing thalamocortical axons.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title><italic>Pax6 </italic>gene targeting</title><p>The RPCI-21 mouse PAC library [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>] was screened with a <italic>Pax6 </italic>intron 6 probe and a clone, 450-I22, was cloned into the plasmid pZero2 (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK).
