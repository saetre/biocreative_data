Typical ISs have a simple genetic organization. They include a single or two open reading frames encoding an enzyme (the transposase) that promotes displacement of the IS, and sometimes also encode proteins implicated in regulation. ISs are generally bordered by two short terminal inverted repeat sequences (IR). Transposase specifically binds to the IRs where it catalyses the DNA strand cleavages and transfer reactions necessary for insertion of the IS into a target site (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c2">2</xref>). Recognition and binding to the IR is therefore a key feature of transposase activity.</p><p>The insertion sequence IS<italic>911</italic>, originally isolated from <italic>Shigella dysenteriae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c3">3</xref>), is a representative member of perhaps the largest group of ISs, the IS<italic>3</italic> family. It has become one of the paradigms of IS transposition (for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c4">4</xref>). IS<italic>911</italic> is 1250 bp long with imperfect 36 bp terminal inverted repeats (IRL and IRR) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh276f1">1</xref>A) terminating with a 5&#x02032;-CA-3&#x02032; dinucleotide characteristic of the majority of IS<italic>3</italic> family members and implicated in strand cleavage and transfer. Previous evidence showed that IS<italic>911</italic> transposes using a circular intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c6">6</xref>) where the two IRs are covalently linked. This is capable of integrating into a target DNA molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c6">6</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh276f1">1</xref>A, I&#x02013;IV). Transposon circles are generated by a process in which the transposase assembles both IS ends into a synaptic or paired end complex (PEC) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh276f1">1</xref>A, I), introduces a single-strand break at one end to generate a 3&#x02032;-OH group and transfers the cleaved strand to the second, target, end, creating a single-strand bridge between the two ends (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh276f1">1</xref>A, II). This generates a molecule resembling a figure-of-eight. Transposon circles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh276f1">1</xref>A, III) are generated from the figure-of-eight forms probably by a replicative pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c5">5</xref>; G. Duval-Valentin, in preparation). Circular transposon forms have been observed for at least three other IS<italic>3</italic> family elements (IS<italic>2</italic>, IS<italic>3</italic> and IS<italic>150</italic>) and this two-step transposition mechanism is thought to be conserved throughout the family (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c4">4</xref>).</p><p>Like most IS<italic>3</italic> family members, IS<italic>911</italic> carries two consecutive and partially overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), <italic>orfA</italic> and <italic>orfB</italic>. The transposase, OrfAB (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh276f1">1</xref>A), is a fusion protein produced from both ORFs by programmed &#x02013;1 translational frameshifting while the product of the upstream ORF, OrfA, plays a regulatory role. The N-terminal region of OrfAB, also partially contained in <italic>orfA</italic>, includes the DNA binding domain (DBD) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh276f1">1</xref>B). This region specifically recognizes the terminal IRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c9">9</xref>). The C-terminal region of OrfAB, encoded by <italic>orfB</italic>, carries the highly conserved DD(35)E catalytic motif and includes the active site. On its own this domain is capable of catalysing sequence-specific strand cleavage in a process known as disintegration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c10">10</xref>). Frameshifting thus serves to assemble two distinct functional domains, a DNA binding domain and a catalytic domain, into the single OrfAB polypeptide.</p><p>To initiate a transposition reaction the transposase must bind to the left and right terminal IRs (IRL and IRR, defined with respect to the orientation of the transposase gene). Previous computer analyses of the N-terminal DBD revealed two distinct and well-defined motifs. The first, a leucine zipper (LZ) located between codons 63 and 94 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh276f1">1</xref>B), is involved in DNA binding and ensures protein&#x02013;protein interactions which are required for OrfAB binding to either of the two IRs. Mutations in the LZ can eliminate both mutltimerization and IR binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c7">7</xref>). Although the full-length transposase binds poorly to the ends <italic>in vitro</italic>, binding by a truncated form of the transposase which carries the N-terminal region (OrfAB&#x0005b;1&#x02013;149&#x0005d;) generates a PEC in which the protein bridges two IRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c7">7</xref>). These observations therefore strongly suggest that OrfAB binds DNA as a multimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c9">9</xref>). The second motif is a helix&#x02013;turn&#x02013;helix (HTH) (codons 25&#x02013;44, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh276f1">1</xref>B) thought to be responsible for the sequence specificity of DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c3">3</xref>). However, no experimental data are yet available to assess this potential role of the HTH in DNA recognition.</p><p>We have addressed this question here by a combination of computer-aided alignment of transposases of the entire available collection of IS<italic>3</italic> family members and site-directed mutagenesis. The alignments demonstrated that an HTH motif is strongly conserved in an equivalent position in all the proteins. Interest ingly, this analysis revealed the presence of a tryptophan residue conserved in all family members for which we propose a role in helix packing. Moreover, more extensive analysis revealed that the IS<italic>911</italic> HTH motif shared sequence characteristics of the LysR protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c11">11</xref>). Based on these alignments, site-directed mutagenesis of the HTH motif of IS<italic>911</italic> confirmed that this region is essential for transposase activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains and media</title><p>The <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain used in this study was a derivative of MC1061 (<italic>recA</italic>).

To obtain a more global view of this secondary structure feature within the IS<italic>3</italic> family, the N-terminal region (residues 1&#x02013;60) of more than 60 members registered in the IS database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www-is.biotoul.fr">http://www-is.biotoul.fr</ext-link>) were aligned using DNAMAN&#x000ae; software (data not shown). Unlike the C-terminal region, which includes the catalytic site (DDE), the N-terminal regions are poorly conserved at the amino acid sequence level. This is presumably due to the fact that different IS elements of this family carry terminal IRs with different sequences and therefore necessitate different arrays of amino acid residues for recognition. On the other hand, examination of the N-terminal region of each transposase for its potential to form HTH and &#x003b1;-helices (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://npsa-pbil.ibcp.fr/">http://npsa-pbil.ibcp.fr/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c17">17</xref>) predicted that each possessed this motif.</p><p>The IS<italic>3</italic> family can be conveniently divided into distinct subgroups (the IS<italic>2</italic>, IS<italic>3</italic>, IS<italic>51</italic>, IS<italic>150</italic> and IS<italic>407</italic> subgroups) based on features such as similarities in transposase sequences, the nucleotide sequence of their terminal IRs and the number of target base pairs which are duplicated on insertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c1">1</xref>). To simplify analysis of secondary structure predictions, a single representative of each subgroup was chosen and the predicted HTH motifs were aligned. The results are presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh276f2">2</xref>A. Inspection of this alignment reveals some degree of sequence conservation, most of which is localized in the first helix (helix 1). Three of the five conserved amino acids of the amphiphatic helix 1 are hydrophobic (V25, A28 and A29) and would be located on the same face of the helix. This is consistent with the fact that, in other well-characterized HTH structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c18">18</xref>), this helix ensures the maintenance of the structure of the DNA binding motif. The conserved hydrophobic residues are presumably implicated in the hydrophobic face which contacts the second helix (helix 2). Helix 2 is generally involved in DNA sequence discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c18">18</xref>). Less conservation is observed in this second helix. This is consistent with a role in DNA recognition since the position of polar residues in this helix would be dictated by the sequence of different IRs. Furthermore, this second helix is more basic than the first, an observation which is also consistent with a DNA binding activity. Interestingly, helix 2 of the HTH motifs of all IS<italic>3</italic> family members contains a tryptophan (W) residue. Together with those of the DDE catalytic motif (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh276f1">1</xref>B), this is the most highly conserved residue in the transposases of the entire IS<italic>3</italic> family, suggesting that it fulfils an important function other than in sequence discrimination.</p><p>To determine the relationship between the HTH motif of the IS<italic>3</italic> transposases with those found in other DNA binding proteins, a BlastP analysis was performed with the non-redundant protein SWISSPROT database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</ext-link>) using the first 60 amino acids of the IS<italic>911</italic> transposase (data not shown). This analysis revealed several identities with the <italic>H.influenzae</italic> CysB protein. CysB is a member of the large LysR family of transcriptional repressor/activator proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c11">11</xref>). An alignment of the OrfAB, CysB, LysR and CbnR sequences (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh276f2">2</xref>B) revealed good conservation in the region predicted to form the HTH motif. The proposed IS<italic>911</italic> HTH motif fits well with the consensus sequence previously described for the LysR family HTH motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c11">11</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh276f2">2</xref>B).</p></sec><sec><title>Directed mutagenesis</title><p>Although no crystal structure was available for a LysR family member at the beginning of this work, many mutational studies defining key amino acid residues had been reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c19">19</xref>). This information was used as a guide for targeting mutations to specific residues designed to affect the DNA binding activity of the IS<italic>911</italic> HTH motif. The following mutations were chosen (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh276f1">1</xref>B): A29P (Ala29&#x02192;Pro), R41A (Arg41&#x02192;Ala), K44A (Lys44&#x02192;Ala), W42A (Trp42&#x02192;Ala), W42F (Trp42&#x02192;Phe) and W42Y (Trp42&#x02192;Tyr). Mutation of the central alanine of helix 1 (A29P) would be expected to disrupt the helix. Mutations R41A and K44A concern charged residues located in helix 2 and would be expected to interfere with specific DNA contacts. Finally, the three mutations at W42 (A, F and Y) should provide information concerning the role of this conserved residue: the requirement for an aromatic residue (W42A) or for a non-polar (F) or polar (Y) hydrophobic aromatic residue.</p></sec><sec><title>The HTH mutant proteins no longer repress the IR&#x02013;IR junction promoter, p<sub>junc</sub></title><p>Formation of the IR&#x02013;IR junction in the circular transposition intermediate generates a strong promoter, p<sub>junc</sub>, by assembling a &#x02013;35 promoter element located within the IRR with a &#x02013;10 element located in the IRL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c13">13</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh276f1">1</xref>A).

However, a transposase derivative truncated for the catalytic C-terminal region and carrying the first 149 amino acids of OrfAB binds strongly to the IRs <italic>in vitro</italic> and is capable of generating a synaptic complex between the terminal IRS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c9">9</xref>). This derivative was previously found to repress p<sub>junc</sub> more strongly <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c20">20</xref>). It was therefore of interest to test whether derivatives of OrfAB&#x0005b;1&#x02013;149&#x0005d;, with the mutated HTH motif retained the capacity of wild-type OrfAB&#x0005b;1-149&#x0005d; to repress p<sub>junc</sub>. For this, the HTH mutations were introduced separately into a copy of <italic>orfAB&#x0005b;1&#x02013;149&#x0005d;</italic> under control of the p<sub>lacUV5</sub> promoter. A set of strains was then constructed, each carrying the pBST2 plasmid, in which p<sub>junc</sub> drives expression of a <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter gene, and a second plasmid to supply each of the mutant OrfAB&#x0005b;1&#x02013;149&#x0005d; derivatives <italic>in trans</italic> under control of the inducible p<sub>lacUV5</sub> promoter. The levels of expression from p<sub>junc</sub>, measured as expression of the &#x003b2;-galactosidase reporter gene, are presented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh276tb2">2</xref>. All mutants showed some reduction in their ability to repress p<sub>junc</sub> but only two, A29P and W42A, were completely inactive. W42F showed only 18&#x00025; repression (compared with 90&#x00025; with the wild-type) and W42Y exhibited an intermediate activity (40&#x00025; repression). R41A also exhibited reduced activity (69&#x00025; repression) while K44A appeared as active as the wild-type (88&#x00025; repression). These <italic>in vivo</italic> results strongly suggest that modification of the HTH motif influences the IR binding properties of the IS<italic>911</italic> transposase (or at least of derivatives containing the DBD of IS<italic>911</italic> transposase). The results also suggest an important role for W42, since all three mutants exhibit a strong decrease in their capacity to repress p<sub>junc</sub>. The A29 position also seems to be important for DNA binding activity. Modifications of the charged residues R41 and K44 have only a slight effect, suggesting that, alone, they are not able to abolish DNA binding activity.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA binding activity of HTH mutants</title><p>To confirm these results, the effect of these mutations on binding to the IS<italic>911</italic> IRs was tested <italic>in vitro</italic>. Previous studies showed that full-length OrfAB binds poorly <italic>in vitro</italic> to the terminal IR sequences. However, as for p<sub>junc</sub> repression, binding can be significantly increased using transposase derivatives truncated for the C-terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c9">9</xref>). OrfAB&#x0005b;1&#x02013;149&#x0005d; was therefore also used in this experiment. The mutations were introduced into a copy of <italic>orfAB&#x0005b;1&#x02013;149&#x0005d;</italic> carrying a C-terminal His<sub>6</sub> tag (<italic>orfAB&#x0005b;1&#x02013;149&#x0005d;</italic>::<italic>6His</italic>) under control of the arabinose promoter (p<sub>ara</sub>). The partially purified proteins were used in EMSAs with radiolabelled DNA fragments carrying IRR. Comparable amounts of OrfAB&#x0005b;1&#x02013;149&#x0005d;, as judged by western blot analysis, were used in these assays. The results of gel electrophoresis of the resulting complexes are presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh276f3">3</xref>. Preparations of wild-type OrfAB&#x0005b;1&#x02013;149&#x0005d; generate different complexes when bound to the IRR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh276f3">3</xref>, right panel schemes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c9">9</xref>). Complex I had previously been identified as a synaptic complex including two IR-carrying DNA fragments paired by a proposed oligomeric form of OrfAB&#x0005b;1&#x02013;149&#x0005d;. Complex II appeared at higher protein concentrations and was proposed to result from the interaction of a single IR-carrying DNA fragment with the same oligomeric form of OrfAB&#x0005b;1&#x02013;149&#x0005d;. Complex III was proposed to represent a complex containing OrfAB&#x0005b;1&#x02013;149&#x0005d; and the IRR in another, but as yet undefined, configuration. This third complex was observed when OrfAB&#x0005b;1&#x02013;149&#x0005d; was mixed with the regulatory protein OrfA or with an equivalent protein produced by proteolysis of OrfAB&#x0005b;1&#x02013;149&#x0005d; in partially purified protein extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c9">9</xref>). To simplify the interpretation of the results, experimental conditions were used in which the partially purified protein extracts of OrfAB&#x0005b;1&#x02013;149&#x0005d; gave rise only to complexes I and III (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh276f3">3</xref>, lane 3). Each mutant was found to modify these complexes quantitatively or qualitatively. As expected, the A29P mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh276f3">3</xref>, lane 4) completely abolished DNA binding. Removal of the basic residues in the recognition helix 2 (R41A and K44A) did not abolish DNA binding. However, these mutants exhibit patterns of complex formation that are clearly different from the wild-type protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh276f3">3</xref>, compare lanes 5 and 6 with lane 3). Both produce more of complexes II and III and less of complex I than the wild-type protein and, in addition, the K44A mutant shows a qualitative difference in the migration of complex II. However, the higher levels of complex III, which are correlated with a reduction in the level of free DNA, might also be explained by there being more of the truncated forms shorter than OrfAB&#x0005b;1&#x02013;149&#x0005d; in the extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c9">9</xref>). Results obtained with mutants of the conserved tryptophan within helix 2 (W42) were also interesting. While only traces of DNA&#x02013;protein complexes were detected with W42A and W42F (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh276f3">3</xref>, lanes 7 and 8), the DNA binding activity of the W42Y mutant was only slightly affected compared with the wild-type protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh276f3">3</xref>; compare lanes 9 and 3). This suggests that an aromatic, polar and hydrophobic residue is needed at this position in helix 2.</p><p>These results are in agreement with those obtained in the p<sub>junc</sub> repression assay (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh276tb2">2</xref>). Furthermore, there is an excellent correlation between the generation of complex I in EMSA and repression in the p<sub>junc</sub> repression assay. This reinforces the idea that the HTH motif mediates correct recognition of IRs. Residues A29 and W42 are clearly important for DNA binding activity of the IS<italic>911</italic> transposase. Whether this is a direct effect on DNA recognition or a more indirect effect on protein structure remains to be determined (see Discussion).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro</italic> activity of HTH mutant transposases</title><p>The results presented above indicate that the HTH motif is required for binding of the truncated form of the transposase to a single IRR both <italic>in vitro</italic> or to p<sub>junc</sub><italic>in vivo</italic>. It was therefore of interest to determine whether these mutants were capable of sustaining transposase-mediated recombination. To examine this, they were first transferred into a full-length copy of <italic>orfAB</italic> under control of p<sub>ara</sub>. Note that in these constructions the OrfAB protein was produced by artificially fusing the <italic>orfA</italic> and <italic>orfB</italic> reading frames to generate the <italic>orfAB</italic> gene without changing the OrfAB amino acid sequence (mutation from ATTA<sub>6</sub>G to ACTCA<sub>6</sub>G) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c5">5</xref>). After partial purification of these modified proteins, their <italic>in vitro</italic> activity in formation of the figure-of-eight intermediates was examined in a standard reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c5">5</xref>). Following incubation of a plasmid carrying an IS<italic>911</italic>-based transposon, pAPT166, with each of the partially purified mutant transposases, the products were digested with EcoRV and figure-of-eight and parental plasmid forms were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The results are presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh276f4">4</xref>. Since the parent plasmid carries two EcoRV sites, one within the transposon and the other within the donor backbone, EcoRV-digested figure-of-eight transposition intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c8">8</xref>) appear as a &#x003c7; DNA form migrating high in the gel while the parental plasmid simply generates two distinguishable DNA fragments (marked &#x0002a; in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh276f4">4</xref>). The persistence of linearized parental plasmid (marked &#x0002a;&#x0002a; in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh276f4">4</xref>) is due to the difficulty of obtaining complete EcoRV digestion after treatment with the protein extract.</p><p>In this assay, mutants A29P and W42A, as expected, showed low activity in figure-of-eight formation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh276f4">4</xref>, lanes 4 and 7) compared with wild-type OrfAB (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh276f4">4</xref>, lane 2). Mutants K44A and W42F (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh276f4">4</xref>, lanes 6 and 8) exhibited reduced activity, whereas the R41A and W42Y mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh276f4">4</xref>, lanes 5 and 9) generated quantities of the figure-of-eight intermediate comparable to those obtained with the wild-type protein. Globally, these results are consistent with those obtained with the OrfAB&#x0005b;1&#x02013;149&#x0005d; variants in the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> DNA binding assays.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vivo</italic> activity of HTH mutant transposases</title><p>As a further test, the activity of the mutant OrfAB derivatives was assessed <italic>in vivo</italic> using a transposase-mediated recombination assay. In contrast to the <italic>in vitro</italic> assay, in which IS<italic>911</italic> transposition is arrested at the figure-of-eight step, both figure-of-eight and transposon circle formation can be followed with this procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c21">21</xref>). A two plasmid system was used. One plasmid carried each of the <italic>orfAB</italic> derivatives under the control of p<sub>ara</sub> while the other, pLH37 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c14">14</xref>), carried an IS<italic>911</italic>-derived transposon with appropriately oriented IRs but without the transposase gene. After 30 min of induced OrfAB expression, DNA was isolated from strains using a cleared lysate procedure and the products were analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis following EcoRV digestion. The results are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh276f5">5</xref>. Again, as in the other assays described above, the mutants A29P and W42A exhibited a clearly reduced level of both figure-of-eight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c8">8</xref>) and circular transposon forms (circle) compared with the wild-type OrfAB (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh276f5">5</xref>, compare lane 3 with lanes 4 and 7). The K44A mutant appeared to be less affected in its activity than either of these (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh276f5">5</xref>, lane 6), while the other mutant derivatives did not appear to be affected at all in their capacity to generate either of these transposition intermediates.</p><p>In contrast to the DNA binding activities of the equivalent OrfAB&#x0005b;1&#x02013;149&#x0005d; derivatives (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh276f3">3</xref>), all mutants, except for A29P, retained at least some activity both <italic>in vivo</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh276f5">5</xref>) and <italic>in vitro</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh276f4">4</xref>). This difference may be due to the presence of the C-terminal catalytic domain in the full-length OrfAB mutants. Since this domain must also interact with the tip of the IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c9">9</xref>) to catalyse strand cleavage and transfer, this interaction may contribute to the overall binding capacity of the protein.</p><p>Taken together, these results demonstrate that mutations within the predicted HTH motif affect transposase activity.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Previous results had located a HTH motif in the N-terminal end of the IS<italic>911</italic> transposase, OrfAB, between residues 25 and 44 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c3">3</xref>), and this had been proposed to play a central role in recognition and binding to the terminal IRs of this insertion sequence. This idea was supported by the observation that an OrfAB derivative including only the first 149 residues retains the capacity to bind these ends and to assemble the two ends into a synaptic or paired end complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c7">7</xref>).</p><sec><title>Conservation of the HTH motif sequence</title><p>Since IS<italic>911</italic> is a member of one of the largest IS families, the IS<italic>3</italic> family, in which all members have presumably adopted a similar transposition mechanism, the importance of this HTH motif should be reflected in its conservation throughout the family. Computer-aided analysis indeed detected a HTH motif at a similar position in the transposases of the entire IS3 family (&#x0003e;60 members, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www-is.biotoul.fr/is.html">http://www-is.biotoul.fr/is.html</ext-link>). Although there was only limited sequence conservation between the different members, most of this was concentrated in the first helix of the motif (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh276f2">2</xref>, consensus hxxhhppx), considered to be a structural helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c18">18</xref>). Moreover, the conservation includes the hydrophobic residues of this helix which could be involved in helix&#x02013;helix interactions. We interpret this as reflecting a conservation of folding of the HTH motif within the family. The fact that less conservation is observed in the second helix, generally considered to be the DNA recognition helix, is consistent with the fact that these transposases interact with different DNA sequences (IRs). Remarkably, the second helix exhibits a highly conserved tryptophan residue (W42 in the case of IS<italic>911</italic>) which, apart from those located in the catalytic active site, is the most conserved residue in the entire IS<italic>3</italic> family of transposases. This conservation must reflect an important function unrelated to DNA sequence discrimination. A similarly conserved tryptophan has been reported in the recognition helix in a family of DNA binding proteins, the homedomain family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c22">22</xref>). Although not explicit in Wintjens and Rooman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c22">22</xref>), visualization of the structure of these domains in several members of the homeodomain family (PdbViewer, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.expasy.org/spdbv">www.expasy.org/spdbv</ext-link>) revealed that the W is involved in hydrophobic contacts between helix 2 (recognition) and helix 1. This suggests a structural role for this residue.</p><p>Further analysis of the IS<italic>911</italic> HTH motif showed it to be related to those of the LysR family of transcriptional activators and repressors. This conservation is particularly notable between OrfAB and CysB. Once again the most important conservation is observed in the first helix, where both the transposase and LysR families exhibit a clear consensus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh276f2">2</xref>A and B, consensus hxxAAp).</p></sec><sec><title>OrfAB derivatives with mutations in the HTH motif exhibit modified DNA binding properties</title><p>All HTH mutations of OrfAB&#x0005b;1&#x02013;149&#x0005d;, based on the alignment presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh276f2">2</xref>, exhibited modified DNA binding properties as judged by EMSA <italic>in vitro</italic> or by repression of p<sub>junc</sub><italic>in vivo</italic>. Three mutants, A29P, W42A and W42F, were particularly affected in their capacity to bind: no complexes could be detected with A29P, whereas W42A and W42F generated only trace levels. The other mutants exhibited less clear-cut effects. W42Y appeared to be only slightly inhibited, whereas R41A and K44A exhibited differences in the pattern of complex formation. For example, complex II generated by R41A migrated as does that generated by the wild-type OrfAB&#x0005b;1&#x02013;149&#x0005d;, whereas that generated by K44A migrated significantly higher in the gel. This shows that these two residues are not essential for DNA binding although their substitution modifies DNA binding. More detailed examination of the formation of these complexes is required to determine the exact molecular consequences of the mutations.</p><p>Globally these results clearly show that point mutations of the predicted HTH motif of IS<italic>911</italic> modify the DNA binding properties of this truncated form of the transposase. The two clear-cut effects are obtained for A29P and W42A, two mutations that are thought to strongly destabilize the HTH structure: A29P should disrupt the first helix and, based on homeodomain family structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c22">22</xref>), W42A would be expected to destabilize the cohesion between helices. The fact that tryptophan is partially complemented <italic>in vitro</italic> by tyrosine (polar, hydrophobic and aromatic) but neither by alanine (small hydrophobic) nor phenylalanine (hydrophobic and aromatic) suggests that tryptophan could form a polar and hydrophobic arm allowing interaction between the helices. A recent structure obtained for CbnR from <italic>Ralstonia eutropha</italic>, a LysR-type transcriptional regulator protein, revealed that the A22 residue (corresponding to A29 in OrfAB) is exposed and may interact directly with DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c23">23</xref>). This suggests that OrfAB A29 residue could have more than a structural role. Residues R41 and K44 are equivalent to R34 and Q37 in CbnR (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh276f2">2</xref>B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c23">23</xref>), which, like A22, are also clearly exposed in the structure. Based on modelling studies, these residues were not proposed to interact with DNA, rather the authors suggested A22 and P30 (equivalent to OrfAB A29 and S37) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c23">23</xref>). Moreover, the &#x02018;HTH&#x02019; motif within the CbnR structure is composed of three rather than two helices. This is also true for the &#x02018;HTH&#x02019; motifs of the homeodomain family which carry a conserved W residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c22">22</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, although few transposases have been characterized for their DNA binding activity &#x0005b;e.g. those of IS<italic>50</italic>, phage Mu, Tc<italic>3</italic> and <italic>Sleeping Beauty</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c27">27</xref>)&#x0005d;, all carry an HTH-like structure with more than two helices in the motif. Structural studies have shown that the transposase of IS<italic>50</italic> carries four helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c24">24</xref>), while those of phage Mu and Tc<italic>3</italic> include three (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c26">26</xref>). Although these present no homology with IS<italic>3</italic> family transposases either in primary sequence or in the organization of the DNA domain, making it difficult to make direct comparisons, OrfAB also contains a third predicted helix located N-terminal to helices 1 and 2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh276f1">1</xref>B). This raises the possibility that the DNA binding domain we have targeted here may carry structural features in addition to the simple HTH motif.</p></sec><sec><title>Inactivation of transposase activity</title><p>In the context of the full-length OrfAB protein, mutants A29P and W42A, which strongly alter the HTH motif, exhibited dramatic effects on transposase activity both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro.</italic> The mutant K44A, which exhibited a slightly modified DNA binding activity, showed partial activity in both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> transposase activity tests, while W42Y and R41A, which exhibited only slight changes in DNA binding activity, appeared to be as active as the wild-type protein in catalysing strand cleavage and transfer. Thus there is an excellent correlation between DNA binding and transposition activity.</p><p>The case of the W42F mutation is more difficult to interpret. This mutant is relatively inactive in the DNA binding assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh276f3">3</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh276tb1">1</xref>), partially active in the <italic>in vitro</italic> recombination assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh276f4">4</xref>) and active in the <italic>in vivo</italic> recombination assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh276f5">5</xref>). We note that all the effects observed in the context of the full-size transposase are less marked than those obtained with truncated forms tested in the DNA binding assay. These differences may be due to the DNA binding properties of the C-terminal part of the transposase carrying the catalytic site (DDE). The DDE domain must clearly recognize the outside tip of the IR since it catalyses sequence-specific strand cleavage and transfer at the conserved 5&#x02032;-CA-3&#x02032; termini of the IS. It is thus possible that this domain contributes to DNA binding and can to some extent &#x02018;complement&#x02019; the effect of some of the HTH mutations, particularly that of W42F. This type of effect would accord with the present model for transposase&#x02013;IR interactions, where the transposase DNA binding domain (HTH plus LZ) serves as an anchor by binding to an internal region of the IR in order to correctly position the catalytic domain (DDE) on the termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c9">9</xref>). Furthermore, the known structure of DNA bound transposases (Tn<italic>5</italic>, phage Mu and retroviral IN) suggests that the protein&#x02013;DNA contacts appear along almost the entire length of the transposase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh276c28">28</xref>).</p><p>In summary, the results presented in this article indicate that the N-terminal HTH motif carried by the IS<italic>911</italic> transposase and, by extension, by all other members of IS<italic>3</italic> family, plays an essential role in transposase activity at the level of recognition of and binding to the terminal IRs. However, comparison with the LysR family member CbnR, homeodomain proteins and other transposases whose structures have been solved raises the possibility that additional structural elements, such the predicted N-terminal helix, may also be associated with this DNA binding motif.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh276f1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> The IS<italic>911</italic> transposition cycle and organization of its transposase.
