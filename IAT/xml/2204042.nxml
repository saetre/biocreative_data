Neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages are critical cellular components of the human innate immune system. Proinflammatory cytokines, such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), and interferon-&#x003b3; (IFN-&#x003b3;), have been shown to up-regulate microbicidal activity in these effector cells of innate immunity. Currently, the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for these effects are not completely understood. We hypothesized that these cytokines may up-regulate TLR expression as a mechanism to facilitate microbial recognition and augment the innate immune response. Using quantitative realtime rt-PCR technology, we examined constitutive expression of TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, and TLR9 mRNA and the effects of G-CSF, GM-CSF, M-CSF, and IFN-&#x003b3; on TLR mRNA expression in purified populations of normal human neutrophils, monocytes, and monocyte-derived macrophages. Relative constitutive expression of TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 was similar in neutrophils and monocytes. Constitutive expression of TLR5 was less in neutrophils compared to monocytes. Constitutive expression of TLR4 was greater and that of TLR9 lower in monocyte-derived macrophages compared to monocytes. Of the cytokines examined, IFN-&#x003b3; and GM-CSF caused the greatest effects on TLR expression. IFN- &#x003b3; up-regulated TLR2 and TLR4 in neutrophils and monocytes. GM-CSF up-regulated expression of TLR2 and TLR4 in neutrophils and TLR2 in monocytes. TLR5 was down-regulated by inflammatory cytokines in monocytes. These results suggest a potential role for IFN- &#x003b3; and/or GM-CSF as therapeutic immunomodulators of the host defense to infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Toll-like receptor</kwd><kwd>human</kwd><kwd>phagocytes</kwd><kwd>cytokines</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The professional phagocytes, namely neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages, play important roles in host defense as critical cellular components of the innate immune system.

Of the cytokines studied, IFN-&#x003b3; and GM-CSF caused the most robust effects on TLR expression with statistically significantly increased TLR2 expression in monocytes, a trend for increased TLR4 in monocytes (IFN-&#x003b3;) and trends for increased TLR2 and TLR4 in neutrophils.

GM-CSF was shown to play an important role in inflammatory signaling in a model of LPS-induced lung injury. Pretreatment of mice with an inhibitor of GM-CSF prior to LPS instillation caused decreased TLR4 mRNA expression, associated with decreased lung neutrophil and macrophage infiltration and decreased levels of TNF- &#x003b1; and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP2). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref> In another study using transgenic mice with varyingTLR4 DNA copy number, mice with increased TLR4 DNA copies had increased lung inflammatory responses to intranasally administered LPS. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref></p><p>While TLR2 and TLR4 were up-regulated by GM-CSF and IFN-&#x003b3; in monocytes, TLR5 expression was diminished by these cytokines in monocytes and by GM-CSF in neutrophils.

Alternatively, they suggest that separate expression control of TLR5 by inflammatory cytokines may contribute to regulation of innate immunity in monocytes and neutrophils.</p><p>The effects of G-CSF and M-CSF on TLR expression in neutrophils and monocytes were less striking. Neutrophil surface TLR2 has been shown to be increased by G-CSF in previous studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref> The present study demonstrated a small increase in expression of TLR2 mRNA in neutrophils. Unlike IFN-&#x003b3; and GM-CSF, only G-CSF led to increased levels of both TLR5 and TLR9 in neutrophils.</p><p>This study did not evaluate the effects of immune-modulating cytokines on protein expression but focused on the effects on TLR mRNA expression. Proinflammatory cytokines may also control protein expression of TLRs on the cell surface and intracellularly through regulation of inhibitory RNA pathways, protein translation and post-translational processes. Our results show that TLR mRNA expression is regulated by these cytokines, and we speculate that this may contribute to enhanced cellular responses to pathogens.</p><p>The human TLR family is a recently described component of the human innate immune system, and our knowledge of the regulation of these pathogen-discriminating receptors continues to evolve. This report demonstrates that cytokines with known ability to enhance microbicidal activity of phagocytes differentially regulate TLR2, TLR4, TLR5 and TLR9 mRNA expression in neutrophils and monocytes. IFN-&#x003b3; strongly increased the expression of the bacterial recognition receptors TLR2 and TLR4 on both neutrophils and monocytes. GM-CSF treatment also increased expression of TLR2 and TLR4 on neutrophils and has previously been shown to enhance TLR ligand responses by these cells. These results demonstrate that up-regulated TLR expression may be a component of cytokine-mediated enhancement of phagocyte-mediated host defense and suggest a promising role for IFN-&#x003b3; and/or
