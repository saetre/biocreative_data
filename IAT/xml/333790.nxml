The library was screened with a multimerized 20 bp-oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the -126 to -107 bp region of the bovine thyroglobulin gene promoter. The specificity of DNA sequence recognition was demonstrated by DNA binding experiments realized with beta-galactosidase-fusion protein immobilized on nitrocellulose filters and various unlabelled multimerized competing DNA fragments. The encoded protein, TFE, appears to be the canine counterpart of a recently cloned human transcription factor, ITF-2, that binds to the mu E5 kappa E2 motif found in both immunoglobulin heavy and light chains genes enhancers and belongs to the basic-Helix-Loop-Helix family of transcription factors. When TFE protein was produced in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate, it displayed the same specificity of DNA sequence recognition as the beta-galactosidase fusion protein and immobilization of the translation product on nitrocellulose still appeared to be essential for detecting in vitro DNA binding activity. Functional data failed to assign a role for TFE in the control of thyroglobulin gene transcription in vitro, suggesting that the selection of TFE clone resulted from the fortuitous presence of a high affinity binding site in the probe used for screening the expression library.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00241-0145-a" xlink:role="1123"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00241-0147-a" xlink:role="1125"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00241-0148-a" xlink:role="1126"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00241-0143.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1121"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00241-0144.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1122"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00241-0145.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1123"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00241-0146.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1124"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00241-0147.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1125"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00241-0148.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1126"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00241-0149.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1127"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
