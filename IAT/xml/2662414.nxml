In the auditory and vestibular neuroepithelia of the inner ear, hair cells are accompanied by another cell type called supporting cells. This second cell population has been described as having stem cell-like properties, allowing efficient hair cell replacement during embryonic and larval/fetal development of all vertebrates. However, mammals lose their regenerative capacity in most inner ear neuroepithelia in postnatal life. Remarkably, reptiles, birds, amphibians, and fish are different in that they can regenerate hair cells throughout their lifespan. The lateral line in amphibians and in fish is an additional sensory organ, which is used to detect water movements and is comprised of neuroepithelial patches, called neuromasts. These are similar in ultra-structure to the inner ear's neuroepithelia and they share the expression of various molecular markers. We examined the regeneration process in hair cells of the lateral line of zebrafish larvae carrying a retroviral integration in a previously uncharacterized gene, <italic>phoenix</italic> (<italic>pho</italic>). <italic>Phoenix</italic> mutant larvae develop normally and display a morphologically intact lateral line. However, after ablation of hair cells with copper or neomycin, their regeneration in <italic>pho</italic> mutants is severely impaired. We show that proliferation in the supporting cells is strongly decreased after damage to hair cells and correlates with the reduction of newly formed hair cells in the regenerating <italic>phoenix</italic> mutant neuromasts. The retroviral integration linked to the phenotype is in a novel gene with no known homologs showing high expression in neuromast supporting cells. Whereas its role during early development of the lateral line remains to be addressed, in later larval stages <italic>phoenix</italic> defines a new class of proteins implicated in hair cell regeneration.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>By screening for regeneration deficient zebrafish mutations, we identified a zebrafish mutant line deficient in a highly specific regeneration process, the renewal of hair cells in the lateral line. Although this organ is specific to fish and amphibians, it contains essentially the same mechanosensory cells (the hair cells) that function in the ear for sound and balance detection in all vertebrates. Mammals are unusual vertebrates in that they have lost the ability to regenerate functional hair cells after damage by sound or chemical exposure. All other vertebrates retain their ability to regenerate their hair cells after damage, but this process is not well understood at the molecular level. The retroviral insertion linked to the <italic>phoenix</italic> mutation is in a new gene family class that is specifically required for the supporting cells to enter into mitosis after hair cell damage. What is particularly unusual about this mutation is that it appears not to affect the normal development and differentiation pathways, but only seems to affect the cells' post-differentiation regeneration.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>During development of the vertebrate inner ear, a subset of neuroepithelial cells specialize to give rise to hair cells and supporting cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000455-Fritzsch1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000455-Kelley2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Consequently, a large majority of deafness cases in humans are linked to absent or damaged hair cells.

It is a superficial organ running along each side of the body which consists of stereotypically distributed patches of neuroepithelium, called neuromasts. These are discrete organs made of hair cells that project into the aqueous environment and supporting cells that surround them. In the zebrafish embryo, the lateral line neuromasts first appear in the head approximately 2 days post fertilization (dpf) and in parallel begin to develop along the entire length of the trunk and tail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000455-Metcalfe1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Hair cells are fully functional by 4dpf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000455-Raible1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> and as the larva grows into an adult, additional neuromasts are continually added to the embryonic pattern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000455-Laguerre1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000455-Gompel1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.

Additionally, this sensory organ is known to continuously replace hair cells in larvae and adults <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000455-Jorgensen1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.

Several waterborne agents have been used to eliminate hair cells from neuromasts, including aminoglycosides, platinum-based drugs, and metal ions. Copper is a potent ototoxic agent, killing hair cells in the lateral line, as early as 3dpf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000455-Hernndez1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. After 5dpf, the hair cells also become sensitive to antibiotics of the aminoglycoside family, in particular to neomycin, presumably coinciding with their functional maturity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000455-Santos1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000455-Murakami1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. At all time points, regeneration of hair cells has been documented, mainly resulting from the division of supporting cells and subsequent differentiation into new hair cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000455-Jones1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000455-Williams1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000455-Ma1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We utilized an <italic>in vivo</italic> assay using both copper and neomycin to follow regeneration of hair cells in neuromasts of 6dpf to 8dpf larvae.

Homozygous mutants did not display obvious morphological or behavioral phenotypes and developed a functional lateral line as ascertained by FM1-43 incorporation. However, when <italic>phoenix</italic> larvae were treated with either copper or neomycin, they showed a strongly reduced regeneration of the hair cells. In parallel, we demonstrated that another form of regeneration, the growth of the tail after amputation, was not affected in the <italic>phoenix</italic> mutants, arguing that the regeneration defect was specific to hair cells.</p><p>We show that, the number of supporting cells was not significantly different before or after copper and neomycin treatments in neuromasts of wild-type versus <italic>phoenix</italic> mutant larvae. Furthermore, we monitored cell death over the time course of our assay in treated wild-type and mutant neuromasts and did not find significant differences in supporting cell death. Strikingly, we found that the proliferation rate in this progenitor cell population was strongly reduced in mutants. Thus, impaired proliferation is tightly correlated to the observed deficit of regenerated hair cells in the <italic>phoenix</italic> mutant.</p><p>We characterized the gene carrying the retroviral integration linked to the phenotype, and find that it is a novel gene, with no previously described homologs. Expression at 3-4dpf is upregulated in the supporting cells of the neuromasts. Thus, <italic>Phoenix</italic> is the first documented member of a novel gene family, which has an important role in the regeneration of hair cells in the lateral line.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Monitoring hair cell regeneration in the lateral line of zebrafish mutant lines</title><p>We have utilized an assay to monitor hair cell regeneration in the lateral line of 5dpf zebrafish larvae, using transient exposure to copper sulphate (10mM) or neomycin (200mM) dissolved in the water. Our intention was to test for defective hair cell regeneration from a collection of mutant lines previously identified in a retroviral integration screen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000455-Golling1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. The major advantage of using retroviral constructs, over chemicals like ENU, as a mutagenic agent is the rapid identification of the mutated gene. This allows the spatio-temporal expression of the mutated genes to be compared to the observed phenotypes, facilitating selection of the mutants of interest. We reasoned that mutant larvae which develop a normal and functional lateral line and that exhibit expression of the mutated gene in neuromasts would be good candidates to test for defects in the regeneration of the hair cells. We found such a mutant line, which we called <italic>phoenix</italic>. Homozygotes displayed no behavioral defects (response to sound or mechanical stimulation was normal, data not shown) or visible morphological abnormalities until 5dpf, when the swim bladder failed to inflate. Later, around 7 to 8 dpf, mutants display necrosis in the liver, and death ensues at approximately 14 dpf. Because the gene was expressed in the lateral line neuromasts (see below), we performed a detailed assessment of this organ in 2 to 12 dpf larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000455-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Semi-thin sections through neuromasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000455-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) of <italic>phoenix</italic> mutants (lower panels, 5dpf left panel and 9dpf right panel) were indistinguishable from wild-type larvae (upper panels). <italic>Camera lucida</italic> drawings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000455-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) of each section show the cilia (green) of hair cells and their nuclei (red) and the nuclei of the supporting cells (blue). Likewise, ultra-thin sections observed by electron microscopy (EM) (10dpf larvae shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000455-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) did not present obvious differences between wild-type (top panel) and mutant neuromasts (lower panel). <italic>Camera lucida</italic> drawings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000455-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) show, like in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000455-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, the cilia (green) of hair cells and their nuclei (red) and the nuclei of the supporting cells (blue). The cytoplasm of hair cells is outlined in dark red and an apoptotic body is shown in yellow in the lower panel. Note that apoptotic bodies, as the one present in the mutant, were found at the same rate in untreated wild-type and mutant sections, being probably products of the regular turnover of the supporting cells, which has been described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000455-Jorgensen1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.

To test the functionality of the hair cells in wild-type and <italic>phoenix</italic> mutant larvae, we used the well-described technique of monitoring the absorption of the vital dye FM1-43 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000455-Seiler1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>.

Again, we did not find a significant difference between the absorption of the dye in wild-type (top) and mutant (bottom) hair cells, nor did we see any significant observable structural differences.

In <italic>pho</italic> mutants, aberrant splicing occurred, fusing exon 1 to exon 7 and causing a deletion and a frame-shift truncation of the presumptive protein product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000455-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Additionally, the aberrant splicing event resulted in an arginine replacing the last serine in a predicted abATPase signature, therefore potentially abrogating the putative enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000455-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>To further prove that the deficient regeneration of the hair cells in the lateral line was caused by a mutation in the <italic>phoenix</italic> gene, we acquired a second commercially available allele (Znomics, Inc. line: ZM_00003486). This mutant line carried a retroviral insertion in the first exon (75bp downstream of the ATG) of the <italic>phoenix</italic> gene (green triangle <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000455-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The insertion of the provirus in this position most probably led to a null mutation. All of the phenotypes observed in the original <italic>hi43</italic> allele were present in the second recovered mutation and all subsequent experiments were performed in both allelic mutant lines.</p><p>We did not attempt to phenocopy the regeneration phenotype using morpholino injection, as our observations started at 6dpf. This time-point is beyond the time-window of efficacy of morpholinos, which get diluted over time after the numerous cell divisions occurring in the growing embryo/larva.</p><p>Taken together, our data strongly indicate that we have correctly identified the genetic defect responsible for the observed phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title><italic>Phoenix</italic> is a novel gene encoding a large protein with low sequence complexity and which is strongly expressed in neuromast supporting cells</title><p>Using RT-PCR, we identified several alternatively spliced variants of the <italic>pho</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000455-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). We compared the different isoforms against various RefSeq databases using BLAST <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000455-Altschul1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. The best predicted homologs in other species for the <italic>pho</italic> gene were of low quality and were all predicted proteins, therefore providing little information. However, using genomic homology comparisons from the UCSC Genome Browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/">http://genome.ucsc.edu/</ext-link>) we were able to identify the syntenic region for four other fish species: <italic>Takifugu rubripes</italic> (fugu), <italic>Tetraodon nigroviridis</italic> (tetraodon), <italic>Oryzias latipes</italic> (medaka), and <italic>Gasterosteus aculeatus</italic> (stickleback). The genes flanking <italic>phoenix</italic> in zebrafish are <italic>aspa</italic> and <italic>c11orf54</italic> homologs. In all fish species examined, this synteny was maintained, but a synteny break occurred at this location in other vertebrate genomes. Located between <italic>aspa</italic> and <italic>c11orf54</italic> in all four fish species was a large predicted ORF. The corresponding predicted genes (GENSCAN00000016645 in fugu, chr14.906.1 in medaka, chrVII.1390.1 in stickleback and chr7.288.1 in tetraodon) had very weak but noticeable identity with the zebrafish <italic>phoenix</italic> gene. The overall identity of the fish homologues was still not significant (the best match was fugu to tetraodon at 35&#x00025; identity in a limited region, with no other pair-wise comparison showing higher than 24&#x00025; identity). The main feature of all proteins was a low complexity sequence with a large number of proline and lysine residues. Using ClustalW2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2/index.html">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2/index.html</ext-link>), we showed that the only significant identity in these predicted transcripts was in the amino-terminal end of the proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000455-g002">Fig .2D</xref> red box and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000455-g002">2C</xref> yellow rectangle). One small region was highly conserved in all transcripts (SDS-X(2-3)-SLF-&#x0005b;ILV&#x0005d;-TQ, red box in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000455-g002">Figure 2D</xref>), which may represent a functional motif for this class of proteins. The high rate of divergence across the different fish species suggested that, the function of the protein can tolerate significant alterations in the primary sequence. Because these fish homologs were not identified through the usual BLAST comparisons, if homologs in other vertebrates exist, they will be difficult to find using traditional approaches. It is likely they will have to be identified through functional similarities instead of primary sequence homology.</p><p>To gather more information on the <italic>phoenix</italic> gene, we analyzed the putative phoenix product, looking for protein motifs and domains, using protein structure databases such as PFAM and CDD. We identified one putative functional domain using Motif Search (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://motif.genome.jp">http://motif.genome.jp</ext-link>). It contained an abATPase signature, PSVHSPPSDS (P-&#x0005b;SAP&#x0005d;-&#x0005b;LIV&#x0005d;-&#x0005b;DNH&#x0005d;-X(3)-SXS), encoded in the first exon with the last serine overlapping the splicing site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000455-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). It is important to note, that evidence for the ATPase signature was not found in the other fish species, but those transcripts were computationally predicted and it is possible that there were missing exons or were incorrectly sequenced. In the largest <italic>phoenix</italic> splice form, there was a strongly predicted single membrane-spanning domain (Bioweb, Pasteur Paris, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000455-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Therefore, the majority of the protein appeared to be a very long, poorly structured, tail with a single potential anchorage point to a membrane. All the shorter gene products were predicted to be cytoplasmic. No secretion signal peptide was found (CBS Website, University of Denmark).</p><p>We performed <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (ISH) on embryos from 8 hours post fertilization (hpf) through 5 dpf. The expression of the <italic>phoenix</italic> gene was first detected in the anterior and posterior lateral line system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000455-g002">Figure 2E</xref>) beginning at 2 dpf, and was uniformly expressed in all neuromasts and still maintained in this organ at 5dpf. <italic>Phoenix</italic> mRNA was found in a &#x0201c;ring-like&#x0201d; structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000455-g002">Figure 2F</xref>, left panel), clearly staining the supporting cells, while it was absent from the center of the neuromasts, where hair cells were located (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000455-g002">Figure 2F</xref>, right). Additionally, we found expression in discrete areas of the inner ear, which could correspond to the neuroepithelial patches (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000455.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). The <italic>pou4f3::GFP</italic> line allowed us to observe in live larvae the hair cells in the inner ear which seemed unaffected by the mutation in wild-type (left) and mutant (right) cristae (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000455.s002">Figure S2A</xref>)</p><p>Taken together, these observations clearly show that, we have identified a new gene with an upregulated expression in the supporting cells of the lateral line in zebrafish.

Most hair cells were ablated immediately after the copper treatment (&#x0002b;0h) in all observed wild-type (top panel) and <italic>phoenix</italic> mutant (lower panel) larvae. At most, one remaining hair cell could be seen, but its irregular shape indicating that it was probably a dying cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000455-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, second column). We concluded that we could efficiently destroy the lateral line hair cells with this treatment. Likewise, 4h after exposure to neomycin, we found that most hair cells were absent (data not shown).

We monitored tail regeneration at 8dpf for copper and 9dpf for neomycin. While tail regrowth did not reach completion in wild-type or in mutant larvae, we saw no differences in the growth rate between wild-type and mutant larvae with either treatment.

To detect dying cells in the supporting cell layer in the mutant neuromasts, we analyzed semi-thin sections (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;2/2 wild-type and mutant larvae, respectively in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000455-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). We reconstructed each neuromast using between 12 and 20 successive sections. We show representative examples of a wild-type (left panels) and a mutant (right panels) neuromast, untreated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000455-g004">Figure 4E</xref>, top panels) and 4 hours after neomycin treatment (lower panels). Before and after treatment, wild-type and mutant neuromasts were indistinguishable. As outlined in the <italic>camera lucida</italic> drawings under each section, the wild-type neuromast had three hair cells (nuclei outlined in red) and ten supporting cells visible (nuclei outlined in blue). In the mutant neuromast, three hair cells and ten supporting cells were visible. Four hours after neomycin treatment hair cells were completely destroyed in the wild-type and in the mutant neuromast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000455-g004">Figure 4E</xref>, lower panels). The supporting cells appeared unaffected in both wild-type and <italic>phoenix</italic> mutant neuromasts. Ten nuclei in the wild-type and ten in the mutant neuromast were visible (as outlined in the <italic>camera lucida</italic> in blue). Thus, at all observed stages, we did not notice a significantly higher cell death rate among the supporting cell population in <italic>phoenix</italic> mutant larvae.</p><p>Next, we examined cell death in live larvae using acridine orange <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000455-Hernndez1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. We stained larvae at &#x0002b;24h, &#x0002b;48h and &#x0002b;72h post treatment. Dying cells displayed strong staining as shown in two wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000455-g004">Figure 4G</xref> left panels) and two mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000455-g004">Figure 4G</xref> right panels) neuromasts at &#x0002b;24h post copper treatment. We counted the acridine orange positive cells in ten head and all trunk and tail neuromasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000455-g004">Figure 4F</xref>) after copper treatment in the wild-type (green line) and mutant (yellow line), or after neomycin treatment (wild-type: blue, mutant: pink). At all stages observed we did not find a significant difference. Additionally, we looked at cell death in the neuromasts, using TUNEL stainings and did not find any obvious difference in the rate of dying cells at all stages observed (data not shown).</p><p>We therefore conclude that the copper and neomycin treatments do not significantly affect the number of supporting cells in either wild-type or mutant larvae. Moreover, we rule out the possibility that progenitor cells may be dying in <italic>phoenix</italic> neuromasts as we did not observe an increase in cell death rates in mutant larvae compared to wild types. Taken together these results indicate that the regenerative capacity rather than the survival of supporting cells is affected by the <italic>phoenix</italic> mutation.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Supporting cell proliferation is impaired during regeneration in <italic>phoenix</italic> mutant neuromasts</title><p>Since the number of supporting cells in mutant neuromasts is not unlike that of wild type neuromasts, we turned our attention to differences in cell division to explain the regeneration phenotype observed in <italic>phoenix</italic> larvae. To test the hypothesis that the <italic>phoenix</italic> mutation is affecting proliferation of the progenitor cell population, we exposed SCM1 transgenic wild-type and mutant larvae, treated with copper or neomycin, to BrdU for 6h prior to fixing them, at &#x0002b;24h, &#x0002b;48h and &#x0002b;72h after chemical treatment. We subsequently double-stained the larvae with an anti-BrdU antibody (red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000455-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, middle and right panels) and with an anti-GFP antibody (green in left and right panels). At &#x0002b;24h after copper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000455-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) and neomycin (not shown) treatments, the BrdU-labeled transgenic wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000455-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, top panels) and the transgenic <italic>phoenix</italic> mutant (lower panels) larvae showed a striking difference in the number of BrdU positive cells. On average, we found eight BrdU positive cells in the transgenic wild-type neuromasts, in mutant neuromasts we typically found no positive cells while at most we found two. Thus the number of BrdU positive cells in the progenitor cells population in the mutant neuromasts is drastically reduced, most likely explaining the decrease in the number of newly regenerated hair cells in <italic>phoenix</italic> mutant embryos.</p><fig id="pgen-1000455-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000455.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Supporting cells do not divide as efficiently after hair cell damage in the <italic>phoenix</italic> mutant neuromast.</title><p>(A) BrdU staining (red, in the middle and right panels) in the <italic>SCM1::GFP</italic> transgenic wild-type (top) and the <italic>SCM1::GFP</italic> transgenic <italic>phoenix</italic> mutant neuromast (bottom) of recovering larvae (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;20/20), 24h after copper treatment.

BrdU was added to the medium 6h before fixation allowing us to determine rates of DNA synthesis in equivalent time-windows during the 3 days regeneration period.

At &#x0002b;24h of recovery, we had an eight-fold difference in the number of BrdU positive cells between wild-type and mutant neuromasts. This difference was still two-fold at &#x0002b;48h of recovery and both returned to the base line frequency at &#x0002b;72h.

Thus, <italic>phoenix</italic> has an important role in ensuring proper proliferation of the supporting cells during hair cell regeneration in neuromasts.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have isolated a mutation in a previously uncharacterized gene in zebrafish that we have named <italic>phoenix</italic> because of an observed deficiency in the regeneration of the hair cells of the lateral line. Identical phenotypes were observed in two different alleles, caused by independent retroviral integrations in the <italic>phoenix</italic> gene in different genetic backgrounds. This unambiguously links the phenotype to this particular gene, which encodes a rapidly evolving protein with no obvious homologs in the current genomic databases. The predicted Phoenix protein is a long peptide of low complexity with a predicted ATPase domain reminiscent of many cytoskeletal proteins. This would argue in favor of a structural protein, possibly interacting with the cytoskeleton and subcellular membranes. How it is linked to the ability of the supporting cells to regenerate will require further investigation. It also remains to be discovered whether mammalian cells have a similar molecule; we were unable to detect a related sequence in the mammalian genomes. Interestingly, inner ear hair cells in mammals are unable to regenerate from supporting cells postnatally and, therefore, exploring the molecular differences between supporting cells between mammals and other vertebrates becomes of interest when trying to understand differences in regenerative capacity.</p><p>We show that the expression of the <italic>phoenix</italic> gene is strongly upregulated in the supporting cells of the lateral line and that the lateral line morphology is essentially normal in the <italic>phoenix</italic> mutant larvae at all stages observed, from 2dpf to 12dpf. However it is important to note that, because we did not assess a possible maternal contribution for this particular gene, we cannot definitively exclude a potential role for <italic>phoenix</italic> during early development in general or of the lateral line in particular.</p><p>Nevertheless, our regeneration assay performed in larvae between 6 and 8dpf, clearly shows that the number of regenerated hair cells is reduced by five-fold after copper treatment and by two-fold after neomycin treatment in <italic>phoenix</italic> mutant neuromasts. Therefore, the zygotic expression of the <italic>phoenix</italic> gene is clearly crucial for proper regeneration of the hair cells in the lateral line. Observations at later stages never showed full recovery to a wild-type number of hair cells in the mutant neuromasts, demonstrating that the deficit in the regenerative process is irreversible. We have also found expression of <italic>phoenix</italic> in the neuroepithelia of the inner ear, but unfortunately regeneration of the hair cells in the ear cannot be assessed with our assay, as water-borne ototoxic compounds do not diffuse into the otic capsule.</p><p>We further show that the regeneration deficiency is specific to the lateral line, as we did not see a similar effect during tail regeneration. In combination with the restricted expression of the gene in supporting cells of the lateral line, this strongly suggests that, zygotic <italic>phoenix</italic> is involved specifically in the regeneration of hair cells in the lateral line, independent of the ototoxic treatment (copper or neomycin) used.</p><p>It is intriguing that while the two treatments trigger similar responses, they are significantly different in the amplitude of the elicited effect. The reason there is a nearly 2.5 times greater inability of the supporting cells to respond properly after copper compared to neomycin treatments, is not clear. However, it is to be noted that the wild-type regeneration is also significantly slower (about two times) after the copper treatments when compared to neomycin treatments, as we found and as it has been described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000455-Hernndez1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000455-Hernandez1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. One possibility, as has been suggested previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000455-Ma1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, is that there is more than one mechanism of regeneration occurring in the supporting cells. The supporting cells probably do not represent a uniform population. For instance, one type of supporting cells, the &#x0201c;early responders&#x0201d; may be unaffected in the case of hair cells killed with neomycin, but might be more severely affected by the copper treatment leaving them unable, either temporarily or permanently, to respond and enter division. In less mature embryos (3dpf), the concentration of copper used (10 &#x000b5;M) has been shown to eliminate post-mitotic precursors, thus requiring cell division and longer times for regeneration when compared to lower doses of the metal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000455-Hernndez1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Additionally, it was recently shown in a screen to identify genes that modify hair cell resistance in the lateral line, that different ototoxic agents can elicit different pathways for protection and survival of hair cells in treated neuromasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000455-Owens1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. It is therefore also possible that the regenerative response in supporting cells depends partially on the type of ototoxic agent applied. Namely, the trigger or the response to the trigger of regeneration in supporting cells could rely on different pathways, partially overlapping or complementing each other depending on the ototoxic chemical. Further investigation will allow us to distinguish between these possibilities. It appears that <italic>phoenix</italic> is upstream of the differential response between neomycin and copper, as the differences in the rates of response in mutant larvae remain similar to the differences seen in wild-type larvae.</p><p>We showed that the death rate of supporting cells was unaltered in mutant neuromasts as observed by three different approaches (histology, acridine orange and TUNEL staining). Furthermore, making use of the MSC1 transgenic line that expresses GFP exclusively in the supporting cells, we demonstrated no loss in the number of those cells in mutant neuromasts. It is to be noted that the counting of cells in the neuromast is technically challenging. Although we did not see obvious differences, we cannot exclude a possible subtle reduction in the number of supporting cells. If a key subset of cells critical to the initiation of regeneration is missing, even a subtle difference in number might have a drastic effect on regeneration, which we cannot exclude at our level of analysis. However, it was previously shown that the regeneration process is happening in many supporting cells simultaneously, encompassing most of the neuromast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000455-Ma1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref> making this possibility unlikely. We clearly show that a significant number of supporting cells are present and that the <italic>phoenix</italic> mRNA is expressed in all supporting cells, therefore the most likely explanation is that the regenerative potential of all supporting cells is severely impaired.</p><p>To assess proliferation of the progenitor cells, we follow the incorporation of BrdU during the S-phase of the cell cycle in neuromasts. The incorporation of BrdU is detected in cells that have exited the cell cycle and have differentiated. Therefore, it provides no information on the post-mitotic state of the BrdU positive cells. However, as the number of regenerated hair cells correlates closely to the number of BrdU labeled cells and as we do not see additional cell death in either wild-type or mutant neuromasts, this would suggest that the progenitor cells that actually enter S-phase proceed through the entire cell cycle and into differentiation. In the <italic>phoenix</italic> mutant larvae, this regenerative process is happening in a significantly reduced number of supporting cells. Further work is required to address the timing of the blockage occurring in the supporting cells in mutant neuromasts, but it is clearly occurring before DNA synthesis initiates. This invaluable information will help to elucidate the mechanism of action of the novel <italic>phoenix</italic> gene in the regeneration process of hair cells in the lateral line.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>All animals were handled in strict accordance with good animal practice as defined by the relevant national and/or local animal welfare bodies, and all animal work was approved by the appropriate committee (NHGRI protocol # G-01-3).</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Fish care and husbandry</title><p>Fish care and husbandry were performed according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000455-Westerfield1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref> in compliance with NIH guideline for animal care.

For the cloning of all transcripts shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000455-g002">Figure 2B and 2C</xref>, we used the same set of 2 nested forward primers <named-content content-type="gene">CCATATCAAAACAGAGCTGTGCTAC</named-content> and <named-content content-type="gene">GTCAAGGCAGAGTAAGCAAGTGACACTG</named-content>, both located in the 5&#x02032;UTR, respectively starting 142bp and 121bp upstream of the start codon. For the cloning of transcripts 2, 3 and 6, they were respectively coupled with the reverse primers <named-content content-type="gene">GTTCTGTTTTCTTTTCCTTGTCAACGCC</named-content> and <named-content content-type="gene">CCTTCTCTCCCTGATAAAGTCTGGCAACC</named-content> both found in the 5&#x02032;end of exon 7.

Immunofluorescence on cultured zebrafish cells (Pac2) using EX1 (green in the top and bottom left panels) or EX7 (green in the top and bottom right panels) antibodies. To highlight the ER, we co-stained with an antibody against PDI (ER-associated protein disulfide isomerase, red in middle and bottom left and right panels). DAPI was used to counterstain nuclei (blue in the two bottom left and right panels). Merged images (bottom, left and right panels) showed a cytoplasmic staining of phoenix, which was more concentrated in the perinuclear region. It appeared excluded from the ER, as there was no co-localization with DPI. Note how phoenix protein was upregulated in cells preparing to enter division (white arrow in the top right panel). D.
