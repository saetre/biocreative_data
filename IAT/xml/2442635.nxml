Low CN of <italic>FCGR3B</italic> has recently been associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Fc&#x003b3;RIIIb is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked, low affinity receptor for IgG found predominantly on human neutrophils. We present novel data demonstrating that both in a family with Fc&#x003b3;RIIIb-deficiency and in the normal population, <italic>FCGR3B</italic> CNV correlates with protein expression, with neutrophil uptake of and adherence to immune complexes, and with soluble serum Fc&#x003b3;RIIIb. Reduced Fc&#x003b3;RIIIb expression is thus likely to contribute to the impaired clearance of immune complexes, which is a feature of SLE, explaining the association between low <italic>FCGR3B</italic> CNV and SLE that we have confirmed in a Caucasian population. In contrast, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody&#x02013;associated systemic vasculitis (AASV), a disease not associated with immune complex deposition, is associated with high <italic>FCGR3B</italic> CN. Thus, we define a role for <italic>FCGR3B</italic> CNV in immune complex clearance, a function that may explain why low <italic>FCGR3B</italic> CNV is associated with SLE, but not AASV. This is the first report of an association between disease-related gene CNV and variation in protein expression and function that may contribute to autoimmune disease susceptibility.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>L.C.

These regions contain submicroscopic segments of DNA, ranging in size from kilobases to megabases, which may be deleted in some individuals but duplicated, perhaps several times, in others. CNV has been defined as a DNA segment that is 1 kb or larger and is present at variable CN in comparison with a reference genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). The implications of such widespread genetic CNV on phenotypic variation are as yet uncertain, but some CN variants are clearly associated with disease. CNV may directly cause disease when the genomic rearrangements disrupt genes vital for normal development; e.g., both microdeletions and microduplications at chromosome 17p11.2 result in syndromes characterized by developmental delay and mental retardation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). CNV has also been associated with complex disease traits, e.g., susceptibility to HIV infection, psoriasis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), diseases in which multiple genetic and environmental factors play a role in pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). As the number of genetic association studies linking CNV and common, complex disease traits increases, it will be necessary to determine the effect of CNV on both gene expression and cellular function to explain how CNV affects disease pathogenesis. This is particularly important in view of several potential problems with CN assays, which often produce results that are continuously distributed across the population, rather than falling into discrete &#x0201c;bins&#x0201d; associated with CN. Difficulties in CN assignation could thus lead to false associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). In addition, CNV in one gene may be in linkage disequilibrium with CNV and/or single-nucleotide polymorphisms in other genes, making it difficult to determine by genetic analysis alone which variant is causal. Correlation of expression and function with CN assays can therefore help validate the CN assay itself, in addition to explaining the disease association.</p><p>CN variability can affect gene expression: in a recent study by Stranger et al., CNV accounted for 18% of variation in gene expression in cell lines from individuals in the HapMap project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Because many genes that control the immune system are found in CNV regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>), it is not surprising that CNV should determine differences in immune system activation between individuals, and thus susceptibility to immune-mediated disease. CNV in two genes in different chromosomal locations (<italic>C4</italic> on chromosome 6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>] and <italic>FCGR3B</italic> on chromosome 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>]) have been independently associated with susceptibility to SLE, a complex polygenic autoimmune disease characterized by autoantibody production, immune complex deposition, and inflammatory damage to multiple organ systems.</p><p>Fc&#x003b3;RIIIb is one member of a family of low-affinity Fc&#x003b3; receptors that are widely expressed on cells of the immune system, binding IgG in immune-complexed rather than soluble form. They are encoded by a cluster of genes found on distal chromosome 1 and can be activatory (Fc&#x003b3;RIIa, Fc&#x003b3;RIIIa, Fc&#x003b3;RIIIb, and Fc&#x003b3;RIIc) or inhibitory (Fc&#x003b3;RIIb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). Fc&#x003b3;RIIIb is found only in humans and is unique among this family of receptors in that its expression is largely restricted to neutrophils and it is linked to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). It has no cytoplasmic domain, and therefore is thought to signal through association with complement receptor 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>), Fc&#x003b3;RIIa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>), or lipid rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). Fc&#x003b3;RIIIb can also be released from the surface of neutrophils upon activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). There are two common polymorphic forms of <italic>FCGR3B</italic> (<italic>FCGR3B&#x0002a;1</italic> and <italic>FCGR3B&#x0002a;2</italic>), which differ by five nucleotides (141, 147, 227, 277, and 349) within exon 3, resulting in a 4-aa substitution in its membrane-distal, immunoglobulin-like extracellular domain. This gives rise to two isoforms termed F&#x003b3;RIIIb-HNA1a and Fc&#x003b3;RIIIb-HNA1b (previously known as NA1 and NA2, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). The Fc&#x003b3;RIIIb-HNA1b (NA2) polymorphism has been associated with SLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>), whereas the Fc&#x003b3;RIIIb-HNA1a (NA1) polymorphism has been associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated systemic vasculitis (AASV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>).</p><p>The function of Fc&#x003b3;RIIIb has been difficult to elucidate, as there is no mouse orthologue. Studies using ligation or blocking of Fc&#x003b3;RIIIb and those removing all GPI-linked proteins from the neutrophil surface have often given conflicting results, which is perhaps not surprising in view of the different methods used. Thus, there is debate about whether Fc&#x003b3;RIIIb binds immune-complexed IgG under static (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>) or only under flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>) conditions. One study suggests that Fc&#x003b3;RIIIb binding mediates phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>), whereas others suggest it is involved in surface binding only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). Fc&#x003b3;RIIIb ligation may play a role in generation of the neutrophil respiratory burst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>), but, again, this is controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). Approximately 0.1% of Europeans do not express Fc&#x003b3;RIIIb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). Such Fc&#x003b3;RIIIb-deficient individuals have been described in the context of neonatal neutropenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>) and in a single case of SLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). In contrast to antibody-blocking studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>), an in vitro study of cells from Fc&#x003b3;RIIIb-deficient individuals failed to show a functional deficit, leading to the suggestion that an increase in surface expression of Fc&#x003b3;RI may compensate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). Thus, the function of Fc&#x003b3;RIIIb remains poorly defined, presumably because of nonphysiological effects of the blocking agents used in some studies and the fact that CNV has not been taken into account. Further studies in Fc&#x003b3;RIIIb-deficient subjects are the best way to define function and resolve these controversies.</p><p>In this study, we first confirmed the observation that SLE was associated with low <italic>FCGR3B</italic> CN in Caucasians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>), though we did not find such an association with SLE in a Chinese population. To determine the mechanism underlying this association, we investigated the functional effects of <italic>FCGR3B</italic> CNV. Using neutrophils from an individual deficient in the receptor and from members of her family, we showed that <italic>FCGR3B</italic> CN correlates with cell surface expression, levels of soluble Fc&#x003b3;RIIIb, and neutrophil adherence to, and uptake of, immune complexes. We found the same relationship between <italic>FCGR3B</italic> CN, protein expression, and function exists in the general population. We then went on to investigate <italic>FCGR3B</italic> CNV in AASV. AASV is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation and necrosis of the microvasculature. The pathology is mediated by Fc&#x003b3;R-mediated activation of neutrophils rather than immune complex deposition as in SLE. Unlike SLE, we found that AASV was associated with increased <italic>FCGR3B</italic> CN. By demonstrating the functional effects of reduced <italic>FCGR3B</italic> CN on protein expression and immune complex handling, we have provided an explanation for the association of low <italic>FCGR3B</italic> CN with SLE, but not with AASV.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Association of low <italic>FCGR3B</italic> CN with SLE in a UK, but not Hong Kong, population</title><p>We sought to replicate the previously reported association between low <italic>FCGR3B</italic> CN and SLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). We assessed <italic>FCGR3B</italic> CN using a quantitative PCR method modified after that described by Fanciulli et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>), which compares the number of cycles required for amplification of <italic>FCGR3B</italic> to reach threshold, compared with the number of cycles required for amplification of a control gene that does not show CNV; in this case, <italic>CD36</italic>. <italic>FCGR3B/CD36</italic> ratios as determined by this assay are not integers, as might have been expected, but form a near continuous distribution, which is a well recognized feature of CN assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). We therefore compared cases and controls on each plate using a Student's <italic>t</italic> test, and then performed a Student's <italic>t</italic> test stratified by the two plates of samples. In total, 171 samples from Caucasian patients with SLE were compared with 176 ethnically matched control samples. We found lower CN was significantly associated with SLE in Caucasians (P &#x0003d; 0.027; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref> and Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072413/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072413/DC1</ext-link>), but such an association was not seen in a Chinese SLE cohort from Hong Kong, comprising 159 cases and 150 controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref> and Fig. S1). This lack of association held true when the patients with lupus nephritis (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 57) were analyzed independently (Fig. S2). <italic>FCGR3B</italic> CN distributions did not differ significantly between the control Caucasian and Chinese populations (Fig. S3). SLE is more common, more severe, of earlier onset, and has some distinct clinical features in East Asians compared with Europeans. These clinical differences are independent of environment and likely to be genetically determined, thus it is to be expected that SLE will have different genetic influences in different ethnic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>); e.g., a transmembrane polymorphism in neighboring <italic>FCGR2B</italic> is associated with SLE in Asian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>), but not European or African-American, populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Association of low <italic>FCGR3B</italic> CN with UK, but not Hong Kong, SLE</bold>. qPCR was used to determine <italic>FCGR3B/CD36</italic> ratios in normal controls and patients with SLE.

The functional data presented here, in both an Fc&#x003b3;RIIIb-deficient individual and her family and in normal volunteers with different CN, show clearly that reduced expression of Fc&#x003b3;RIIIb is associated with reduced immune complex uptake and with reduced neutrophil adhesion to immune complex&#x02013;bearing surfaces. We have also confirmed a genetic association between SLE and low CN. Our data would suggest that the mechanism underlying this association is a failure of neutrophil trafficking to inflammatory lesions and reduced ability to ingest immune complexes once there, thereby reducing immune complex clearance and predisposing to SLE. Hence &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; levels of Fc&#x003b3;RIIIb (both neutrophil-surface and soluble) may be important in protection against SLE. Our results thus provide a mechanism explaining the genetic association of low <italic>FCGR3B</italic> CN and SLE.</p></sec><sec><title>Association of high <italic>FCGR3B</italic> CN with AASV in three UK cohorts</title><p>Unlike SLE, AASV is not associated with immune complex deposition. Rather, whereas neutrophils are not thought to play a major role in inflammatory damage in SLE, it is clear that Fc receptor-mediated neutrophil activation is important in AASV pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). Thus, it might be expected that increased <italic>FCGR3B</italic> CN would be associated with AASV. We therefore analyzed <italic>FCGR3B</italic> CN in 286 ethnically matched controls and 556 patients derived from the following 3 independent AASV cohorts: a UK cohort with biopsy-proven, ANCA-associated renal vasculitis (cohort 1, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 347), an independent ANCA-associated vasculitis cohort (cohort 2, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 136), and a vasculitis cohort from Birmingham, UK (cohort 3, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 73). Further details of these cohorts are described in the online supplemental material. Cases and controls were plated together and compared using a Student's <italic>t</italic> test as described above and in the Materials and methods. No association between disease and low CN was seen in any of the three cohorts; in fact, AASV was associated with high CN when cases from all cohorts were compared with controls (P &#x0003d; 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> calculated using a Student's <italic>t</italic> test stratified by plate of samples; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, A&#x02013;C</xref>, and Fig. S1). To substantiate the observation that <italic>FCGR3B</italic> CN distribution differed between SLE and AASV, we compared samples from both groups directly on a single plate (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>). Patients with SLE showed a significantly lower mean <italic>FCGR3B/CD36</italic> ratio than patients with AASV (P &#x0003d; 0.0028; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>). We then measured levels of soluble circulating Fc&#x003b3;RIIIb in patients with SLE and AASV at both disease onset and after therapy (patients described in the Supplemental clinical information and Table S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072413/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072413/DC1</ext-link>). In the 43 patients with AASV, soluble Fc&#x003b3;RIIIb levels at diagnosis correlated with <italic>FCGR3B/CD36</italic> ratio, and levels were significantly higher than both controls and the 15 lupus patients (Fig. S6, B and C).</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Association of high <italic>FCGR3B</italic> CN with AASV.</bold> qPCR was used to determine <italic>FCGR3B/CD36</italic> ratios in normal controls and cohorts of patients with AASV (cohorts described in Supplemental materials and methods).

The most likely reason for this is that that study compared groups after CN assignation, despite the continuous nature of the data. This is known to risk producing misleading results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>), is likely to explain the variation in CN distribution observed between ethnically similar control groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>), and may be part of the reason why low <italic>FCGR3B</italic> CN was found to be associated with lupus nephritis alone in one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>), but not others ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>] and this study). To ensure the accuracy of our data, we used three independent cohorts (including one overlapping with [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>]) and larger numbers of patients, and we compared raw values using a stratified Student's <italic>t</italic> test rather than arbitrary &#x0201c;binning&#x0201d; (as discussed in the Materials and methods). In addition, we correlated results with a family of known <italic>FCGR3B</italic> CN and with DNA from individuals with CN determined independently from the HapMap data. Finally, we correlated our assay with Fc&#x003b3;RIIIb surface expression and function (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>, and Fig. S5), and with soluble Fc&#x003b3;RIIIb titers (Fig. S6). We are therefore confident AASV is associated with increased <italic>FCGR3B</italic> CN. Nonetheless, all of the results in this field will need to be reassessed as more sophisticated CN assays are developed in the future.</p><p>The associations of high <italic>FCGR3B</italic> CN with AASV and low CN with SLE is consistent with what is known of the pathophysiology of these diseases. In AASV, unlike SLE, inflammatory lesions are characterized by neutrophil infiltration, but not immune complex deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). ANCA is thought to mediate its pathogenic effect by activating neutrophils in an Fc&#x003b3; receptor&#x02013;dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>) and should therefore be exacerbated by increased <italic>FCGR3B</italic> CN. In addition, AASV is associated with <italic>FCGR3B&#x0002a;1,</italic> the isoform of Fc&#x003b3;RIIIb that confers increased phagocytosis, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>), whereas SLE is associated with <italic>FCGR3B&#x0002a;2,</italic> which is associated with reduced phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>), providing further evidence that the receptor plays a different role in each disease.</p><p>CNV is an important cause of genetic variation in populations, and has recently been implicated in complex disease causation. The known associations with disease will increase as whole-genome association studies are analyzed for CNV. These associations will need to be investigated to determine the mechanism by which CNV contributes to disease. In this study, we use a family with <italic>FCGR3B</italic> deficiency to demonstrate not only the physiological function of the receptor, but also the effect of <italic>FCGR3B</italic> CNV on protein expression and function. By extending these studies into the general population, we show for the first time the association between CNV, expression, and function of a disease-related gene, providing a functional explanation for the genetic association between low <italic>FCGR3B</italic> CN and SLE.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title><italic>FCGR3B</italic> CN determination</title><sec><title>qPCR.</title><p><italic>FCGR3B</italic> CN was measured using qPCR modified from that previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>), with the exception that <italic>FCGR3B</italic> values were normalized to <italic>CD36</italic> rather than <italic>FOXP2</italic>. In brief, 10 &#x003bc;l PCR reactions, using 2.5 ng of genomic DNA as template, were performed using SYBR green (Quantifast; QIAGEN) and an ABI 7900HT real-time PCR system with a 384-well module (ABI). Cycling conditions were 95&#x000b0;C for 5 min, and then 40 cycles of 95&#x000b0;C for 10 s, followed by 60&#x000b0;C for 30 s. All samples were measured in duplicate, and for each sample the difference between replicate Ct values was determined. The mean difference across all samples was then determined, and any samples with a difference in values exceeding the mean plus two standard deviations were removed from the dataset.</p><p>The number of cycles required for amplification of <italic>FCGR3B</italic> to reach threshold (the Ct value) was then compared with the number of cycles required for amplification of <italic>CD36</italic>, a gene that does not show CNV. The ratio of <italic>FCGR3B</italic> Ct/<italic>CD36</italic> Ct is therefore a measure of <italic>FCGR3B</italic> CN. Two difficulties posed by the assay had to be circumvented as follows. First, we found that the <italic>FCGR3B/CD36</italic> ratios were not integers, as might be expected from the principle of CNV. This is a well recognized problem with CN assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). Indeed, when we downloaded array comparative hybridization data for probes encompassing the <italic>FCGR3B</italic> locus (from 270 HapMap individuals), we saw a spread of log intensities similar to the pattern seen using the qPCR assay (Fig. S7, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072413/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072413/DC1</ext-link>). We obtained DNA from 14 of these individuals from the Coriell Institute (Camden, NJ), and found a close correlation between aCGH data and qPCR ratios of <italic>FCGR3B/CD36</italic> (Fig. S8 B). The second potential problem we found was that, although the distribution of <italic>FCGR3B/CD36</italic> ratios for a given set of samples is remarkably constant upon repeat measurement, the absolute values may vary on repetition (Fig. S8 B). We therefore plated control and diseased samples together. We compared cases and controls on each plate using a Student's <italic>t</italic> test, and then performed a Student's <italic>t</italic> test stratified by both plates of samples. We were able to do this because the means of the <italic>FCGR3B/CD36</italic> ratios for SLE cases were lower than control means on both plates of samples used, and the means of the AASV samples were greater than controls on all seven plates assayed. Fig. S1 shows the raw data for all plates of SLE and AASV cases and controls.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Microarray analysis</title><p>Blood samples were obtained from 15 SLE patients with active disease and 10 age- and sex-matched normal controls.
