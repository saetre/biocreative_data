Emerging evidence suggests that insulin resistance, at least in skeletal muscle, is caused by dysregulated signaling processes secondary to lipid accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>). Although the increase in lipid content is manifested as an increase in triacylglycerol (TAG), it is likely that elevated TAG may only serve as a marker of dysfunctional muscle fatty acid metabolism and that accumulation of bioactive lipids such as diacylglycerol (DAG) and/or ceramide is actually responsible for the insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>). DAG can activate several isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC), which can impair insulin signal transduction via serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>). Ceramides can cause insulin resistance by preventing insulin-stimulated Akt serine phosphorylation and activation and translocation of Akt to its substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>). In addition, ceramide initiates inflammatory signaling pathways, leading to the activation of both c-jun NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal kinase (JNK) and nuclear factor &#x003ba;B/inducer of &#x003ba; kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>), which have been implicated in the development of insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>).</p><p>Several factors may contribute to increased lipid deposition in muscle. An increase in fatty acid uptake without any change in oxidation could lead to cytosolic lipid accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>). Conversely, an impaired ability to utilize fat as a fuel source because of reduced activity of enzymes of oxidative metabolism and fatty acid utilization could also result in increased cytosolic lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>). Recently, the concept of defective fatty acid oxidation causing insulin resistance has been challenged. Muoio and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>) have suggested that the increased flux of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria is not accompanied by complete &#x003b2;-oxidation because of the inability of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to cope with the increase in the demand on fatty acid metabolism. This leads to intramitochondrial metabolite accumulation, mitochondrial stress, and cellular insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>). Thus, the role of fatty acid oxidation in regulating insulin sensitivity is controversial and mechanisms remain unresolved. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) is a mitochondrial transmembrane enzyme thought to be rate limiting for long-chain fatty acid entry into the mitochondria for &#x003b2;-oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>). Inhibition of CPT1 with the chemical etomoxir increases lipid deposition and exacerbates insulin resistance when animals are placed on a high-fat diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>), whereas overexpression of CPT1 protects myotubes against lipid-induced insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>), arguing that alterations in fatty acid flux into the mitochondria are critical in regulating lipid effects on insulin sensitivity. Thus, to test whether increasing the capacity for fatty acid flux into the mitochondria is, in itself, sufficient to increase fat oxidation and alter insulin action, we used an approach in which we selectively overexpressed the muscle isoform of CPT1 in skeletal muscle in vivo. The results show that a physiological increase in CPT1 activity is sufficient to improve insulin resistance caused by a high-fat diet, suggesting that entry of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria is more critical in the regulation of fatty acid oxidation than the downstream capacity of the &#x003b2;-oxidation and TCA cycle.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Vector construction.</title><p>The human <italic>CPT1B</italic> cDNA was a gift from Dr. Feike van der Leij (van Hall University of Applied Sciences, Leeuwarden, the Netherlands) and was constructed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Animal maintenance and surgery.</title><p>Male Wistar rats (&#x0223c;200 g; Animal Resources Centre, Perth, Australia) were acclimatized at 22 &#x000b1; 0.5&#x000b0;C under a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle for 1 week on a standard chow diet (8&#x00025; calories from fat, 21&#x00025; calories from protein, and 71&#x00025; calories from carbohydrate; Gordon's Specialty Stock Feeds, Yanderra, New South Wales, Australia) with ad libitum water. Thereafter, one-half of the animals were switched to a high-fat diet (45&#x00025; of calories from fat &#x0005b;lard&#x0005d;), 20&#x00025; calories from protein, and 35&#x00025; calories from carbohydrates; 4.7 kcal/g; based on Rodent Diet D12451; Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ for 4 weeks. One week before study, the right and left jugular veins of rats designated to undergo euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp studies were cannulated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>). Rats were single housed and handled daily to minimize stress. Body weight was recorded daily, and only those rats that had fully recovered their presurgery weight were subsequently studied. All experimental procedures were approved by the Garvan Institute/St. Vincent's Hospital Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee and were in accordance with the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia Guidelines on Animal Experimentation.</p></sec><sec><title>In vivo electrotransfer.</title><p>The purifed CPT1 plasmid was directly injected into rat tibialis anterior muscle by a previously described protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>). The tibialis anterior muscle was chosen because it can be electroporated easily without the requirement of surgery, and the fiber composition is representative of the entire musculature of the rat. We have previously reported that this protocol results in a transfection rate of &#x0223c;50&#x00025; of fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>). Hyperinsulinemic-euyglycemic clamps (subsequently described) were performed on animals 7 days after transfecting the tissue, a time point when we have shown peak CPT1 overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>). Because we also observed overexpression in the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle, which lies in close proximity to the tibialis anterior muscle, EDL was sampled from a subset of animals 7 days after electroporation, and glucose uptake and fatty acid oxidation (described below) were determined.

Using tandem mass spectrometry we analyzed several muscle acylcarnitine species ranging from C2 to C16. Free carnitine levels were not altered by diet or CPT1 overexpression (supplementary Fig. 2, available in the online appendix).

To assess whether this small increase in C16 acylcarnitine levels in high-fat diet&#x02013;fed rats affected markers of mitochondrial metabolic control, we measured fatty acid oxidation to CO<sub>2</sub> and ASM fractions, because if fatty acids are incompletely oxidized, the percentage of oxidation to CO<sub>2</sub> should fall, leading to a concomitant increase in the percentage of fatty acid metabolites in the ASM fraction. However, we show that neither the high-fat diet nor CPT1 overexpression affected the percentage of fatty acid oxidation in either the ASM or CO<sub>2</sub> fraction (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>), although both high-fat diet and CPT1 overexpression increased the total oxidation of fatty acids by EDL ex vivo (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>CPT1 overexpression restores insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and insulin signaling due to diet-induced obesity.</title><p>Insulin increased glucose uptake (&#x0223c;twofold, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), phosphorylation of IRS1 (Tyr<sup>612</sup>; &#x0223c;twofold, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) and Akt (Ser<sup>473</sup>; &#x0223c;10-fold, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) in the EDL. CPT1 overexpression had no effect on these measures in chow-fed animals (supplementary Fig. 3, available in the online appendix). However, although the high-fat diet reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in the control leg by &#x0223c;30&#x00025;, overexpression of CPT1 in the EDL of high-fat diet&#x02013;fed animals increased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake to levels comparable with control chow-fed animals (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>). Whereas the high-fat diet reduced the phosphorylation of IRS-1 and Akt under insulin-stimulated conditions (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), CPT1 overexpression in the EDL of high-fat diet&#x02013;fed animals restored insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IRS-1 (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>) and Akt (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>C</italic></xref>) to levels observed in control chow-fed animals.</p><p>Lipid handling by muscle and its role in the etiology of insulin resistance is a process that involves tissue cross-talk that is highly influenced by circulatory factors and flux of fatty acids across the plasma membrane. Therefore, we examined the effect of CPT1 overexpression on insulin action in vivo, by conducting hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps with the infusion of radiolabeled 2-deoxyglucose to measure glucose uptake (Rg&#x02032;) in tibialis anterior muscles. The high-fat diet increased fat pad mass and induced whole-body insulin resistance, as shown by an increase in basal insulin levels (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>) and a reduction in the glucose infusion rate during the clamp. Fasting plasma glucose and FFA were not different after high-fat diet (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Rg&#x02032; was reduced in the tibialis anterior of high-fat diet&#x02013;fed animals (32&#x00025;, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05; <xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>), but overexpression of CPT1 in the tibialis anterior of chow-fed animals had no effect on Rg&#x02032; (supplementary Fig. 4, available in the online appendix). In contrast, overexpression of CPT1 in high-fat diet&#x02013;fed animals prevented the decrease in Rg&#x02032;, restoring rates comparable with the control leg of chow-fed animals (24.3 &#x000b1; 3.3 vs. 22.2 &#x000b1; 3.3 &#x003bc;mol &#x000b7; 100 g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> &#x000b7; min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for chow and high-fat diet, respectively; <xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>). Consistent with these findings, the phosphorylation of Akt (Ser<sup>473</sup>) was enhanced in the tibialis anterior muscles of high-fat diet&#x02013;fed animals overexpressing CPT1 (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>CPT1 overexpression decreases high-fat diet&#x02013;induced accumulation of TAG, the membrane to cytosolic ratio of DAG, serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, and activation of PKC&#x003b8; and JNK.</title><p>The high-fat diet increased TAG, whereas overexpression of CPT1 decreased TAG in both chow and high-fat diet conditions (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). Both DAG and ceramide content in the tibialis anterior muscle were increased with high-fat diet, but overexpression of CPT1 affected neither DAG nor ceramide content (data not shown). However, the bioactivity of deleterious lipid species is critically dependent on their cellular localization. We, therefore, measured the membrane-to-cytosolic ratio of DAG and ceramide. The membrane-to-cytosolic ratio of DAG was reduced in muscles from high-fat diet&#x02013;fed animals overexpressing CPT1 (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>). In addition, although not statistically significant, there was a trend (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.07) for the same to occur in the membrane-to-cytosolic ratio of ceramide (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>C</italic></xref>).</p><p>Given that ceramide and DAG act as second messengers, we next measured a raft of signal transduction pathways known to affect insulin action.

It has been suggested that enhancing fatty acid flux through the mitochondria in the absence of a concomitant &#x0201c;metabolic remodeling&#x0201d; of mitochondrial machinery may lead to deleterious effects on insulin action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>), whereas other studies report that increasing fatty acid oxidation can ameliorate insulin resistance by reducing intracellular lipid levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>). Here, we report that a physiologically relevant increase in skeletal muscle CPT1 protein expression was sufficient to increase fatty acid oxidation and to prevent high-fat diet&#x02013;induced fatty acid esterification into intracellular lipids, subsequently leading to enhanced muscle insulin sensitivity in high-fat&#x02013;fed rats in the absence of major changes in markers of downstream capacity of the TCA cycle and ET/OxPhos pathways. The insulin-sensitizing effect of CPT1 overexpression was associated with a lower membrane-to-cytosolic ratio of DAG and reduced PKC&#x003b8; activity. Furthermore, high-fat diet&#x02013;induced phosphorylation of JNK and IRS-1 at Ser<sup>307</sup> was reduced with CPT1 overexpression. Hence, using a model that selectively increases flux of fatty acids into the mitochondria by inducing a physiological overexpression of the rate-limiting enzyme for mitochondrial fatty acid flux, we clearly show amelioration of high-fat diet&#x02013;induced insulin resistance.</p><p>Whether increasing fatty acid flux into the mitochondria reduces or exacerbates insulin resistance is the subject of considerable debate. Several studies have shown that increased rates of fatty acid oxidation are associated with skeletal muscle insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>). Furthermore, Muoio and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>) recently demonstrated that mice lacking the enzyme malonyl-CoA-decarboxylase (MCD<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>), an enzyme whose action theoretically promotes &#x003b2;-oxidation by relieving malonyl-CoA&#x02013;mediated inhibition of CPT1, were protected from high-fat diet&#x02013;induced insulin resistance. Together with in vitro data, these authors concluded that reducing fatty acid oxidation was beneficial with regard to insulin action. These results are in contrast with the data reported here in which increasing fatty acid oxidation alleviated insulin resistance in muscle of fat-fed rats. There are some important methodological differences that may explain this apparent anomaly. First, we used 4 weeks of high-fat diet to induce insulin resistance in rats, whereas Koves et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>) performed studies after 12 weeks of high-fat diet in both rats and mice. Thus, it is possible that differences between studies may be due to the duration of high-fat diet and the time of exposure of the muscle to hyperlipidemia. Furthermore, whereas our studies were focused on the tibialis anterior and EDL muscles, which are predominantly white muscles, Koves et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>) mostly used the gastrocnemius muscle, which is a mixture of red and white. It is also important to note that in the previous study, the model was a whole-body MCD<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse, and the researchers reported insulin tolerance tests as their measure of insulin action, which cannot distinguish between insulin action in different insulin-responsive organs. They also examined the ability of MCD deletion to protect against the development of insulin resistance in fat-fed animals. In contrast, in our study, we used a technique in which we selectively overexpressed CPT1 in one hind limb of a rat and then were able to compare muscles from this hind limb with those obtained from the sham-treated, contralateral limb to see whether there were alterations to pre-existing, high-fat diet&#x02013;induced insulin resistance. This technique has many advantages. First, the comparable muscles are subjected to exactly the same circulatory factors. Second, we were able to increase the activity of CPT1 in a skeletal muscle to levels seen with physiological interventions such as exercise training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>). Of note, we have consistently reported a transfection efficiency of &#x0223c;50&#x00025; in the tibialis anterior muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>). We did not determine transfection efficiency of the CPT1 plasmid, but based on our previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>), we expect that 40&#x02013;50&#x00025; of fibers would be overexpressing CPT1. However, given that CPT1 protein was only increased by &#x0223c;40&#x00025;, it is possible that the transfection efficiency of CPT1 was lower than in our previous studies, or it may indicate that CPT1 protein has a rapid turnover rate when overexpressed. Nonetheless, the critical aspect of the study is that we achieved a physiological increase in CPT1 protein and activity that functionally translated into enhanced rates of fatty acid oxidation and, importantly, suppressed fatty acid esterification into TAG. Having performed hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps with 2-deoxyglucose tracers, we were able to demonstrate that CPT1 overexpression improves insulin action in diet-induced obese models. Our results are entirely consistent with previous work in vitro, where it has been reported that a two- to threefold overexpression of CPT1 in L6 myotubes increased oxidation of the long-chain fatty acids palmitate and oleate and increased insulin stimulation of &#x0005b;<sup>14</sup>C&#x0005d;glucose incorporation into glycogen by 60&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, high-fat diet&#x02013;induced insulin resistance was associated with an increase in CPT1 activity and a trend toward elevated fatty acid oxidative capacity (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A&#x02013;C</italic></xref>). This is consistent with previously reported data showing that rodents can adapt to a high-fat diet to coordinately increase the ability of skeletal muscle to take up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>) and utilize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>) fatty acid, this being dominant energy substrate. This is accompanied by muscle insulin resistance, which is at first glance seemingly paradoxical considering that we here demonstrate that a further enhancing of muscle CPT1 expression and fatty acid oxidation in high-fat diet&#x02013;fed rats had an insulin-sensitizing effect. However, the critical difference was in the degree of fatty acid esterification (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref>). In the empty vector condition, when animals were placed on high-fat diet, fatty acid incorporation into TAG was increased compared with chow-fed rats, despite the concomitant increase in CPT1 activity and a trend toward increased fatty acid oxidation. This increase in fatty acid esterification was associated with increased lipid deposition in membranes (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) and increases in PKC&#x003b8; and JNK activation (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), resulting in impaired insulin signal transduction. These data suggest that diet-induced obesity results in an enhanced entry of fat into the mitochondria and subsequent oxidation; however, this increase is quantitatively less than the increase in fatty acid entry into the tissue, resulting in a net increase in cellular lipid storage. In contrast, by increasing CPT1 activity in fat-fed animals, in this case due to ectopic overexpression, the exacerbated increase in fatty acid entry into the mitochondria and subsequent oxidation was sufficient to match the increased rate of fatty acid uptake into the tissue, thereby preventing any esterification into TAG and subsequent insulin resistance.</p><p>Although the total content of bioactive lipids appears to play a role in regulating insulin action in muscle, it is also emerging that the subcellular location of lipids plays a fundamental role in dictating its downstream targets and cellular responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>). Many of the proximal steps in insulin signaling to GLUT4 translocation occur at or in close proximity to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>). Thus, it is possible that excessive accumulation of lipid species, such as DAG and ceramide, in cellular membranes may affect insulin action by interfering with the activation of critical components of the insulin signaling pathway. Such an effect may be mediated by DAG and ceramide-induced displacement of cholesterol in membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>), which is associated with decreased Akt phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>). In the current study, we found that the membrane-to-cytosolic ratio of ceramide was increased in muscle of high-fat&#x02013;fed animals, and this was associated with impaired phosphorylation of Akt. We also observed that there was a tendency for the ceramide membrane-to-cytosolic ratio to be reduced in muscles overexpressing CPT1 from fat-fed rats, an effect that may have contributed to enhanced insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation. In addition, we also found that the DAG membrane-to-cytosolic ratio was decreased in muscle from fat-fed animals overexpressing CPT1.</p><p>The molecular mechanisms by which lipids induce insulin resistance in skeletal muscle remain uncertain. However, it has been suggested that lipid-induced insulin resistance in muscle is mediated by activation of a serine kinase cascade that leads to impaired insulin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>). We were able to show that the high-fat diet not only induced translocation of PKC&#x003b8; to the membrane but also increased JNK phosphorylation in muscle, which was associated with an increase in basal IRS-1 Ser<sup>307</sup> phosphorylation. However, when CPT1 was overexpressed in muscles of high-fat diet&#x02013;fed rats, there was a significant reduction in the membrane-to-cytosol ratio of PKC&#x003b8; and phosphorylation of JNK. These changes were associated with a decrease in the phosphorylation status of IRS-1 on Ser<sup>307</sup>. Given that phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser<sup>307</sup> can impair subsequent insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>), it is likely that the insulin-sensitizing effect of CPT1 overexpression is mediated by inhibiting the activation of serine kinases that interfere with insulin signaling. It is possible that these changes are related to the observed reduction in membrane DAG and ceramide content in muscles overexpressing CPT1.</p><p>In summary, we have shown that moderate overexpression of CPT1 is sufficient to increase fatty acid oxidation, thereby preventing fatty acid esterification, subsequently enhancing muscle insulin sensitivity in high-fat&#x02013;fed rats. The insulin-sensitizing effect of CPT1 overexpression was associated with a reduction in muscle TAG content, although no difference in total DAG and ceramide levels was detected. However, the membrane-to-cytosolic ratio of DAG was reduced in muscle overexpressing CPT1, and this was associated with inhibition of PKC&#x003b8; and JNK activity. Hence, we propose that increasing the capacity for fatty acid oxidation exerts an insulin-sensitizing effect in muscle by modulating the content of bioactive lipid species in membranes, preventing the activation of serine kinases and thereby relieving inhibition on insulin signaling. In addition, CPT1 overexpression did not have any major effect on markers of &#x0201c;metabolic remodeling,&#x0201d; such as changes in the protein expression of several subunits of the respiratory chain, ET/Ox Phos gene expression, maximal activity of key mitochondrial enzymes, and muscle acylcarnitine content, suggesting that under conditions of physiological increases in fatty acid flux, pathways downstream of fatty acid entry into the mitochondria were not limiting for complete oxidation of fatty acid to CO<sub>2</sub>. We conclude that CPT1 agonists are a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Online-Only Appendix</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="db08-1078_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="db08-1078_db08-1078[1].suppl.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by research grants from the Diabetes Australia Research Trust.
