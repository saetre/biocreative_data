The ectoplasmic domain of CK8 acts as a binding site for plasminogen, however, by using confocal microscopy, we demonstrated that it is also co-localized with uPA. CK8, therefore, function also as a receptor for uPA on the cell surface, and the presence of anti-CK MAb may prevent the binding of uPA to a designated CK8 motif. The consequent inhibition of plasmin generation resulted in changed cell morphology, enhanced cell adhesion to fibronectin, reduced invasion potential, and an enhanced G1/S transition. Moreover, surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that the synthetic dodecapeptide corresponding to the epitope sequence (VKIALEVEIATY), binds uPA in the nanomolar range.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These novel findings suggest a model in which CK8, together with uPA, plasminogen and fibronectin, constitutes a signaling platform capable of modulating cell adhesion/growth-dependent signal transduction in breast tumor cells.

For this, they need to be activated, either on the tumor cell surface or in the pericellular space. In breast cancer, urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA), a serine proteinase, has been associated with an aggressive malignant phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Cell surface uPA, bound to uPA receptor (uPAR), activates plasminogen to plasmin, a central player in breast cancer progression and metastasis. Plasmin activates growth factors and protease cascades that lead to the disruption of cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix adhesion via pericellular proteolysis of glycoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Plasmin can also affect the cell phenotype by activating or inactivating growth factors, and by modifying growth factor receptors and adhesion receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Plasminogen is activated on the cell surface much faster than in solution, due to the presence of proteins that promote a plasminogen conformation more open to proteolytic attack [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In addition to uPAR, cytokeratin 8 (CK8) is an important plasminogen-binding protein in the membrane of breast cancer cells. CK8 is an intermediate filament protein and associates with CK18 to form an insoluble matrix within the cell. However, the C-terminal end of CK8 also penetrates the cellular membrane, as shown for hepatocellular and breast carcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. CK8 is unique among cytokeratins in that it contains a carboxyl-terminal lysine that can interact with the lysine binding sites of plasminogen, although it is able to bind plasminogen even when the C-terminal lysine is mutated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Plasminogen activation is promoted by tissue type plasminogen activator (tPA), which can bind to both components of the cytokeratin heterodimer, CK8/CK18. Plasminogen and tPA cannot bind to CK8 at the same time, but the binding of tPA to CK18 enhances the binding of plasminogen to CK8 and its activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>The CK8/CK18 complex modulates the signaling pathways intracellularly by binding kinases involved in signal transduction. It integrates signals generated by stimulated surface membrane receptors, such as insulin receptor and integrin beta 1 receptor, and modulates their signal transduction in appropriate reaction sequences. The absence of CK8/CK18 in hepatocytes results in a phenotype that attaches more rapidly to fibronectin and undergoes an enhanced G1/S transition compared with wild-type hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. On the other hand, the cytoskeleton itself can undergo rearrangements as a result of outside-in signals triggered by fibronectin binding to cell surface receptors, the integrins.</p><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the involvement of CK8 in plasminogen activation, and consequently in cell adhesion, invasion and signaling of breast tumor cells. An anti-cytokeratin MAb directed against an epitope on the ectoplasmic tail of CK8 was used to determine whether it prevents uPA mediated activation of plasminogen, resulting in enhanced adhesion of breast tumor cells to fibronectin, reduced invasion, as well as changed morphology and enhanced G1/S transition.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Plasminogen expression in breast tumor cells</title><p>Plasminogen was detected by flow cytometry in MCF-10 A neoT cells that were cultured in serum-free medium (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).

For instance, at 30 min post seeding, 67.7% of MCF-10A neoT cells were already attached in the presence of the anti-CK MAb as compared to 21.7% in its absence. The fact that the effect of anti-CK MAb was evident so quickly indicates that it acts by binding to the cell surface epitope and not by its intracellular activity. Even after 200 min, only 48.8% of untreated cells were attached (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>), while anti-CK MAb treated MCF-10A neoT cells were all attached (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). However, when uPA was added to the culture medium, the anti-CK MAb-stimulated adhesion of MCF-10A neoT cells was diminished (54.5% after 200 min), demonstrating that increased plasmin activity mediated by uPA reduces the adhesion of breast tumor cells to fibronectin. Anti-CK MAb did not alter cell adhesion to an uncoated surface, showing the substrate-dependent effect of the MAb (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Adhesion of MCF-10A neoT cells to fibronectin in the presence of anti-CK MAb and uPA</bold>.

The CFSE proliferation assay does not depend on the metabolic activity of breast tumor cells and enables detection of cells that have undergone cell division. The addition of anti-CK MAb enhanced the proliferation of cells cultured on fibronectin from 77.3% to 94.2% (MCF10A neoT cells) and from 54.8% to 87.3% (MCF-7 cells). No enhancement was observed on surfaces not covered with fibronectin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We have demonstrated that uPA is able to bind a particular motif on the CK8/CK18 complex expressed on the plasma membrane of breast tumor cells, that is recognized also by anti-CK MAb. The antibody hinders uPA binding to the cell surface of MCF-7 and MCF-10A neoT breast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], resulting in lower plasmin generation, adhesion, invasiveness and G1/S transition of breast tumor cells.</p><p>Although plasminogen does not bind to the motif that resembles the epitope of anti-CK MAb (data not shown), anti-CK MAb significantly reduces plasminogen activation in MCF-7 and MCF-10A neoT cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Plasminogen is shown to be expressed endogenously in these cells and localized intracellularly as well as on the plasma membrane. The activation of plasminogen to plasmin enables degradation of the proteins of the extracellular matrix, a process that enhances the invasive potential of tumor cells. Plasminogen activation is enhanced if plasminogen activator (uPA/tPA) and the substrate (plasminogen) are in close juxtaposition on the cell surface. The most prominent uPA binding receptor is uPAR (CD87). However, plasminogen activation independent of uPAR suggests that other uPA binding proteins exist on the plasma membrane. On neutrophils, for example, &#x003b1;<sub>M</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>integrin receptor binds uPA irrespectively of the presence of uPAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In this case, uPAR may serve as an enhancer of &#x003b1;<sub>M</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>binding, and uPAR, uPA, &#x003b1;<sub>M</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>and plasminogen may form a multicontact complex on the cell surface. MCF-7 cells, for example, express very low levels of cell surface uPAR compared to the larger amount of cell surface bound plasminogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Our results show that CK8, the major plasminogen receptor on breast tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], may also serve as a uPA binding protein and enhance uPA mediated plasminogen activation. As shown by surface plasmon resonance analysis, the interaction between uPA and CK8 is significant, since uPA binds the peptide VKIALEVEIATY, deduced from the C-terminal region of CK8, in the nanomolar range (<italic>K</italic><sub>a </sub>of 9.8 nM). This peptide, which also binds strongly to the anti-CK MAb, contains a consensus sequence, corresponding to the most conserved region between D381 and E407 (CK8) in CK1, CK2, CK8, CK10 and CK18. Anti-CK MAb was shown to recognize these CKs, therefore, we conclude that the epitope is identical, independently of the exact amino acid sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Expression of CK8 on the cell surface correlates with increased invasiveness <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and may predispose cell polarization and adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. We have shown that anti-CK MAb, by diminishing the uPA mediated plasminogen activation in serum-free environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], affects the de-adhesion-invasion processes of breast tumor cells. The adhesion of these cells treated with anti-CK MAb was greatly enhanced, due to the reduced pericellular proteolysis of fibronectin, increasingly degraded in the tumor environment by plasmin. This is consistent with the findings of Tan et al. who showed that plasminogen expression, restricted to cells with high invasion ability, is involved in cell dissociation, the first important step in the invasion process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The adhesion of MCF cells to fibronectin is mediated via &#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>integrin receptors, which can be modified by plasmin in a way that affects the cell phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Although we cannot exclude a direct effect of plasmin on integrin chains, we suggest that the anti-adhesive effect of plasmin results from the proteolytic cleavage of fibronectin, similarly to the way that plasmin, when generated by the uPA-dependent cell surface-associated pathway, abrogates the HaCaT cell binding functions via cleavage of vitronectin and destruction of its cell binding function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In contrast, anti-CK MAb did not affect cell adhesion to the surface not coated with fibronectin.</p><p>Our results further show that, in breast tumor cells cultured on fibronectin in serum free medium, anti-CK MAb reduces cell cluster formation and promotes cell polarization associated with actin reorganization. This is consistent with the observations that, in the presence of uPA or plasmin, MCF-7 breast tumor cells begin to retract and form solid tumor cell spheroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The spontaneous formation of the spheroids starts after supplementing the culture medium with an outdated source of human serum containing uPA and plasminogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Anti-CK MAb treated breast tumor cells cultured on fibronectin, but not on uncoated surface, also exhibited enhanced proliferation. The latter can be attributed to an increased mitogenic signal delivered by fibronectin, where the activating signal is mediated by &#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>integrin receptor. The signaling reactions activated by &#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>integrins include focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-Src and MAPK pathways, and generate sustained activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway, a property that could be important for anchorage-dependent survival of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. MCF-7 cell-fibronectin interaction induces the re-entry of MCF-7 cells into S phase, and prevents them from undergoing serum deprivation induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Anti-CK MAb increases adhesion of breast cancer cells to fibronectin, thereby promoting their G1/S transition. These novel findings suggest a model by which CK8, along with plasminogen-<italic>see earlier comment </italic>and fibronectin, constitutes a signaling platform capable of modulating cell adhesion/growth-dependent signal transduction. A similar effect was observed in CK8-null hepatocytes, which attach more rapidly but spread more slowly on a fibronectin substratum. Loss of CK8/CK18 also leads to decreased size, reduced rate of protein synthesis, and an enhanced G1/S transition in hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The analogy between hepatocytes and the MCF-7/MCF-10A neoT used in our experiments is not surprising, considering that CK8-mediated plasmin activation has been reported on hepatocytes and hepatocellular carcinoma cells, as well as on certain breast tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Anti-CK MAb, that recognizes the epitope on the ectoplasmic tail of CK8 present on the plasma membrane of the breast tumor cells, prevents the binding of uPA to cytokeratin and, consequently, the activation of plasminogen to plasmin. Anti-CK MAb could thus be used as an agent to reduce the invasive potential of breast tumor cells, whereas the synthetic peptide, resembling the epitope, may regulate uPA activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>MCF-10A neoT cells were provided by Prof. Bonnie F. Sloane (Wayne State University, Detroit, MI). The original human breast epithelial cell line (MCF-10) was transformed with neomycin resistance gene and c-Ha-ras oncogene, to give a highly invasive cell phenotype. MCF-7 cells were obtained from ATCC (HTB 22). Cells were cultured in monolayers to 80% confluence in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 12.5 mM HEPES, 2 mM glutamine, 5% fetal bovine serum (FCS), insulin, hydrocortisone, epidermal growth factor and antibiotics at 37&#x000b0;C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The cells were maintained in serum-free medium for 24 h before being used in assays. Cells were washed with PBS, pH 7.4 and detached from culture flasks with 0.05% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA in PBS, pH 7.4. The viability of cells in the experiments was at least 90%, as determined by staining with nigrosin.</p></sec><sec><title>Antibody preparation</title><p>Anti-CK MAb, a mouse monoclonal antibody, was raised against soluble membrane proteins of MCF-7 human invasive ductal breast carcinoma. Using immunocytochemical analysis, its staining was detected predominantly in primary breast carcinomas and in metastatic lymph nodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The antibody recognizes a specific cytokeratin profile (cytokeratins 1, 2, 8, 10, 18) in MCF-7 and MCF-10A neoT breast cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], as determined by 2D electrophoresis, immunoblotting and mass spectroscopy. Hybridoma cells for antibody isolation were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 13% FCS and antibiotics, at 37&#x000b0;C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The antibody was isolated by affinity chromatography on Protein A Sepharose using standard procedures. On MCF-7 and MCF-10A neoT it was demonstrated that the antibody inhibited the generation of plasmin in a dose dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>For flow cytometry, MCF-10A neoT cells were grown for 24 hours in serum free medium and afterwards cultured on 12-well plates pre-coated with fibronectin (Corning Costar). Cells were harvested and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, and permeabilized for 10 minutes with Triton-X 100. Non-specific staining was blocked for 30 minutes with 3% BSA in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4. Cells were incubated with 5 &#x003bc;g/mL goat anti-plasminogen polyclonal antibody in blocking buffer for 1 hour on ice. Afterwards, the cells were washed with PBS and incubated with Alexa-488 labeled anti-goat secondary antibody in blocking buffer for 1 hour on ice. Alexa-488-IgG1 was used for isotype control. Cells were washed and analyzed with FACS Calibur (Becton Dickinson, NJ).</p><p>For confocal microscopy, glass coverslips were pre-treated with 20% sulfuric acid, followed by 10 M NaOH, and washed with distilled water and ethanol before use. They were coated with 1 &#x003bc;g/mL fibronectin in carbonate buffer, pH 9.6 overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. For immunofluorescence detection, MCF-10A neoT cells were cultured on either fibronectin-coated or uncoated coverslips for 24 hours. Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 40 minutes, then permeabilized with 0.05% Triton-X 100. To preserve membrane associated components and foreclose cytoplasmic staining, some samples were not permeabilized with Triton-X 100. Non-specific staining was blocked with 3% BSA in phosphate buffer saline (PBS), pH 7.4, for 1 hour. After 1.5 hour of incubation with anti-CK MAb and either rabbit anti-uPA polyclonal antibody or goat anti-plasmin(ogen) polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA), cells were washed with PBS. Secondary Alexa-488 labeled anti-rabbit or Alexa-488 labeled anti-goat and Alexa-555 labeled anti-mouse antibody were incubated for 1 hour in blocking buffer and afterwards washed with PBS. Actin was labeled with phalloidin-tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate conjugate (Fluka) (500 ng/mL) for 30 min at room temperature in anti-CK MAb treated or un-treated cells, then washed with PBS. Prolong Antifade kit (Molecular Probes, CA) was used for mounting coverslips on glass slides. Fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Carl Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. Alexa 488 and FITC were excited with an argon (488 nm) laser and Alexa 546 with a He/Ne (543 nm) laser. Emission was filtered using narrow band 505-530 nm or LP 560 nm filters, respectively. Images were analyzed using Carl Zeiss LSM image software 3.0.</p></sec><sec><title>Surface plasmon resonance</title><p>The binding of uPA to the peptide VKIALEVEIATY (Doljak et al., 2008) was monitored using a Biacore X system (Biacore, Sweden). The assay was performed on a CM5 sensor chip (BR-1003-98 BIAcore). VKIALEVEIATY was immobilized at a flow rate of 1 &#x003bc;L/min for 10 minutes (300 RU). The flow cell was then washed with 5 &#x003bc;L of 10 mM glycine buffer (pH 2.2) at a flow rate of 30 &#x003bc;L/min. The second flow cell was used as the reference cell. Identical wash cycles were used to regenerate the dodecapeptide surface between the assays. uPA was prepared in PBST buffer (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20). All steps were performed at 25&#x000b0;C with a flow rate of 1 &#x003bc;L/min in 1% PBST running buffer. 5 &#x003bc;L of uPA was injected for each assay.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell invasion assay</title><p>Transwell plates (Corning Costar, MD) with 12-mm polycarbonate filters and 12 &#x003bc;m pore size, were used to test the effect of anti-CK MAb on invasion of breast cancer cells. 25 &#x003bc;l of 100 &#x003bc;g/mL fibronectin (Sigma, Germany) was applied on the lower side of the filters and left for one hour in a laminar hood to dry. The upper sides of the filters were then coated with 100 &#x003bc;L of 1 mg/mL Matrigel (Becton Dickinson, NJ), 100 &#x003bc;L of DMEM was added, and the filters left at 37&#x000b0;C for one hour.
