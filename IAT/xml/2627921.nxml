Recently, a number of rat studies have indicated that SPS successfully reproduces many neuroendocrine and behavioral characteristics of PTSD, including enhanced hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal negative feedback, exaggerated acoustic startle response, and increased contextual freezing 7 days after SPS exposure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004276-Liberzon1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004276-Khan1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004276-Iwamoto1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Taken together, these findings indicate that SPS induces time-dependent sensitization, which resembles the developmental course of PTSD and represents an animal model for PTSD. It has long been established that ED is a multi-factorial dysfunction, and some treatments for ED patients have been developed with a focus mainly on therapeutics for penile vasculopathy. Recently, we demonstrated that a system of neurons in the upper lumbar spinal cord utilize a specific peptide, GRP, to drive lower spinal centers that coordinate male reproductive functions such as erection and ejaculation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004276-Sakamoto1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004276-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). The present data show that SPS significantly attenuates penile reflexes in rats. Thus in addition to the other features of PTSD in humans that have been previously described in rats following SPS, we find the rats also display male reproductive dysfunctions after SPS. SPS also attenuated two aspects of the GRP system, the expression of GRP <italic>per se</italic> and the expression of ARs that regulate penile reflexes. Furthermore, pharmacological stimulation of GRP receptors restores male reproductive function in male rats exposed to SPS. These data suggest that the effects of SPS to inhibit male reproductive function are mediated, at least in part, by effects on the spinal GRP system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a center for male reproductive function in the spinal cord that can be altered in the expression and/or distribution of protein by exposure to stress. Since a significant reduction in the frequency of penile reflexes was observed in SPS-exposed males, this may also serve as a viable paradigm to study the pathophysiology of psychogenic ED in PTSD or other disorders.</p><p>Considerable evidence suggests that GRP has complex molecular interactions in various tissues. GRP stimulates neuroblastoma growth and the expression of angiogenic markers, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor expressions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004276-Kang1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, GRP activates nuclear factor kappa B-dependent pathway to modulate the expressions of interleukin-8 and vascular endothelial growth factor in prostate cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004276-Levine1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, GRP regulates the expression of many genes to affect cellular function both in the neural and non-neural cells. When stress suppresses GRP expression in the spinal cord, it presumably involves a cascade of other stress-response genes, both upstream and downstream from GRP itself.</p><p>Castration of adult male rats significantly reduced the expression of GRP in the lumbar spinal cord, and this reduction was averted by androgen replacement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004276-Sakamoto1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Additionally, the spinal GRP system is completely feminine in XY rats with a dysfunctional AR gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004276-Sakamoto1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus T and AR are both necessary to maintain normal GRP expression in the lumbar spinal cord <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004276-Sakamoto1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Men with major depression have decreased T levels and negative correlation between T levels and the severity of depression has been observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004276-Mason1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004276-Yesavage1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, exposure to chronic restraint stress in rats, a rodent model of depression, decreases plasma levels of T <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004276-RetanaMarquez1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004276-Matsumoto1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting a relationship with male reproductive dysfunctions. Our results with SPS in rats are consistent with previous reports of normal plasma T levels in combat-related PTSD patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004276-Mulchahey1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> and in refugees suffering from PTSD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004276-Bauer1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. However, cerebrospinal fluid T levels were lower in combat-related PTSD patients as compared with normal controls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004276-Mulchahey1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Although the level of plasma T is normal 7 days after SPS exposure, we found a significant decrease in the expression of AR but not ER&#x003b1; protein in the upper lumbar spinal cord. In control males, nearly every GRP-immunoreactive neuron in the upper lumbar spinal cord also contains AR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004276-Sakamoto1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Taken together, these results suggest that the decline of AR expression in the upper lumbar spinal cord may be a link in the attenuation of the GRP system after SPS exposure, and consequently contributes to the appearance of sexual dysfunctions, including erection and ejaculation difficulties. Future study is required to clarify the mechanism(s) involved in down-regulating AR expression in the spinal sexual center in response to the severe psychological stress.</p><p>Stress responses are typically mediated through glucocorticoid receptors in the central nervous system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004276-Chrousos1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004276-Holsboer1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Although plasma levels of CORT in patients with major depression are high, most have demonstrated subnormal CORT levels in the plasma of humans with PTSD, despite the increased release of corticotrophin releasing factor, suggesting an exaggerated hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis negative feedback <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004276-Yehuda1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004276-Yehuda2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, in rats, we found plasma CORT level as well as T were still in the physiological range 7 days after SPS (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004276-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Furthermore, we see no difference in the expressions of glucocorticoid receptor protein in the upper lumbar spinal cord (L3&#x02013;4) of SPS-exposed males as revealed by Western blotting (our unpublished observation). Thus the GRP system in the rat lumbar spinal cord may be independent of CORT after SPS exposure.</p><p>In the present study, we did not use the GRP antagonist RC-3095 in SPS-exposed rats because they already display few reflexes. Furthermore, installing intrathecal catheters to the lower lumbar spinal cord to deliver the antagonist, would itself act as a stressor, making it difficult to see an effect of SPS. However, we previously inserted intrathecal catheters in otherwise unstressed rats and found that RC-3095 suppresses sexual reflexes in a dose-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004276-Sakamoto1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. These studies, taken together, support the hypothesis that SPS suppresses erectile reflexes by affecting the spinal GRP system.</p><p>In summary, we found that stress significantly attenuates the spinal GRP system regulating male reproductive function, reducing expression of both GRP and the ARs mediating T effects on the system, interfering with male reproductive function. These findings suggest that the use of selective GRP-R agents may provide new avenues for the treatment of stress-related ED in men.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals</title><p>Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were maintained in air-conditioned rooms (22&#x000b1;1&#x000b0;C) on a 12 h light/dark cycle with free access to food and drinking water.
