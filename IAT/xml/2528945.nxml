We previously reported that intranasal immunization of mice with pneumococci confers CD4&#x0002b; T cell&#x02013;dependent, antibody- and serotype-independent protection against colonization. Here we show that this immunity, rather than preventing initiation of carriage, accelerates clearance over several days, accompanied by neutrophilic infiltration of the nasopharyngeal mucosa. Adoptive transfer of immune CD4&#x0002b; T cells was sufficient to confer immunity to na&#x000ef;ve RAG1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. A critical role of interleukin (IL)-17A was demonstrated: mice lacking interferon-&#x003b3; or IL-4 were protected, but not mice lacking IL-17A receptor or mice with neutrophil depletion. <italic>In vitro</italic> expression of IL-17A in response to pneumococci was assayed: lymphoid tissue from vaccinated mice expressed significantly more IL-17A than controls, and IL-17A expression from peripheral blood samples from immunized mice predicted protection <italic>in vivo</italic>. IL-17A was elicited by pneumococcal stimulation of tonsillar cells of children or adult blood but not cord blood. IL-17A increased pneumococcal killing by human neutrophils both in the absence and in the presence of antibodies and complement. We conclude that IL-17A mediates pneumococcal immunity in mice and probably in humans; its elicitation <italic>in vitro</italic> could help in the development of candidate pneumococcal vaccines.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The bacterium <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (pneumococcus) causes serious disease in children and the elderly, including pneumonia and meningitis (inflammation of the brain). Carriage of pneumococcus in the nose is a necessary first step for most infections. As children age, they carry pneumococcus for shorter periods of time and their risk of disease decreases also. The mechanisms underlying this age-related decrease of carriage are not well understood. A deeper understanding of resistance to colonization would enable us to develop better pneumococcal vaccines. Using experimental mouse models, we show that repeated exposure to pneumococci leads to a subsequent reduction in duration of pneumococcal carriage, similar to what is observed in humans. We identify the immune cells that are responsible for this process, so-called T<sub>H</sub>17 cells, which release a factor that enables human blood cells to kill pneumococcus more efficiently. We show that these T<sub>H</sub>17 cells exist in adults and children, but not in newborn babies, which suggests that they may arise as a consequence of humans being exposed to pneumococcus. We describe an assay for the measurement of these cells in humans. Such an assay could facilitate the development of novel vaccines directed against pneumococcal carriage.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (pneumococcus) is an &#x0201c;extracellular&#x0201d; pathogen, generally considered to be killed by phagocytic ingestion, which is facilitated by opsonic antibodies.

However, we and others have found that factors other than anticapsular antibodies may play a role in the natural development of protection against pneumococcal colonization and disease.

Both WCV-vaccinated and control mice immunized with CT alone were colonized one day after challenge. In mice immunized with WCV however, carriage became significantly reduced after 4 days compared to controls given cholera toxin (CT) adjuvant alone (median density of colonization on day 4 in WCV- vs. CT-immunized mice 251 vs. 3720 cfu/nasal wash, P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.029 by Mann-Whitney U test) and was undetectable by day 6 (0/4 WCV-immunized mice had detectable colonies on day 6 vs. 4/4 mice that received CT, P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.029 by Fisher's Exact test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000159-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).
