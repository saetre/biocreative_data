Both IGFBP-1a and -b are capable of IGF binding, but IGFBP-1b has much lower affinities for IGF-I and -II because of greater dissociation rates. Overexpression of IGFBP-1a and -1b in zebrafish embryos caused significant decreases in growth and developmental rates.

Gene duplication is considered to be the primary force of new gene evolution, and is evident in a number of sequenced genomes ranging from Bacteria to human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Zhang1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Divergent functions in duplicates might help permanent preservation of the genes. Two major hypotheses have been advanced to explain the functional retention of the duplicated genes. The neofunctionalization hypothesis argues that after duplication one daughter gene retains the ancestral function while the other acquires new functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Ohno1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The duplication-degeneration-complementation (DDC) hypothesis asserts that the functions of the ancestral gene are partitioned between the duplicated genes, such that the duplicate genes complement each other by jointly performing the necessary subfunctions of the ancestral gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Force1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. These two hypotheses may not necessarily be mutually exclusive. It has been proposed recently that a large portion of duplicated genes undergo rapid subfunctionalization followed by prolonged and substantial neofunctionalization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-He1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Despite the advance in our understanding of the role of gene duplication in the evolution of new genes and gene families, deciphering whether a pair of duplicated genes has evolved divergent functions is often challenging. The zebrafish is uniquely positioned to provide insight into the process of functional gene evolution due to its versatility, amenability to genetic and experimental manipulation, and because it possess a large number of duplicated genes. By one estimation, zebrafish has two co-orthologs for at least 20&#x00025; of human genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Postlethwait1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Recent studies have suggested that a genome duplication event occurred in the teleost lineage &#x0223c;350 million years ago, prior to the beginning of the teleost radiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Postlethwait1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Taylor1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We have previously reported the isolation of <italic>igfbp-1</italic> (insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1) that is expressed in the liver in zebrafish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Maures1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> and plays an important role in mediating hypoxia-induced embryonic growth and developmental delay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Kajimura1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Here, we describe a new and related zebrafish gene. Phylogenetic, gene structure, and chromosomal location analysis indicate this gene is an <italic>igfbp-1</italic> paralog and therefore we termed it as <italic>igfbp-1b</italic> and the previously reported gene as <italic>igfbp-1a</italic>. Both genes encode proteins that are related to IGFBP-1 reported in humans and other mammals. IGFBP-1 is a secreted protein belonging to the IGFBP gene family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Clemmons1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Firth1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Kajimura2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

Like other IGFBPs, IGFBP-1 has conserved N-terminal and C-terminal domains and a variable linker (L)-domain. Its expression is highly inducible under a variety of catabolic conditions such as food deprivation, malnutrition, stress, injury, and hypoxia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Kajimura2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>To understand whether the duplicated IGFBP-1 genes have evolved distinct structural and functional properties, we have investigated their spatial and temporal expression, physiological regulation, IGF binding kinetics, and biological activities. These results indicate that the two IGFBP-1 genes have gone through subfunction partitioning at the temporal expression, physiological regulation, protein structure and functional levels and provide novel insights into the functional conservation and divergence of the duplicated <italic>igfbp-1</italic> genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Identification of a new zebrafish IGFBP gene</title><p>In searching IGFBP genes in zebrafish, we have identified a new IGFBP like gene (ENSDARG00000038666, DQ465370) in the zebrafish genome database. Using 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-RACE, its full-length cDNA was determined (DQ465369). The encoded protein (ABE98257) shares higher identities with IGFBP-1 and -4 than with other known IGFBPs. Structural analysis suggests that the mature peptide is composed of 224 aa with a predicted molecular mass of 23.8 kDa. Like other known IGFBPs, there are 12 cysteine residues in its N-terminal domain (residues 1&#x02013;82) and 6 cysteine residues in its C-terminal domain (residues 156&#x02013;244; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003091-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). A typical IGFBP motif is present in the N-domain and a thyroglobulin-1 motif in the C-domain. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003091-t001">Table 1</xref>, the overall sequence identities of this protein with six human IGFBPs are 35&#x00025; (IGFBP-1), 28&#x00025; (IGFBP-2), 28&#x00025; (IGFBP-3), 33&#x00025; (IGFBP-4), and 30&#x00025; (IGFBP-5 and IGFBP-6). Its identities with the known zebrafish IGFBPs are 50&#x00025; (IGFBP-1), 28&#x00025; (IGFBP-2), 26&#x00025; (IGFBP-3), and 30&#x00025; (IGFBP-5), respectively. If only the N- and C-domains were used for comparison, the sequence identities were much higher. Among various members of the IGFBP family, the new IGFBP has higher sequence identities with IGFBP-1s and IGFBP-4s. IGFBP-4s are unique among the IGFBP family in that they have two extra cysteine residues in the L-domain. No cysteine is found in the L-domain of this newly identified protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003091-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). In the L-domain of mammalian IGFBP-1, there is a proline, glutamine, serine, and threonine (PEST) motif, known to contribute to its susceptibility to proteolysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Lee1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. The PEST sequence is present in this protein. Mammalian IGFBP-1 has an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif in its C-domain, but it is not found in the previously reported zebrafish IGFBP-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Maures1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Likewise, this new IGFBP does not contain any RGD motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003091-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0003091-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003091.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Structural and phyologenetic analysis.</title><p>A) Comparison of the new zebrafish IGFBP primary sequence with that of human (h), bovine (b), chicken (c), and zebrafish (z) IGFBP-1 and -4.

Exposure of ZF-4 cells to IGF-I at 20 nM resulted in a 372.8&#x000b1;10.2&#x00025; increase in BrdU labeling index (p&#x0003c;0.05, <italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6). IGFBP-1a, when added together with IGF-1, inhibited IGF-I-stimulated DNA synthesis in a concentration-dependent manner. At 10 nM (1&#x02236;2 molar ration to IGF-I), IGFBP-1a caused a significant decease in IGF-I action (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003091-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). At the highest concentration (50 nM), IGFBP-1a reduced the DNA synthesis close to the basal level (148.8&#x000b1;11.5&#x00025; of control), suggesting a near complete inhibition of IGF-I actions. Consistent with the IGF binding affinity results, IGFBP-1b had a weaker effect. At 10 nM, IGFBP-1b caused a 22.7&#x00025; reduction as compared to the 48.4&#x00025; reduction in the case of IGFBP-1a. This difference in their inhibitory effects is statistically significant (p&#x0003c;0.05). At 20 nM, IGFBP-1b appeared to have a weaker effect compared to IGFBP-1a (IGFBP-1a, 184.1&#x000b1;10.1&#x00025; vs. IGFBP-1b, 259.6&#x000b1;12.7 of the control group). These data suggest that both IGFBP-1a and -b are functional and both inhibit zebrafish embryo growth and development by binding to IGFs. However, the two proteins are clearly not identical functionally. IGFBP-1a has a stronger activity than IGFBP-1b in inhibiting IGF actions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have identified a pair of co-orthologs of human IGFBP-1 in zebrafish and examined their gene structures, chromosomal locations, spatial and temporal expression patterns, physiological regulatory mechanisms, ligand binding kinetics, and biological activities. The conclusion that zebrafish <italic>igfbp-1b</italic> is a human IGFBP-1 co-ortholog is well supported by phylogenetic and detailed structural data. For instance, zebrafish IGFBP-1b has no cysteine residue in its L-domain, while all known IGFBP-4s have 2 cysteine residues in the L-domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Zhou1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. It is known that mammalian IGFBP-4, but not IGFBP-1, is cleaved by a specific protease, pregnancy associated plasma protease (PAPP)-A, and that the PAPP-A cleavage site is located in the L-domain of all known IGFBP-4s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Boldt1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Laursen1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Chen1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Laursen2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. The new IGFBP lacks the basic residues critical for PAPP-A recognition in the corresponding region. In many mammalian species, IGFBP-1 and -3 genes are located next to each other on the same chromosome in a tail-to-tail orientation. By physical mapping and database searching, we found that zebrafish <italic>igfbp-1a</italic> and <italic>igfbp-3</italic> are neighboring genes located on LG20 in a tail-to-tail orientation, resembling the situation of human <italic>IGFBP-1</italic> and <italic>-3</italic> genes localized on chromosome 7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Ehrenborg1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Hwa1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. If zebrafish <italic>igfbp-1a</italic> and <italic>igfbp-1b</italic> arose by a chromosomal duplication event, one would expect that zebrafish <italic>igfbp-1b</italic> should also be located next to another <italic>igfbp-3</italic> gene. Indeed, analyzing sequences adjacent to <italic>igfbp-1b</italic> on LG2 reveals sequences with significant identity with fish and human IGFBP-3 (data not shown). Whether these sequences indeed encode a functional zebrafish <italic>igfbp-3</italic> awaits further molecular and functional study. In addition to these IGFBP genes, we were able to identify a number of orthologous genes between zebrafish LG2 and human Chr.7. These synteny relationships strongly suggest that zebrafish <italic>igfbp-1a</italic> and <italic>igfbp-1b</italic> are co-orthologs of the human <italic>IGFBP-1</italic> gene and that they originated from a gene duplication event that occurred prior to the teleost radiation.</p><p>The finding that two <italic>igfbp-1</italic> genes are present in the zebrafish genome raised the interesting question regarding their functional relationship. After genome duplication, each gene copy can follow a separate evolutionary fate. It has been postulated that non-functionalization is the fate for the majority of the duplicate genes and only 20&#x00025; or so are retained <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Jaillon1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Woods1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, when the putative zebrafish orthologs of 74 human genes on chromosome 17 were examined, only 15 (20&#x00025;) were present as duplicate genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Force2">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Postlethwait2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Subfunction partitioning is common among the retained duplicated genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Postlethwait1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Despite a large list of examples, in only a few cases has the subfunction partitioning of mammalian gene functions by zebrafish duplicates been explained on a molecular level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Postlethwait1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. For example, differential temporal and/or spatial expression profiles have been documented in duplicated zebrafish <italic>hox1a/b</italic> and <italic>sox9a/b</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Amores1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Cresko1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Hoegg1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Yan1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. In those cases, it has been postulated that the degenerative loss of regulatory modules in each of the two duplicates may have been sufficient to allow the preservation of the two genes, such that the duplicates together retain original functions of the single ancestor gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Postlethwait1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Prince1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. The duplicated zebrafish <italic>igfbp-1</italic> genes are clear examples of temporal subfunctioning partitioning. In humans and mouse, IGFBP-1 is expressed only in the liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Kajimura2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. The zebrafish paralogs are also expressed exclusively in the liver in adult fish. During embryogenesis, the two genes are expressed in overlapping spatial domains. The two genes, however, have distinct temporal patterns. While zebrafish IGFBP-1a mRNA was easily detected throughout embryogenesis, IGFBP-1b mRNA was not detectable or was present at very low levels in early stages. It is only highly expressed in advanced embryonic stages.</p><p>In humans and mice, IGFBP-1 is highly induced by a variety of catabolic conditions, including fasting, malnutrition, and endoplasmic reticulum stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Kajimura2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Another major physiological cue that regulates IGFBP-1 expression is hypoxia. Hypoxia triggers the induction of the human IGFBP-1 gene via the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Tazuke1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. The results of this study indicate that fasting and hypoxia induce the hepatic expression of the two zebrafish IGFBP-1 co-orthologs. One of the interesting findings in the present study is while both <italic>igfbp-1a</italic> and <italic>igfbp-1b</italic> are hypoxia-inducible, their timing and responsiveness to hypoxia are clearly different. In early embryonic stages, hypoxia strongly induces the <italic>igfbp-1a</italic> expression in early embryogenesis, whereas it represses <italic>igfbp-1b</italic> expression. In advanced embryonic stages, it induced a marked increase in <italic>igfbp-1b</italic> expression, while the same treatment had no effect on the levels of <italic>igfbp-1a</italic> expression. In adult fish, hypoxia has a stronger effect on <italic>igfbp-1a</italic> than on <italic>igfbp-1b</italic> expression, suggesting that the duplicated genes underwent subfunction partitioning. We term this type of subfunction partitioning as inducible or regulation subfunctioning partitioning as it is distinct from the simply spatial, temporal, qualitative, and quantitative partitioning previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Postlethwait1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The differential responses of <italic>igfbp-1a</italic> and <italic>igfbp-1b</italic> to hypoxia are likely due to changes/mutations in their <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements after the duplication. The HIF-1 complex activates target gene expression by direct binding to the hypoxia-response element (HRE; A/G CGTG) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Semenza1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Tazuke et al. (1998) have identified a HRE located in intron 2 of the human IGFBP-1 gene responsible for its hypoxia response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Tazuke1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. We have recently shown that the induction of zebrafish <italic>igfbp-1a</italic> expression by hypoxia is mediated through HIF-1 both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Kajimura3">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. The zebrafish <italic>igfbp-1a</italic> promoter contains 13 potential HREs within a 2.1 kb region upstream of the translational start site and the HRE positioned at &#x02212;1090/&#x02212;1086 is primarily responsible for the hypoxia and HIF-1-induced IGFBP-1 expression. An additional <italic>cis</italic> element, HIF-1 ancillary sequence (HAS), is required for the responsiveness to hypoxia and to HIF-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Kajimura3">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study, we show that there are 5 putative HREs and 3 possible HASs in the 2.3 kb region upstream of the translational start site of zebrafish <italic>igfbp-1b</italic>, indicating possible re-arrangement of these cis elements in the duplicated gene. This subfunction partitioning of IGFBP-1 genes provides an excellent opportunity to identify critical regulatory elements. Further functional studies will undoubtedly reveal the factors responsible for the unique expression patterns of these two genes.</p><p>Subfunction partitioning can involve protein structural changes and has important functional and evolutionary consequences, but few such examples have been established in zebrafish. In this study, we provide biochemical and biological evidence indicating subfunction partitioning involved protein structural and functional changes in the duplicated <italic>igfbp-1</italic> genes. We show that purified zebrafish IGFBP-1a and -1b proteins have different apparent molecular mass on SDS-PAGE. A single <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation motif, that could account for the larger molecular mass, is found in IGFBP-1a but not -1b. While both zebrafish IGFBP-1a and -1b are capable of IGF binding, binding kinetics analysis revealed that the two proteins have very different IGF binding properties. Zebrafish IGFBP-1a has very high-affinity for IGF-I (<italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.28 nM) and IGF-II (<italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.34 nM) and the IGFBP-1a/IGF complexes are highly stable. In comparison, the affinities of IGFBP-1b to IGF-I and IGF-II are 43 and 27 fold lower. Interestingly, IGFBP-1b retains a remarkably high association rate with IGF-I and IGF-II but the IGFBP-1b/IGF complexes are much less stable, due to the high dissociation rates. In mammalian IGFBPs, amino acid residues responsible for IGF-binding have been elucidated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Sitar1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Further mutational analysis of zebrafish IGFBP-1a and -1b will undoubtedly provide structural insights underlying the different ligand binding properties of the two zebrafish IGFBP-1 proteins.</p><p>Studies in a variety of species have shown that the IGF signaling pathway plays a fundamental role in regulating wide range of physiological events from embryonic development and growth to life span regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Butler1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Wood1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. The multiple forms of IGFBPs bind the IGF ligands and regulate the availability of the IGFs to the IGF-1 receptors, therefore providing additional layers of regulation of the IGF signaling.

A number of <italic>in vitro</italic> studies using transgenic mice have shown that IGFBP-1 has an inhibitory effect on IGF activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Rajkumar1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Gay1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Crossey1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Froment1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-BenLagha1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Watson1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. The inhibitory effects seem to be mainly caused by competition for IGF binding with the IGF-1R <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003091-Kajimura2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. In good agreement with these findings, injection of IGFBP-1a and -1b mRNA into zebrafish embryos caused significant decreases in body size and somite number. These overexpression experiments suggest that IGFBP-1a and -1b are inhibitory proteins and that they probably act by binding to and inhibiting IGF actions in vivo. However, the two proteins are clearly not identical in terms of biological potency. When IGFBP-1a or -1b was added to cultured zebrafish embryonic cells in the presence of absence of IGF-I, IGFBP-1b has a significantly lower activity in inhibiting IGF actions compared to that of IGFBP-1a. This is consistent with the fact that zebrafish IGFBP-1b has a much lower affinity for IGF-1 and IGF-II.</p><p>In conclusion, we have identified and characterized a novel zebrafish IGFBP gene, <italic>igfbp-1b</italic>, which is a co-orthologous gene of human IGFBP-1.
