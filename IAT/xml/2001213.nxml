The distance constraints from both methods reveal large-scale movement of opposite signs in the periplasmic and cytoplasmic part of the transporter upon ATP hydrolysis. LPS induces distinct structural changes that are inhibited by trapping of the transporter in an ATP post-hydrolysis intermediate. The formation of this intermediate involves a 33-&#x000c5; distance change between the two ABCs, which is consistent with a dimerization-dissociation cycle during transport that leads to their substantial separation in the absence of nucleotides.

A subclass of these pumps&#x02014;ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters&#x02014;use energy from ATP to remove a wide range of molecules. MsbA is a conserved ABC transporter from Gram-negative bacteria with sequence similarity to human multi-drug ABC transporters. MsbA flips the building block of the outer membrane, lipid A, across the inner membrane. The input of ATP energy occurs in two dedicated nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), whose configuration in intact transporters is controversial. We determined the amplitude of MsbA conformational motion that couples energy expenditure to substrate movement across the membrane. Using molecular probes introduced into the protein sequence, we found that ATP hydrolysis fuels a relative motion of the NBDs close to 30 &#x000c5;. The movement of the NBDs is coupled to reorientation of the chamber, which binds the lipid substrate from cytoplasmic-facing to extracellular-facing through large amplitude motion on either side of the transporters. In addition to revealing the structural mechanics of transport, these results challenge current models deduced from studies of substrate-specific ABC importers that envisions the two NBDs in contact throughout the ATP hydrolysis cycle.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Analysis of the conformational changes that occur in a conserved ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter challenges current models of this clinically important class of molecules.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Borbat PP, Surendhran K, Bortolus M, Zou P, Freed JH, et al (2007) Conformational motion of the ABC transporter MsbA induced by ATP hydrolysis.

The location of spin labels in three helices suggests that the distance changes reflect a concerted conformational rearrangement in the transmembrane segment.

This indicates that there is no significant change in the local environment of the spin label, and the distance change at this site thus reflects a rigid body type movement of the backbone. An even larger distance change is reported at the NBD interface where spin labels at sites 539 move closer by almost 30 &#x000c5; (we note that the spin label at site 539 is confined such that the uncertainty in distance is 0.3 &#x000c5;). In contrast, an opening movement of 10 &#x000c5; occurs between spin labels at site 61 in ECL1. Taken together, these distance changes suggest that alternating access of the chamber is induced by substantial movements on both sides of the transporter.

However, even in these cases, the deviations of the measured distance from the alpha carbon separation can be rationalized by the expected projection of the spin labels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050271-g002">Figure 2</xref>B).

Whereas the sampling grid was selected to represent the extreme distances, it was not exhaustive and we did not attempt to assess the relative energies of spin labeled MsbA for every set of torsion angles. We found the modeled distance between the spin labels to vary from 14 to 24 &#x000c5; (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050271-t001">Table 1</xref>), which is shorter than the distance between the corresponding alpha carbons as expected from projecting the spin label along the C<sub>&#x003b1;</sub>-C<sub>&#x003b2;</sub> vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050271-g002">Figure 2</xref>B), but well in line with the experimental data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050271-g001">Figure 1</xref>B.

The effect is detergent-dependent: LPS titration in undecyl-maltoside, which has a higher critical micelle concentration (CMC) relative to &#x003b1;-ddm (dodecyl maltoside), shifts the curve to lower concentrations, and exposes an inflection point above which the distance increases monotonically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050271-g003">Figure 3</xref>A <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050271-sg007">Figure S7</xref>).

LPS induces the appearance of a mobile component in the ESR spectrum at all sites explored and leads to a new population of transporters with longer distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050271-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). At the periplasmic site 57, the addition of LPS reduces the amplitude of dipolar splittings (arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050271-g003">Figure 3</xref>B), which reflects spin labels separated by less than 10 &#x000c5;, implying an increase in distance.</p><p>An effective distance increase between residues 301 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050271-g003">Figure 3</xref>C) and 61 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050271-sg008">Figure S8</xref>) for an LPS concentration of 1.5 mM (which is already in excess, as compared to a protein concentration of &#x0223c;100 &#x003bc;M) is also detected by DEER. The increase in distance at site 61 is more pronounced than for site 301, with virtually no change for site 248 (unpublished data). This may indicate preferential binding of LPS at the ECL1 loop region that is always accessible due to the spherical shape of micelles. In addition, the same sign of the distance change at sites 301 and 61 is not in line with the opposite signs of comparably large changes produced in opening or closing of MsbA by ATP hydrolysis, but is more indicative of a different structural change. Taken together, the data suggest that at these concentrations, LPS induces an increase in monomer separation in the transmembrane domain.</p><p>At an LPS concentration of 5 mM, there is no further increase in distances, but the pattern of DEER signals clearly changes and can be interpreted in two ways. The first, and most likely, explanation is that it reflects the presence of a second component with a much longer distance (&#x0003e;70 &#x000c5;); this could imply the complete dissociation of the dimer. The second, less likely, explanation is that at excessive concentrations of LPS, lipids bridge two transporters at their periplasmic side (as was observed in the crystal structure of MsbA-ADP/Vi in presence of LPS in high concentration), leading to a more rapid decay of the DEER signal. But this case technically is more difficult to reconcile with the nearly uniform pattern of signal change for sites 61, 248, and 301 located at progressively larger distance from spin-labels residing on the suggested second dimer. A more detailed DEER study would be instrumental in establishing the precise nature of the mode of LPS interaction with MsbA</p><p>Hydrolysis of ATP subsequent to LPS addition resets the distance constraints close to those of the ADP/Vi as long as the LPS concentration is in the range of the binding isotherm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050271-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). The ensemble averaging of the homotransfer by steady-state anisotropy detection implies that the partial distance recovery may reflect a population of transporters that did not turn over ATP; i.e., have a separation similar to that obtained by LPS addition. This interpretation is reinforced by the multi-component nature of the ESR lineshape and its partial recovery at higher LPS concentrations. Notable is the decrease in the population of labels with dipolar coupling at sites 248 and 307 (unpublished data) if LPS is added before ATP and Vi are added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050271-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). In contrast, the ESR spectra of the preformed ADP/Vi intermediate are unchanged after the addition of up to 10 mM LPS, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050271-g003">Figure 3</xref>B for site 248 (compare black and blue traces). Thus, high concentrations of LPS relative to the detergent result in substantial structural reorganization, which may reflect a solvent effect rather than the specific interaction of a substrate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The nucleotide-bound structure of Sav1866 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050271-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d; has demonstrated that the post-hydrolysis conformation of ABC efflux transporters has an open chamber to the extracellular or periplasmic side &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050271-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;.

Similarly, the closing of the chamber in the cytoplasmic side that leads to reduction in NiEDDA accessibility upon ATP binding occurs through large movements, although in the opposite direction compared to the periplasmic side.

If these contacts were to be disrupted due to the opening in the ICD region as implied by our data (sites 103 and 248), this may destabilize the NBD dimer enough to allow its complete dissociation.</p><p>Our results provide direct structural insight into the interaction of LPS with MsbA. It is clear that the addition of LPS leads to structural rearrangements even at low concentrations. However, as with all lipophilic substrates, the results can be easily confounded by changes in the properties of the micelles and liposomes. In the case of MsbA, high concentrations of LPS induce pronounced structural rearrangements possibly reflecting a solvent-like effect. At all sites explored here, high concentrations of LPS increased mobility of spin labels. We are carrying out a systematic analysis of LPS effects on MsbA structure in detergents and liposomes (P Zou HS Mchaourab, unpublished observations).</p><p>When analyzed in the context of previous crystallographic and biochemical studies, our results are consistent with the initiation of the transport cycle by substrate binding to an open chamber at the cytoplasmic side of the transporter. After ATP binding, large-amplitude motion is required to form the ABC dimer, consistent with the two domains having significant conformational entropy in the apo intermediate and not being in contact throughout the cycle. In addition to the absolute distances reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050271-t001">Table 1</xref>, this configuration is also supported by large NiEDDA accessibilities of residues on the cytoplasmic side in the apo intermediate &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050271-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;.
