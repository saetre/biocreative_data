In the absence of ligand, Armadillo is phosphorylated and targeted to the proteasome.

We have therefore addressed how the subcellular distribution of Armadillo and its association with E-Cadherin change in larval wing imaginal discs, under wild type conditions and upon signalling. Using confocal microscopy, we show that Armadillo and E-Cadherin are spatio-temporally regulated during development, and that a punctate species becomes concentrated in a subapical compartment in response to Wingless. In order to further dissect this phenomenon, we overexpressed Armadillo mutants exhibiting different levels of activity and stability, but retaining E-Cadherin binding.

One efficient means by which to achieve this is to recycle the cellular machinery for multiple functions, for example by directly linking signalling to adhesion. <italic>Drosophila</italic> Armadillo, and by extension its vertebrate orthologue &#x003b2;-catenin, is perhaps one of the best candidates for such a molecular integrator. In effect, Armadillo/&#x003b2;-catenin plays dual roles in transducing Wingless/Wnt, and in bridging E-Cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002893-Nelson1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>).</p><p>Wingless (Wg), the <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologue of Wnt-1, is a diffusible glycoprotein with concentration-dependent effects, and is critical to patterning and growth of the embryo and larval imaginal epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002893-MartinezArias1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002893-Mikels1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The essence of canonical Wg signalling is the modulation of the amount and activity of Armadillo. There are two pools of Armadillo, one at the adherens junction and another deemed to be cytoplasmic. In the absence of Wg, the cytoplasmic pool is low due to a steady degradation of Armadillo, mediated by a complex centered around the protein Axin. In this complex, phosphorylation of Armadillo by Shaggy/GSK3&#x003b2; kinase targets it for proteasomal degradation. Upon Wg signalling, a receptor complex containing Frizzled (Fz) and Arrow/LRP6, through the action of the adaptor protein Dishevelled, leads to the recruitment of the Axin complex to the membrane, where it is dismantled and destroyed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002893-Tolwinski1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002893-Cong1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

What emerges is a picture of a complex relationship between &#x003b2;-catenin's distribution, activity and signalling potential, mediated in part by its association with E-Cadherin. Further, these results provide an interesting <italic>in vivo</italic> counterpart to recent biochemical evidence suggesting that &#x003b1;-catenin can bind &#x003b2;-catenin or actin, but not both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002893-Drees1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002893-Yamada1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>.

We show that Armadillo is dynamically regulated during the third larval instar, closely paralleled by E-Cadherin, throughout the apicobasal section of the epithelium. Most importantly, we observe that in response to Wingless signalling, Armadillo is found in a subapical punctate distribution. We have also analyzed the consequences of expressing Armadillo mutants for the distribution of endogenous Armadillo and E-Cadherin. We find a clear dissociation between endogenous Armadillo and E-Cadherin both at the membrane and in the AJ, made evident by the use of our novel method of quantification of subcellular levels. Our results provide new insight into the dynamics of Armadillo/E-Cadherin <italic>in vivo</italic>, and suggest that competition between mutants and endogenous Armadillo may affect recycling of E-Cadherin to the membrane and the AJ. In addition, adult phenotypes may hint at changes in the relationship between AJ components and the cytoskeleton, particularly at the A/P boundary.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Fly work</title><p>Fly stocks were maintained at 18&#x000b0;C or 25&#x000b0;C on standard media (10&#x00025; cornmeal, 9&#x00025; glucose, 4&#x00025; yeast, 1&#x00025; agar and 0.3&#x00025; nipagin in ethanol), supplemented with yeast.

In mitotic cells, which can be identified by their larger size, roundedness, and rosette-like appearance, Armadillo was expressed while Fasciclin III, Scribble, Neurexin and Discs Large were absent, suggesting that septate junctions might be dismantled during cell division (Scribble shown, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002893-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p>Subapically (10&#x00025; shown), Armadillo and E-Cadherin were strongly associated both in the membrane and in puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002893-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). However, none of the Armadillo puncta were seen to associate with the other markers (not shown). Fasciclin III, which appears as an exclusive and true membrane marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002893-g005">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002893-Narasimha1">&#x0005b;79&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002893-Woods1">&#x0005b;80&#x0005d;</xref>), highlighted the existence of a membrane-associated but distinct population of Armadillo that localised in puncta.

Finally, Armadillo and E-Cadherin are tightly associated not only in the AJs, but in membranes and puncta subapically.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Signalling modulates Armadillo puncta subcellular distribution</title><p>The observation that Armadillo puncta were found to be most prevalent in a subapical domain around the D/V boundary where Wingless is expressed (<italic>cf</italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002893-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), and/or associated with E-Cadherin puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002893-g005">Figure 5D</xref>), was intriguing. Several hypotheses, which are not mutually exclusive, could be advanced to explain this. In one scenario, Armadillo puncta represent part of the signalling pool that is stabilised by Wingless; in the absence of signalling Armadillo is &#x0201c;safe&#x0201d; in complex with E-Cadherin at the membrane. Alternatively, Wingless does not change the association between Armadillo and E-Cadherin but rather alters the rate of shuttling of Armadillo-E-Cadherin complexes between different compartments, such that Armadillo becomes available for signalling. The idea that E-Cadherin acts to sequester signalling &#x000df;-catenin has been proposed (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002893-Nelson1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>), but an in-depth analysis of subcellular changes in &#x000df;-catenin is still lacking. We therefore decided to compare the subcellular distribution of Armadillo with that of E-Cadherin and other apicobasal polarity markers upon signalling, by overexpressing a wild type allele of Wingless in the <italic>dpp</italic> domain.</p><p>Overexpression of Wingless did not cause appreciable changes in the distribution of apicobasal polarity markers (not shown). However, we observed some changes in the distribution of Armadillo and E-Cadherin that correlated with the changes seen in the wild type wing discs in regions of endogenous Wingless signalling. While some folding of the epithelium and packing of cells occurred in response to Wingless, E-Cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002893-g006">Figure 6A</xref>) and Armadillo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002893-g006">Figure 6B</xref>) expression were apparently unchanged at 0&#x00025;. In contrast, in the subapical domain (10&#x00025;), Wingless altered the subcellular distribution of E-Cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002893-g006">Figure 6C</xref>) and Armadillo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002893-g006">Figure 6D</xref>).

Thus overexpression of Wingless and Arm<sup>S10</sup> appear to cause similar changes in E-Cadherin, at least at the subcellular level.

These mutants should be able to associate with E-Cadherin through the Armadillo repeats, but are known to differ in their signalling ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002893-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In particular, we were interested in how known deletion mutants would affect changes in the subcellular distribution of endogenous protein at the level of the AJs and basolateral membranes.

In addition, &#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup> and Myr-&#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup> are compromised in their ability to bind &#x003b1;-catenin, with Myr-&#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup> differing in the presence of a Myristoyl tag targeting it to membranes. Finally, we compared these to the effect of mutant Arm&#x00394;C<sup>XM19</sup> on Armadillo's subcellular distribution and signalling potential, as the C-terminus is known to act as a Wg transactivation domain (summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002893-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>At 0&#x00025;, variation in the ability of the Armadillo mutants to associate stably with the AJ was observed, differing from Arm<sup>S10</sup> in both strength and extent.

However, its distribution extended further anteriorly, particularly in the dorsal compartment (compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002893-g007">Figure 7A and B</xref>). In contrast, the membrane targeted form Myr-&#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup> was expressed in a similar domain as Arm<sup>S10</sup>, but was unable to exclude the endogenous protein from the AJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002893-g008">Figure 8C, insets</xref>).

However, since neither the &#x003b1;N27 nor the &#x003b1;Arm antibodies can distinguish this construct from endogenous protein, it was not possible to confirm this. Interestingly, this construct must be stabilised by Wingless as it was ectopically expressed apically near the D/V boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002893-g008">Figure 8D, arrowhead</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0002893-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002893.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Stability of UAS constructs determines the strength of association of endogenous protein with the AJ.</title><p>(A) &#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;128</sup> excludes endogenous Armadillo (red channel, absence of staining) only at the strongest levels of <italic>dppGAL4</italic> expression, away from the A/P boundary (denoted by white line).

This appears to be caused by its own localisation, albeit patchily, in the membrane, and there is some evidence of its import into the nucleus (inset, blue channel).

In order to estimate levels of mutant overexpression, which cannot be compared to wild type cells as for Armadillo and E-Cadherin, we defined &#x0201c;lateral&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;central&#x0201d; domains of overexpression, reflecting strength of the <italic>dppGAL4</italic> driver expression (high centrally, lower laterally, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Materials and Methods</xref>). This further provides an estimate of &#x0201c;stability&#x0201d; since only those proteins that are highly stable will continue to be expressed in lateral domains. Employing this rationale to evaluate different mutants, we found that both &#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup> and Arm&#x00394;C<sup>XM19</sup> levels in the lateral domains were approximately 50&#x00025; of the maximal levels seen in the central domain (0.45 and 0.5, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002893-g012">Figure 12</xref>). In contrast, Arm<sup>S10</sup> only represented 20&#x00025; of maximal levels, and Myr-&#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup> (as a true membrane-marker) was absent from the cytoplasm. &#x003b1;Arm, which detects both &#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;128</sup> and endogenous protein, showed an increase of 19&#x00025; of the pixel intensity in the central domain relative to the surrounding wild type tissue, indicating that the construct was not very stable in the &#x0201c;cellular&#x0201d; domain. This was further shown by the absence of difference between Armadillo levels in the lateral domain of expression compared to the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002893-g012">Figure 12</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the mutants differed dramatically in the magnitude and direction of effects on levels of endogenous Armadillo in the &#x0201c;cellular&#x0201d; domain, highlighting a qualitative difference in lateral and central domains of expression. For instance, in the central domain both &#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup> and &#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;128</sup> caused a dramatic reduction in endogenous Armadillo levels, with decreases of 60 and 67&#x00025; respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002893-g012">Figure 12</xref>). In contrast, Myr-&#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup> and Arm&#x00394;C<sup>XM19</sup> caused a twofold and 78&#x00025; increase, respectively, in cellular Armadillo levels, whereas only a 10&#x00025; increase was apparent upon Arm<sup>S10</sup> overexpression. Thus, in the central domain where overexpression levels are highest, two classes of mutant can be distinguished: those that radically increase, and those that decrease Armadillo levels, respectively. Furthermore, these changes do not necessarily correspond to those seen in the AJ.</p><p>In lateral domains, where mutant overexpression levels are lower, only Myr-&#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup> showed similarly high levels of endogenous protein as in the central domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002893-g012">Figure 12</xref>). At the opposite end of the spectrum, &#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;128</sup> had no effect at all, such that Armadillo levels in the lateral domain were equal to those in neighbouring wild type cells. However, &#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup> and Arm&#x00394;C<sup>XM19</sup> here caused almost 20&#x00025; reduction in endogenous levels; interestingly the levels of mutant expression also closely correspond (near 50&#x00025;). Arm<sup>S10</sup> caused the greatest reduction in Armadillo protein in the lateral domain of expression. The absence of obvious correlation between levels in lateral and central domains highlights qualitative differences in the mutants.</p><p>Unlike the construct and endogenous Armadillo levels, which at least partially paralleled one another, changes in cellular E-Cadherin levels were much less variable in direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002893-g012">Figure 12</xref>). In effect, levels increased in all cases except Arm<sup>S10</sup>, which caused a 30&#x00025; decrease in E-Cadherin levels. Arm&#x00394;C<sup>XM19</sup>, &#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;128</sup> and &#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup> promoted increased E-Cadherin levels approaching 30&#x00025; within the (central) domain of expression, and Myr-&#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup> by almost 60&#x00025;. These observations were intriguing given that only &#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup> caused appreciable changes in E-Cadherin levels at the AJ, suggesting that we were missing some level of complexity in our evaluation.</p><p>Since the quantification method used estimated changes in protein levels across a field of cells, we further subdivided the &#x0201c;cellular&#x0201d; domain into basolateral membrane and nuclear components, by specifically choosing and quantifying points within these compartments. The expectation was that comparison of the total &#x0201c;cellular&#x0201d; levels with those in its constituent parts would allow a more accurate estimate of the subcellular location at which changes in Armadillo and E-Cadherin were occurring.</p></sec><sec id="s3e3"><title>Basolateral membrane levels</title><p>Using discs that were not saturated for fluorescence intensity, and that had approximate 1&#x02236;1 ratio of endogenous Armadillo to E-Cadherin proteins in wild type cells outside the overexpression domain, nevertheless does not provide a very accurate means of assessing the construct levels across experiments, even when attempting to normalise to the maximal pixel intensity. Thus maximal expression levels in the central domain of 0.56, 0.47, 0.68 and 0.2 for Arm<sup>S10</sup>, &#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup>, Myr-&#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup> and Arm&#x00394;C<sup>XM19</sup> mutants, respectively, only provided a rough estimate. What was apparent, however, was that &#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup> and Myr-&#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup> were as stable in the lateral as in the central domains of expression. This was in contrast to the other constructs, which were either only stable in the highest domain of <italic>dpp</italic> expression (&#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;128</sup>), or at much lower levels (Arm<sup>S10</sup>, 14&#x00025; and Arm&#x00394;C<sup>XM19</sup>, 11&#x00025;, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002893-g012">Figure 12</xref>).</p><p>Levels of endogenous Armadillo in the basolateral membrane tended to parallel those within the &#x0201c;cellular&#x0201d; compartment in direction if not magnitude. This was true of &#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup>, Myr-&#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup> and &#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;128</sup>, and of Arm<sup>S10</sup> in the lateral domain. In the central domain, Arm<sup>S10</sup> caused a dramatic reduction of endogenous Armadillo (&#x02212;52&#x00025;) while &#x0201c;cellular&#x0201d; levels remained relatively unchanged (&#x0002b;10&#x00025;), suggesting a change in cytoplasmic or nuclear protein levels.</p><p>In the absence of nuclear E-Cadherin, the basolateral membrane E-Cadherin should in principle constitute the entire &#x0201c;cellular&#x0201d; component, assuming there was no cytoplasmic protein. The E-Cadherin puncta observed in the wing discs likely represent the cytoplasmic component. Arm<sup>S10</sup>, &#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;128</sup> and Myr-&#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup> basolateral membrane levels were similar in direction to the quantified &#x0201c;cellular&#x0201d; levels. Arm<sup>S10</sup> showed similar decreases of E-Cadherin levels both across the cellular field and in the basolateral membrane (0.3 and 0.33). Myr-&#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup> and &#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;128</sup> caused increases in basolateral membrane-associate E-Cadherin relative to wild type sister cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002893-g012">Figure 12</xref>). Most importantly, &#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup> showed a change in direction of E-Cadherin levels between the &#x0201c;cellular&#x0201d; compartment and the basolateral membrane. This clearly indicates a movement of E-Cadherin from the basolateral membrane to the cytoplasm or to the nucleus, and may correlate with the loss of endogenous Armadillo there (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002893-g011">Figure 11A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002893-g012">12</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3e4"><title>Nuclear levels</title><p>One of the most intractable problems faced in immunohistochemical studies of Armadillo concerns the difficulty of unequivocally showing that it accumulates to any appreciable levels in the nucleus upon signalling. This is particularly relevant in cases where it is important to distinguish low levels from background &#x0201c;noise&#x0201d;. We therefore further extended our quantification methodology to help address any small changes in nuclear Armadillo accumulation that might have occurred upon mutant overexpression, by comparing levels within the expression domain with those in wild type neighbours. Since the nucleus constitutes the largest fraction of the cells in the wing imaginal disc epithelium, it is relatively straightforward to assign levels there.</p><p>As with the basolateral membrane quantification, nuclear levels were calculated relative to a maximal pixel intensity of 255, after taking into consideration &#x0201c;background&#x0201d; pixel intensity. Construct expression in nuclei was rarely high if observable, with Myr-&#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup> and &#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;128</sup> mutants undetectable in the nucleus. Only &#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup> and Arm<sup>S10</sup> had appreciable localisation in the nucleus in the central domain of <italic>dppGAL4</italic> expression, represented as 0.22 and 0.15 of a possible maximum of 1. &#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup> was also present at low levels in the lateral domain of expression, with a value less than 10&#x00025; (0.09, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002893-g012">Figure 12</xref>). Arm&#x00394;C<sup>XM19</sup> was only present in nuclei in cells adjacent to the source of Wingless (0.28, white star), at the D/V boundary.</p><p>Endogenous Armadillo was also found in nuclei, paralleling Arm<sup>S10</sup> in localisation and levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002893-g012">Figure 12</xref>). In contrast, &#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup> did not cause a visible translocation of Armadillo to the nucleus, similarly to &#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;128</sup>. The membrane localisation of Myr-&#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup>, however, induced a uniform increase in nuclear Armadillo levels throughout the <italic>dppGAL4</italic> expression domain. Finally, overexpression of Arm&#x00394;C<sup>XM19</sup> appeared to induce some increase in endogenous protein levels in the nucleus, as there was more &#x003b1;N27 staining in the nuclei than could be accounted for by Arm&#x00394;C<sup>XM19</sup> alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002893-g012">Figure 12, white star</xref>), even when pixel intensity on the red channel was adjusted to equal that of the blue channel (<italic>i.e.</italic> if all N27 levels corresponded to those of Arm&#x00394;C<sup>XM19</sup>; data not shown). The data presented here highlight the value of quantifying the changes in subcellular distribution of Armadillo and E-Cadherin, which otherwise might not be visible to the naked eye.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Changes in Armadillo distribution and levels correlate with adult phenotype</title><p>Wingless signalling, in combination with Notch, is responsible for the formation of bristles along the wing margin through its role in the positioning and stabilisation of sensory organ precursors on either side of the D/V boundary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002893-deCelis1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002893-Langdon1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. By extension, the stabilisation of Armadillo can induce the formation of ectopic bristles both at the margin and within the wing blade. As such, the presence or absence of ectopic bristles acts as a readout of Wingless signalling and Armadillo stability in the wing. Since there is evidence that the levels of Armadillo alone might not be a signalling determinant, we wanted to examine the phenotypes caused by overexpression of Armadillo mutant proteins, and to attempt to correlate them with the changes in subcellular distribution and levels that we observed.</p><p>As with overexpression of Wingless under <italic>dppGAL4</italic>, overexpression of Arm<sup>S10</sup> or Myr-&#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup> was lethal even at 18&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002893-g013">Figure 13A, A&#x02032;, D, D&#x02032;</xref>).

However, using <italic>C5GAL4</italic>, which drives late expression throughout the wing pouch with the exception of the D/V boundary, it was possible to compare phenotypes across these constructs. Although the wings were severely folded and blistered, it was evident that while &#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup> caused a neurogenic phenotype, the ectopic signalling induced by Arm<sup>S10</sup> and Myr-&#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup> resulted in a lawn of ectopic bristles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002893-g013">Figure 13A, A&#x02032;, C, C&#x02032;, D, D&#x02032;, insets</xref>). In contrast, only weak phenotypes were observed with &#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;128</sup> and Arm&#x00394;C<sup>XM19</sup> wings, with few ectopic bristles along and at the tip of the L3 vein, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002893-g013">Figure 13B, B&#x02032;, E, E&#x02032;</xref>). The presence of ectopic bristles correlated well with the high nuclear levels of endogenous Armadillo induced by overexpression of Arm<sup>S10</sup>, &#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup> and Myr-&#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup>; with Arm&#x00394;C<sup>XM19</sup> near the D/V boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002893-g012">Figure 12</xref>); and with nuclear localisation of &#x003b1;Senseless, which marks sensory organ precursors (not shown).

The &#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup> and &#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;128</sup> mutants differ structurally in the extent of the N-terminal deletion; the absence of part of the 1<sup>st</sup> Armadillo repeat in &#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;128</sup> likely reduces its binding to &#x003b1;-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002893-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0002893-g013" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002893.g013</object-id><label>Figure 13</label><caption><title>Armadillo mutants overexpressed with <italic>dppGAL4</italic> induce ectopic bristles and veins in adult wings, with varying degrees of severity.</title><p>(A, A&#x02032;) Arm<sup>S10</sup> is lethal even at 18&#x000b0;C using <italic>dppGAL4</italic>, but results in a lawn of ectopic bristles using <italic>C5GAL4</italic> (insets).

Our <italic>in vivo</italic> data indicating that Wg signalling is correlated with the appearance of Armadillo puncta in a subapical domain, both under wild type and experimental conditions, represents circumstantial support for the existence of a subapical signalling domain. However, the nature of the punctate species of Armadillo remains to be elucidated. In this regard, the dissociation that we observe between E-Cadherin and Armadillo distributions upon overexpression of Wingless or Arm<sup>S10</sup> was intriguing. In a variety of systems, overexpression of E-Cadherin effectively blocks Wnt signalling by sequestering or titrating available &#x000df;-catenin at the membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002893-Miller1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002893-Wodarz1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002893-Sanson1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>. This titration has been thought to take place from a cytoplasmic pool. However, it is also possible that Armadillo is released for signalling from a membrane-associated pool. In this case, E-Cadherin would act as an anchor for a signalling pool of Armadillo rather than sequestering the cytoplasmic pool. While much evidence suggests that adhesion and signalling are mutually exclusive states, it is more likely that these in fact represent alternate faces of the same coin, determined in large part by a balance of tyrosine kinase and phosphatase activities of the E-Cadherin/catenin complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002893-Nelson1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>E-Cadherin plays a central role in epithelial-mesenchymal transitions associated with cancers, through deregulation of appropriate &#x000df;-catenin function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002893-Brembeck1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> and reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002893-MartinezArias2">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>;). Our data on Armadillo mutants further point to an active role of Armadillo in determining the subcellular localisation of E-Cadherin, and hence function in adhesion or Wg signalling. In this context it is perhaps noteworthy that &#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup>, the mutant with the most significant effect on levels and localisation of E-Cadherin/Armadillo at the AJ and basolateral membrane, also appeared to cause sorting defects in wings (refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002893-g013">Figure 13C</xref>).

Furthermore, Arm<sup>S10</sup> is able to bind Legless and Pygopus to activate Wnt targets in the nucleus, an interaction unlikely to occur with &#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup> which lacks part of the 1<sup>st</sup> Armadillo repeat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002893-Hoffmans1">&#x0005b;73&#x0005d;</xref>. It is probable that &#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup> titrates positive regulators in the nucleus, which could explain its phenotype in wings, which is neurogenic or adhesive, rather than reminiscent of ectopic signalling when compared with Arm<sup>S10</sup> or Myr-&#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup>. Finally, we show that Arm&#x00394;C<sup>XM19</sup> not only accumulates in membranes, but also in nuclei at the D/V boundary, where it is responsive to Wg. Previous reports suggested that the mutant allele <italic>arm<sup>XM19</sup></italic>, which causes segment polarity and cuticle defects in embryos, retains some signalling potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002893-Cox2">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. The ability of Arm&#x00394;C<sup>XM19</sup> to weakly activate the Wg pathway may be due to its inability to bind Chibby at the C-terminus, a negative regulator of Wnt signalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002893-Tolwinski3">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002893-Takemaru1">&#x0005b;74&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We do not find a simple correlation between subcellular distribution and activity of the mutant forms of Armadillo that we used in our study. It has been reported in embryos that the signalling activity of Myr-&#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup> is mediated exclusively through endogenous Armadillo, which is driven into nuclei to active Wg targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002893-Tolwinski3">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results are consistent with this, as we observed an increase in nuclear Armadillo throughout the Myr-&#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup> overexpression domain. In contrast, in the case of &#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup> we can detect some of the protein in the nucleus, similarly to Arm<sup>S10</sup>. However, although &#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup> efficiently occupies basolateral membranes, Armadillo levels in the nucleus do not rise appreciably, except in a few cells at the D/V boundary next to the source of Wingless, suggesting that this protein is sensitive to some Wingless regulation that is not Sgg/GSK3-dependent. Another striking difference between these mutant proteins is that while Myr-&#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup> leaves the AJ unaffected, &#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup> reduces Armadillo/E-Cadherin levels. Taken together, these observations lead us to suggest that the basolateral membrane and AJ-associated pool of E-Cadherin/Armadillo are criticial to signalling.</p><p>One of the possibilities raised by our study that might help to explain discrepancies in the signalling ability of our N-terminal deletion mutants is that some cell-surface protein is required for the proper shuttling of Armadillo/E-Cadherin among the subcellular compartments. A putative candidate might be &#x003b1;-catenin, whose passive role in linking the E-Cadherin/&#x000df;-catenin complex to the actin cytoskeleton has recently been put into question <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002893-Drees1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002893-Yamada1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Indirect evidence for a role of &#x003b1;-catenin in mediating the signalling or stability of Armadillo arises from several observations. First, Arm<sup>S10</sup>, which is functional in both signalling and adhesion, is likely the only activated form able to efficiently bind &#x003b1;-catenin, with perhaps the exception of Arm&#x00394;N<sup>1&#x02013;128</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002893-Pai1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002893-Aberle1">&#x0005b;75&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002893-Pai2">&#x0005b;76&#x0005d;</xref>. Second, although Myr-&#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup> lacks &#x003b1;-catenin binding sites, its targeting to the membrane may overcome this limitation by bringing it into proximity with cell surface molecules. Additionally, junctional function is not compromised as endogenous Armadillo and E-Cadherin occupy the AJ. &#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup>, on the other hand, can neither bind &#x003b1;-catenin nor is able to effectively recruit proteins near the cell surface, and furthermore impedes normal Armadillo/E-Cadherin function at the AJ. Finally, our data suggest that actin accumulates at the A/P boundary in cells depleted of E-Cadherin, most notably upon overexpression of &#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;155</sup>. We therefore see a correlation between signalling of mutants, either alone or through endogenous Armadillo, and their ability to interact with &#x003b1;-catenin. It is interesting in this context to note that &#x003b1;-catenin may inhibit CK1 phosphorylation-dependent degradation of &#x003b2;-catenin, and that the region encompassing the junction of the N-terminus and first Armadillo repeat are critical for this regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002893-Bustos1">&#x0005b;77&#x0005d;</xref>.Thus a possible model of Armadillo/E-Cadherin movement upon signalling can be derived from our mutant data, from which we infer a regulatory input from &#x003b1;-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002893-g015">Figure 15</xref>). In support of our model, plasma membrane recruitment of a punctate, signalling-competent species of &#x000df;-catenin appears to be an important step in the transcriptional activation of Wnt signalling both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and occurs independently of E-Cadherin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002893-Hendriksen2">&#x0005b;81&#x0005d;</xref>. Additional studies will be required to confirm the validity of this model, as well as any putative role of &#x003b1;-catenin in mediating these interactions.</p><fig id="pone-0002893-g015" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002893.g015</object-id><label>Figure 15</label><caption><title>Theoretical model of the localization and interactions of wild type and mutant forms of Armadillo and E-Cadherin.</title><p>In a wild type cell in its basal state (no signalling, left), Armadillo (blue dots) and E-Cadherin (green dots) are targeted to the membrane, possibly via the exocyst complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002893-Langevin1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. From there, Armadillo/E-Cadherin cycle to the Adherens Junction (AJ, box), or are hypothesised to remain in the cytoplasm as a complex free from degradation. There is little Armadillo in the nucleus (grey oval). During Wingless signalling (right), Armadillo accumulates in subapical puncta and can enter the nucleus (blue oval) to activate Wg targets. We hypothesise that Armadillo/E-Cadherin are released from the AJ (black arrows); alternatively the rate of cycling of Armadillo/E-Cadherin may also be increased. In our proposed model, either in its basal state or during signalling, Armadillo/E-Cadherin may be able to bind &#x003b1;-catenin (yellow hexagon). The activated N-terminal deletion mutants (centre, red boxes and dots) represent a range of effects in the spectrum between the basal state and Wingless signalling, depending at least in part on overexpression levels (bottom, red bar). &#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;128</sup> (centre, top left) most closely resembles the basal state, with little Armadillo in the nucleus or signalling. At highest levels of overexpression, &#x00394;NArm<sup>1&#x02013;128</sup> excludes Armadillo from the basolateral membrane and AJ, and is unlikely to efficiently bind &#x003b1;-catenin (grey hexagon; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002893-Pai2">&#x0005b;76&#x0005d;</xref>). Arm<sup>S10</sup> (centre, top right) excludes Armadillo from the AJ, as well as basolateral membranes at lowest expression levels. However, Arm<sup>S10</sup> has no effect on E-Cadherin levels and should have the capacity to bind &#x003b1;-catenin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002893-Pai1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002893-Pai2">&#x0005b;76&#x0005d;</xref>, thus ensuring appropriate adhesive function, as well as signalling (red and blue nucleus). In this case, we propose that Armadillo/E-Cadherin at the basolateral membrane may not be sufficiently stable to enter the AJ (grey arrow). Several sources indicate that Armadillo/E-Cadherin is first targeted to the basolateral membrane, and from there to the AJ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002893-Chen1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002893-Palacios1">&#x0005b;78&#x0005d;</xref>.
