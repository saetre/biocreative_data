Ptf1a (pancreas transcription factor 1a) is a helix-loop-helix transcription factor that was first identified as a subunit of the trimeric PTF1 transcription factor complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], which is crucial for the development and maintenance of the pancreas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Ptf1a was also shown to play an important role in the neurogenesis of different central nervous system structures. In particular, Ptf1a is important for the generation of many inhibitory (primarily &#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic) interneurons in different areas, such as the spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and cerebellum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], although in specific other central nervous system regions it is also involved in the specification of excitatory glutamatergic neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. When Ptf1a is knocked down, the inhibitory cells that usually express Ptf1a during development become glutamatergic cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>In the retina, Ptf1a is expressed in the horizontal and amacrine cell populations. Studies in <italic>Xenopus </italic>and mouse retina show that Ptf1a is both essential and sufficient for determining the fates of these inhibitory neuronal types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We made use of a transgenic zebrafish line expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the <italic>ptf1a </italic>promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] to describe the expression of this gene in relation to the development of cells expressing Ptf1a. <italic>In vivo </italic>time-lapse movies in this line helped us determine that Ptf1a turns on in differentiating horizontal and amacrine cells within hours of the completion of the last progenitor division and stays on in these precursors until they begin to differentiate, at which point the Ptf1a transcript disappears. Ptf1a:GFP protein remains in these cells as they differentiate into a variety of subtypes.</p><p>Different types of photoreceptors and horizontal, bipolar and ganglion cells have already been described in detail in the adult zebrafish retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], but only a few anatomically distinct amacrine cell types have been noted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Mosaic expression of the transgene combined with a morphometric classification scheme allowed us to distinguish 28 amacrine subtypes in the zebrafish retina at just 120 hours post-fertilization (hpf). This is the first comprehensive characterization of amacrine subtypes in the zebrafish retina, which will hopefully be useful in understanding visual function and the specification of subtype identity in this developmental model system.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Transgenic Ptf1a:GFP expression marks cells expressing Ptf1a during development</title><p>To study the developing cell types that express Ptf1a during retinal neurogenesis, we made use of a transgenic line expressing GFP under the control of the <italic>ptf1a </italic>promoter (kindly provided by Professor Steven Leach) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. To ensure that the retinal cells that express Ptf1a:GFP reflect the expression of endogenous <italic>ptf1a </italic>gene, the spatio-temporal expression pattern of <italic>ptf1a </italic>RNA was studied using <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization and compared to the expression of GFP in the transgenic line.</p><p>Endogenous <italic>ptf1a </italic>RNA was first expressed at 35 hpf in the ventronasal patch of the retina, as described for the <italic>ath5 </italic>gene, which drives ganglion cell fate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Expression then spread nasally and dorsally, with the dorsal temporal region being the last to express <italic>ptf1a </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The <italic>ptf1a </italic>RNA expression was highly transient, being expressed at any given region for less than 5 hours. By about 60 to 65 hpf <italic>ptf1a </italic>is completely absent from all but the ciliary margin (where retinal development continues throughout adulthood). The onset of GFP expression in the Ptf1a:GFP transgenic line followed that of the RNA expression, with a delay of 4 to 5 hours, but accurately follows the pattern of <italic>ptf1a </italic>message expression - as one would expect of a good anatomical reporter. However, while RNA expression is very transient, the GFP protein is stable and is retained in the retinal cells throughout development (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Comparison of endogenous <italic>ptf1a </italic>RNA expression and GFP reporter protein</bold>.

We have previously shown that the transcription factors Vsx1 and Ath5 turn on in progenitors just before they undergo a final division at the apical surface of the developing retina, thus restricting the fate choices of both daughters of such progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Ptf1a has previously been shown to be necessary in the differentiation of horizontal and amacrine cells in the retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Labelling with a 1 or 2 hour bromodeoxyuridine pulse suggested that Ptf1a turns on postmitotically in mouse retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We made use of the four-dimensional imaging capability in the zebrafish to directly address the question at which stage of the cell cycle/differentiation process is this gene switched on in individual cells.</p><p>Cells undergo their final (and all previous) cell division as multipotent progenitors (reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]) at the apical surface and then migrate to their appropriate layer in the developing retina, taking 3 to 6 hours to reach their final laminar position (measured from Supplementary Movies 4 and 5 in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]).</p><p>Imaging of developing retinas from Tg(<italic>ptf1a</italic>:<italic>GFP</italic>) embryos from 30 hpf for 16 to 28 hours revealed that GFP first turns on in cells in the apical half of the neuroepithelium within the first few hours following their terminal neuroepithelial division. GFP positive cells then migrate basally until they reach the central part of the epithelium, the approximate laminar position of future amacrine cells. Some of these GFP positive cells then move back apically to the developing horizontal cell layer in a process that depends on Lim1 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Here, they undergo one last division (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) to produce a pair of sibling horizontal cells and subsequently extend processes into the developing outer plexiform layer (reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]).

The entire population of transplanted cells was visualized by injection of <italic>H2B:RFP </italic>RNA into the yolk of the donor Tg(<italic>ptf1a</italic>:<italic>GFP</italic>), thus marking all transplanted nuclei with red fluorescent protein (RFP). In these transplanted embryos, many red nuclei are seen to undergo terminal division at the apical surface and then turn on Ptf1a:GFP expression subsequently (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). These cells are at various stages of their migration (see position of cells as Ptf1a:GFP turns on; arrowheads in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), but never move up to the apical surface to undergo division again (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). It was not easy to follow individual cells backwards to their last division, but we can say that the last division of any H2B:RFP-positive nuclei was observed at least 160 minutes prior to Ptf1a:GFP expression.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Ptf1a turns on in postmitotic differentiating cells</bold>.

Endogenous <italic>ptf1a </italic>RNA expression is seen in cells in the apical half of the retinal neuroepithelium (white asterisks in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> mark individual cells that show <italic>in situ </italic>signal but no Ptf1a:GFP expression). These might represent cells that have recently undergone terminal cell division at the apical surface. Ptf1a:GFP expression in these sections is found primarily in the middle of the neuroepithelium, where differentiating amacrine cells are found. Because the Ptf1a:GFP expression is maintained for longer than the transient RNA expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), it is not surprising to find that many of the Ptf1a:GFP cells that are located in the future amacrine cell layer do not express <italic>ptf1a </italic>RNA (black asterisks in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> indicate Ptf1a:GFP-positive, <italic>in situ </italic>signal-negative cells). We suggest that these cells are likely to represent the population that used to, but no longer, expresses <italic>ptf1a </italic>RNA. Overlap of the RNA <italic>in situ </italic>signal and GFP occurs, as expected if this suggestion is correct, in cells at the junction of these two regions (yellow asterisks in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> show double labelled cells). The most likely interpretation is thus that endogenous but transient <italic>ptf1a </italic>RNA expression turns on in cells apically around the time of the terminal division and is downregulated as cells migrate to their final positions, whilst the Ptf1a:GFP expression turns on in migrating cells a few hours after the RNA expression and is maintained as cells migrate to their final laminar destinations in the retina and differentiate.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>The transition from <italic>ptf1a </italic>RNA to ptf1a:GFP protein expression</bold>.

A variety of subtype-specific markers of amacrine cells were used to see if distinct populations are already present at this age. These included calretinin (which additionally labels ganglion cells in the zebrafish retina; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>), parvalbumin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5G</xref>) and Sox2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5H</xref>).

Crisp staining for GABA or glycine could only be achieved in plastic sections (in which the GFP of the Ptf1a:GFP could not be recovered), and these revealed that about half of the cells in the amacrine layer (inner half of the INL) are GABA immunopositive and about a third are glycine immunopositive (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5I, J</xref>). Horizontal (elongated somas in the outermost layer of the INL) and displaced amacrine cells (ganglion cell layer (GCL)) seem to be exclusively GABAergic (white arrowheads in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5I</xref>), as no glycine staining was observed in the outer INL or GCL (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5J</xref>).</p><p>We conclude that Ptf1a is not expressed in the excitatory cell types, (photoreceptors, bipolars and ganglion cells) or in M&#x000fc;ller cells, but is exclusively expressed in inhibitory neurons (horizontal and amacrine cells).

We therefore undertook a morphological classification of the different types of Ptf1a-expressing cells present at this early developmental stage. As <italic>ptf1a </italic>RNA is expressed transiently, there is a limited pool of Ptf1a:GFP in each precursor cell. Thus, continued frequent imaging of Ptf1a:GFP-expressing cells led to the bleaching of the GFP signal, so we decided to survey these cells at 120 hpf. Furthermore, Godinho <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] previously studied the early steps of neurite outgrowth in amacrine cells using time-lapse series in different transgenic lines. Amacrine cells migrate to the developing INL and sprout processes in random directions. Those processes that are directed towards the ganglion cells are stabilized and arborise laterally in the forming inner plexiform layer (IPL) in either 'on' or 'off' sublaminas, suggesting that initial stages of amacrine subtype specificity are already initiated by this stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>Prox1 labelling revealed that Ptf1a:GFP is expressed in all horizontal cells and whilst different morphologies of Ptf1a:GFP-expressing horizontal cells were encountered in this study, these have recently already been characterized in great detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Our sample allowed for a vertical view of cells only (not a wholemount view) and horizontal cells with different sized somas with and without axons were seen (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>), but without the more informative wholemount view revealing patterns of dendritic tips, these cells could not be effectively classified here.</p><p>Since Ptf1a:GFP labels the entire inner half of the INL (amacrine cell layer), we could use it to determine the subtypes of amacrine cells (the only type of retinal neuron in the zebrafish whose subtype variety has not yet been described extensively) that arise from Ptf1a-expressing progenitors at 120 hpf. At least 25 to 30 amacrine cells have been described in other adult vertebrate retinas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and the large variety reflects the important function these interneurons play in the different parallel visual circuits in the retina. A few morphological amacrine cell types have been described previously in the adult zebrafish retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and we asked if these and possibly additional types would be found in the 120-hpf zebrafish retinas. Previous data show that neuritic outgrowth of amacrine cells stabilises by 70 to 73 hpf and lamination and mature synapses are also evident by this stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Similarly, visual, electroretinogram and optokinetic reflex responses can be recorded around this time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. This suggests that subtypes of cells have established appropriate connectivity even by 3 or 4 days post-fertilization, such that functionally different subtypes are probably apparent by 120 hpf.</p><p>Time-lapse analyses of 120-hpf amacrine cells were performed to see how stable neuritic arbors are at this stage. Individual cells were obtained by injecting <italic>ptf1a</italic>:<italic>GFP </italic>DNA construct into the cap cells of a one- or two-cell stage embryo, which results in a mosaic expression pattern. Stacks of images were taken through retinas of live wholemount embryos at 120 hpf. The cells shown were extremely stable, and some of the detailed branches seemed to remain unchanged for up to 24 hours (white arrowheads in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), in contrast to the highly dynamic branches around 60 hpf, which have been shown previously to change within 20 minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Ptf1a:GFP amacrine cells at 120 hpf have stable neurite arbors</bold>.

Amacrine cells in mammals have been further subdivided into narrow-, medium- and wide-field classes according to the width (presumed equivalent to the diameter) of the neurite arbors. Cells with large neurite arbors sample across large areas of the visual field and can thus modulate circuitry at different locations, which might be important, for example, for directionally selective behaviour, whereas narrow-field amacrine cells often provide modulation between different circuits (at different stratification levels) within the same receptive field and can thus function in linking OFF and ON circuits, as is the case for the AII amacrine cell in the rod pathway.</p><p>In some species, the width of neuritic arbors of amacrine cells naturally form separate groups, supporting the notion that cell sizes are not random [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Because of the much smaller size and difference in morphology of amacrine cells in the zebrafish at this age (120 hpf), the parameters could not simply be rescaled (by normalising to IPL depth or visual angle). Instead, our sample set was analysed for naturally occurring cutoffs in neuritic arbor width. Thus, cells were first grouped based on stratification depth, stratification breadth and morphological features of the processes (branching pattern, varicose or smooth). Within each of these groups, individual cells were ranked by neurite width and we looked for large breaks within the sizes to see if cells were part of a continuum of sizes or were perhaps multiple types. Such breaks (about 10 &#x003bc;m) were indeed observed at cell widths of 25 and 40 &#x003bc;m. Thus, narrow-field cells were defined as cells with arbor widths of up to 25 &#x003bc;m, medium-field cells as cells with arbor widths between 25 and 40 &#x003bc;m and wide-field cells as cells with arbor widths larger than 40 &#x003bc;m. Some types with the same stratification pattern fell into two of the categories by size, whereas others only occurred in one of these size-defined categories. Whilst this provides some confidence in the classification scheme presented here, we emphasise that without physiological studies, we cannot confirm any functional meaning behind these subdivisions.</p><p>Narrow-field amacrine cell types (15 types) were found relatively frequently (78% of all cells; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) and came in mono- or multi-stratified varieties with distinct neurite morphologies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). Many of the subtypes had somas that were located in the INL layer closest to the IPL, but other types had somas with variable positions within the depth of the INL. The arbors of medium-field (five types) and wide-field (eight types) amacrine cells were much simpler (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>), being primarily mono-stratified (or multi-stratified within the same half of the IPL). Larger cells tended to have their somas located in the centre of the INL closest to the bipolar cell layers.</p><p>Neurites of most amacrine cells with somas in the INL stratified in the outer half of the IPL, whereas most of the neurites from displaced amacrine cells with somas in the ganglion cell layer stratified in the inner half of the IPL (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). Whilst displaced amacrine cells generally follow this trend in other species, INL amacrine cells often stratify throughout both sublaminas (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]).</p><p>Because some immunohistochemical markers for subtypes of amacrine cells seemed to label somas within a particular layer in the INL, the position of the soma (either closest to the IPL, closest to the outer bipolar half of the INL or in-between) was also noted. Some types had very characteristic locations of somas and are indicated by black somas in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, whilst other types had somas in various layers (grey somas in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>), which suggests either that different types were grouped together or that soma position is not a cell type-specific feature. Soma size varied within subtypes and did not show greater variance between groups. On average, zebrafish amacrine somas at 120 hpf have a minor diameter (generally the width of the soma) of 5.14 &#x003bc;m and a major diameter (length of soma) of 7.1 &#x003bc;m.</p><p>In sum, 28 different subtypes of amacrine cells were discovered (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). Of these, 25 had somas in the INL and 3 types had somas displaced to the GCL. Narrow-field cells came in 15 subtypes, including all 3 displaced amacrine cells; 5 subtypes were medium-field, and 8 subtypes were wide-field. Additionally, two cells were found with morphologies that did not fit into any of these 28 subtypes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). The fact that these isolated examples were found (which were not included in the classified types, each of which is represented by two or more examples) suggests that rarer subtypes might have been missed in this sample. We used a binomial statistics test that predicts that, at the 5% confidence level, our sample probably contains all types that occur at a frequency greater than 1.7%, but that rarer types might have been missed.</p><fig position="float" id="F10"><label>Figure 10</label><caption><p><bold>Unclassified amacrine cells</bold>.

The <italic>ptf1a </italic>RNA is turned on very transiently in cells around or just after the time of their final apical mitosis, but is downregulated as these cells migrate to their final laminar position. Based on the Ptf1a:GFP reporter expression, the Ptf1a protein is probably expressed hours after the terminal division, as cells migrate. <italic>Ptf1a </italic>RNA expression turns off as or before migrating cells reach the target layer and new Ptf1a protein can thus no longer be made in these differentiating cells. We confirm the inhibitory cell fate of Ptf1a-expressing precursors as they account for the great majority, if not all, of the amacrine and horizontal cells and no other neuronal or glial cell type in the retina. Interestingly, subtype-specific markers are already expressed in 120-hpf embryos. That these neurons immediately differentiated into specific subtypes is further confirmed by our morphometric analysis of 28 amacrine cell subtypes in the zebrafish. Our results are combined with previous studies to summarise the developmental stages of Ptf1a-expressing retinal neurons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F11"><label>Figure 11</label><caption><p><bold>The developmental progression of Ptf1a-expressing horizontal and amacrine cells in the retina</bold>. Results used to draw this schematic come from this study and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Beginning at 35 hpf, some multipotent progenitors undergo their terminal division and migrate towards their final laminar position (unconstrained mode) over the next 3 to 6 hours. During this migration, Ptf1a:GFP expression is turned on. Once settled at their correct position, processes start extending towards the developing IPL (basally for amacrine cells with somas in the INL, apically for amacrine cells that will be displaced to the ganglion cell layer). Some of these Ptf1a:GFP-expressing cells migrate back apically, reach their final layer, undergo a last division as committed horizontal progenitors and subsequently differentiate as horizontal cells. Processes of differentiating amacrine cells in the INL start extending laterally in the IPL either in the outer or inner half. By 120 hpf, horizontal and amacrine cell types have differentiated and 28 different subtypes of amacrine cells can be distinguished. AC, amacrine cell; GCL, ganglion cell layer; HC, horizontal cell; hpf, hours postfertilization; INBL, inner neuroblastic layer; INL, inner nuclear layer; IPL, inner plexiform layer; ONBL, outer neuroblastic layer; ONL, outer nuclear layer; OPL, outer plexiform layer.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1749-8104-4-34-11"/></fig><p>Ptf1a:GFP is expressed after the last division of multipotent progenitor cells (of pseudostratified undifferentiated morphology), although committed horizontal cell precursors (but not amacrine cells) do undergo an additional division in the outer neuroblastic layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. These data are consistent with those in mouse showing that no Ptf1a-expressing cells incorporated bromodeoxyuridine during a 1- or 2-hour pulse prior to sacrifice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Some examples that we were able to follow in four-dimensional movies show that Ptf1a:GFP turns on hours after the last division in cells between the apical side (where terminal mitosis occurs) and the centre of the neuroepithelium (where the future amacrine cell layer is located). The delay of up to 5 hours between the beginning of the RNA <italic>in situ </italic>signal and Ptf1a:GFP onset matches the delay of hours between individual cells expressing GFP after terminal division, as judged by the position of cells (along the apical-basal dimension) and subsequent migration of cells that turn on GFP, combined with the 3 to 6 hours between division and migration to the final layer observed previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. These findings suggest that transcription of <italic>ptf1a </italic>is initiated around the time of terminal mitosis, but the protein and its effect on other genes as a transcription factor occurs during migration to the correct laminar position.</p><p>Ptf1a:GFP is exclusively expressed in the two inhibitory neuron types (horizontal and amacrine cells), but not in any of the excitatory neuron types of the retina, nor the glial cells, consistent with reports in other species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Interestingly, amacrine subtype-specific markers (calretinin, parvalbumin and Sox2) also co-labelled Ptf1a:GFP cells, suggesting that different subtypes of amacrine cells arising from the Ptf1a lineage are already established at this time. Unlike other central nervous system regions, in which Ptf1a plays a specific role in the generation of inhibitory GABAergic cell types, in the retina, both GABAergic (horizontal and some subtypes of amacrine cells, including the displaced types) and glycinergic cells (some amacrine cell subtypes) arise from Ptf1a:GFP cells, suggesting that the different neurotransmitter identity of these inhibitory neurons is determined by other factors, which have been suggested to act much earlier in progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>Among mammalian species in which amacrine cells have been classified to date, the estimated number of subtypes of amacrine cells ranges between 25 and 30 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], while in the roach, a related teleost fish, they have been suggested to consist of as many as 43 major types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Here we show that a similar variety of amacrine cell subtypes had already developed by 120 hpf. Anatomical features (for example, lamination, remodelling and synapses) are present and the visual system is functional by 3 days post-fertilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], and immunohistochemical subtype markers already label distinct subpopulations at this time. Indeed, our morphological classification scheme identified 28 different subtypes, comparable to the variety encountered in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The stratification of cell types identified in this study was relatively simple (many monostratified types and simple branching patterns compared to, for example, fountain and recurving and AII cells) compared to those described in mammals and might reflect the relatively simple visual circuitry of the embryonic zebrafish retina.</p><p>Other trends described in different species also hold true for the zebrafish classification scheme presented here. Firstly, wide-field amacrine cells tend to be monostratified whilst narrow-field amacrine cell types often stratify more broadly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], and may form a modulating link between different synaptic circuits analysing the same visual area in space. However, direct homologies cannot be drawn between most of the zebrafish amacrine cell types described here and the described mammalian amacrine cell subtypes. This does not come as a surprise, given that some of the other classified cell types, such as the bipolar cells, also differ vastly in their morphologies in zebrafish compared to mammalian retinas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Secondly, the three displaced amacrine cell types described here all have neurites that stratify within the inner half of the IPL, which is also commonly observed in displaced amacrine cells of other species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. In mammals, narrow-field amacrine cells tend to be glycinergic and larger amacrine cells tend to be GABAergic, but this trend does not hold true for other vertebrates such as fish (reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]). Whilst we could not determine the main neurotransmitter identity for specific types of amacrine cells, displaced amacrine cells in zebrafish seem to be GABAergic (since antibodies to GABA labelled somas in the GCL, whereas antibodies to glycine did not), as previously described in different vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Interestingly, the three types of zebrafish displaced amacrine cells (GABAergic) described here were all of narrow-field morphology, suggesting a difference between the neurotransmitter identity of narrow versus wide-field amacrine cells in different species. Lastly, many of the smaller types occurred at a higher frequency than the types with larger neurite arbors, which is consistent with the inherent idea that cells of a given subtype must be able to cover the entire retina (thus, cells with smaller arbors occur at a higher density and would be found more frequent if labelled randomly) in order to carry out their specific function across the visual field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>].</p><p>Similar morphologies of each of the seven amacrine cell types (previously reported in adult zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]) were found in this sample (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). One previously described type, Aon-4, matches one of our unclassified cells (narrow-field smooth S3 to S5, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>); this was only encountered once in this sample set, suggesting that cells with this morphology might indeed be a true subtype. However, to be conservative, we did not feel confident to make a class with features only found in one example, in case it represents a rare developmental abnormality. Whilst some types had only two examples, it is far less likely that different cells had developmental errors leading to the same morphology. Secondly, all of the types for which only two examples were encountered were of the medium- or wide-field morphology and some had processes spanning a quarter of the retina, such that a low frequency might relate to a lower density required for these types as discussed above. Indeed, some mammalian subtypes were encountered at similarly low frequencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>], so such low occurrences come as no large surprise.</p><p>The cell types that are matched morphologically between the current and the previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] are much larger in the adult zebrafish, but the main features, such as stratification and relative width (compared to IPL size, for example), match well. This suggests that eye growth is achieved by not only addition of new cells from the ciliary margin, but also growth of individual cells. The bistratified Aon-s1/s5 described by Connaughton and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] does not seem to have a large neurite arbor, as our equivalent type did in the embryonic retina, indicating that some cell types might grow more in size than others. The descriptive summary of a total of 27 adult zebrafish amacrine cells presented in an abstract by the same group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>] also matches the types described here.</p><p>Some immunohistochemical subtype-specific markers label types with somas located at a particular depth of the INL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>], suggesting that somal location might be a subtype-specific criterion. In some classified types the somas were consistently located in the same INL layer (for example, nearest to the IPL or furthest away from the IPL adjacent to the bipolar somas), with wide-field cells having somas nearest to the bipolar somas. Other types had randomly placed somas, which could mean that different groups of amacrine cells were combined together or that somal positioning is somewhat random in these subtypes (perhaps related to the order of development) and may not carry subtype-specific significance. Not surprisingly, single or combinations of cell types classified in this study could account for the immunohistochemical staining pattern obtained by the vast majority of amacrine-specific antibodies found by Yazulla and Studholme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>].</p><p>The main point of the classification at this age is to reveal the diversity of amacrine cell types within the embryonic zebrafish retina that can be used as a basis for investigating how different functional manipulations of genes and/or external signals affect the different cell types already present at this early age. Subtypes that differ in very subtle features might have been erroneously grouped together here; however, the interesting finding is that by analysing relatively simple unambiguous features (mainly stratification depth and width), we can already distinguish dozens of different types. A more detailed description of the morphology of individual amacrine cell types (such as branching patterns or density, degree of ellipticity of neurite arbor) cannot be carried out with this marker, due to the decrease of stable GFP protein by 120 hpf (as the RNA expression ceases by 65 hpf). By then, the signal strength was not sufficiently bright to perform more extensive three-dimensional reconstructions as has been done in other classification studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Ptf1a is expressed transiently in postmitotic precursors that differentiate into all the inhibitory cells in the zebrafish retina, suggesting that this aspect of fate determination might occur in a critical temporal window during the early development of individual neurons that then differentiate into different horizontal and amacrine cell subtypes. Cell type identity can be determined by soma location, stratification of processes and staining patterns with immunohistochemical markers, which reveals the presence of distinct subtypes. It will be interesting in future to examine if and how Ptf1a interacts with other factors to determine the identity of these subtypes and whether these subtypes come from lineage restricted progenitors such that certain subtypes of inhibitory cells (that is, glycinergic versus GABAergic) tend to have clonal relationships with specific excitatory cell types in the retina. We hope our classification schemes at this early developmental stage of the zebrafish will aid future studies in discovering other genes that influence specific subtypes of amacrine cells by, for example, comparing the different subtypes present in normal and mutant animals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Zebrafish were maintained and bred at 26.5&#x000b0;C.

As immunohistochemical markers for subtypes or groups of subtypes of amacrine cells seem to label somas within a particular layer of the INL, the position of amacrine cells was recorded. The amacrine layer (inner half of the INL) usually contains three to four layers of somas; thus, individual cells were assigned as having somas closest to the IPL, closest to the bipolar half of the INL or in the in-between layer. The zebrafish retina also contains displaced amacrine cells with somas in the ganglion cell layer and these always had their somas in the layer immediately adjacent to the IPL.</p><p>Measurements were performed using the ImageJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>] line length measurement tool by focusing back and forth through the stacks of images. The minor and major diameters of somas were measured. The most distinguishing feature among groups is the morphology and stratification pattern of the neurites.</p><p>Cells were included only if they were completely separable from neighbouring cells in three-dimensional space. Some cells would seem intermingled in projections of stacks, but were isolated in focal depth and could be unambiguously separated in the individual images, which were used during analysis. The stratification depth (outermost and innermost neurite) was measured as a percentage of IPL depth (0% being the border with the INL, 100% being the border with the GCL) with at least two measurements taken at the extreme ends for wide-field amacrine cells. For classification and descriptive purposes the IPL was subdivided into six equal sublaminas (S1 to S3 represent the outer/OFF half and S4 to S6 represent the inner/ON half of the IPL) as used previously in zebrafish retinal neuron classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Cells with processes contained within a single sublamina were classified as monostratified, others as multistratified confined either to the OFF sublamina (S1 to S3), ON sublamina (S4 to S5) or both.</p><p>Amacrine cells have been classically subdivided into narrow-field, medium-field or wide-field classes, based on the extent of their neurites. Thus, the width of the neurites was measured and cells were classified accordingly. The process of choosing the cutoff size between groups is explained in the results section.</p><p>Lastly, morphological features of the neurites were used as a final classification parameter.
