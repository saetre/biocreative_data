PPAR&#x003b1; is a ligand activated nuclear receptor, which is known to be activated by free fatty acids and their derivatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Besides fatty acids, several synthetic compounds are available that specifically activate PPAR&#x003b1;, including hypolipidemic drugs, such as fibrates and pirinixic acid (WY14,643) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Synthetic PPAR&#x003b1; agonists mimic effects of dietary unsaturated fatty acids on hepatic gene expression in terms of regulation of target genes and molecular mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Activation of PPAR&#x003b1; with WY14,643 in mice showed that the main function of PPAR&#x003b1; in liver is the regulation of lipid metabolism, and more specifically fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. PPAR&#x003b1; was also found to be involved in regulation of amino acid metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In humans, the function of PPAR&#x003b1; is examined less thoroughly, because functional studies are more complicated. There is no human genetic disease linked to a dysfunctional <italic>PPAR&#x003b1; </italic>gene and tissue sampling is often not feasible in healthy volunteers. Blood is one of the few tissues which is readily available in healthy humans. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are relatively easily obtainable by isolation from blood. These cells consist of lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages and it is known that PPAR&#x003b1; is expressed in these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The use of PBMCs has proven to be highly robust in distinguishing a disease state from healthy state, by studying gene expression profiles of these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Recently, we showed that PBMC gene expression profiles of healthy volunteers can also reflect changes between 24 and 48 hours fasting, when plasma fatty acid concentrations are elevated. In addition, we showed that PPAR&#x003b1; seems to have a functional role in human PBMC during fasting as several of the genes changed upon fasting were also changed upon incubation of PBMC with the specific PPAR&#x003b1; agonist WY14,643 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, the extent of the role of PPAR&#x003b1; in human PBMCs remains unclear. Therefore, we tried to elucidate the function of PPAR&#x003b1; in human PBMCs by whole genome microarray analysis of the PBMCs incubated with the specific PPAR&#x003b1; ligand WY14,643. Furthermore, to examine the complete role of PPAR&#x003b1; within PBMCs during fasting, we compared microarray analysis of PBMCs activated with WY14,643, with microarray analysis of PBMCs during 24 hours of fasting.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>PPAR&#x003b1; regulation in PBMCs after incubation with WY14,643</title><p>Incubation of PBMC with the specific PPAR&#x003b1; ligand WY14,643 for 12 hours resulted in a differential expression of 1,373 of the 13,080 genes expressed in the PBMCs, indicating a PPAR&#x003b1;-dependent regulation of 10.5% of the genes expressed in PBMC (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). More than half of these genes (56%) were up-regulated. Pathway analysis of the genes changed upon activation of PPAR&#x003b1; with WY14,643, showed a marked increase in fatty acid metabolism, primarily in &#x003b2;-oxidation, and a decrease in several amino acid metabolism pathways (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Gene selection procedure after microarray analysis of WY14,643 incubated PBMCs</bold>.

Of these genes, 75 were up-regulated and 31 were down-regulated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> shows the responses to activation of PPAR&#x003b1; for each person by illustrating the changes in gene expression of these 106 genes per individual. For several genes a clear variation in response upon PPAR&#x003b1; activation between individuals is present. Donor B and, especially, donor E show an obvious distinction from the other donors. However, no difference could be found in the expression of <italic>PPAR&#x003b1; </italic>between the donors at basal level, and also after incubation with WY14,643 no change in expression of <italic>PPAR&#x003b1; </italic>was observed (data not shown). Another reason for the variation could be the difference in concentration of the PPAR&#x003b1; ligands, i.e. fatty acids, and other nutritional factors present in the blood during donation. Blood donors are commonly advised to eat before donating blood. To investigate whether the nutritional status influences changes in gene expression, we incubated PBMCs of four volunteers, obtained after a meal and after an overnight fast, with WY14,643. Using QPCR, we determined the changes in PBMC gene expression of genes that showed either a low (<italic>PDK4, SLC25A20, ACAA2</italic>) or a high variation (<italic>CPT1, ABCA1, TLR4, PPAR&#x003b3;</italic>) between donors in the microarray analyzes of the first study (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).

The main function of PPAR&#x003b1; in PBMCs appeared to be the regulation of fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation and other lipid metabolism related functions, which is in line with results from mice studies in liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and human cell line studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Moreover, the observed down-regulation of amino acid metabolism has been shown before in liver in studies comparing wild type mice to the PPAR&#x003b1; knock out mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Besides the possible roles of PPAR&#x003b1; in PBMCs, this study also demonstrates strong individual variability between the subjects in gene expression responses to activation with WY14,643. It appears that each donor has its own specific gene expression profile response to PPAR&#x003b1; activation, which results in distinct differences in the expression of certain genes after WY14,643 incubation. Beck <italic>et al</italic>. also reported differences in responsiveness in gene expression between individuals, after incubation of endothelial cells with LPS. However, endothelial cell cultures were already divided beforehand into type I or type II responders based on their LPS mediated IL8 production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In another study, incubation of cultured macrophages with oxidized low-density lipoprotein resulted in a person-specific inflammatory gene expression response that could be correlated to changes in gene expression of scavenger receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, we did not find a correlation between basal <italic>PPAR&#x003b1; </italic>expression or changes in <italic>PPAR&#x003b1; </italic>expression and the observed variation in gene expression changes. In addition, the differences observed are probably not caused by the nutritional status of the subjects at baseline, as we did not observe differences in expression changes of selected PPAR&#x003b1; target genes between the postprandial and the fasted state of PBMCs incubated with WY14,643. However, it should be noted here that only four subjects were studied. A reason for the difference in response of the donors in the first study could be genetic variation, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the <italic>PPAR&#x003b1; </italic>gene, its target genes or PPAR&#x003b1; co-factors involved in activation of gene transcription. Furthermore, epi-genetic variation such as methylation status of the PPAR&#x003b1; promoter or its target genes may have caused between-subject differences in gene expression levels. Additional studies are required to elucidate whether gene expression profiles can be clustered in different response profiles, simplifying the identification of factors responsible for these individual responses. With respect to personalized nutrition these individual responses are of great interest as it can be expected that nutrients such as fatty acids can induce similar variations in response as WY14,643, which in the end might lead to personalized dietary advice.</p><p>The PPRE analyzes of the genes changed showed that approximately 8% of the genes changed after incubation with the PPAR&#x003b1; ligand WY14,643 contained a predicted or reported PPRE, using the list as described by Lemay et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, Lemay <italic>et al</italic>. report that they tolerate a low false-positive, and a high (60%) false-negative rate, suggesting that their list of PPREs is far from complete. Our additional transcription factor binding site analysis increase the number of genes that contain a PPRE to a total of 17% of the genes changed. A network search showed that, besides PPAR, five other transcription factors were involved in direct regulation of at least 10 out of the 1,373 changed genes. Interestingly, all these transcription factors are known to be affected by PPAR&#x003b1; activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Transcription factor binding site analysis revealed that, out of the changed genes that did not contain a PPRE, 27% contained a binding site for at least one of the other five selected transcription factors These genes appear not to be regulated by PPAR&#x003b1; directly, but indirectly, via these other transcription factors, a mechanism which has been suggested before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The role of PPAR&#x003b1; in this respect seems to be extensively larger than expected based on the outcome of PPRE analyzes alone.</p><p>An interesting observation is the decrease in expression level of genes containing a PPRE. Activation of PPAR&#x003b1; by a ligand may result in a negative regulation of genes by means of transrepression as has been reported in several studies and reviewed by Ricote and Glass (2007) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. This transrepression, however, does not require the presence of PPREs in the promoter regions of the target genes. Apparently, negative regulation of these genes, regardless of its mechanism, is stronger than the transcriptional activation of PPAR&#x003b1;. Previously, Degenhardt et al. (2006) also showed down regulation of an insulin-like growth factor-binding protein gene (IGFBP-6) that contained a predicted PPRE, in response to the presence of a PPAR&#x003b1; ligand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>The overlap in gene expression profiles between fasting and incubation with WY14,643 shows that PPAR&#x003b1; in PBMCs carries out a substantial part of its function during fasting, when concentrations of its natural ligands, free fatty acids, are elevated in the blood. The main role of PPAR&#x003b1; in PBMCs during fasting is fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation, most likely to cope with the reduced availability of glucose for utilization in energy production and the increase of fatty acids.</p><p>Direct comparison between the two array analysis should be examined with care, since the two studies are distinctly different in set-up. The fasting intervention study was conducted in vivo, while the WY14,643 incubation experiments were performed ex vivo. Moreover, fasting involves many more changes in physiology, apart from the before-mentioned increase in plasma free fatty acids, including changes in plasma insulin, glucose and leptin concentrations. The PPAR&#x003b1; ligand incubations were set-up to elucidate the specific effects of activation of one nuclear factor, controlling for all other parameters.</p><p>Summarizing, this study gives us valuable information on the extent of the effect of PPAR&#x003b1; activation, during fasting and in general, on human PBMC gene expression. It also shows that persons respond differently to PPAR&#x003b1; activation with respect to their gene expression changes, indicating a possible person-specific nutrient response. It seems justified to conclude that human PBMCs are a suitable model to study changes in PPAR&#x003b1; activation. This opens up the possibilities for more specific PPAR&#x003b1; signaling studies in healthy humans using these relatively easily obtainable blood cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>PBMC incubation</title><p>PBMCs from six healthy Caucasian male blood donors, aged between 30 and 48 yr, were isolated directly after arrival of the buffy coat (max. 8 hours after donation) by Ficol-paque Plus density gradient centrifugation (Amersham Biosciences, Roosendaal, the Netherlands).

Application of this annotation procedure on the previously published data from the 48 hours fasting study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] resulted in a difference in number of genes expressed and changed as compared to the previously used annotation method as this analysis was performed on probe set level.</p><p>Expression values were calculated using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) method. RMA signal value estimates are based on a robust average of background corrected perfect match intensities and normalization was performed using quantile normalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Only genes with normalized signals higher then 20 on at least two out of twelve arrays were defined as expressed and selected for further analysis. Genes were defined as 'changed' when comparison of the normalized signal intensities showed a p-value lower then 0.05 in a two-tailed paired t test with Bayesian correction (Limma) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Pathway analysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis 5.5 (Ingenuity Systems). Array data have been submitted to the Gene Expression Omnibus, accession number GSE11289.</p></sec><sec><title>PPRE incidence</title><p>To indicated which of the genes changed upon activation of PPAR&#x003b1; had a predicted or reported peroxisome proliferator response element (PPRE), we used information from Lemay <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This paper recently reported predicted PPRE on a genome wide scale, using computational genomics and also summarized known PPRE. Using Genomatix software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], network analysis was performed on 1,373 genes in BiblioSphere, from which transcription factors were selected that were directly linked to more than 10 genes from our list of changed genes. Subsequent transcription factor binding site analysis identified transcription factor binding sites in the promoters of our genes of interest that were cocited at least once in an abstract with these transcription factors. Heat maps were created by using Spotfire software.</p></sec><sec><title>cDNA synthesis and quantitative real-time PCR</title><p>RNA was reverse transcribed with the use of the cDNA synthesis kit (Promega, Leiden, the Netherlands). Standard quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) was performed with the use of Platinum Taq DNA polymerase and SYBR Green on an iCycler PCR machine (Bio-Rad Laboratories BV) and duplicated at least twice. Primer sequences used in the PCRs were chosen based on the sequences available in PRIMERBANK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Q-PCR data were normalized by measuring cycle threshold ratios between candidate genes and a housekeeping gene, human acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein PO, which was shown to be consistent within PBMCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MB collected and analyzed the data and wrote the manuscript.
