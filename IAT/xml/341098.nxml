By comparison of the genomic sequence and the delta-crystallin cDNA sequence previously determined, we have identified exon sequences in the genomic sequence. Thus, the presence of 17 exons and 16 introns in the gene has been clarified. The delta-crystallin polypeptide deduced from the exon sequences consists of 465 amino acids which is larger, by 19 amino acid residues, than the polypeptide deduced from the cDNA sequence previously reported. Re-examination of the cDNA sequence using the same cDNA clone previously used shows that the present exon sequences are correct and the molecular weight of the deduced delta-crystallin polypeptide is 50,615 daltons instead of the previously reported value of 48,447 daltons. In addition, some structural features of the delta-crystallin gene including putative expression signals are discussed.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00299-0167.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1593"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00299-0168.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1594"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00299-0169.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1595"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00299-0170.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1596"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00299-0171.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1597"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00299-0172.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1598"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00299-0173.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1599"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00299-0174.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1600"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00299-0175.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1601"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00299-0176.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1602"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00299-0177.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1603"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00299-0178.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1604"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00299-0179.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1605"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00299-0180.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1606"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
