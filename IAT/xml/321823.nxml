Sequence and hybridization analysis of these cDNAs as well as expression in E. coli provided evidence that they encode proteins which have the characteristics of IFN type I but which are sufficiently diverged in sequence from both IFN-alpha s and IFN-beta to suggest that they are representatives of a new and distinct class of interferons named interferon-omega. Hybridization of these sequences to genomic DNA reveals that this class contains at least four members.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00307-0139-a" xlink:role="4744"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00307-0134.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4739"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00307-0135.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4740"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00307-0136.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4741"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00307-0137.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4742"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00307-0138.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4743"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00307-0139.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4744"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00307-0140.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4745"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00307-0141.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4746"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00307-0142.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4747"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00307-0143.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4748"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00307-0144.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4749"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
