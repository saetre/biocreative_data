Human UBF was shown to contain four tandem homologies to the folding domains of the HMG1 and 2 proteins and hence to belong to a previously unrecognised family of 'HMG-box' transcription factors. Here, cDNA clones encoding the Xenopus laevis UBF (xUBF) have been isolated and sequenced. Northern and Southern blots revealed that in tissue culture cells, xUBF is coded on a single major mRNA size species by a small number of genes. The deduced primary structure of xUBF is highly homologous with the human protein except for a central deletion which removes most of one HMG-box. This explains the major size difference between the X. laevis and human proteins and may well explain their different transcriptional specificities. It is shown that xUBF contains 5 tandemly repeated HMG-boxes and that by analogy the human protein contains 6.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00089-0090-a" xlink:role="2333"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00089-0088.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2331"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00089-0089.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2332"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00089-0090.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2333"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00089-0091.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2334"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00089-0092.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2335"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
