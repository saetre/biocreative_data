As PB2 is a relevant host-range determinant we expressed a TAP-tagged PB2 in human cells and isolated intracellular complexes. Alpha-importin was identified as a PB2-associated factor by proteomic analyses. To study the relevance of this interaction for virus replication we mutated the PB2 NLS and analysed the phenotype of mutant subunits, polymerase complexes and RNPs. While mutant PB2 proteins showed reduced nuclear accumulation, they formed polymerase complexes normally when co expressed with PB1 and PA. However, mutant RNPs generated with a viral CAT replicon showed up to hundred-fold reduced CAT accumulation. Rescue of nuclear localisation of mutant PB2 by insertion of an additional SV40 TAg-derived NLS did not revert the mutant phenotype of RNPs. Furthermore, determination of recombinant RNP accumulation in vivo indicated that PB2 NLS mutations drastically reduced virus RNA replication. These results indicate that, above and beyond its role in nuclear accumulation, PB2 interaction with &#x003b1;-importins is required for virus RNA replication. To ascertain whether PB2-&#x003b1;-importin binding could contribute to the adaptation of H5N1 avian viruses to man, their association in vivo was determined. Human alpha importin isoforms associated efficiently to PB2 protein of an H3N2 human virus but bound to diminished and variable extents to PB2 from H5N1 avian or human strains, suggesting that the function of alpha importin during RNA replication is important for the adaptation of avian viruses to the human host.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transcription and replication of influenza A virus is carried out in the nucleus of the infected cells by each of the eight ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) that constitute their genome (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003904-Elton1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003904-Palese1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>).

We found &#x003b1;-importins as PB2-associated host factors and showed that they bind efficiently to PB2 derived from a human virus but associate to a diminished and isoform-specific way to PB2 from H5N1 avian viruses. Although polymerase complex formation was not affected by mutation of PB2 NLS, RNP activity was essentially abolished. Restoring nuclear import by ectopic addition of a SV40 TAg NLS did not rescue the RNP biological activity, suggesting that PB2 interaction with &#x003b1;-importin is required for the biological activity of influenza polymerase, in addition to its role in protein transport. Furthermore, mutation of PB2 NLS abrogated the capacity of recombinant RNPs to accumulate in vivo, indicating that the interaction of importin &#x003b1; with the natural NLS in PB2 is necessary for viral RNA replication.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Importins &#x003b1; associate in vivo with the influenza polymerase PB2 subunit</title><p>To determine the human host factors that associate in vivo with the PB2 subunit of the influenza RNA polymerase we expressed a TAP-tagged version of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003904-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) by transfection of human cells and purified the intracellular complexes formed in vivo by tandem affinity chromatography as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003904-Jorba1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

These mutations were described previously on the basis of the co-crystal structure of PB2 NLS domain bound to alpha importin and progressively decreased the interaction of PB2 with the importin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003904-Tarendeau1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, a deletion mutant in which the complete NLS was eliminated was also produced &#x02013;mutant &#x00394;NLS- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003904-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). After verifying that all mutant PB2 proteins were expressed correctly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003904.s001">Fig. S1</xref>), their nuclear import in HeLa cells was tested by indirect immunofluorescence using PB2-specific antibodies. Representative images are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003904-g002">Fig. 2B</xref> and a summary of the phenotypes is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003904-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>. The results are consistent with those reported for the mutant C-terminal domain of PB2 fused to GFP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003904-Tarendeau1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> and indicate that nuclear accumulation of untagged PB2 protein is slightly affected by single-point mutations in NLS1 and more inhibited by a double mutation in NLS2. Thus, only slight PB2 cytoplasmic staining was apparent in the 737 or 738 mutants, while mutants KNRQ and 8/K had similar concentrations of PB2 in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Even mutant &#x00394;NLS showed some nuclear staining. Similar phenotypes were observed in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003904.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). The biological activity of these mutants was first tested in a RNP replication system using a CAT gene-containing viral replicon. Cells were transfected with plasmids encoding each of the polymerase subunits, the NP and the recombinant replicon. Either wt or mutant PB2-encoding plasmids were used, while PB2 plasmid was omitted as a negative control. The CAT protein accumulation was used as a measure of the combined replication-transcription activity of each recombinant RNP. The results obtained are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003904-g002">Fig. 2D</xref> and show that the NLS mutations in PB2 lead to a much stronger phenotype than that expected from the intracellular localisation of the protein. Thus, mutants 737 and 738, which show a localisation hardly distinguishable from wt PB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003904-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>), led to RNPs 2&#x02013;4 times less active than wt RNPs. On the other hand, mutants KNRQ and 8/K, which still show considerable accumulation of PB2 in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003904-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>), gave rise to RNPs 10&#x02013;100 times less active than wt. In addition, mutant &#x00394;NLS, which was not completely excluded from the nucleus, was completely inactive. These results indicated that there is a correlation between the progressive reduction in mutant PB2 domain interaction with importin alpha <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003904-Tarendeau1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> and a decrease in the activity of the mutant RNPs. However, the much stronger activity phenotype suggested that the defect in PB2 intracellular localisation is not the only cause for the reduction in mutant RNP activity and led us to test other alternatives. A na&#x000ef;ve explanation would be that the polymerase complex is not formed. Hence, we tested this possibility by cotransfection of plasmids expressing PB1, HisTEVPA and either wt or mutant PB2, and pull-down with Ni-NTA-agarose. Complex formation was ascertained by Western-blot with anti-PB2 antibodies and is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003904-g003">Fig. 3</xref>.

These facts, together with the importance of the interaction of PB2 with &#x003b1;-importins for viral replication prompted us to test whether PB2 proteins derived from viruses of different phylogenetic origins would show differential capacities for an stable association to human &#x003b1;-importins. Thus, the PB2 coding regions of A/Goose/Guandong/1/97 (H5N1), an avian strain, and those from A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) and A/Thailand/Kan1/04 (H5N1), two viruses isolated from sporadic avian influenza cases in humans, were TAP-tagged, expressed in human cells and used to pull-down &#x003b1;-importins.

It was not surprising to identify &#x003b1;-importin among the proteins associated to PB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003904-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), since a NLS has been identified at its C-terminus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003904-Mukaigawa1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> and a PB2 C-terminal domain could be co-crystallised with &#x003b1;-importin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003904-Tarendeau1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the stability of the interaction in vivo was unexpected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003904-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>) and hence the relevance of the PB2 interaction to &#x003b1;-importins for influenza virus infection was analysed by mutation. In agreement with previous data reported for NLS domain-&#x003b1;-importin interaction, mutation of the NLS resulted in defective nuclear import of mutant PB2 proteins, although none of the mutations led to exclusion of the protein from the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003904-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>) and their capacity to form polymerase complexes in vivo was not altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003904-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). In spite of proper formation of polymerase complexes, the activity of RNPs including NLS mutations in PB2 was progressively reduced, in parallel to the decrease in their ability to interact with &#x003b1;-importin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003904-Tarendeau1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, as reflected in the activity of a CAT replicon in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003904-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). Altogether, the results obtained suggested that the interaction of &#x003b1;-importins with the C-terminal NLS in PB2 might serve an additional role, distinct from its normal function for nuclear import, during influenza virus infection. A usual approach to test the relevance of a host factor in a virus infection is to down-regulate its expression by gene silencing and analyse the consequences for the replication of the virus. Such an approach would not be useful here, as down-regulation of &#x003b1;-importins would reduce nuclear accumulation of PB2 (and other cellular and viral proteins) and hence lead to indirect, non-informative phenotypes. As an alternative, we rescued the nuclear localisation of NLS PB2 mutants by insertion of an additional NLS derived from SV40 TAg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003904-g004">Figs. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003904-g005">5</xref>) and asked whether the rescued mutants would lead to the recovery of the biological activity of the RNPs in vivo. The results showed clearly that this was not the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003904-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>), indicating that indirectly driven nuclear localisation is not sufficient for RNP activity and suggesting that correct binding of &#x003b1;-importin to the <italic>bona-fide</italic> PB2 NLS is required. The correlation between (i) the import phenotype of the various mutants generated, (ii) their ability to interact in vitro with &#x003b1;-importin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003904-Tarendeau1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> and (iii) the reduced activity of the mutant-containing RNPs, makes it very unlikely that the functional defect described here is unrelated to the alterations in PB2-&#x003b1;-importin interaction. It could be argued that insertion of the SV40 TAg NLS itself impairs the activity of the RNPs but this is also unlikely since (i) it only diminishes the activity of wt RNPs by twofold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003904-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>) and (ii) insertion of any tags at PB2 C-terminus (His, TAP, GFP) did not alter the activity of RNPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003904-Area1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003904-Fodor1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>As PB2 protein is involved in the cap-RNA recognition required for cap-snatching, it might be hypothesized that interaction with &#x003b1;-importin is important for viral transcription initiation.

Indeed, the experiments reported here revealed that alteration of PB2 NLS abolishes virus RNP accumulation in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003904-g007">Fig. 7</xref>).

At least two alternative models can be put forward to explain the requirement of &#x003b1;-importin: either <italic>bona fide</italic> interaction of PB2 with &#x003b1;-importin is necessary for the proper folding of an active viral polymerase complex or it is needed for RNP replication itself. Further experimentation will be required to distinguish between both possibilities.</p><p>Our results should also be put in the perspective of the adaptation of avian influenza viruses to mammalian hosts, in particular to man.

For protein identification, the combined peptide mass fingerprint and MS/MS data search was performed using GPS Explorer&#x02122; software v3.6 (Applied Biosystems) against the NCBInr database using MASCOT 2.1 software (Matrix Science, London, UK). Search parameters were: carbamidomethyl cystein as fixed modification by the treatment with iodoacetamide, oxidized methionines as variable modification and 1 missed cleavage site allowed. Peptide and fragment mass tolerance were set to 100 ppm and &#x000b1;0.8 Da, respectively. In all protein identifications, the probability protein and peptide mowse scores were greater than the minimum score fixed as significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0003904.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Expression of wt and mutant PB2 proteins.
