Each FT-ICR ECD event was paired with a linear ion trap collision-induced dissociation (CID) event, allowing a direct comparison of the relative merits of ECD and CID for phosphopeptide identification and site localization. Linear ion trap CID was shown to be most efficient for phosphopeptide identification, whereas FT-ICR ECD was superior for localization of sites of phosphorylation. The combination of confident CID and ECD identification and confident CID and ECD localization is particularly valuable in cases where a phosphopeptide is identified just once within a phosphoproteomics experiment.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Phosphorylation is an important protein post-translational modification. Phosphoproteomics experiments have successfully identified thousands of phosphorylation sites, predominantly using CID with relatively low resolution ion trap detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>). For phosphoproteomics data to be of most use to the wider biology community, two key criteria should be met: the phosphopeptide identifications should be correct, and the sites of phosphorylation should be correctly localized. In practice it is not possible to guarantee the accuracy of identifications and site localizations; however, it is possible to include some measure of the confidence in both these results for each phosphopeptide. Database search algorithms give output such as expectation values or similar scores, which can be used to gauge the strength of an identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>). Recently algorithms have been introduced that give similar confidence scores for phosphorylation site localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>).</p><p>Electron capture dissociation (ECD)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">1</xref> is a radical-driven fragmentation technique that provides an alternative to slow heating CID fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>). In contrast to CID fragmentation, labile modifications are usually retained intact upon ECD peptide backbone cleavage. ECD has therefore been applied to the analysis of post-translationally modified proteins almost since its inception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>). ECD efficiency has improved to the point where on-line LC-MS/MS experiments are feasible; however, the amount of precursor required for such analyses remains significantly greater than for corresponding CID experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>). ECD is effectively restricted to FT-ICR mass spectrometers. Although ECD has been demonstrated in ion trap instruments, to date these demonstrations have consisted only of direct infusion of known standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>). The recently developed technique of electron transfer dissociation (ETD) has allowed similar radical fragmentation to be obtained in ion trap mass spectrometers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>). Large scale comparisons of CID and ETD have been carried out for unmodified peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>). The increase in speed and sensitivity, albeit at the expense of resolution, has also allowed ETD to be used in phosphoproteomics analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>). These studies demonstrated that ETD can efficiently identify phosphopeptides on a chromatographic time scale. Molina <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>) compared alternating CID and ETD fragmentation of the same precursors (for an unspecified number of precursors) and found that ETD gave greater peptide sequence coverage. This was assumed to result in improved phosphorylation site localization; however, neither study calculated confidence scores for site localization.</p><p>The benefits of ECD fragmentation have been demonstrated for various single phosphoproteins and simple mixtures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>); however, no large scale comparison of CID and ECD for phosphoprotein analysis has been carried out. In this context, we present a phosphoproteomics data set obtained using both CID and ECD tandem mass spectrometric techniques. Particular attention was paid to the confident localization of sites of phosphorylation within the identified phosphopeptides.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec disp-level="4"><title>Cell Culture&#x02014;</title><p>Mouse fibroblast NIH 3T3 cells were cultured at 37 &#x000b0;C, 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub> in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 m<sc>m l</sc>-glutamine (Invitrogen), 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 0.2 units/ml penicillin (Sigma), and 10&#x00025; (v/v) donor bovine serum (Invitrogen).

Equal amounts of the resulting mixture were analyzed either by DD-CID-ECD or by data-dependent CID with NL-ECD. Each analysis required &#x0223c;12 h of instrument time (11 SCX fractions; 65-min LC MS/MS). CID and ECD mass spectra acquired in each analysis were searched independently, resulting in a total of four database searches.

Neutral loss-dependent ECD ensured that ECD events were predominantly restricted to phosphorylated species (89&#x00025; of identifications), thereby increasing the time available for CID events. This resulted in an increased number of identifications in the NL-ECD experiment, both phosphorylated (1855 <italic>versus</italic> 1324 identifications) and non-phosphorylated. It should be noted that not every phosphopeptide identified by CID triggered an ECD event. Specifically 441 of the (redundant) phosphopeptides identified by CID in the NL-ECD experiment did not trigger an ECD event. 200 of these CID mass spectra were examined manually to determine why an ECD event was not triggered. The reasons, in order of significance, were as follows: combined neutral loss of phosphate and water (36&#x00025;), no dominant neutral loss (25&#x00025;), tyrosine phosphorylation (21&#x00025;), and neutral loss peak outside the five most intense peaks (but within the top 10; 17&#x00025;).</p><p>From here on, to directly compare CID and ECD performance, we will concentrate on CID/ECD paired events. 6080 CID/ECD pairs were acquired, 1892 of which resulted in phosphopeptide identification. Phosphopeptide identifications from paired events gave 796 distinct phosphopeptide identifications, <italic>i.e.</italic> 88&#x00025; of the overall total (906 distinct phosphopeptides). The difference between the larger (906) and smaller (796) number of distinct phosphopeptides corresponds to 110 distinct phosphopeptides that were identified only from CID mass spectra where no paired ECD mass spectrum was acquired. Distinct phosphopeptides are defined as those of unique peptide sequence and phosphorylation site and number, <italic>i.e.</italic> methionine oxidation variants are not counted as distinct. Phosphopeptides differing only in the site of phosphorylation are considered as distinct if both sites of phosphorylation are confidently localized (<italic>p</italic> &#x02264; 0.0126).</p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Paired CID/ECD Events Allow Internal Validation of Identifications&#x02014;</title><p>3208 paired CID/ECD events led to peptide identification (from one or both events) for a total of 4763 separate identifications.

If both CID and ECD identifications are correct, we expect agreement within each pair. In fact five pairs of 1555 do not agree (supplemental Table 2). This is well within the expected maximum number of conflicts predicted by the decoy search (19 incorrect identifications).</p><p>Three of the five conflicts are between homologous, isobaric peptides with either an amino acid order inversion or an isoleucine/leucine substitution. This observation illustrates the previously identified difficulty in confidently identifying peptides when homologous sequences exist (32).

In the case of conflict 2, isoleucine and leucine could not be distinguished as the relevant w/d ions were not observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>). In conflict 3, the CID mass spectrum showed evidence for the presence of both identified forms (supplemental Fig. 4). Manual analysis of the remaining conflicts indicated that in conflict 4 the ECD mass spectrum could better be explained by the sequence identified from the CID search, <italic>i.e.</italic> the OMSSA ECD identification was incorrect (supplemental Fig. 5<bold>)</bold>. The reason for the misidentification is that OMSSA is currently unable to consider z&#x02032; and c<sup>&#x002d9;</sup> ions (resulting from hydrogen transfer between classical ECD fragments) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>). In the final case, neither CID nor ECD identification appeared convincing (supplemental Fig. 6).</p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Phosphopeptide Identification&#x02014;</title><p><xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> shows the overlap between CID and ECD distinct phosphopeptide identifications. (See also supplemental Table 1.) The data indicate that CID was more efficient for phosphopeptide identification than ECD; however, a significant number (13&#x00025;) of identifications were by ECD only. The majority of phosphopeptides were identified by both CID and ECD (53&#x00025;) with obvious benefits for reducing false positives. CID identifications make up the final third of distinct phosphopeptides identified (34&#x00025;). It should be noted that the comparison being made is between a CID event in the linear ion trap and an ECD event in the FT-ICR cell.</p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Site Localization of Phosphorylation&#x02014;</title><p>Phosphorylation site localization was determined using the SLoMo algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>). The SLoMo algorithm assigns a localization confidence score to each phosphopeptide. This score is analogous to the previously described AScore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>). Scores &#x0003e;19 indicate confident localizations (<italic>p</italic> &#x02264; 0.0126; SLoMo Score &#x0003d; &#x02212;10 &#x000d7; log(<italic>p</italic>)). <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> shows the distribution of SLoMo scores for CID and ECD phosphopeptide data. (See also supplemental Table 1.) In both cases the distributions appear to be bimodal with a fraction of identifications having scores of 0, <italic>i.e.</italic> no site-determining ions that distinguish between the top two possibilities were detected. This division is particularly clear for the ECD data where the higher mass accuracy of site-determining ions (12 ppm compared with 350 ppm) and the lower level of background noise ensures that in most cases if a site-determining ion is detected the phosphorylation site will be confidently localized. The higher confidence localizations from ECD data are reflected in the relative contributions of CID and ECD data to the site localization of distinct phosphopeptides (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). The higher rate of phosphopeptide backbone bond cleavage by ECD compared with CID is shown in supplemental Fig. 7. Despite contributing fewer phosphopeptide identifications (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), the ECD data contribute more confident localizations than the CID data.</p><p>As discussed above for phosphopeptide identification, when paired CID and ECD mass spectra both give confident site localization we expect the two localizations to agree. A total of 340 pairs of mass spectra (non-distinct phosphopeptides) fall into this category. Of these pairs, 336 agree (99&#x00025; of localizations), one pair disagrees in identification (one of the five cases listed in supplemental Table 2), and three pairs disagree on the site of phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table II</xref>). Although this is within the expected error rate for a SLoMo score of 19, it seems rather high given that many of the SLoMo scores are significantly greater than 19. The three conflicts shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table II</xref> were analyzed manually. This revealed evidence in two cases for co-elution of both phosphoisoforms, <italic>i.e.</italic> both localizations were correct. An example of co-elution of isobaric phosphopeptides is shown in <xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>. Co-elution of isobaric phosphopeptides will generally suppress the SLoMo localization scores. This is demonstrated by the example shown in supplemental Fig. 8 where the SLoMo score for the CID mass spectrum is only 11.7. In this example, both ECD and CID mass spectra contain clear evidence of two distinct phosphoisoforms.</p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Multiply Phosphorylated Peptides&#x02014;</title><p>ECD identified fewer multiply phosphorylated peptides than CID (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). However, more than 60&#x00025; of the multiply phosphorylated peptides identified by ECD were well localized as opposed to only 34&#x00025; of the CID identifications. The localization score applies to the entire phosphopeptide rather than individual sites of phosphorylation; therefore a score &#x0003e;19 indicates that all of the sites of phosphorylation are well localized.</p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>High Confidence Identification and Site Localization from Single Phosphopeptides&#x02014;</title><p>A total of 844 pairs of CID and ECD mass spectra both identified the same phosphopeptide. That corresponds to 434 distinct phosphopeptides or over half of the phosphopeptides identified from paired events. Given that the same sequence was identified from orthogonal CID and ECD mass spectra in separate database searches, additional confidence can be placed on these identifications. This feature is of particular significance when the phosphopeptide in question is only sequenced once from the multiple SCX fractions and NL-ECD and DD-CID-ECD experiments. 96 of the 434 phosphopeptides, nearly one-quarter, fall into this category.</p><p>Within the 844 agreeing pairs, the sites of phosphorylation from 409 pairs (including 73 pairs with only one possible localization) were unambiguously localized from both CID and ECD mass spectra. This corresponds to 235 distinct phosphopeptides or &#x0223c;30&#x00025; of the distinct phosphopeptides identified from paired events.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study we analyzed 6080 paired CID/ECD mass spectra, 1892 of which led to phosphopeptide identifications by CID, ECD, or both. This data set allowed a comparison of the relative merits of LTQ CID and FT-ICR ECD mass spectra for phosphopeptide identification and site localization. CID was shown to be more efficient in this experiment for phosphopeptide identification (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). This is likely to be related to the higher sensitivity of CID in the ion trap over ECD in the FT-ICR cell. The overall target number of charges for each ECD mass spectrum was 4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> as opposed to just 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> for CID. To accumulate these large numbers of ions for ECD in a reasonable time (4 s), the threshold to select a peak for fragmentation was set at 4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup>, which is significantly higher than the 1000&#x02013;3000 threshold routinely used in CID-only experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>). It therefore follows that all CID mass spectra will achieve the target number of ions, and the majority will be of high quality. This is indicated by the overall success rate of CID identifications: 51&#x00025; (5271 identifications from 10,285 mass spectra). This success rate is significantly higher than that from the average proteomics analysis. Additional factors that may impact the efficiency of CID <italic>versus</italic> ECD for phosphopeptide identification are the choice of trypsin as proteolytic enzyme and the database search algorithm used to assign identifications. Trypsin tends to produce abundant doubly charged peptides, which have been shown to be suboptimal for ETD fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>). All the major search engines (Mascot, Sequest, OMSSA, X!Tandem, etc.) were designed for CID data usually acquired using either ion traps or time-of-flight mass spectrometers. An additional complication of ECD/ETD fragmentation, highlighted by conflict 4 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table II</xref> (supplemental Fig. 5), is the potential for hydrogen rearrangement, resulting in z&#x02032; and c<sup>&#x002d9;</sup> ions (differing in mass by 1 Dalton from the conventional c and z fragments) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>). OMSSA does not consider these fragments in the database search.</p><p>Although ECD was less efficient at phosphopeptide identification, ECD mass spectra gave more confident site localization than CID mass spectra. Several factors are likely to contribute to this: the phosphoamino acid remains intact upon ECD backbone fragmentation; ECD tends to cleave a greater proportion of backbone bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>); ECD fragment intensities are more uniform than those of CID (<italic>e.g.</italic> CID gives dominant cleavages N-terminal to proline) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>); ECD mass spectra are acquired at higher mass accuracy, and therefore fragment identification is less likely to be ambiguous. The advantage of ECD over CID for site localization is particularly clear for multiply phosphorylated peptides. Multiply phosphorylated peptides present a greater analytical challenge than singly phosphorylated peptides due to both decreased ionization in the positive mode (when the number of phosphorylations exceeds the number of basic residues) and multiple neutral losses upon CID fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>). Using the NetPhos phosphorylation prediction algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>), we calculated that approximately one-fifth of tryptic peptides in the human proteome are multiply phosphorylated (supplemental text). This illustrates the limitations of using analytical techniques that are optimized for the analysis of singly phosphorylated peptides.</p><p>We also demonstrated that NL-ECD effectively restricts ECD events to phosphopeptides and therefore allows a greater number of identifications overall. The proportion of phosphopeptides selected for ECD could be increased by considering the combined neutral loss of phosphate and water or by extending the NL peak depth beyond the five most intense peaks, a finding of relevance to phosphoproteomics studies relying on NL-dependent MS<sup>3</sup> CID. However, we note that recent results suggest that MS<sup>3</sup> CID mass spectra may not be suitable for characterizing phosphorylation site localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>).</p><p>Paired spectra where both CID and ECD give identifications (and confident localization) can be used to give additional confidence in the identification (and localization). This complementarity provides greater confidence than repeated CID identifications of the same phosphopeptide (<italic>e.g.</italic> by multiple injections of the same sample) and reduces the need to look for alternative missed cleavage versions of phosphopeptides and use multiple enzymes to confirm &#x0201c;one-hit wonder&#x0201d; identifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>). The strategy of analyzing complementary CID and ECD data separately can be contrasted with that used by Zubarev and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>) where CID and ECD data are merged prior to database searching. Merging the data increases both the information available for peptide identification and the score of the resulting identification; however, the increased confidence given by two independent identifications is lost.</p><p>In conclusion, our results indicate that combined ECD and CID analysis results in high confidence phosphopeptide identifications and phosphorylation site localization. Hybrid mass spectrometers, such as the LTQ-FT used in this work, are primarily used to measure precursor ions with high mass accuracy while carrying out rapid CID (at lower resolution). We showed that there are potential advantages to using both parts of the hybrid instrument during peptide fragmentation to acquire orthogonal MS/MS data.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplemental Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="M800451-MCP200_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M800451-MCP200_1.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M800451-MCP200_2.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M800451-MCP200_3.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M800451-MCP200_4.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M800451-MCP200_5.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M800451-MCP200_6.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel" xlink:href="M800451-MCP200_Supptable1.xls"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="PMC_2" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplemental Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="M800451-MCP200v2_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M800451-MCP200v2_1.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M800451-MCP200v2_2.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M800451-MCP200v2_3.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M800451-MCP200v2_4.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M800451-MCP200v2_5.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M800451-MCP200v2_6.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel" xlink:href="M800451-MCP200v2_Suppl_table_1.xls"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal">Ficarro, S.
