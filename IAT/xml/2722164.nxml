Polymorphisms in the Ro52 gene have been linked to these autoimmune conditions, but the molecular mechanism by which Ro52 may promote development of systemic autoimmune diseases has not been explored. To address this issue, we generated Ro52-null mice (Ro52<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>), which appear phenotypically normal if left unmanipulated. However, Ro52<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice develop severe dermatitis extending from the site of tissue injury induced by ear tags. The affected mice further develop several signs of systemic lupus with hypergammaglobulinemia, autoantibodies to DNA, proteinuria, and kidney pathology. Ro52, which was recently identified as an E3 ligase, mediates ubiquitination of several members of the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family, and the Ro52-deficient mice have an enhanced production of proinflammatory cytokines that are regulated by the IRF transcription factors, including cytokines involved in the Th17 pathway (interleukin [IL] 6, IL-12/IL-23p40, and IL-17). Loss of IL-23/IL-17 by genetic deletion of IL-23/p19 in the Ro52<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice conferred protection from skin disease and systemic autoimmunity. These data reveal that the lupus-associated Ro52 protein is an important negative regulator of proinflammatory cytokine production, and they provide a mechanism by which a defective Ro52 function can lead to tissue inflammation and systemic autoimmunity through the IL-23&#x02013;Th17 pathway.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sj&#x000f6;gren's syndrome are related and partly overlapping autoimmune diseases that share several genetic and phenotypic features. SLE represents a more severe systemic autoimmune condition, but both diseases may involve multiple organs including skin, muscle, joints, and vital internal organs such as kidneys. Both disorders present with activation of type 1 IFN pathways, with increased levels of the cytokines IL-6, IL-12/IL-23p40, and TNF-&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Borchers et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ramanujam and Davidson, 2008</xref>), and both conditions have a genetic association with polymorphisms in the IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 5 gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Sigurdsson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Graham et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Nordmark et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Ro52 is a target autoantigen in several systemic autoimmune diseases, including SLE and Sj&#x000f6;gren's syndrome, and molecular characterization of Ro52 revealed that it belongs to the TRIM (Tripartite motif) family of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Reymond et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hennig et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ottosson et al., 2006</xref>). Like several members of this family, Ro52 has RING-dependent E3 ligase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Espinosa et al., 2006</xref>) and has been suggested to polyubiquitinate IRF3 and IRF8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Higgs et al., 2008</xref>). Although genetic polymorphisms in the Ro52 gene have been linked to the development of SLE and Sj&#x000f6;gren's syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Frank et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Nakken et al., 2001</xref>), it has not been addressed how Ro52 regulates cytokine production, tissue inflammation, and development of systemic autoimmunity. To investigate the molecular mechanisms that may link Ro52 to the development of systemic autoimmunity, we generated Ro52-deficient GFP-reporter mice.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Ro52 is an immune-specific gene induced by IFNs</title><p>We inserted an IRES-GFP reporter cassette into the Ro52 locus to generate Ro52-deficient mice in which the GFP expression allowed us to track Ro52-expressing cells in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A&#x02013;C</xref>). Tissue specificity of Ro52 expression has not been investigated systematically, and using GFP as a reporter for Ro52 expression, we observed that Ro52 was predominantly expressed in the lymphoid compartments of spleen, lymph node, and thymus, with little or no expression in nonimmune tissues including liver, pancreas, heart, kidney, and skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20090585/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>). Some expression was observed in endothelial cells (Fig. S1). Our findings are supported by microarray analysis, showing that Ro52 messenger RNA is predominantly expressed in lymphoid cell populations in both mice and humans (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biogps.gnf.org">http://biogps.gnf.org</ext-link>). These observations suggest that the primary function of Ro52 may be in the immune system. The vast majority of leukocytes in the bone marrow, thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, and peripheral blood expressed Ro52, as detected by GFP expression, with the highest expression in CD3<sup>+</sup> and CD11b<sup>+</sup>GR-1<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref> and not depicted). Using GFP as the reporter, we noted that, as has previously been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Rhodes et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Strandberg et al., 2008</xref>), the expression of Ro52 was induced by IFN-&#x003b3; and, to a lesser extent, by IFN-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>). Other cytokines (TGF-&#x003b2; or TNF-&#x003b1;) did not affect the expression of Ro52 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Ro52 is expressed in the immune system and induced by IFNs.</bold> (A) Targeting construct for generating Ro52<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.

These data indicate that although there are discreet signs of early activation in splenic T cells in Ro52<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, there is no apparent immune phenotype or other physical abnormalities present in naive unmanipulated Ro52-deficient mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Ro52 deficiency leads to tissue inflammation and systemic autoimmunity</title><p>Individual mice are routinely identified either by ear punching or by metallic ear tags. After ear tagging with metal clips, no visible tissue reaction, other than transient erythema and swelling, is normally observed. However, 25 wk after application of metal ear tags, &#x0003e;90% of Ro52<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice had developed a very severe and progressive dermatitis emanating from the tagged ear, which did not occur in Ro52<sup>+/+</sup> WT littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A-C</xref>). Dermatitis also developed in Ro52<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> mice but was not present in Ro52-deficient mice that had lost their ear tag.

Serum immunoglobulin analysis revealed increased IgG levels in Ro52<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice with dermatitis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>), and the affected mice also developed antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), with specificity for DNA, and autoantibodies to several lupus-associated autoantigens and other autoantigens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20090585/DC1">Fig. S4</ext-link>). Furthermore, affected mice developed kidney pathology with substantiated mesangium and intraglomerular immunoglobulin depositions, as well as proteinuria, showing impaired renal function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 F</xref>). The systemic nature of the inflammation was further supported by the development of splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy in affected mice (Fig. S4 and not depicted). Ro52<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice that were not ear tagged did not develop either dermatitis or systemic autoimmunity when observed up to 40 wk of age, suggesting that initial tissue injury induced by physical ear tagging results in uncontrolled tissue inflammation in Ro52<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and, subsequently, leads to development of systemic autoimmunity.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Ro52-deficient mice develop tissue inflammation and systemic autoimmunity.</bold> (A) Photographs of the progressive dermatitis developing spontaneously from tissue injury mediated by ear tags in Ro52-deficient mice.

SMAD4, which has structural homology to the IRF proteins, was used as a negative control in our experiments and was not ubiquitinated by Ro52 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Ro52 inhibits IRF activity and regulates proinflammatory cytokine expression.</bold> (A) Immunoblotting of immunoprecipitates from transfected 293T cells show Ro52-mediated polyubiquitination of IRF3, IRF8, and IRF5 but not SMAD4.

GAL4-IRF3&#x02013; and GAL4-IRF5&#x02013;mediated luciferase expression was diminished by the simultaneous coexpression of Ro52 as compared with an empty vector control (EV), indicating that Ro52 inhibits the activity of IRF3 and IRF5.

IRF3 and IRF5 fused to GAL4 were tested for their ability to drive luciferase expression from a 4xGAL4-luciferase reporter plasmid upon transfection into 293T cells. Cotransfection with Ro52 substantially decreased IRF3 and IRF5 transcriptional activity in response to toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 or TLR9 signaling induced by polyI:C or CpG stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). These findings indicate that a deficiency in Ro52 would lead to increased IRF activity in vivo and persistent production of cytokines induced by IRF3 and 5, such as IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b2;, and IL-12/IL-23p40. To investigate the cytokine production in Ro52<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells after TLR stimulation, the knockout cells were cultured with TLR agonists including CpG, LPS, polyI:C, and Imiquimod. The stimulation of Ro52<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> splenocytes or bone marrow&#x02013;derived macrophages resulted in increased expression of cytokines (IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b2;, IL-12/IL-23p40, and IL-23p19) compared with Ro52<sup>+/+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref> and not depicted), confirming that the loss of Ro52 indeed leads to increased expression of many proinflammatory cytokines. Together, our data show that IFNs will induce expression of Ro52 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.1F</xref>) and that Ro52, in turn, will suppress expression of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b2;, and IL-12/IL-23p40 through ubiquitination of IRF3, 5, and 8. Thus, the cellular role of the IFN-induced Ro52 is to act as a negative-feedback regulator of immune responses and inflammation by suppressing the expression of IRF-induced proinflammatory cytokines.</p></sec><sec><title>Disruption of the IL-23&#x02013;Th17 pathway inhibits tissue inflammation and systemic autoimmunity in Ro52<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice</title><p>Ro52<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice developing dermatitis and systemic autoimmunity produced IL-6 and IL-12/IL-23p40 and had increased levels of Th17 cells in the draining lymph nodes.

We therefore hypothesized that genetic disruption of the IL-23&#x02013;Th17 pathway rather than the IL-12&#x02013;IFN-&#x003b3; pathway would result in inhibition of the tissue inflammation and systemic autoimmunity in Ro52<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.

The enhanced T cell activation observed in Ro52<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was also reversed in the double knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>).

Although expressed at a steady-state level, Ro52 is further induced by IFNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Rhodes et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Strandberg et al., 2008</xref>), and our data show that Ro52 then acts to control and down-regulate the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b2;, and IL-12/IL-23p40, thus providing a negative-feedback loop by suppressing IFN-mediated immune activation. Recent studies indicate dual roles for Ro52 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kim and Ozato, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Yang et al., 2009</xref>) and indicate that this E3 ligase may act to sustain IRF3 and IRF8 stability under some conditions but may promote polyubiquitination and degradation of the same transcription factors after TLR- and IFN-mediated activation of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Higgs et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kim and Ozato, 2009</xref>). Different functions for Ro52 depending on the degree of cellular activation is consistent with our previous observations that Ro52 resides in the cytoplasm in unstimulated cells but translocates into the nucleus upon IFN stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Strandberg et al., 2008</xref>) and that Ro52-mediated ubiquitination is supported both by UbcH5 and UbcH6 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes/E2 ligases that are present in the cytoplasm and nucleus, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Espinosa et al., 2008</xref>). In Ro52<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, we observed no obvious phenotype in naive unmanipulated mice, but we did observe a severe unrelenting tissue inflammation after tissue injury, progressing into systemic autoimmunity with several lupus-like features, which was dependent on the IL-23&#x02013;IL-17 pathway, stressing the importance of Ro52 as a negative regulator of inflammatory responses. Our data begin to build an understanding of how loss or genetic deficiency of Ro52 would result in dysregulation of IFN pathways, a feature which is common to many systemic autoimmune diseases as they present clinically with an &#x0201c;IFN signature&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baechler et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ronnblom et al., 2006</xref>). The Ro52 haploinsufficient mice developed disease at the same frequency and with similar phenotypical expression as the mice that completely lacked Ro52, suggesting an important role of Ro52 in regulating immune homeostasis and that even a partial loss of function for this key regulatory protein would result in exaggerated tissue inflammation and systemic autoimmunity. From our data, one would predict that the human genetic linkage to polymorphisms in the Ro52 gene most likely relate to reduction in the level, binding, or function of Ro52 in systemic autoimmune patients.</p><p>Although the role of IL-17 and the Th17 pathway in lupus and Sj&#x000f6;gren's syndrome is only beginning to be explored, several studies implicate a role for Th17 effector cells also in these autoimmune conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Crispin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Nguyen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Sakai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Wong et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, our data suggest that loss of IL-17 also suppresses development of exaggerated skin inflammation in Ro52<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals.
