Apart from the canonical K<sub>ATP</sub>-dependent glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), there are important K<sub>ATP</sub>-independent mechanisms involving both anaplerosis and mitochondrial GTP (mtGTP). How mtGTP that is trapped within the mitochondrial matrix regulates the cytosolic calcium increases that drive GSIS remains a mystery. Here we have investigated whether the mitochondrial isoform of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK-M) is the GTPase linking hydrolysis of mtGTP made by succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS-GTP) to an anaplerotic pathway producing phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). Although cytosolic PEPCK (PEPCK-C) is absent, PEPCK-M message and protein were detected in INS-1 832/13 cells, rat islets, and mouse islets. PEPCK enzymatic activity is half that of primary hepatocytes and is localized exclusively to the mitochondria. Novel <sup>13</sup>C-labeling strategies in INS-1 832/13 cells and islets measured substantial contribution of PEPCK-M to the synthesis of PEP. As high as 30% of PEP in INS-1 832/13 cells and 41% of PEP in rat islets came from PEPCK-M. The contribution of PEPCK-M to overall PEP synthesis more than tripled with glucose stimulation. Silencing the PEPCK-M gene completely inhibited GSIS underscoring its central role in mitochondrial metabolism-mediated insulin secretion. Given that mtGTP synthesized by SCS-GTP is an indicator of TCA flux that is crucial for GSIS, PEPCK-M is a strong candidate to link mtGTP synthesis with insulin release through anaplerotic PEP cycling.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>&#x003b2;-Cells in pancreatic islets of Langerhans make and release insulin in response to changes in blood glucose levels. The mechanisms by which high concentrations of glucose stimulate insulin release from islets remain unclear. The canonical explanation for GSIS<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN3"><sup>2</sup></xref> is that glucose metabolism increases mitochondrial ATP production, thereby raising the cytosolic ATP:ADP ratio that triggers the closure of ATP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> channels. This, in turn, depolarizes the membrane and stimulates the opening of voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels with increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx promoting the exocytosis of insulin. Although K<sub>ATP</sub> channels certainly have an important role in &#x003b2;-cells, K<sub>ATP</sub>-independent signals are implicated to play a fundamental role in GSIS. In particular, &#x003b2;-cells are known to have notably elevated rates of anaplerotic flux of the carbon from glucose into the mitochondria and back out to pyruvate (pyruvate cycling) that is tightly correlated with insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>Recently, mtGTP synthesis was identified as a novel K<sub>ATP</sub>-independent mitochondrial signal for insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). mtGTP is synthesized as a product of glucose metabolism by the GTP-specific isoform of the matrix enzyme SCS. mtGTP synthetic rates are determined by the rate of TCA cycle flux as well as by the ratio of activities of the ATP-specific and GTP-specific isoforms of SCS. The mtGTP signal is trapped within the matrix of the mitochondria, suggesting that another GTPase in the matrix transmits the mtGTP signal to the cytosol. Because both mtGTP synthesis and anaplerotic flux correlate with insulin secretion, we investigated whether the GTP-dependent mitochondrial isoform of PEPCK, an enzyme that lies at the intersection of anaplerosis and mtGTP metabolism (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>), is important for GSIS.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title>Cell Culture and Transfection</title><p>INS-1 832/13 cells were cultured and siRNA-transfected, GSIS assays were performed, and islets were isolated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).

As such, [3-<sup>13</sup>C]pyruvate was used as a tracer entering distal to the irreversible PK step to label the mitochondrial OAA precursor pool of PEPCK-M and kept at a constant concentration with varying concentrations of glucose. To ensure that the [3-<sup>13</sup>C]pyruvate could contribute label to the PEP precursor pool in the face of increasing glucose concentrations, an extracellular concentration of 5 m<sc>m</sc> was applied. &#x003b2;-Cells in intact islets do not take up pyruvate but do take up glutamine, and even low glucose concentrations sufficiently increase mtGTP synthesis to prevent islet glutamine metabolism (via allosteric inhibition of glutamate dehydrogenase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).

For experiments with islets, after the incubation 100 islets per replicate were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 2000 rcf for 5 min to pellet the islets which were immediately frozen and lyophilized before resuspension in buffer A. The collected cells or islets were centrifuged to pellet bulk insoluble materials before filtration (MultiScreen BV, Millipore). The lysates were separated on a C16 5-&#x003bc;m 120 &#x0212b; 4.6 &#x000d7; 250-mm column (Acclaim&#x000ae; Polar Advantage, Dionex) before ionization for multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) analysis by LC/MS/MS (Applied Biosystems MDS SCIEX, 4000 Q-TRAP).</p><p>Each analyte was eluted isocratically in buffer A at a flow rate of 400 &#x003bc;l/min with a single gaussian-shaped peak whose retention time was confirmed with known standards. Individual MRM transition pairs (Q<sub>1</sub>/Q<sub>3</sub>) were designated for the natural abundance (M) and mass + 1 (M +1) isotopologues of each analyte (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). In addition to malate and PEP, aspartate and combined 2-phosphoglycerate/3-phosphoglycerate (2-PG/3-PG) enrichments were measured for comparison. Endogenous taurine and <italic>d</italic><sub>4</sub>-taurine were used as internal and external controls. <sup>13</sup>C incorporation into taurine did not occur under the experimental conditions nor did the absolute concentration of taurine change during the incubations. 2-PG and 3-PG were unable to be separated either chromatographically or by MRM analysis. So, for comparison with the atomic percent excess (APE) of PEP, they were treated as the same analyte for calculation of APEs because of equilibrium of both phosphoglycerate species across phosphoglycerate mutase. Phosphate was the daughter anion for both PEP and 2-PG/3-PG and sulfate for taurine as well as <italic>d</italic><sub>4</sub>-taurine and did not vary with <sup>13</sup>C incorporation. For the remaining analytes, because the daughter fragment contained two or more carbons, the M and M+1 of the daughter anions were summed. Under the conditions of these experiments, M + 2 and greater labeling were minimal. When multiple Q<sub>3</sub> daughter anions were measurable for a single parent, the one with the highest signal to noise ratio and minimal spectral overlap were chosen and coincidence of both MRM pairs was confirmed in the chromatogram. The KEGG data base of metabolites was screened for potential significant M and M+1 mono- and di-anions that might give similar MRM pairs. Each analyte was determined to have either a unique MRM pair and/or retention time.

Because PEPCK-M is compartmentalized in the mitochondrial matrix where the concentrations of substrate and products may be locally high and different from the cytosol, direct comparison of these activities <italic>ex vivo</italic> in lysates may be misleading. Thus, a labeling strategy was developed to measure PEPCK-M flux in intact cells to assess the functional contribution of PEPCK-M to metabolism.</p><p>The two primary sources of PEP synthesis are the glycolytic enolase reaction of 2-PG and the cataplerotic PEPCK reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref><italic>A</italic>). Because insulin-secreting cells lack PEPCK-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> and Refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>)), any PEPCK activity measured in &#x003b2;-cells will arise from PEPCK-M. INS-1 832/13 cells, unlike islets, have high monocarboxylate transporter activity, so <sup>13</sup>C-labeled pyruvate can be used to assess PEPCK-M flux in living cells. After entry into the mitochondria, pyruvate carboxylase (PC) can metabolize [3-<sup>13</sup>C]pyruvate into OAA that becomes racemized across carbons 2 and 3 as a consequence of rapid equilibration across fumarase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>A</italic>). Pyruvate dehydrogenase metabolism of [3-<sup>13</sup>C]pyruvate with continued TCA cycle flux will lead to a similar labeling pattern of OAA. Any labeled pyruvate that spontaneously decarboxylated to form [2-<sup>13</sup>C]acetate would similarly label OAA if incorporated into [2-<sup>13</sup>C]acetyl-CoA. Therefore, regardless of the direction of mitochondrial metabolism (PC <italic>versus</italic> pyruvate dehydrogenase), the OAA pool will be enriched equally in the 2 and 3 position during the first cycle. Because OAA and malate are in isotopologue equilibrium with each other, the <sup>13</sup>C enrichment of the more abundant and less labile malate reflects the enrichment of OAA. Thus, [3-<sup>13</sup>C]pyruvate can specifically mass-label the PEPCK precursor pool as determined by measuring the M+1 APE of malate by LC/MS/MS. As the OAA is metabolized to PEP by PEPCK, 100% of the <sup>13</sup>C label will be transferred to the respective 2 or 3 position with the loss of unlabeled CO<sub>2</sub>. The newly synthesized PEP will have the same mass isotopologue enrichment as its precursor OAA. Thus, by knowing the precursor pool enrichment of OAA (as measured by the APE of its surrogate, malate) it is possible to calculate the fractional contribution of PEPCK-M to the cellular PEP pool (&#x003a6;<sub>PEPCK-M</sub>).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>FIGURE 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Mitochondrial PEPCK makes PEP in INS-1 832/13 cells.</bold><italic>A</italic>, schematic of PEP labeling strategy.

Although K<sub>ATP</sub> channels are definitively involved in GSIS, this mechanism does not account for the entirety of the metabolic signal. Indeed, in the absence of any measurable K<sub>ATP</sub> channel activity in the islets of SUR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, glucose-induced calcium oscillations and insulin secretion are observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Investigations of K<sub>ATP</sub>-independent mechanisms of GSIS have identified important roles for both anaplerotic metabolism from high PC flux and SCS-GTP-produced mtGTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). In addition to previous reports suggesting the presence of PEPCK activity, data presented herein indicate 1) there is significant mRNA expression, immunodetectable protein, and enzyme activity of PEPCK-M but not PEPCK-C, 2) there is a substantial metabolic flux of substrate through PEPCK-M in intact cells and islets, and 3) that PEPCK-M is involved in GSIS. Given that mtGTP synthesized by SCS-GTP is an indicator of TCA flux and crucial for GSIS, PEPCK-M is a strong candidate for connecting this metabolic signal to insulin release by hydrolyzing mtGTP to make PEP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p>There are conflicting reports whether or not significant PEPCK activity exists in pancreatic islets. A similar controversy has arisen in studies of gluconeogenesis in the liver where both PEPCK isoforms are reported to varying extents. Unlike most eutherian mammals where PEPCK-M is significant compared with PEPCK-C, the prevailing opinion is that the rat has little or no detectable hepatic PEPCK-M activity. Compartmentalization of PEPCK to the cytosol and mitochondria of the rat has been compared mostly by measuring enzymatic activity either directly or indirectly in fractions of tissue homogenate with the percentage of PEPCK-M activity ranging from undetectable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), 5% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), 6% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), 10% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>),18% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), 25% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), to 50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). This approach has inherent weaknesses inasmuch as the assumption is made that enzymatic activities under the assayed condition, are representative of metabolic flux within each of these compartments in a living cell. There is no clear explanation for why there is such a wide range of ratios of mitochondrial <italic>versus</italic> cytosolic PEPCK activity. Some of the differences might be attributed to the age of the rodent (PEPCK-M is prominent early in life) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), whether they were fed or fasted (fasting or stress favors PEPCK-C since it is glucagon and glucocorticoid driven), mitochondrial isolation techniques (differences arise from hypotonic lysis, sonication, freeze thaw, detergent, and lyophilization) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), whether leakage of mitochondrial contents into cytosolic fractions was accounted for, or whether the mitochondrial activity was measured directly or as a difference between total and cytosolic. Moreover, direct comparisons of PEPCK-M and PEPCK-C enzymatic activity favor one or the other isoform based on the type of assay (whether the assay is measured as the forward reaction, reverse reaction or by CO<sub>2</sub> fixation), the pH, the counter ion (Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, or both), and different <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> of products and reactants for the different directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). A third confounding factor in these comparisons is that of competing enzyme activities. In particular when inositol nucleotides are used as a reactant, then PK becomes a concern as both islets and rat liver (compared with other species) have particularly high levels of PK, and both PK as well as PEPCK can utilize IDP in reactions with PEP to lead to either false positive or false negative activities depending on the type of assay performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).</p><p>Early reports of a PEPCK enzymatic activity were described in mouse islets with many of the same characteristics as that of PEPCK from liver (including the dissociation constants and a dependence on Mn<sup>2+</sup> but lacking &#x0201c;ferroactivator&#x0201d; or hormonal/nutrient stimulation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Later, while investigating why glyceraldehyde but not pyruvate itself stimulated insulin secretion in islets, no significant PEPCK activity in rat islets was detected despite a seemingly exhaustive analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Subsequently, as further support for the absence of PEPCK activity, the same group found no demonstrable evidence for gluconeogenesis from labeled pyruvate nor mRNA from PEPCK-C in islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Lack of monocarboxylate transporter activity in islet &#x003b2;-cells, unlike other islet cell types, later proved to be the explanation for non-responsiveness to pyruvate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Despite later reports that pancreatic islets contain PEPCK activity as well as PEPCK protein by Western blot and immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>), the prevailing conclusion remains that insulin-secreting cells do not contain substantial PEPCK activity.</p><p>Retrospectively, these discrepancies may be reconciled on the basis 1) of the presence of two distinct PEPCK gene products (mitochondrial and cytosolic), 2) that islets contain little or no PEPCK-C, and 3) the different assays variably detected the cytosolic and mitochondrial isoforms. In the two reports of observed PEPCK activity, the total soluble cellular fraction (<italic>i.e.</italic> containing both cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions) was assayed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Activity was measured in the forward direction from islets that were sonicated and dialyzed in a hypotonic buffer using ITP. NaF was added as an inhibitor to block enolase, and the addition of Mn<sup>2+</sup> led to a large stimulation of activity. When PEPCK activity was found lacking in rat islets cytosol, a &#x0201c;true&#x0201d; cytosolic fraction devoid of PEPCK-M activity was assayed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Because islets lack PEPCK-C, minimal activity was observed in this fraction. When the mitochondrial fraction was studied, intact mitochondria were added to a similar reaction mixture that contained ITP and Mg<sup>2+</sup> but with no inhibitors. The lack of activity in the mitochondrial fraction could be because either the mitochondria were still intact and reactants could not get in or contaminating mitochondrial outer membrane-associated enolase activity consumed the PEP. Mn<sup>2+</sup> or Fe<sup>2+</sup> did not further stimulate PEPCK activity, but because the combination of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>2+</sup> can blunt enzyme activity measurements and ferroactivator (later identified to be glutathione peroxidase) does not activate the mitochondrial fraction, this is not surprising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>).</p><p>Here significant PEPCK-M enzyme activity is reported in islets and INS-1 832/13 cells, comparable with the total activity found in hepatocytes. The assay to measure PEPCK activity is a modified version of Petrescu <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) where dGDP is used as nucleotide because PK cannot utilize it, rotenone is used to inhibit Complex 1, and background activity is accounted for by parallel reactions lacking HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>. In addition, NaF was added to inhibit contaminating enolase and because PK activity is so high in islets an additional inhibitor of PK activity (Phe) was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Reduction in PEPCK activity after siRNA silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>B</italic>) confirms that the activity measured is that of PEPCK-M.</p><p>PEPCK-M mRNA has previously been detected in the pancreas by Northern blotting, whereas PEPCK-C was absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Here we demonstrate by quantitative PCR that PEPCK-M and not PEPCK-C are present in INS-832/13 cells and rat islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic>). In addition, silencing PEPCK-M by two different siRNA reduces PEPCK-M message (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>A</italic>), confirming the identity of the message.</p><p>Previously, PEPCK has also been detected in islets using a rabbit polyclonal antibody by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. This antibody was raised against PEPCK protein purified from whole liver by GTP affinity chromatography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Because both PEPCK isoforms have high sequence homology, similar affinities for GTP, and the same electrophoretic mobilities, it is likely that this antibody was raised against both PEPCK-M and PEPCK-C as antigens. Furthermore, given the high sequence homology of the two isoforms, cross-reactivity might be expected. Using an isoform-specific antibody from a peptide unique to PEPCK-M, PEPCK-M was clearly identified in INS-1 832/13 cells as well as rat and mouse islets at comparable levels with those found in hepatocytes. Silencing PEPCK-M led to a reduction in the immunodetectable PEPCK-M, confirming the identity of the band on Western blot.</p><p>Although identification of PEPCK-M at the message, protein, and enzyme activity level in tissue extracts is important, demonstration of significant functional activity of the enzyme in intact cells is essential to ascribe an important cellular role of the enzyme. Novel <sup>13</sup>C labeling strategies were developed for LC/MS/MS measurement of PEPCK-M activity in intact cells and islets. This strategy allows for measurement of &#x003a6;<sub>PEPCK-M</sub>, the fractional contribution of PEPCK-M to PEP synthesis relative to glycolysis. Concordant with the assumptions made for these calculations, PEPCK-M was the only significant source of PEPCK activity (&#x003bd;<sub>PEPCK-M+1</sub> &#x0226b; &#x003bd;<sub>PEPCK-C+1</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). The theoretical contribution of reverse flux from PK (&#x003bd;<sub>PK-1</sub>) was confirmed to be negligible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Because there is not an intramitochondrial pool of 2-PG or 3-PG, the identical <sup>13</sup>C enrichment of these analytes as PEP demonstrates that the mitochondrial anion pool is small relative to and in rapid communication with the cytosolic pool of PEP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.011775/DC1">supplemental Fig. S2<italic>B</italic></ext-link>). In addition, the similarity of the enrichment pattern supports PEP<sub>mt</sub> and PEP<sub>Glyc</sub> being metabolically indistinguishable by PK. Furthermore, the identical enrichments also suggest that during glucose stimulation there is significant flux in the gluconeogenic direction beyond enolase. Such activity could lead to an underestimation of &#x003a6;<sub>PEPCK-M</sub>. It is of interest that although fructose-1,6-bisphosphosphatase expression is normally low in insulin-secreting cells, it is increased during pathological states of the islet and that overexpression of the enzyme reduces insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). It remains unclear how far in the gluconeogenic direction mitochondrial metabolites can traverse under physiological conditions.</p><p>The addition of <sup>13</sup>C-labeled substrate to islets resulted in &#x003a6;<sub>PEPCK-M</sub> as high as 41% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>), a surprisingly similar percentage compared with maximal PEPCK-M flux in pigeon liver during gluconeogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Furthermore, not only is PEPCK-M flux robust compared with glycolysis, but also it is increased further by glucose-stimulated mitochondrial metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>D</italic>). Thus, multiple lines of compelling data support a crucial physiologic role for PEPCK-M in &#x003b2;-cell metabolism.</p><p>There are no known allosteric regulators of either PEPCK isoform, which is unusual for an enzyme at the intersection of important metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). In contrast to PEPCK-M, much of the control of PEPCK-C appears to be hormonally driven at a transcriptional and translational level. Given the lack of known regulators of PEPCK-M expression, flux through this enzyme is consequently much more susceptible to vary based on product and substrate concentrations. Although, it has been proposed that mitochondrial membrane potential uptake of Mn<sup>2+</sup> might be a potential activator of PEPCK-M given 1) the 3000-fold discriminatory activity of Mn<sup>2+</sup> over Mg<sup>2+</sup> and 2) Mn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency in rats leads to decreased insulin secretion, the association remains to be demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). The <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> of PEPCK-M for HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> is an order of magnitude higher than for PEPCK-C (25 <italic>versus</italic> 2 m<sc>m</sc>), suggesting that under physiologic conditions, compared with PEPCK-C, metabolism in the direction of PEP may be even more favored for PEPCK-M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Catalysis requires two Mn<sup>2+</sup> ions, although Mg<sup>2+</sup> can substitute, and GTP is the obligate nucleotide that binds before OAA and has a slow off-rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Once GTP is bound, it has a high likelihood of progressing to product (PEP, CO<sub>2</sub>, and GDP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Whether mitochondrial OAA or mtGTP are rate-determining remains an open question, but the tight association between mtGTP synthesis and PEP production would suggest mtGTP is rate-limiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p><p>In the mitochondrial matrix PEPCK-M is uniquely positioned to integrate the SCS-derived mtGTP TCA flux signal with PC flux. Functional coordination of GTP synthesis by SCS-GTP with PEPCK-M synthesis of PEP has been shown such that at high flux rates there was nearly a 1:1 relationship between mtGTP synthesis and PEP production in isolated mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Moreover, PEP synthesis by PEPCK-M was proposed to be involved in calcium-dependent increases in gluconeogenesis whereby increases in cytosolic calcium activated the 2-OG dehydrogenase to increase net GTP synthesis by SCS-GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). The metabolic role of PEPCK-M in liver is unclear, although it may contribute to hepatic gluconeogenesis in a manner similar to PEPCK-C but may be more predisposed to using substrates preferentially favoring mitochondrial metabolism. Interestingly, although mice lacking PEPCK-C in the liver have some abnormalities in gluconeogenesis, they nevertheless maintain fasting euglycemia, and although extra-hepatic glucose synthesis may compensate, these results may also suggest an undiscovered role for PEPCK-M in gluconeogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>).</p><p>Previously it has been demonstrated that PEPCK-M synthesis of PEP in the mitochondria rapidly leads to export of PEP from such mitochondria and has a maximum matrix concentration of 11 nmol/mg of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). PEP itself first emerged as a candidate second messenger when it stimulated insulin release in a reconstituted Cod islet insulin secretion assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). The concentration of intra-islet PEP correlated with insulin secretion in response to several fuels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). PEP was later demonstrated to have the same effect on mitochondrial calcium extrusion as had been seen in other tissues, and it was proposed that PEP stimulated insulin secretion by mobilizing Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the mitochondria in an adenine nucleotide transporter-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). However, the emphasis on PEP as a second messenger waned upon the reports of K<sub>ATP</sub>-dependent insulin secretion and that PEPCK (at least PEPCK-C) was not present in islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>). Furthermore, although phenylalanine nearly doubled PEP levels, it did not increase GSIS, suggesting cytosolic PEP <italic>per se</italic> was not sufficient to augment insulin release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>). In agreement, overexpression of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content> PEPCK in the cytosol of islets actually reduced glucose-stimulated increases in insulin synthesis (secretion was not measured) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>). Thus, because total PEP concentrations may not be important for insulin release, the signal from mitochondria-generated PEP is more likely to be either via intramitochondrial allosteric effects or via the transport of PEP out of the matrix in exchange or in lieu of another metabolite. In the event where the cataplerotically synthesized PEP (via PEPCK-M from anaplerotically generated OAA and mtGTP) is transported out of the mitochondria to join the cytosolic PEP pool, a PEP cycle will, thus, be formed, coupling TCA cycle flux with PC flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p>A PEP cycle is entirely consistent with the compelling observations now from multiple laboratories that anaplerotic pyruvate cycling is an important component of the mechanism regulating GSIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>). Because of its dependence upon mtGTP, maximal PEP cycle flux is limited to TCA cycle flux through SCS-GTP, and that may explain why the best correlation of pyruvate cycling with insulin secretion included both PC and TCA flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Just how such cycling is connected to insulin secretion remains a puzzle. Several cycles have been proposed to account for the observed cycling of carbons to pyruvate including 1) the pyruvate-malate cycle, 2) the pyruvate-citrate cycle, and 3) the pyruvate-isocitrate cycle, each of which will be considered below (for review, see Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>). It is particularly important to note that at the time NMR isotopomer modeling techniques were developed to measure pyruvate cycling, malic enzyme was assumed to be the sole path back to pyruvate (<italic>i.e.</italic> PEPCK-M flux of carbons to PEP and then to pyruvate were assumed to be absent) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Thus, any estimate of pyruvate cycling by these techniques includes an indistinguishable component of PEP cycling. It will be, therefore, important in future studies to identify the individual malic enzyme and PEPCK-M contributions when considering the relationship between pyruvate cycling and insulin secretion.</p><p>The pyruvate-malate cycle involves the anaplerotic production of malate that is then converted directly to pyruvate via the cytosolic or mitochondrial isoform of malic enzyme. In these reactions mitochondrial malic enzyme reduces NAD<sup>+</sup> in the mitochondrial matrix, whereas the cytosolic form reduces NADP<sup>+</sup> in the cytosol. There remains considerable controversy about the role of malic enzyme in insulin secretion as overexpression and silencing studies in clonal INS-1 cell lines support a role for malic enzyme in insulin secretion, whereas data supporting such a role in islets is lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>). Although primary tissue is more physiologically relevant than cell lines, given the discrepancy between the observations in INS cells and islets, interpretation of the negative data from rat islets where the cytosolic isoform of malic enzyme was silenced by adenovirus must be considered with caution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>). This is especially important because only a single titer of one virus was reported <italic>versus</italic> a scrambled control short hairpin RNA with the absence of supporting functional data such as reductions in enzyme activity or diminished pyruvate cycling and NADPH levels (as had been seen in the cell lines). Given that parallel malic enzyme reactions occur in the cytosol and mitochondria as well as parallel cytosolic NADPH-generating reactions (<italic>e.g.</italic> via cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase), if the malic enzyme reaction is important, these parallel pathways could be compensatory. Similar to the pyruvate-malate cycle, the pyruvate-citrate cycle also requires malic enzyme. In this cycle, anaplerotic citrate is exported to the cytosol, and as such OAA and acetyl-CoA are delivered to the cytosol by the action of citrate lyase. For cycling to occur, the OAA that is metabolized to malate is then decarboxylated to pyruvate by cytosolic malic enzyme, leaving the acetyl-CoA for lipid synthesis pathways. Complementary results were observed in both INS-1 cells and islets where citrate lyase activity was inhibited or silenced with no diminishment of insulin secretion, suggesting a nonessential role for this cycle in GSIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>). Both the pyruvate-malate and the pyruvate-citrate cycle would be in competition with the PEP cycle for carbons from PC flux, and the maximal rate of PEP cycling would be dependent upon mtGTP production.</p><p>More recently the pyruvate-isocitrate cycle has reached some prominence as a potentially important cycle to regulate insulin secretion. In this cycle, the citrate/isocitrate flux is diverted to the cytosol via the citrate carrier (CIC), and then eventually NADPH and &#x003b1;-KG are made by the action of the cytosolic isoform of isocitrate dehydrogenase (cIDH). The &#x003b1;-KG then is either further metabolized in the cytosol or returns to the TCA cycle. Without a return to the mitochondria to enter the PEP cycle or the pyruvate-malate cycle, the carbons in this pathway cannot cycle back to pyruvate. Thus, unlike the two previously described cycles, this cycle does not involve anaplerotic pyruvate cycling but, rather, is an extra-mitochondrial loop for generation of cytosolic NADPH and/or &#x003b1;-KG that is reminiscent of the well established isocitrate-oxoglutarate shuttle for transporting mitochondrial NADPH equivalents to the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>). It is, therefore, not surprising that eliminating this extra-mitochondrial loop by silencing cIDH leads to only a &#x0223c;20% reduction in total pyruvate cycling compared with controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>). In support of the importance of this loop, silencing cIDH was accompanied by dramatically diminished GSIS in INS-1 cells and rat islets compared with a scrambled control, although GSIS did not completely correlate with the degree of mRNA suppression. Although there was a significant &#x0223c;15% decrease in NADPH/NADP<sup>+</sup> ratios when cIDH was silenced, this ratio was the same as that found during maximal GSIS, suggesting that the impaired GSIS under these conditions was not primarily because of the NADPH/NADP<sup>+</sup> ratio. Cytosolic aconitase has a dual role as an enzyme catalyzing the interconversion of citrate and isocitrate as well as a transcription factor (regulating among other things iron homeostasis) that translocates to the nucleus upon losing its Fe-S complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>). Furthermore, both citrate and isocitrate are physiologic chelators of divalent cations such as calcium and manganese. It is, therefore, possible that altering citrate and/or isocitrate fluxes and/or concentrations in the cytosol influence GSIS by a mechanism independent of the proposed cIDH mechanism. Both silencing and overexpressing the CIC transporter also provided further evidence supporting the importance of the cIDH pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>). Given that this exchange carrier can transport citrate, isocitrate, malate, and PEP, it is unclear whether the effects on GSIS are because of a pathway involving cIDH or an anaplerotic cycling pathway. Regardless, unlike the two aforementioned pyruvate cycles, the cIDH loop is independent of PEP cycling except in the case where PEP transport via the CIC is interrelated or the carbons from &#x003b1;-KG do not return to the TCA cycle.</p><p>Silencing PEPCK-M both reduces &#x003bd;<sub>PEPCK-M+1</sub> as well as blocks GSIS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). Unlike other anaplerotic pyruvate cycles that may be involved in insulin secretion, the PEP cycle presented here is unique in that it results in no net reduction of NADP<sup>+</sup> to NADPH in the cytosol. However, the PEP cycle could incorporate a cIDH loop to generate cytosolic NADPH, mtGTP, and mitochondrial PEP within a single turn of the cycle. Although intramitochondrial PEP metabolism is a possibility, given the lack of PK in the matrix, transport out of the mitochondria becomes particularly relevant to its signaling role. Mitochondrial PEP transport is carrier-dependent and occurs primarily by the CIC and the adenine nucleotide transporter (in exchange for ADP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). There may also be a PEP/pyruvate transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>). PEP regulation of both mitochondrial calcium transport and ATP/ADP exchange is well documented. The addition of PEP to mitochondria will drive calcium out of the mitochondria in a process that 1) requires an energized membrane potential, 2) is independent of ATP synthesis, 3) is a coupled exchange process that requires transport of phosphate and adenine nucleotides out of the mitochondria, and 4) occurs through the adenine nucleotide transporter (and not the CIC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>). The observation that mtGTP-dependent insulin secretion alters ATP synthesis rates as well as mitochondrial and cytosolic calcium suggests a link between mtGTP and PEPCK-M as well as insulin secretion. An advantage of this interaction would be coupling PC flux with TCA cycle flux to generate PEP in a PEP cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) that may then act as a second messenger itself, either as an allosteric modulator (<italic>e.g.</italic> ATP synthesis or calcium transport) within the mitochondrial matrix or by driving the exchange of another ion into the matrix via mitochondrial exchange transporters (<italic>e.g.</italic> the CIC or the adenine nucleotide transporter). Although it remains to be determined how mitochondrial PEP synthesis is coupled to insulin secretion, linked co-transport of other ions such as calcium or phosphate may be strong candidates.</p><p>In summary, mtGTP and anaplerosis via PC flux are essential components of GSIS that hitherto lacked a clear mechanism linking them together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Given that PC flux itself involves ATP hydrolysis without increasing electron transport, it is a poor candidate to generate an ATP signal. Similarly, mtGTP synthesis by SCS-GTP, an indicator of TCA flux, is also a potent signal for insulin secretion that leads to reduced ATP levels and ATP synthesis rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Substrate level synthesis of mtGTP by SCS-GTP can provide energy for PEP synthesis from OAA in the mitochondrial matrix by PEPCK-M and thereby link PC flux with TCA cycle flux to stimulate insulin release. Hypoglycemia would occur if the entire insulin content of islets were inappropriately released. As such, requiring simultaneous flux through both PC and the TCA cycle via a transmitochondrial PEP cycle may act as a fail-safe to prevent inappropriate insulin secretion yet allow responsiveness to glucose as the preferred stimulus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplemental Data</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="supp_284_39_26578__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="supp_M109.011775_jbc.M109.011775-1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by" id="FN1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported by United States Public Health Service Grants R01 DK-40936, R01 DK-71071, K08 DK-80142, P30 DK-45735, and P30 DK-34989 and by American Diabetes Association Grant 1-09-RA-86.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supplementary-material" id="FN2"><label><inline-graphic xlink:href="sbox.jpg"/></label><p> The on-line version of this article (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org">http://www.jbc.org</ext-link>) contains <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.011775/DC1">supplemental</ext-link> Figs. 1 and 2.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="abbreviations"><fn id="FN3"><label>2</label><p>The abbreviations used are: <def-list><def-item><term id="G1">GSIS</term><def><p>glucose-stimulated insulin secretion</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G2">OAA</term><def><p>oxaloacetic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G3">PEPCK</term><def><p>phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxykinase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G4">PEPCK-M</term><def><p>mitochondrial PEPCK</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G5">PEPCK-C</term><def><p>cytosolic</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G6">PK</term><def><p>pyruvate kinase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G7">PC</term><def><p>pyruvate carboxylase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G8">&#x003b1;-KG</term><def><p>&#x003b1;-ketoglutarate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G9">SCS</term><def><p>succinyl-CoA synthetase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G10">mtGTP</term><def><p>mitochondrial GTP</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G11">2-PG</term><def><p>2-phosphoglycerate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G12">3-PG</term><def><p>3-phosphoglycerate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G13">MRM</term><def><p>multiple reaction monitoring</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G14">CIC</term><def><p>citrate carrier</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G15">cIDH</term><def><p>cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G16">TCA</term><def><p>tricarboxylic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G17">siRNA</term><def><p>small interfering RNA</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G18">GAPDH</term><def><p>glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G19">DMEM</term><def><p>Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G20">MRM</term><def><p>multiple reaction monitoring</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G21">LC/MS/MS</term><def><p>liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G22">APE</term><def><p>atomic percent excess</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G23">ANOVA</term><def><p>analysis of variance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G24">rcf</term><def><p>relative centrifugal force.</p></def></def-item></def-list></p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank X.
