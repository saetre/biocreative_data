Whereas much is known about the nature of membrane systems in interphase, the organization and function of the mitotic membrane system are less well understood. In this study, we show that epsin, an endocytic adapter protein, regulates mitotic membrane morphology and spindle integrity in HeLa cells. Using epsin that harbors point mutations in the epsin NH2-terminal homology domain and spindle assembly assays in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> egg extracts, we show that epsin-induced membrane curvature is required for proper spindle morphogenesis, independent of its function in endocytosis during interphase. Although several other membrane-interacting proteins, including clathrin, AP2, autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia, and GRASP65, are implicated in the regulation of mitosis, whether they participate through regulation of membrane organization is unclear. Our study of epsin provides evidence that mitotic membrane organization influences spindle integrity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Much progress has been made in understanding how the microtubule (MT)-based mitotic spindle captures and segregates chromosomes into daughter cells. However, it is not known whether membrane systems play a role in facilitating spindle organization in mitosis. In interphase, membrane organization and trafficking are regulated not only by membrane deformation, fusion, fission, and tethering systems but also by the MT cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">McMahon and Gallop, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Itoh and De Camilli, 2006</xref>). Interphase membranes also regulate MT organization. For example, the interphase trans-Golgi network functions as an MT-organizing center essential for both cell polarity and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chabin-Brion et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Efimov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu et al., 2007</xref>). Such an intimate relationship between MTs and membranes in interphase suggests that the two structures could regulate each other in mitosis to facilitate proper cell division.</p><p>Consistent with this idea, the ER and Golgi undergo dramatic reorganization during mitosis, with membrane tubules and vesicles being observed both within and surrounding mitotic spindles, suggesting a function for the spindle in the partitioning of mitotic membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Waterman-Storer et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Axelsson and Warren, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altan-Bonnet et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lowe and Barr, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wei and Seemann, 2009</xref>). An increasing number of membrane-associated proteins have been shown to regulate different aspects of mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cao et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cao and Zheng, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Royle et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">S&#x000fc;tterlin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Vong et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boucrot and Kirchhausen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lehtonen et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, a membranous mitotic spindle matrix has been isolated from <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> egg extracts, which can stimulate MT assembly from pure tubulin in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tsai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zheng and Tsai, 2006</xref>). These data suggest that proper organization of mitotic membranes could influence spindle assembly.</p><p>Endocytic proteins such as clathrin, AP2, and autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia (ARH) induce membrane curvature either directly or indirectly by recruiting other proteins to drive endocytic vesicle formation. During mitosis, they localize to different places, with clathrin concentrating on the spindle, ARH localizing to centrosomes, and AP2 distributing throughout the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Royle et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boucrot and Kirchhausen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lehtonen et al., 2008</xref>). Whereas clathrin appears to regulate kinetochore MT bundling independent of its role in membrane deformation and endocytosis, how AP2 and ARH regulate mitosis remains unclear.</p><p>In this study, we focus on epsin, an endocytic adapter protein which directly binds and deforms membranes through its epsin NH2-terminal homology (ENTH) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ford et al., 2002</xref>). We provide evidence that the membrane deformation function of epsin affects spindle organization during mitosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Reduction of epsin in human cells causes defects in spindle morphology</title><p>We used RNAi to determine whether endocytic adapter proteins might regulate mitosis in HeLa cells and found that epsin1 depletion caused a strong increase in mitotic cells with defective spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200902071/DC1">Fig. S1, A and B</ext-link>). This was confirmed by two different siRNA oligonucleotides targeting different regions of epsin1, both of which reliably reduced epsin1 to 20&#x02013;30% of the control levels in HeLa cells 48 h after siRNA transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). In contrast to control cells in which pericentrin staining was intense and focused at the spindle poles, epsin1 RNAi&#x02013;treated cells showed a significant increase in splayed spindle poles and multipolar spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>). There was no increase in the number of centrosomes in interphase cells (unpublished data). Although RNAi of epsin1 alone gave only a mild defect in spindle morphology in another human cell line, MCF-10A, codepletion of epsin1 and -2 resulted in a similar level of mitotic defects to those observed in HeLa cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200902071/DC1">Fig. S2</ext-link>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Effects of epsin1 reduction on mitosis in HeLa cells.</bold> (A) Western blotting of epsin1 48 h after siRNA transfection.

There was no obvious defect in chromosome segregation, as a majority of the cells proceeded through mitosis after a delay. Interestingly, a recent study also showed that deletion of NuMA (nuclear/mitotic apparatus protein) in mouse embryonic fibroblasts prevented spindle pole focusing without rendering obvious chromosome segregation defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Silk et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Reduction of epsin alters membrane organization in mitosis</title><p>Next, we performed immunofluorescence staining for epsin1. Although clathrin was enriched on mitotic spindles relative to cytoplasmic staining, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Royle et al., 2005</xref>), we found that epsin1 was diffusely distributed in the mitotic cytoplasm, including the spindle region, with no obvious localization to centrosomes or spindle poles (Fig. S1 D). In addition, although epsin1 has been shown previously to interact with tubulin and MTs in rat brain lysate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hussain et al., 2003</xref>), we could not detect any interaction between epsin1 and MTs or tubulin in mitotic <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200902071/DC1">Fig. S3</ext-link>). Therefore, it is unlikely that epsin1 contributes toward spindle organization by directly regulating MT assembly dynamics in mitosis.</p><p>Epsin1 is known to induce membrane curvature through its ENTH domain in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ford et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, epsin1 may organize mitotic membranes, which in turn facilitates spindle morphogenesis. We used a membrane-permeable fluorescent dye, DiOC<sub>6</sub>(3), to visualize mitotic membranes in live cells by confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Waterman-Storer et al., 1993</xref>). To identify mitotic cells, chromosomes were labeled with Hoechst 33258. In control RNAi&#x02013;treated cells, the membrane network uniformly surrounded mitotic chromosomes, whereas epsin1 RNAi&#x02013;treated cells often showed distorted and uneven membrane distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200902071/DC1">Videos 1&#x02013;4</ext-link>). The percentage of cells with abnormal membrane morphology was significantly higher with epsin1 siRNA treatment than with control siRNA treatment (control, 9.2 &#x000b1; 3.8%; epsin1 siRNA, 45.8 &#x000b1; 8.9%; Student's two-tailed <italic>t</italic> test, P = 0.0016; <italic>n</italic> &#x0003e; 100 in each condition).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Effects of epsin1 reduction on membrane organization in mitotic HeLa cells.</bold> (A) Control or epsin1-depleted cells were labeled with DiOC<sub>6</sub>(3) and Hoechst 33258 to visualize membranes and chromosomes, respectively. Confocal images of mitotic cells at one z section are shown.

Abundant membrane tubules and fragments were observed in control metaphase cells. These membrane structures usually surrounded condensed chromosomes in an even distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). However, in epsin1-depleted cells, uniform short membrane tubules were replaced by abnormally long membrane tubules or sheets frequently associated with layers of membrane whorls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Cells with abnormal membrane organization were as follows: control, 2.8 &#x000b1; 3.9% (<italic>n</italic> = 30); epsin1 siRNA2, 37.2 &#x000b1; 2.7% (<italic>n</italic> = 57); Student's two-tailed <italic>t</italic> test, P = 0.014. The distorted membrane morphology was not caused by prolonged arrest in mitosis, as nocodazole-arrested mitotic cells with control RNAi treatment did not show such defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). In addition, a significant increase of cells with aberrant membrane organization was observed in epsin1-depleted cells arrested in mitosis with nocodazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Cells with abnormal membrane organization were as follows: control, 6.3 &#x000b1; 8.8% (<italic>n</italic> = 39); epsin1 siRNA2, 49.2 &#x000b1; 4.6% (<italic>n</italic> = 79); Student's two-tailed <italic>t</italic> test, P = 0.049. Similar defects in membrane organization were also observed with a different siRNA oligonucleotide (siRNA1; unpublished data). There was no apparent membrane morphology change in interphase cells with either siRNA oligonucleotide (unpublished data), suggesting epsin1 specifically mediates mitotic membrane organization, which in turn modulates spindle assembly.</p><p>We found that epsin1 reduction did not cause obvious changes in the distribution of markers for Golgi (&#x003b2;-Cop), nuclear pores (nucleoporin; nuclear pore complex; detected by MAb414), or nuclear lamina (lamin B2) in mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). However, the evenly distributed mitotic ER network around the spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Puhka et al., 2007</xref>), which is revealed by the KDEL antibody in control cells, became disorganized upon epsin1 knockdown by RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). Cells with uneven KDEL signal were as follows: control, 15.7 &#x000b1; 8% (<italic>n</italic> = 56); epsin1 siRNA2, 52.5 &#x000b1; 2.3% (<italic>n</italic> = 64); Student's two-tailed <italic>t</italic> test, P = 0.011. This is reminiscent of the membrane morphology defects observed in live cells by membrane dye labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Therefore, epsin regulates the organization of the mitotic membrane network that contains ER membranes, which may in turn influence spindle integrity.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Mitotic ER network marked by the KDEL antibody is affected by epsin1 reduction in HeLa cells.</bold> (A) Confocal images of markers for subcellular compartments in mitosis in control or epsin1 knockdown cells.

By introducing point mutations into the wobble codons of siRNA-targeting sequences, we generated RNAi-insensitive versions of epsin1 expression constructs that have the wild-type amino acid sequence. Because epsin1 is known to be phosphorylated by Cdc2 kinase on residue Ser357 during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kariya et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ross&#x000e9; et al., 2003</xref>), we further introduced a single mutation at Ser357 to produce the phosphomimic and nonphosphorylatable forms Ser357D and Ser357A, respectively. All three constructs were able to rescue the defects caused by epsin1 depletion when cotransfected with the siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref> and Fig. S1, E and F), suggesting that the mitotic function of epsin1 does not depend on its phosphorylation by Cdc2. However, as a previous study showed that overexpression of wild type and Ser357A but not Ser357D interfered with clathrin-mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kariya et al., 2000</xref>), we used the mitotic phosphomimic form Ser357D to further investigate whether the membrane-bending function of epsin is involved in spindle morphogenesis.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Epsin1 regulates spindle integrity through its membrane-bending ENTH domain.</bold> (A) Domain structure of epsin1 expression constructs with the indicated mutations.

The NPF motif interacts with proteins such as Eps15. The mutant epsin1Ser357D (S357D) mimics the mitotic phosphorylated form. The RNAi-insensitive rescue construct epsin1Ser3573D-ins (S357D-ins) contains mutations in wobble codons in the sequence corresponding to siRNA2, which do not affect protein sequences. Mutant epsins epsin1L6E/Ser357D-ins (L6E/S357D-ins) and epsin1R63L/Ser357D-ins (R63L/S357D-ins) are derived from epsin1Ser357D-ins but contain an additional point mutation in the ENTH domain that abolishes the membrane-bending activity of epsin1. (B) Western blot analysis of epsin1 expression in HeLa cells. Epsin1Ser357D expression was inhibited by siRNA2 but not by control siRNA, whereas expression of epsin1Ser357D-ins, epsin1L6E/Ser357D-ins, and epsinR63L/Ser357D-ins was not affected by treatment with siRNA2.

Because the ENTH domain of XEpsin1 appeared to be important for spindle organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>), the ENTH domain antibody might inhibit assembly of spindles when added to the egg extracts. We first incubated either the ENTH domain antibody or rabbit IgG purified from nonimmunized rabbits with the cycled egg extract at a final IgG concentration of 0.15 mg/ml and then initiated spindle assembly using <italic>Xenopus</italic> sperm. We observed a reduction of normal spindle assembly and a corresponding increase in sperm associating with half spindles that were unable to proceed into bipolar spindles, defective spindles with distorted or reduced MT fibers, or no MT structures at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, B and C</xref>).</p><p>Next, we immunodepleted XEpsin1 from cytostatic factor (CSF)&#x02013;arrested egg extracts. Approximately 90% of the endogenous XEpsin1 was depleted, as judged by Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, D and E</xref>). Similar to ENTH domain antibody addition, we found that depletion of XEpsin1 also resulted in a significant reduction of normal spindle assembly compared with mock-depleted egg extracts and a corresponding increase of sperm associated with either no spindles or with defective spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, C and G</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we expressed and purified wild-type XEpsin1-6His and mutant XEpsin1L6E-6His (defective in membrane bending), and used the proteins to rescue the XEpsin1-depleted egg extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, E and F</xref>). The addition of wild-type XEpsin1 but not XEpsin1L6E-6His resulted in a significant rescue of normal spindle formation in XEpsin1-depleted egg extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 G</xref>). Similarly, XEpsin1R63L-6His, which is defective in lipid binding, also failed to rescue the spindle defects caused by XEpsin1 depletion (unpublished data). Therefore, the spindle organization function of XEpsin1 requires its membrane-bending activity but is independent of its role in endocytosis during interphase.</p><p>We show that epsin regulates spindle morphology indirectly through its ability to regulate mitotic membrane organization. Although most studies of spindle assembly have focused on structures and forces produced within the spindle MTs, both our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref> and Videos 1 and 3) and previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Waterman-Storer et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Axelsson and Warren, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altan-Bonnet et al., 2006</xref>) have shown that the mitotic spindle is built inside a highly interconnected membrane network, which could form an elastic module to provide support for MTs during spindle assembly. A disorganized membrane network such as those caused by epsin reduction would exhibit uneven elasticity and deformability when subjected to forces from MTs, which could affect spindle morphology. We suggest that the membrane elasticity could be provided in part by the intermediate filament protein lamin B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tsai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ma et al., 2009</xref>). Consistent with this, we have found that lamin B balances motor activities during spindle assembly in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts (unpublished data).</p><p>Besides epsin, other proteins may also contribute to the organization of various membrane compartments in the mitotic cytosol. This may explain the relatively mild spindle defects we observed in epsin reduction. Proteins such as AP2, ARH, and GRASP65 have functions in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">S&#x000fc;tterlin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boucrot and Kirchhausen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lehtonen et al., 2008</xref>). It will be interesting to determine whether they have a role in mitotic membrane organization as well. Other proteins such as BAR (Bin, amphiphysin, and Rvs) or F-BAR (FCH-BAR) domain&#x02013;containing proteins, coat proteins such as COPI and COPII, and enzymes involved in lipid metabolism may also be involved in regulating mitotic membrane organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">McMahon and Gallop, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Itoh and De Camilli, 2006</xref>). Our study of epsin and mitotic membrane should stimulate further investigation into how structures outside the spindle proper could affect MT organization within the spindle.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>siRNAs, plasmids, proteins, and antibodies</title><p>siRNAs for human epsin1 (siRNA1, 5&#x02032;-GGAAGACGCCGGAGTCATT-3&#x02032;; siRNA2, 5&#x02032;-GGACCTTGCTGACGTCTTC-3&#x02032;; siRNA3, 5&#x02032;-GAACTGGCGTCACGTTTAC-3&#x02032;), clathrin heavy chain (5&#x02032;-GCAATGAGCTGTTTGAAGA-3&#x02032;), Eps15 (EGF receptor pathway substrate 15; 5&#x02032;-AAACGGAGCTACAGATTAT-3&#x02032;), Eps15R (Eps15 related; 5&#x02032;-GCACTTGGATCGAGATGAG-3&#x02032;; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Huang et al., 2004</xref>), and control siRNA (5&#x02032;-CGTACGCGGAATACTTCGA-3&#x02032;) as well as SMARTpool siRNA for epsin2 and -3 were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific.
