Newly assembled duplications contain protein-coding genes that are mostly involved in reproductive function.</p></abstract><abstract><p>The mouse (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>) is the premier animal model for understanding human disease and development. Here we show that a comprehensive understanding of mouse biology is only possible with the availability of a finished, high-quality genome assembly. The finished clone-based assembly of the mouse strain C57BL/6J reported here has over 175,000 fewer gaps and over 139 Mb more of novel sequence, compared with the earlier MGSCv3 draft genome assembly. In a comprehensive analysis of this revised genome sequence, we are now able to define 20,210 protein-coding genes, over a thousand more than predicted in the human genome (19,042 genes). In addition, we identified 439 long, non&#x02013;protein-coding RNAs with evidence for transcribed orthologs in human. We analyzed the complex and repetitive landscape of 267 Mb of sequence that was missing or misassembled in the previously published assembly, and we provide insights into the reasons for its resistance to sequencing and assembly by whole-genome shotgun approaches. Duplicated regions within newly assembled sequence tend to be of more recent ancestry than duplicates in the published draft, correcting our initial understanding of recent evolution on the mouse lineage. These duplicates appear to be largely composed of sequence regions containing transposable elements and duplicated protein-coding genes; of these, some may be fixed in the mouse population, but at least 40&#x00025; of segmentally duplicated sequences are copy number variable even among laboratory mouse strains. Mouse lineage-specific regions contain 3,767 genes drawn mainly from rapidly-changing gene families associated with reproductive functions. The finished mouse genome assembly, therefore, greatly improves our understanding of rodent-specific biology and allows the delineation of ancestral biological functions that are shared with human from derived functions that are not.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The availability of an accurate genome sequence provides the bedrock upon which modern biomedical research is based. Here we describe a high-quality assembly, Build 36, of the mouse genome. This assembly was put together by aligning overlapping individual clones representing parts of the genome, and it provides a more complete picture than previous assemblies, because it adds much rodent-specific sequence that was previously unavailable. The addition of these sequences provides insight into both the genomic architecture and the gene complement of the mouse. In particular, it highlights recent gene duplications and the expansion of certain gene families during rodent evolution. An improved understanding of the mouse genome and thus mouse biology will enhance the utility of the mouse as a model for human disease.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mouse (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>) occupies a singular position in genetics and genomics. It is both the premier animal model for human disease and development and the mammalian genome against which human DNA, genes, and genomes are most frequently compared. Despite approximately 90 million years of independent evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000112-Murphy1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, the laboratory mouse remains an excellent model for many human phenotypes and thus is critical to the study of human disease and mammalian development. Its small size and rapid breeding cycle are of immense practical utility, and the mature mouse genetics system, with hundreds of inbred lines, allows phenotypic consequences of sequence variation to be inferred <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000112-Rossant1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Given the critical role of the mouse as a model organism, it is particularly important to separate shared ancestral characteristics that have been conserved in the mouse and human since their divergence from derived characteristics that are unique to either lineage. Mouse and human genes whose coding sequences have scarcely changed since the last common ancestor and that have remained unduplicated in each lineage are the most likely to have retained their ancestral functions. In contrast, genes that have duplicated along the rodent lineage may contribute to derived traits that are less relevant to human biology, and are thus less appropriate models of human physiology and disease.</p><p>Genomic duplication and divergence is a primary source of functional innovation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000112-Ohno1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Recent gene duplicates are highly sequence-similar and are expected to be embedded within segmentally duplicated regions of the genome (defined as DNA segments greater than 1 kb showing &#x0003e;90&#x00025; sequence identity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000112-Bailey1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>). Approximately 40&#x00025; (50 Mb) of segmentally duplicated sequences are known to be copy number variable among laboratory strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000112-She1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, whereas the remainder appears to have been fixed, either by genetic drift or by positive selection when the duplicated genes provide a selective advantage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000112-Nguyen1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000112-Bailey2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

This publication marked a watershed in mammalian genetics and genomics, as it allowed the first genomic comparisons between mouse and human. It also represented the first publicly funded mammalian genome project using Whole Genome Sequence and Assembly (WGSA). This approach, or variations of it, has since been the primary method for producing most mammalian genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000112-Gibbs1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000112-Gibbs2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref><bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000112-g001">Figure 1</xref><bold>)</bold>.</p><fig id="pbio-1000112-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1000112.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Graphical representation of the two sequencing strategies used for mouse.</title><p>A careful cost/benefit analysis must be performed when approaching a genomic sequencing project.

The most serious issue to the use of the MGSCv3 is its almost complete lack of highly sequence-similar and recently segmentally duplicated regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000112-She2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000112-Bailey3">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. It was our principal concern that missing segmental duplication-rich regions of the draft assembly might harbour large numbers of rapidly evolving genes whose identification might illuminate mouse-specific biology. Only by accounting for these missing genes could we obtain a comprehensive understanding of the biology that distinguishes these two species. Given this, it has been a goal of the international consortium to produce a mouse genome assembly of coverage and quality comparable to that of the human genome described in 2004 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000112-International1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Although it was anticipated that the effort and expense required for producing such an assembly via a clone-based approach would be substantial, this would be justified by the increased fidelity, and thus utility, of the higher quality genome assembly to the biomedical research community.</p><p>Here we report the completion of this effort and present a high-quality, largely finished clone-based genome assembly of the C57BL/6J strain of mouse, here referred to as Build 36. This new assembly includes 267 Mb of sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000112.s001">Protocol S1</xref>) that was either missing or misassembled, much of which consists of repetitive and segmentally duplicated sequence (4.94&#x00025; of the genome). Over 175,000 gaps in MGSCv3 have been closed, and genome-wide continuity has improved accordingly, with scaffold N50 lengths (the scaffold length in which at least half of the bases of the assembly reside) increasing from 17 Mb to 40 Mb.</p><p>The availability of finished sequence for human, and now mouse, enables more-complete surveys of protein-coding genes in both species. We now estimate that mouse and human reference genomes contain 20,210 and 19,042 protein-coding genes, respectively. The number of mouse genes had been missing or substantially disrupted in the previous MGSCv3 assembly is 2,185. The majority of these arise from rodent lineage-specific duplications, often (61&#x00025;) embedded within segmentally duplicated regions that were recalcitrant to WGSA. Many of these mouse-specific genes may contribute to rodent-specific functions and, with their inclusion in the assembly, are now available for further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Build 36 Assembly</title><p>The mouse genome assembly (Build 36; <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="pbio-1000112-box001">Box 1</xref>) shows marked improvements over the MGSCv3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000112-t001">Table 1</xref>) (Tables S1, S2, S3, S4, S5 and S6 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000112.s001">Protocol S1</xref>), with an increased amount of ordered and oriented sequence placed on a chromosome (2.58 Gb in the MGSCv3 versus 2.64 Gb in Build 36) and increased base level accuracy due to the addition of clone-based finished sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000112-g002">Figure 2</xref>) (Table S3a&#x02013;S3c in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000112.s001">Protocol S1</xref>). Scaffold continuity, as measured by the N50, is also dramatically improved, with an N50 of 40.3 Mb in Build 36 compared to an N50 of 17.8 Mb in the MGSCv3. In addition, the number of gaps in Build 36 is reduced by over 140-fold when compared to the MGSCv3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000112-t001">Table 1</xref>) (Tables S4 and S5 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000112.s001">Protocol S1</xref>). Evidence (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="pbio-1000112-box001">Box 1</xref>) indicates that Build 36 is a high-quality assembly that covers &#x0003e;99&#x00025; of the C57BL/6J genome (assuming a 2.66-Gb genome size; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000112.s001">Protocol S1</xref>). Although many of the problematic regions identified in these analyses have been corrected in a subsequent Build 37 (the current public build, see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="pbio-1000112-box001">Box 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000112.s001">Protocol S1</xref>), a few regions remain under review and will be addressed in forthcoming assemblies. Improvements to the assembly are evident at a fine scale in the spanning of previous gaps and inclusion of locally duplicated sequences. However, at a larger scale, the genome structure remains basically unchanged from MGSCv3, and conserved syntenic relationships to human inferred from the two assemblies have remained essentially unaltered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000112-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p><boxed-text id="pbio-1000112-box001" position="float"><sec id="s2a1a"><title>Box 1. Assembly Production and Quality Assurance</title><p>The mouse genome assembly (Build 36) was produced largely as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000112-International1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> but with some variations in methodology and standards (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000112.s001">Protocol S1</xref>). The availability of a high-quality WGS assembly was essential in providing a framework for the clone-based assembly. Nevertheless, over 7&#x00025; of the bases found in the finished clone sequences failed to align to the MGSCv3. Unaligned sequence contributed from approximately 4&#x00025; for Chromosome 11 to 18&#x00025; for the X chromosome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000112.s001">Protocol S1</xref>: Alignments)). Tables S1, S2, S3, S4 and S5 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000112.s001">Protocol S1</xref> provide assembly statistics, stratified by chromosome, for both Build 36 and the subsequent Build 37, which was produced after the analysis performed here. While this analysis led to improvements in Build 37, the changes in this build are not expected to drastically alter the conclusions of the analysis presented in this manuscript. The main differences between Build 36 and Build 37 are the incorporation of an additional 8.3 Mb of sequence onto the assembled chromosomes and 44.7 Mb of sequence as unplaced sequence. During the course of analyzing Build 36, a number of scaffolds that were unplaced in the MGSCv3 were found to contain sequences not represented in Build 36. In all cases, these sequences contained protein-coding genes. While many of these can be associated with a chromosome, the exact order and orientation is unknown. However, because of the missing gene sequences, we thought it was important to release Build 37 with these sequences included. Work is ongoing to both place these sequences in the correct location on the chromosome and to identify clone-based sequences to represent them. Although statistics are provided for the Y chromosome, analysis of this chromosome will not be discussed here, because it remains a separate project that will be described at a later date. However, the authors have generously provided the scientific community with data prior to publication (J. Alfoldi, personal communication).</p><p>To assess the accuracy of Build 36, the genome assembly was compared to several independent sources of data including a linkage map <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000112-Dietrich1">&#x0005b;81&#x0005d;</xref>, a radiation hybrid map <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000112-Hudson1">&#x0005b;82&#x0005d;</xref>, and sequences (genomic and transcript based) not used to generate the assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000112-Pruitt1">&#x0005b;83&#x0005d;</xref>. In all cases, the discrepancy rate was very low, indicating that Build 36 is a high-quality and high-coverage genome assembly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000112.s001">Protocol S1</xref>). This project was the first to use an optical map to assess the assembly and to disambiguate problematic regions.

The large amount (126 Mb; 4.94&#x00025;) of segmentally duplicated sequence in the mouse genome was unexpected, because the initial MGSCv3 assembly contained virtually no (&#x0003c;0.1&#x00025;) such sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000112-Bailey1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, and what was there in MGSCv3 resided in a large pool of unplaced sequences. When evaluating the segmental duplication content of Build 36, we used an assembly-independent approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000112-She2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> to validate 85&#x02013;91&#x00025; of long (&#x02265;10 kb) and highly similar (94&#x02013;99&#x00025;) duplications. Nevertheless, some virtually identical (&#x0003e;99&#x00025;) duplications remained as artefacts in the assembly, because these exhibited slightly lower rates of validation (82&#x00025;), and further work will be required to resolve them. Of critical importance, with the addition of the new data in Build 36, segmental duplications in the mouse thus are now seen to occupy a similar proportion of the genome as they do in human. However, they are overwhelmingly intrachromosomal, with a high prevalence of tandem duplication, whereas human segmental duplications are often interchromosomal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000112-She2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><fig id="pbio-1000112-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1000112.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>The distribution of segmental duplication in MGSCv3 (top) and Build 36 (bottom).</title><p>Interchromosomal (red) and intrachromosomal (blue) duplications (&#x0003e;95&#x00025; identity and &#x0003e;10 kbp) in length are shown for both genome assemblies with the requirement that pairwise alignments are shown for only those regions (Build 36) that are also confirmed by the WGS depth of coverage analysis (black vertical bars/ticks).

When one compares the divergence of segmental duplications between the mouse (Build 36) and human genome assemblies (Build 36), there are some notable differences. For example, the majority of human intrachromosomal segmental duplications show high sequence identity (98.5&#x02013;99.5&#x00025; with a mode at 99&#x00025; sequence identity). In contrast, the pairwise sequence identity distribution for mouse segmental duplications shows a much more bell-shaped distribution with a clear mode around 95&#x00025;. These findings are consistent with a burst of intrachromosomal segmental duplications in the human&#x02013;great ape lineage as recently discussed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000112-MarquesBonet1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, and indicate that perhaps intrachromosomal segmental duplications have a more ancient origin in the mouse. There are, however, some important caveats. First, it is likely that high-identity duplications in the human genome assembly have been better resolved because of the larger and longer effort in its finishing&#x02014;as such, we posit that we are underestimating the highest-identity segmental duplications in the mouse genome. Second, the substitution rate for rodents is significantly higher than primates, so if divergence is used as surrogate for evolutionary age, this adjustment must be taken to account. Finally, this pattern is true for C57BL6, but the pattern in wild-type mice under strong natural selection may differ significantly. Estimating differences in timing of segmental duplications is particularly tricky in the absence of comparative sequence data of more closely related rodent genomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Mouse and Human Protein-Coding Gene Repertoires</title><p>The Build 36 assembly contains many genes that were absent, truncated, incomplete, or misassembled in the initial draft MGSCv3 genome sequence.

This increased number of genes in mouse compared to human is, for most families, primarily attributable to gains in the rodent lineage; however, the primate lineage has also experienced substantial losses of genes encoding olfactory receptors, VRs, VR-associated molecules, and putative pheromones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000112-Rouquier1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000112-Liman1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000112-g007">Figure 7</xref>).

Differences in the human and mouse gene repertoires can also arise from gene loss in the rodent lineage.

One such case is the human gene <italic>EYS</italic> (Entrez Gene (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/</ext-link>) GeneID 346007), whose disruption results in retinitis pigmentosa; nevertheless the mouse ortholog found in B6 is a pseudogene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000112-AbdElAziz1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. For the few human genes whose mouse orthologs are entirely absent from the current assembly, it is difficult to determine whether their absence reflects past deletions of genomic sequence or else indicates regions that continue to be problematic to sequence. One gene that has remained elusive since the draft MGSCv3 assembly is the mouse ortholog of human <italic>KAL1</italic> (GeneID 3730), whose disruption leads to an absence or hypoplasia of olfactory bulbs and tracts in human patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000112-Sderlund1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. No transcript or genomic evidence for the existence of a <italic>KAL1</italic> mouse ortholog is apparent.

The finished mouse genome adds over 6&#x00025; additional euchromatic sequence, much of it repetitive, but includes 1,259 mouse-specific genes that were missing or grossly misassembled in the draft. Improvements to the assembly should enhance many coordinated initiatives that are exploiting the utility of the laboratory mouse for understanding human biology and disease processes. For example, an international effort to establish baseline phenotypic measurements on the 40 most commonly used strains has provided a much needed platform upon which more complex phenotypes can be assessed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000112-Grubb1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>. Several large-scale studies have produced hundreds of models of human disease using chemical mutagenesis or random insertional mutagenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000112-Justice1">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>. Other projects are underway with the goal of producing a targeted mutation in every gene in the mouse genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000112-Collins1">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref>. As the primary organizational framework for all of these projects, it is essential that the annotated mouse genome reference sequence is as complete and accurate as possible.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Sequencing Strategies</title><p>The original MGSCv3 mouse draft assembly proved comparatively cheap and easy to produce. A large number of other vertebrate genomes have been sequenced to similarly deep coverage, either as aids to model organism biology or to improve our understanding of the human genome. The cost to take a genome to an equivalent finished state is typically at least four times the cost of generating the draft assemblies using traditional Sanger sequencing. Nonetheless, it is clear from our analysis of the finished mouse genome assembly that draft WGSAs will always poorly reflect lineage-specific biology. This conclusion is also supported by analysis of both the dog <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000112-LindbladToh1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000112-Nicholas1">&#x0005b;68&#x0005d;</xref> and rhesus macaque genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000112-Gibbs2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000112-MarquesBonet1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Whereas they provide a sufficient framework for understanding the majority of the genome that lies outside of lineage-specific regions, recent, rapidly evolving parts of the genome are greatly underrepresented due to the collapse of segmental duplications and evolutionarily young repeat sequences. Finished genome sequence has proved essential to understanding the full range of biology for both the human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000112-She2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> and the mouse genome, and will no doubt prove similarly informative for other vertebrate species.</p><p>Using next-generation sequencing technology, the cost of generating several-fold coverage of a genome drops several orders of magnitude; however, especially for large genomes; it is still not possible to generate a de novo assembly from the collection of such reads. While it is likely that de novo assembly of large genomes using next generation sequencing technologies will be achieved relatively soon, it is unlikely that these assemblies will represent these complex, lineage-specific regions any better than WGSAs generated using traditional Sanger technology. We have seen little evidence from next-generation sequence assemblies of genome or clones that segmental duplications can be adequately resolved with methods other than capillary sequencing of clones. For example, we recently completed an analysis with 96 clones, which contained structural variants and segmental duplications and, not surprisingly, those regions that remained unresolved (by 454 sequence data) were enriched in segmental duplications and large common repeats (Eichler EE, Kidd JM, Fulton RS, Chen L, Graves T, et al. unpublished data). Cost-effectiveness should not be the primary consideration for these regions. Studies of human disease and phenotypes in other organisms show conclusively that the content, copy, and structure are important. Short-read, next-generation sequencing technology, while a significant advance, will not comprehensively capture all of this complex sequence structure. Obtaining large insert clones for these regions is the key, but we need third-generation technology with longer-read lengths to assemble these complex regions accurately. Long-read technology developments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000112-Eid1">&#x0005b;69&#x0005d;</xref> hold promise in this regard. A targeted clone-based approach to sequencing may thus be especially well justified for representative species on the lineage leading to human, comprising our closest primate lineages as well as other simians. This is because many of the critical changes that underlie biological innovations in primate lineages are likely to reside in precisely the rapidly evolving, segmentally duplicated regions that have proved so illuminating for the mouse. Coding and noncoding gene gains and losses in each lineage, and changes to their regulatory sequence, may allow us to elucidate the pressures that have shaped different regions of the human genome over recent evolutionary history. Changes in the repertoire of immune genes, for example, would help to explain the contrasting susceptibilities of primates to different pathogens and auto-immune diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000112-Varki1">&#x0005b;70&#x0005d;</xref>, while much of human reproductive biology and placental development, so distinct from those of rodents, may be understood in the context of changes in reproductive strategy among primates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000112-Martin1">&#x0005b;71&#x0005d;</xref>. Other laboratory models, such as the rat, or species that lie at key branch points in the evolutionary tree leading to humans, or representatives of important lineages outside the eutherian mammals, such as marsupials, birds, and fish, may be similarly justified in having a finished genome sequence.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Comprehensive Gene Lists</title><p>The greatest improvements to the mouse assembly have been to regions that are replete with rodent lineage-specific duplicated sequence. Segmental duplications that were previously found at negligible levels now constitute almost 5&#x00025; of the genome. Many of these duplications harbour multiple rodent-specific genes that show a strong bias towards reproductive function. This suggests a role for either adaptive forces or clonal selection in shaping the mouse genome. The availability of these mouse genes now allows their experimental investigation.</p><p>The comparison of two finished mammalian genomes has enabled the revision of comprehensive and reliable human and mouse protein-coding gene catalogues. The 75&#x00025; of mouse genes that are in 1&#x02236;1 orthologous relationships with human genes are the most likely to have maintained ancestral function in both species, and are, therefore, most appropriately targeted as disease models. Phenotype data, mainly from knockouts, are already available for over 5,000 of these 15,187 genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000112-Knockout1">&#x0005b;72&#x0005d;</xref>. Other genes exist in multiple copies in the B6 genome or are polymorphic among mouse strains, and these will be more difficult to study on a gene-by-gene basis. While variation among strains suggests that some of these lineage-specific genes are not essential to development, many of these differences may contribute to phenotypic variation seen among laboratory strains. Understanding rodent-specific innovations is, therefore, critical when investigating human physiology or disease using the mouse as a model organism.</p><p>The shortcomings of the initial draft assembly are readily apparent now that a more-complete genome assembly is available. Undoubtedly these have led to incomplete or inaccurate understanding of some aspects of mouse biology. The availability of high quality genome sequence for the mouse will lead the way in dismissing some commonly held misconceptions and, more importantly, in revealing many previously hidden secrets of mouse biology.</p><p>Supplemental material and data for this paper including validated protein-coding and noncoding gene models can be found at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/guide/mouse/Build36_Publication_Supplement">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/guide/mouse/Build36_Publication_Supplement</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Sequence Generation and Assembly Production</title><sec id="s4a1"><title>Clone-based sequence production</title><p>Ninety-six percent of the clone-based sequence was derived from four centres, The Genome Center at Washington University in St. Louis, The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, The Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, and The Genome Center at the Baylor College of Medicine (Figure S6 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000112.s001">Protocol S1</xref>).

Each sequencing centre provided the assessing centre with the clone-based shotgun traces they had produced.

The two sequences were then aligned, and all differences were manually assessed by an independent third party. Differences found within SSRs were not counted as true differences. The overall base level error rate was determined to be 1 error per 50,000 bp, well below the accepted finishing standard of 1 error in 10,000 bp (Table S6 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000112.s001">Protocol S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4a3"><title>Tiling path production</title><p>The genome assembly is driven by a tiling path file (TPF).

Alignments having greater than 99.6&#x00025; identity, no gap greater than 25 bp, and a complete dovetail alignment were &#x0201c;passed&#x0201d;. While it is expected that all clones should have an alignment of 100&#x00025; identity with no gaps, in practice this rarely happens due to the difficulty of finishing SSRs. Clones not passing the above criteria were manually assessed. In some cases, manual adjustment of the alignment could produce an acceptable overlap and in other cases, a &#x0201c;certificate&#x0201d; was submitted to provide additional external evidence that the join was acceptable.

The alignments were trimmed to maximize alignment scores and to retain reciprocal best hits. An additional step allowed alignments that are of high quality, but not reciprocal, to be included in order to capture regions that are duplicated in one assembly, but not in the other (Y. Kapustin, unpublished data). CDS features on Build 36 were then propagated through the alignments onto the MGSv3 (J. Cherry, unpublished data) to obtain coordinates on the MGSCv3. Exonic coordinates from the union of NCBI and Ensembl transcripts for each gene were mapped through alignments from Build 36 onto MGSCv3 (J. Cherry, unpublished data). Exonic regions that abutted, or were wholly contained within, one another were merged before mapping, as were MGSCv3 aligned regions that overlapped.</p><p>We have chosen not to compare the current and initial draft mouse gene catalogues, because gene annotations have benefitted from the many improvements in the availability of transcriptional evidence, gene prediction algorithms, and the heuristics used to evaluate these data. Instead, we determined the extent to which the initial MGSCv3 assembly could have supported the current mouse gene catalogue. We were thus interested in identifying disrupted Build 36 gene models whose corresponding MGSCv3 sequence was (i) not previously placed on chromosome scaffolds; (ii) previously dispersed among two or more different chromosomes, and/or were placed on both strands of a single chromosome; (iii) interdigitated, on the same strand, with sequence corresponding with an unrelated gene model; and (iv) entirely absent from this early assembly. We describe any such gene model as being &#x0201c;unmatched&#x0201d; in MGSCv3. These four unmatched criteria were applied in order. The remaining &#x0201c;matched&#x0201d; Build 36 gene models are contiguous and their exons do not overlap with other gene models on the same strand in both Build 36 and MGSCv3 assemblies. With few (65) exceptions, these gene models are placed on the same chromosome and strand in both assemblies.</p><p>For each Build 36 gene model, we then tabulated its exonic regions according to these four unmatched criteria. This allowed us to estimate the proportion of Build 36 exonic nucleotides that could have been predicted correctly in the early MGSCv3 assembly.
