We also describe how the proportion of ATC cells that are CD133<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> increases dramatically over three months of culture, from 7&#x00025; to more than 80&#x00025; of the total. This CD133<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cell pool can be further separated by flow cytometry into two distinct populations: CD133<sup>&#x0002b;/high</sup> and CD133<sup>&#x0002b;/low</sup>. Although both subsets are capable of long-term tumorigenesis, the rapidly proliferating CD133<sup>&#x0002b;/high</sup> cells are by far the most efficient. They also express high levels of the stem cell antigen Oct4 and the receptor for thyroid stimulating hormone, TSHR. Treating ATC cells with TSH causes a three-fold increase in the numbers of CD133<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells and elicits a dose-dependent up-regulation of the expression of <italic>TSHR</italic> and <italic>Oct4</italic> in these cells.

Its incidence is increasing more rapidly than any other solid tumor - about 3 percent per 100,000 people each year <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005395-Davies1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> - and it is now the seventh most common cancer in women <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005395-Cancer1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. More than 90&#x00025; of thyroid cancers are derived from thyroid follicular cells, are well differentiated and have a favorable prognosis. In contrast, anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), an undifferentiated thyroid cancer, is significantly more severe than other thyroid cancers and has a poor prognosis. Ninety percent of patients with ATC die within six months. Although ATC accounts for more than 50&#x00025; of deaths associated with thyroid cancer every year, the causes of this disease are largely unknown. Current treatments for ATC are aggressive - including surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy &#x02013; but no study has shown a convincing improvement in survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005395-Pierie1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, perhaps because they do not adequately target the cancer-initiating cells. Most cancer therapies target differentiated or differentiating cells, regardless of whether or not they are cancerous. However, if the disease is due to cancer stem cells (CSCs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005395-Reya1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005395-Hope1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, this could be the wrong approach. Like normal stem cells, CSCs can both self-renew and produce differentiated progeny, including a phenotypically diverse tumor cell population to drive tumorigenesis. Several lines of evidence suggest that CSCs, which are highly resistant to standard chemotherapeutic agents and radiation, sustain the disease in late phases of malignancy. To date, CSCs have been isolated based on their ability to express specific cell surface molecules in hematologic malignancies and epithelial-cell-derived cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (CD34<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD38<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD123<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005395-Hope1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, mammary carcinoma (CD44<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD24<sup>low</sup>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005395-AlHajj1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, brain tumors (CD133<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005395-Singh1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, colon cancer and melanoma (CD133<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005395-RicciVitiani1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005395-Dou1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>CD133 (prominin-1) is a five-transmembrane domain glycoprotein specifically expressed on populations of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from fetal and adult cord blood, peripheral blood and bone marrow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005395-Yin1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005395-Yin2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

Recently, Zito <italic>et al</italic> reported that, of four human ATC cell lines examined, two &#x02014; ARO and KAT-4 &#x02014; contain subpopulations of CD133<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells that exhibit stem cell-like features such as rapid proliferation, an ability to self-renew and form colonies, and resistance to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005395-Zito1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. As a result, these populations are believed to be able to initiate tumor growth, although this hypothesis has not yet been validated in animal models.</p><p>Here we evaluate the tumorigenic potentials of ATC-derived CD133<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> populations <italic>in vivo</italic>. We used fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS) to further divide the CD133<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells into two distinct fractions: CD133<sup>&#x0002b;/high</sup> and CD133<sup>&#x0002b;/low</sup>. We then compared the ability of CD133<sup>&#x0002b;/high</sup>, CD133<sup>&#x0002b;/low</sup> and CD133<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells to engraft and give rise to subcutaneous tumors in NOD/SCID mice. We used two xenotransplantation models in our study to explore the possible existence of CSCs in ATC: limiting dilution transplantation experiments to determine whether our xenograft system was qualitative and capable of detecting single tumor-initiating cells, and a serial xenograft model to test the cells' self-renewal and lineage capacities. We observed that, although both CD133<sup>&#x0002b;/high</sup> and CD133<sup>&#x0002b;/low</sup> cells generate subcutaneous xenograft tumors that display histology resembling the primary tumors, CD133<sup>&#x0002b;/high</sup> cells initiate earlier and more aggressive tumor growth. We also found that thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), the main regulator of thyroid gland function, is important for the growth of the CD133<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> population. Unlike normal thyroid cells, ATC tissue specimens were clearly positive for CD133. Our findings, together with the identification of thyroid CSCs and the elucidation of the role of TSH in CD133<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cell growth, may lead to new diagnostic markers and therapies to treat this devastating disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>CD133 is expressed on human ATC cell lines but not on papillary thyroid cancer cell lines</title><p>To determine whether a CSC population exists in ATC, we examined CD133 expression in a panel of human thyroid cancer cell lines. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that CD133 is expressed in two ATC cell lines, ARO (in which 7.02&#x00025; of cells are CD133<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) and FRO (in which 6.32&#x00025; of cells are CD133<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>), but not in either of two well-differentiated papillary thyroid cancer cell lines (NPA and TPC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005395-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). These results suggest that CD133 expression is uniquely associated with undifferentiated ATC.

Moreover, the two CD133 populations grow differently in culture. In tumors, CD133<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells exhibit pleomorphic giant cell nuclei and appear granular and dense; in two-dimensional cultures they form tight round colonies. In contrast, CD133<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells are devoid of most of these features.

Mice injected with single-cell suspensions of 10<sup>6</sup> ARO cells developed palpable tumors within a few days and visible tumors within 21 days. These tumors are remarkably similar to those from human patients and exhibit little resemblance to the original thyroid follicle structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005395-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Importantly, we found that the tumorigenic potential of the ARO cells varies with their passage number: cells that had been cultured longer formed larger and more aggressive tumors when transplanted into NOD/SCID mice than did cells of lower passage number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005395-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). We speculate that this phenomenon is due to the positive selection over time of the more robustly proliferating CD133<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells at the expense of the CD133<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells. Indeed, we found that two ARO cultures that had been passaged 50 or more times contained a higher proportion (&#x0223c;50.1&#x00025;) of CD133<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells than did ARO cultures of lower passage numbers (&#x0223c;21.9&#x00025;)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005395-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that the human ARO cell line contains cells with the capacity to form new tumors in NOD/SCID mice and that CD133 expression levels are positively correlated with tumor formation. Furthermore, the rapid proliferation of CD133<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells results in the robust positive selection of these cells over time&#x02014;from the original 7.02&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005395-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) of the total population to more than 80&#x00025; after three months of continuous culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005395-g004">Fig. 4</xref>).

It is highly resistant to conventional therapies and its mortality rate approaches 100&#x00025;. The relative rarity and rapidly fatal nature of ATC complicate both its diagnosis and treatment. The present study demonstrates for the first time that only a subpopulation of ATC cells is able to form tumors in NOD/SCID mice. We identified and isolated these cells based on the expression of a cell surface CSC marker, CD133, in the human ATC cell line ARO. Our data demonstrate that as few as 1,000 CD133<sup>&#x0002b;/high</sup> cells and 10,000 CD133<sup>&#x0002b;/low</sup> cells can form tumors in NOD/SCID mice. In contrast, mice injected with CD133<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells remained tumor free throughout the study period. These data reveal that tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic cells co-exist within ATC, and imply that not all tumor cells are able to initiate neoplastic growth. Rather, anaplastic tumors are generated by a small subset of CSC cells that can self-renew and differentiate into the entire tumor population. Our <italic>in vivo</italic> data support a previously uncharacterized CSC model for ATC tumorigenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005395-Lin1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005395-Thomas1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The current approach relies on two well-characterized human ATC cell lines: ARO and FRO. Zito <italic>et al</italic> previously reported that over 60&#x00025; of ARO cells were CD133<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, and that FRO cells did not express CD133 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005395-Zito1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, we found that about 7&#x00025; of both ARO and FRO cells were CD133<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005395-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Furthermore, despite the fact that immunofluorescent staining by us (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005395-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>) and others clearly show that CD133 is a cell surface protein, Zito's group described CD133 immunostaining as cytoplasmic and apical &#x02014; atypical for a five-transmembrane glycoprotein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005395-Zito1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. There are several possible explanations for these discrepancies. First, because the sources of cell lines are different, it is possible that they inherited different characteristics. For example, we describe here how, like many CSCs, CD133<sup>&#x0002b;/high</sup> cells proliferate more rapidly than CD133<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005395-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Over an extended period of continuous culturing, we observed that the proportion of CD133<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells in the ARO culture increased dramatically from 7&#x00025; to 80&#x00025;. If Zito's group studied early-passage FRO cells they may have mistakenly concluded that the cells did not express CD133. A recent report by Schweppe <italic>et al</italic> also suggests that the purported ATC cell lines ARO and KAT-4 are actually derived from the colon cancer cell line HT-29 and are not of thyroid cancer origin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005395-Schweppe1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Although it is not clear whether the cell lines used by Zito <italic>et al</italic> were contaminated, genetic analysis and DNA fingerprinting studies should be used to clarify the identity of these cell lines. Finally, it will be necessary to confirm our findings in fresh human ATC surgical tissue samples because cell lines do not always recapitulate all aspects of primary tumors. However, the rarity of the disease may make this difficult to achieve.</p><p>The rapid proliferation of CD133<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells may at least partially explain ATC's fatal nature. Existing diagnostic methods are based upon several characteristics: a lack of radioactive iodine uptake, a direct extension into soft tissues, and a rapidly enlarging neck mass (mean size at presentation: 8 cm). Most patients are struggling with breathing problems by the time they are diagnosed, and most of these cancers are already stage IV&#x02014;they have spread extensively to cervical lymph nodes and distant organs such as lung and bone, and are difficult to target and kill even with surgery. Because it is likely that the fast-growing nature of ATC and the subsequent high casualties are due to the highly proliferative and tumorigenic nature of CD133<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells, it seems reasonable that future therapies should be designed to target CD133<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> populations. Drug therapies targeting these populations are likely to differ from current chemotherapies for ATC patients and may be more successful in treating the disease.</p><p>Our immunohistochemical studies of clinical ATC specimens clearly showed that CD133 is expressed on tumor cells but not on neighboring normal thyroid cells. More importantly, tumors derived from CD133<sup>&#x0002b;/high</sup> and CD133<sup>&#x0002b;/low</sup> primary and secondary xenografts faithfully reproduced the primary tumors at the histological level in our xenograft models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005395-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Together these results suggest that CD133<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells maintain their tumorigenic potential during <italic>in vivo</italic> passaging and are indeed CSCs. CSCs self-renew and reconstitute their particular organ systems through a process of asymmetrical division that generates one new stem cell and one daughter cell capable of differentiation. They can also divide symmetrically to form either two normal daughter cells or two stem cells, depending on surrounding extracellular factors. Our data that CD133<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells generate new tumorigenic CD133<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells in addition to mixed populations of non-tumorigenic cells further support the notion that they are true CSCs.</p><p>Shmelkov <italic>et al</italic> recently reported that CD133 may not be a reliable marker for colon CSCs. Using transgenic mice expressing LacZ under the CD133 promoter, they found that CD133 was broadly expressed in normal and cancerous colonic epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005395-Shmelkov1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, they reported that although both CD133<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD133<sup>&#x02212;</sup> metastatic colon cancer cells can initiate tumors in NOD/SCID mice, CD133<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells can give rise to the more aggressive CD133<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells during the metastatic transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005395-Shmelkov1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. ATC is an undifferentiated thyroid cancer, and its behavior is largely different from colon cancer. For example, we found that normal thyroid cells do not express CD133. Moreover, both CD133<sup>&#x0002b;/high</sup> and CD133<sup>&#x0002b;/low</sup> subsets can initiate tumor growth in NOD/SCID mice, but CD133<sup>&#x0002b;/high</sup> cells generate more aggressive tumors than CD133<sup>&#x0002b;/low</sup> cells. It is not clear in our study which CD133 subsets play a role in ATC metastases. Our current xenograft model depends upon the subcutaneous transplantation of CD133 cells into NOD/SCID mice. This location is not a normal niche of thyroid cancer cells and may not faithfully recapitulate the environment experienced by the cancer cells in the original tumor. Although we have shown that tumors derived from either bulk or sorted ARO cell populations are remarkably similar to the primary tumor, it is conceivable that the thyroid bed may better support the growth and differentiation of thyroid CSCs. This point is even more important when we consider that ATC is a locally aggressive type of thyroid tumor with high rate of distant metastases. Therefore, it is critically important to establish an orthotopic model in which tumor cells are injected directly into the thyroid gland <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005395-Ahn1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We found that CD133<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells preferentially overexpress genes, such as Oct4, that are normally enriched in embryonic stem cells. Our previous RT-PCR gene expression profiles indicate that ATC cell lines express the embryonic stem cell markers Rex1, Oct4 and Nanog. The expression of a number of endodermal markers, including Sox17, Foxa2 and Sox 7, is also detected (data not shown). Although these cancer cell lines also express TSHR and the thyroid transcription factor Pax8, other markers of terminally differentiated thyroid cells, such as the sodium-iodide symporter and thyroglobulin, are not expressed in these cell lines (Friedman and Lin, unpublished observations). These results are in agreement with those reported by Zito <italic>et al</italic> who found that ARO/CD133<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells express the thyroblast-specific transcription factor TTF-1 and Oct4, but not thyroglobulin, thyroperoxidase or sodium-iodine symporter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005395-Zito1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Together these findings indicate that ATC cells have not only begun to proliferate uncontrollably, a property common to all cancer cells, but also that they are losing characteristics of differentiated thyroid cells. Our results reveal a previously unknown link between genes associated with embryonic stem cells and thyroid cells and support the possibility that these genes contribute to the CSC-like phenotypes exhibited by many tumors. These observations suggest that the regulatory networks controlling the function of thyroid cells may also be active in ATCs. Our discovery that TSH can regulate the proliferation and growth of CD133<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells may have important implications. Clinically, the highest incidence of thyroid cancer occurs in patients with abnormally elevated TSH levels. We found that CD133<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells overexpress the TSHR gene. Furthermore, this expression is positively regulated by TSH, implying an autoregulatory feedback mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005395-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). It is important to further investigate how TSH affects the proliferation of CD133<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells and, by extension, that of other CSCs. The role of Oct4 activation in cancer survival and the genes and proteins that facilitate the self-renewal of CD133<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> also warrant investigation.</p><fig id="pone-0005395-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005395.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Model depicting the role of TSH signaling in ATC development.</title><p>TSH, thyroid stimulating hormone, TSHR, the receptor for thyroid stimulating hormone, Red circle, CD133<sup>&#x0002b;/high</sup> cells, blue circle, CD133<sup>&#x0002b;/low</sup> cells, yellow circle, CD133<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0005395.g007"/></fig><p>In summary, our identification of these tumorigenic ATC cells is a critical first step in understanding how TSH signaling affects the growth of CD133<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells and in developing more effective therapies for ATC. The diagnosis of ATC currently relies on a complex panel of pathological parameters and the use of CD133 as a novel marker to identify ATC-cancer-initiating cells may be a more reliable way to detect and monitor cancer progression. These findings should stimulate additional studies to determine whether quantitative or qualitative differences in CD133 expression in ATC have prognostic value. Furthermore, they suggest that CD133 may itself be a potential therapeutic target in this disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Human thyroid cancer cell culture</title><p>Two undifferentiated human anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cell lines (ARO and FRO), and two poorly differentiated human papillary thyroid carcinoma cell lines (NPA and TPC), were obtained from Dr. James Fagin (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York).
