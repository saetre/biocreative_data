Here, we have performed a microscopy-based genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells to identify proteins required for centriole duplication and mitotic PCM recruitment. We analysed 92&#x00025; of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome (13,059 genes) and identified 32 genes involved in centrosome function. An extensive series of secondary screens classified these genes into four categories: (1) nine are required for centriole duplication, (2) 11 are required for centrosome maturation, (3) nine are required for both functions, and (4) three genes regulate centrosome separation. These 32 hits include several new centrosomal components, some of which have human homologs. In addition, we find that the individual depletion of only two proteins, Polo and Centrosomin (Cnn) can completely block centrosome maturation. Cnn is phosphorylated during mitosis in a Polo-dependent manner, suggesting that the Polo-dependent phosphorylation of Cnn initiates centrosome maturation in flies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>A major goal of the cell cycle is to accurately separate the duplicated chromosomes between two daughter cells. To achieve this, a pair of centrosomes organise a bipolar spindle made of microtubules; the chromosomes line up on the spindle and are then separated to the two spindle poles. Centrosomes are also required for the formation of cilia and flagella, which are present in many eukaryotic cells; centrosome dysfunction is a common feature of many human cancers and several neurological disorders, whereas mutations in genes that affect cilia function give rise to several human diseases. Here, we perform a genome-wide screen using RNA interference to try to identify all of the proteins required for centrosome function in the model organism <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila melanogaster</named-content> (a fruitfly). We identified all 16 of the centrosomal proteins that were already known to be required for centrosome function in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, as well as 16 new centrosomal components or regulators. We confirmed the centrosomal location of several of the components and performed some analysis of their functions.

Finally, defects in cilia function have been identified as the cause of several human syndromes such as Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) and Kartagener's syndrome, which lead to relatively pleiotropic defects during the development of affected individuals &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060224-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060224-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Although more than one hundred proteins are concentrated at centrosomes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060224-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060224-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;, it is unclear how these proteins are assembled into a functional unit, and how many of these proteins are actually required for centrosome function. Traditional genetic screens and genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screens in the early <named-content content-type="genus-species">Caenorhabditis elegans</named-content> embryo have identified just four proteins that are essential for centriole duplication (ZYG-1, SAS-4, SAS-5, and SAS-6), three that are essential for the recruitment of the PCM to the centrioles during mitosis (SPD-5, Protein Phosphatase-4 &#x0005b;PP-4&#x0005d;, and the Aurora A kinase &#x0005b;AIR1&#x0005d;), and one that appears to have a role in both processes (SPD-2) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060224-b020">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060224-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, a surprisingly small number of proteins appear to be essential for these &#x0201c;core&#x0201d; centrosomal functions in worms. Experiments in other systems, however, have identified many additional proteins that appear to have a role in centrosome maturation and/or centriole duplication (&#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060224-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d; and references therein; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060224-b027">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060224-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;). As the initial genome-wide screens in worms were not specifically designed to identify proteins required for centrosome function, it remains unclear how many proteins are required for the key functions of centriole duplication and centrosome maturation.</p><p>Here, we have performed a genome-wide RNAi screen in <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissue culture cells (S2R&#x0002b;) designed to identify proteins required for centriole duplication and centrosome maturation. After an extensive series of localisation studies and secondary screens, we have identified just 32 proteins that are required for these core centrosomal processes. Importantly, this screen successfully identified every <italic>Drosophila</italic> protein that had previously been implicated in centriole duplication and/or centrosome maturation, as well as several new factors, some of which have been implicated in centrosome function in other systems, and some of which are novel proteins that we confirm are components of the centrosome. Thus, we believe we are approaching a near-complete inventory of proteins required for these processes in flies. Finally, we noticed that only the depletion of either Polo kinase or Centrosomin (Cnn) could completely suppress centrosome maturation, indicating that they are major players in this process. We show that Cnn is phosphorylated exclusively during mitosis in a manner that is dependent on Polo kinase, and that these two proteins are codependent for their localisation at centrosomes. This suggests that the Polo-dependent phosphorylation of Cnn plays a crucial part in initiating centrosome maturation in flies.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>A Genome-Wide RNAi Screen for Proteins Required to Recruit Cnn to Mitotic Centrosomes</title><p>We devised a microscopy-based screen to search for proteins required for centriole duplication and centrosome maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060224-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060224-g001">1</xref>B). We used a library of double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) targeted against 13,059 individual genes (approximately 92&#x00025; of all predicted protein-coding genes in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila melanogaster</named-content>) to deplete individual proteins in S2R&#x0002b; cells. Treated cells were grown for 4 d in 384-well plates, then incubated with colchicine to depolymerise the MTs and arrest cells in mitosis for 8 h prior to fixation. The colchicine treatment increased the number of mitotic cells to facilitate the analysis, but did not interfere with centrosome maturation, which occurs robustly even in the absence of centrosomal MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060224-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). Cells were then fixed and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy with antibodies raised against phospho-histone H3 (p-H3) to identify mitotic cells and Cnn to label the PCM. The colchicine arrest often prevented proper centrosome separation and resulted in a mix of mitotic cells with one or two centrosomes (1.2&#x02013;1.5 centrosomes per mitotic cell on average&#x02014;see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p><fig id="pbio-0060224-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>A Genome-Wide RNAi Screen for Centrosome Defects</title><p>(A) A summary of the genome-wide RNAi screen.

Thus, proteins that cause defects in the mitotic recruitment of Cnn to centrosomes are also likely to be general recruitment factors that are required for the proper recruitment of many other PCM components. Moreover, we reasoned that this screen would also identify proteins that are required for centriole duplication, as the PCM only assembles on the centriole scaffold in flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060224-g001">Figure 1</xref>C) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060224-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;.

First, each well of RNAi-treated cells was examined manually on a fluorescence microscope. Second, digital images of four fields of cells (typically containing more than 50 mitotic cells/field) from each well were acquired automatically and analysed manually.

Nine proteins appeared to be required primarily for efficient centriole duplication (Class I, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060224-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). The depletion of these proteins led to a reduction in the number of centrioles and centrosomes per cell, but in those cells that retained centrioles, the recruitment of the PCM was largely unperturbed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060224-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060224-sg001">S1</xref>). Nine proteins appeared to be required for both efficient centriole duplication and efficient PCM recruitment (Class II, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060224-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). The depletion of these proteins led to a reduction in the average number of centrioles per cell, and in those cells that retained centrioles, the recruitment of the PCM to the centrioles was also reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060224-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060224-sg001">S1</xref>). Eleven proteins appeared to be required primarily for the efficient recruitment of the PCM to the centrioles (Class III, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060224-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). The depletion of these proteins had only a minor effect on the average number of centrioles per cell, but significantly reduced the amount of PCM that was recruited to the centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060224-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060224-sg001">S1</xref>).

The upper (phosphorylated) form of Cnn, however, was undetectable on much longer exposures of this blot, and we consistently failed to detect this upper band in several independent Polo-depletion experiments (unpublished data). Thus, we are very confident that the absence of this band from the Polo-depleted cells is not simply due to the lower amount of protein loaded in this lane.</p><p>(D) Western blot analysis of a 2-D gel of nontreated cycling S2R&#x0002b; cell extracts (N) or extracts enriched for mitotic cells by colchicine treatment (M) treated with a control dsRNA (GFP) or a dsRNA against Polo.

As well as recovering all known <italic>Drosophila</italic> proteins that had previously been implicated in these processes, we identified several fly homologs of centrosomal proteins previously identified in other systems, and several new proteins that had not previously been implicated in centrosome function, some of which have homologs in other systems. We show that several of these new proteins are centrosomal components, indicating that they probably have a direct role in centrosome function.</p><p>One surprising aspect of our results was the identification of a relatively large number of proteins (nine) that appear to be required for both centriole duplication and centrosome maturation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0060224-t002">Table 2</xref>). It is unclear, however, whether these proteins have separate functions in these processes. Previous studies in worms and human cells have revealed that although centrosome maturation is not essential for centriole duplication, the recruitment of at least some PCM components to the centrioles is required for this process to occur efficiently &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060224-b063">63</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060224-b065">65</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, although the proteins we identify in this class do not have a particularly strong defect in centrosome maturation (compared to Cnn and Polo, for example, which have stronger defects in centrosome maturation, but no defects in centriole duplication), it may be that these proteins play a particularly important part in recruiting a small amount of PCM to the centrioles during S-phase, and that this is required for efficient centriole duplication. Alternatively, some or all of these proteins may only be required for efficient centriole duplication, but their partial depletion may lead to the formation of defective centrioles that no longer efficiently recruit PCM. Further investigation will reveal how these proteins regulate these two processes, but it is clear that Asl/Cep152, DCep135 (CG17081), DCP110 (CG14617), DCep97 (CG3980), Rcd4 (CG17259), (which so far has no homolog outside of insects), and calmodulin are all centrosomal components that are required for efficient centriole duplication and/or efficient PCM recruitment in fly cells.</p><p>Studies in worm embryos have identified just five proteins that are required for centriole duplication, and these have been ordered into a functional pathway: SPD-2 recruits the kinase ZYG-1, which recruits SAS-5 and SAS-6, which in turn recruit SAS-4 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060224-b020">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060224-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. Proteins related to ZYG-1, SAS-6, and SAS-4 are required for centriole duplication in several other systems, and it has been postulated that these five proteins constitute a conserved &#x0201c;core&#x0201d; centriole duplication machinery &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060224-b066">66</xref>&#x0005d;. Previous studies in fly cells suggested that three additional proteins (Ana1&#x02013;3) may also be required for centriole duplication (inferred from a lack of astral MTs in spindles and absence of &#x003b3;-tubulin at the poles when these proteins were depleted), and Ana1 and Ana2 were shown to localise to centrioles &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060224-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. We have confirmed these results and extended them by directly showing that centriole numbers decrease in cells depleted of Ana1&#x02013;3. Further experiments will be required, however, to determine whether these proteins are part of the conserved &#x0201c;core&#x0201d; centriole duplication machinery.</p><p>It is worth noting that whereas SPD-2 is a key initiator of centriole duplication in worm embryos &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060224-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060224-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;, DSpd-2 was only picked up in our screen as being required for PCM recruitment (see below), consistent with previous analyses of DSpd-2 mutant flies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060224-b051">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060224-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d;. Whether human Spd-2/Cep192 has a role in centriole duplication that is independent of its role in PCM recruitment remains controversial &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060224-b067">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060224-b068">68</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, the exact role of this family of proteins in centriole duplication and PCM maturation remains to be clarified.</p><p>We believe we have now identified most, if not all, of the major structural components required for general PCM assembly during mitosis (see below). Cnn, DSpd-2, D-PLP, &#x003b3;-tubulin, and Grip71WD are all components of the PCM, whereas Map205 is a MT-associated protein that is present in the PCM. Polo and a specific form of PP2A appear likely to play regulatory roles in this process. Moreover, although the depletion of Aurora A and UbcD6 causes primarily a centriole-clustering phenotype, the recruitment of PCM to individual centrioles is reduced when either of these proteins is depleted, indicating that they too play a part in centrosome maturation. Although it remains unclear how these proteins work together to drive centrosome maturation, the individual depletion of two of these proteins, Cnn and Polo, consistently perturbed centrosome maturation to a greater extent than the depletion of any of the other proteins. This indicates that these two proteins may initiate the centrosome maturation pathway in flies. In support of this possibility, we found that Cnn is specifically phosphorylated during mitosis in a Polo-dependent manner. More experiments are required, however, to determine whether Polo phosphorylates Cnn directly, and whether this phosphorylation event really initiates centrosome maturation, or is simply correlated with it.</p><p>Interestingly, it has previously been postulated that Cnn functions primarily to &#x0201c;strengthen&#x0201d; the structure of the PCM, thus preventing the PCM from dissipating away from the centrosomes soon after it is recruited &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060224-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. An attractive model is that the Polo-dependent phosphorylation of Cnn may initiate centrosome maturation by allowing Cnn to strengthen the PCM. In such a scenario, the centrioles would actively recruit PCM at all stages of the cell cycle, but in the absence of phosphorylated Cnn, the PCM is structurally weak, and it cannot accumulate to any extent around the centrioles. As cells enter mitosis, Polo phosphorylates Cnn (either directly or indirectly), thus allowing it to strengthen the PCM, which can then accumulate around the centrioles.</p><p>An important question is whether the proteins we identify here represent a complete list of those required for centriole duplication and centrosome maturation in flies. Clearly, we may have missed some proteins. Our screen probed only approximately 92&#x00025; of protein-coding genes, and 108 proteins could not be tested because there were not enough mitotic cells to be scored after their depletion. In addition, some proteins may not have been detected because they are poorly depleted by RNAi, or because their depletion produced such pleiotropic defects that centrosome defects could not be scored properly. On the other hand, all 13 of the known fly proteins previously implicated in centrosome maturation (Polo, Aurora A, Cnn, DSpd-2, D-PLP, Asl, and &#x003b3;-tubulin) or centriole duplication (DSas-4, DSas-6, Sak, Ana1, Ana2, and Ana3) were successfully identified in our screen. This is despite the fact that many centriolar proteins are known to be difficult to deplete by RNAi &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060224-b042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060224-b069">69</xref>&#x0005d; (J. Dobbelaere, unpublished data). Moreover, the depletion of proteins such as Polo and Aurora A clearly produces pleiotropic mitotic defects, yet both proteins were successfully identified in our screen.</p><p>Taken together, these observations suggest that it is unlikely we are missing large numbers of proteins from this list, and that we are at least approaching a near-complete inventory of the proteins required for centriole duplication and centrosome maturation in flies. Although this list is significantly larger than the list that has emerged from studies in worm embryos, it is still surprisingly small, and we conclude that only a relatively small subset of the many proteins concentrated at centrosomes is actually essential for the key centrosomal functions of duplication and maturation. Clearly, this extensive dataset provides an important framework with which to delineate the events that drive the centrosome cycle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Preparation of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> RNAi library.</title><p>An RNAi library covering nearly the whole <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome was purchased from Ambion (Silencer(R) <italic>Drosophila</italic> RNAi Library, AM85000).

Second, the pictures taken with the automated microscope were manually scored using the same criteria. All of these analyses were performed &#x0201c;blind,&#x0201d; so that we did not know which genes were being analysed.

Each bar represents the mean intensity of PCM staining (Cnn) from three independent experiments, each analysing more than 20 centrosomes. Error bars represent the SE; a single asterisk (&#x0002a;) or double asterisks (&#x0002a;&#x0002a;) indicate <italic>p</italic> &#x02264; 0.05 or <italic>p</italic> &#x02264; 0.01 compared to control, respectively. Note that from this experiment, one cannot infer the strength of the defect in PCM recruitment in Cnn-depleted cells, but that Cnn depletion gave an equally strong reduction of the PCM when stained with the PCM markers &#x003b3;-tubulin and DSpd-2.</p><p>(382 KB AI)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.0060224.sg001.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio-0060224-sg002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><title>A Failure in Centrosome Separation Is the Main Phenotype Observed in <italic>aurora A</italic> Mutant Brain Cells</title><p>(A&#x02013;D) Wild-type (<italic>w<sup>67</sup></italic>) or <italic>aurora-A</italic> mutant (<italic>aur<sup>e200/e209</sup></italic>) 3rd instar larval brains were stained with anti&#x02013;&#x003b1;-tubulin (red) and anti-Cnn (green) antibodies and counterstained with Hoechst (blue).</p><p>(E) Graph depicting the centriole numbers in mitotic cells in control (grey) and <italic>aurora-A</italic> mutants (red).
