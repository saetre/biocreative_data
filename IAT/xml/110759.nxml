We show that the enhancer activity of the region depends on a 44 bp sequence centered on a CACCC motif. The sequence is the target of the two zinc fingers transcription factors BKLF and YY1. The introduction of a mutation destroying the CACCC box impairs the binding of BKLF but improves that of YY1. Moreover, the mutated sequence behaves as a negative control element, suggesting that BKLF behaves as a positive factor and that YY1 is a negative one. We also demonstrate the existence of a novel, tissue-specific AFP mRNA isoform present in the yolk sac and fetal liver which initiates from an alternative promoter located &#x0223c;100 bp downstream of the enhancer element. The transcriptional start site controlled by this new promoter (called P2), was mapped to 66 bp downstream of a TATA box. A putative AUG translation site in-frame with exon 2 of the classical gene was found 295 bp downstream of the transcription start site. Like the traditional AFP promoter (P1), the P2 promoter is active in the yolk sac and fetal liver. Embryonic stem cells with an AFP knock-in gene containing either the P2 promoter or deleted for it were isolated and comparative analysis of embryonic bodies derived from these cells suggests that the P2 promoter contributes to early expression of the AFP gene.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The albumin gene family comprises four known genes expressed specifically in the liver and encoding serum albumin (ALB), &#x003b1;-fetoprotein (AFP), &#x003b1;-albumin (ALF) and vitamin D-binding protein (Gc, group-specific component) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c5">5</xref>). These related genes produce specialized products characterized by specific patterns of expression. The molecular basis of the differential gene expression is only partially explained. Two recent reviews provide a general overview of AFP regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c7">7</xref>). The AFP gene is an attractive gene for studying tissue-specific and developmental transcription regulation. Indeed, this gene is transcribed at high levels in the visceral endoderm, the yolk sac and fetal hepatocytes and at low levels in the fetal gut. Expression is shut off at birth, so that the normal adult liver produces 10<sup>3</sup>- to 10<sup>4</sup>-fold less AFP mRNA than the fetal liver&#x000a0;(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c10">10</xref>). The AFP gene can be reactivated in the adult during liver regeneration or in the case of hepatocarcinomas or teratomas. The AFP gene has a large and complex transcription control region. <italic>cis</italic>-acting control domains that govern AFP expression have been identified by transfection assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c15">15</xref>) and by insertion of transgenes into mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c17">17</xref>). Three upstream enhancer regions have been defined. They are several hundred nucleotides long and are active in most tissues, although at various levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c21">21</xref>). The AFP promoter, covering a region of &#x0223c;250 bp, is regulated by tissue-specific activators such as HNF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c22">22</xref>), C&#x0002f;EBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c23">23</xref>), Nkx2.8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c24">24</xref>) and FTF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c25">25</xref>), as well as by ubiquitous factors like NF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c26">26</xref>). Promoter activity is limited to tissues producing AFP, indicating that this region contributes to tissue-specific expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c28">28</xref>). In addition, it has been suggested that a region in the first intron of AFP participates in the control of gene activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c13">13</xref>); indeed, a 146 bp sequence located in the first intron stimulates transcription of a reporter gene preceded by the AFP promoter. The purpose of this work was to characterize this regulatory region. We report that it contains two regulatory elements: an enhancer able to act on the upstream promoter and an alternative promoter active in the yolk sac and fetal liver.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Gel retardation analysis</title><p>Nuclei of HepG2 human hepatoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c29">29</xref>) were isolated from sub-confluent cultures as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c13">13</xref>) and nuclear extracts were prepared according to a procedure as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c30">30</xref>). DNA probes were prepared by 3&#x02032;-end-labeling with &#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;dATP and Klenow enzyme. Binding reactions were performed on ice in a final volume of 25 &#x000b5;l &#x0005b;10&#x000a0;mM HEPES&#x02013;KOH, pH 7.9, 30 mM KCl, 12&#x00025; glycerol, 5&#x000a0;mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1 mM EDTA&#x0005d;.

In competition experiments the competitor was pre-incubated with nuclear extract and poly(dI&#x02013;dC) for 20 min on ice before incubation with the probe. A Sp1 target sequence (5&#x02032;-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3&#x02032;), a Sp1 mutated sequence (5&#x02032;-ATTCGATCGGTTCGGGGCGAGC-3&#x02032;) and a YY1 target sequence (5&#x02032;-CGCTCCGCGGCCATCTTGGCGGCTGGT-3&#x02032;) were used as competitors. For DNA binding assays in which antibodies were included, antibodies were added to the binding mixtures and incubated for 30 min on ice before addition of radiolabeled oligonucleotide. Anti-BKLF was a gift from M. Crossley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c31">31</xref>). Polyclonal rabbit antiserum against the YY1 protein was purchased from Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA).

The first one was classical chromatography. Aliquots of 5 mg HepG2 nuclear extract were prepared and fractioned by ion exchange chromatography on an FPLC system (Hi trap Q; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK). The fractions containing C3 activity were monitored by band shift assay using the 44-mut bp probe. DNA affinity chromatography of pooled active fractions was performed on a SMART system with a NHS-activated Superose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK) coupled with a multimer of 44-mut bp sequence as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c32">32</xref>) and according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Proteins were eluted with band shift buffer containing increasing amounts of KCl. Protein fractions were TCA precipitated, washed with acetone, resuspended in sample buffer and incubated in boiling water for 3 min prior to analysis by SDS&#x02013;PAGE. The second strategy was based on preparative band shifts in a Prep Cell system (model 491; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Aliquots of 120&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g HepG2 nuclear extract were incubated with <sup>32</sup>P-labeled 44-mut bp probe (100 000 c.p.m.) under the band shift assay conditions. The binding reaction was loaded on the Prep Cell column containing a 5&#x00025; non-denaturing acrylamide gel in 1&#x000d7; TBE. The fractions collected were monitored for radioactivity and the labeled fractions were subjected to a band shift assay and to SDS&#x02013;PAGE.

A single complex was obtained (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd544f1">1</xref>B, lane 1, C0). The reaction product was specific since this shift was eliminated by competition with the homologous unlabeled probe (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd544f1">1</xref>B, lanes 6 and 7). To determine whether this complex was due to Sp&#x0002f;XKLF family factors, new gel mobility shift assays were performed using HepG2 nuclear extracts and, as a competitor, an oligonucleotide corresponding to the most common Sp1 binding site (GC box, see Materials and Methods). The C0 shift was specifically abolished by this oligonucleotide (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd544f1">1</xref>B, lanes 2 and 3). This shift thus appears to result from binding of a factor(s) belonging to the Sp&#x0002f;XKLF family. Among these factors, BKLF (for basic Kr&#x000fc;ppel-like factor; also called KLF3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c31">31</xref>) binds the CACCC motif and is known to be abundant in the mouse yolk sac and fetal liver, i.e. in AFP-expressing tissues. An antibody directed against BKLF was added to the gel shift assay reactions; under these conditions, complex C0 was strongly inhibited and a supershift was clearly visible (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd544f1">1</xref>B, lane 9). This result shows that BKLF binds the 22 bp segment and is (at least partially) responsible for the C0 shift. A longer sequence centered on the 22 bp oligonucleotide (and thus on the CACCC motif) covering the segment from &#x0002b;347 to &#x0002b;390&#x000a0;bp (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd544f1">1</xref>A, 44 bp) was also used in band shift assays. Five DNA&#x02013;protein complexes were obtained with this 44 bp probe (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd544f1">1</xref>C, lane 8, C1&#x02013;C5). The C2 and C4 shifts were abolished when the 22 bp sequence was used as competitor, strongly suggesting that these shifts contain BKLF as the main component. Moreover, an oligonucleotide mutated in the CACCC motif (44-mut bp, 10 bp including the CACCC box were mutated; see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd544f1">1</xref>A) was unable to compete for formation of the C2 and C4 complexes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd544f1">1</xref>C, lanes 1&#x02013;3) and, when the mutated sequence was used as probe, the C2 and C4 complexes were not formed while formation of the C3 and C5 shifts was improved (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd544f1">1</xref>C, lane 9). The later observation suggests that BKLF competes with the factor(s) generating the C3 and C5 shifts. In order to identify this factor(s), HepG2 nuclear extracts were partially purified either by ion exchange chromatography followed by affinity chromatography (FPLC) or by preparative gel shifts. With the purified extracts and the 44 bp or 44-mut bp probe, the C3 complex was still produced, and even reinforced with the 44-mut bp probe. The same extracts showed a major protein of 68 kDa on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). This protein must be a zinc finger protein because the C3 shift disappeared in the presence of the specific zinc chelator 1,10-phenathroline. The 44 bp and 44-mut bp sequences contain a potential binding site for the multifunctional zinc finger protein YY1, which has a molecular weight of 68 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c46">46</xref>). To test the role of YY1 in formation of the C3 complex, the 44-mut bp sequence was used as probe and incubated with purified HepG2 nuclear extracts (in this case only the C3 complex was observed) and either an unlabeled oligonucleotide containing a YY1 binding site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd544f1">1</xref>D, lanes 2 and 3) or an antibody specific to YY1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd544f1">1</xref>D, lane 4). The C3 complex disappeared under these conditions and a supershift was observed in the presence of the antibody. These results thus show that the 347&#x02013;390 bp sequence possesses binding sites for BKLF and YY1 and suggest that in the presence of BKLF, binding of YY1 to its site is reduced.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of the regulatory role of the 44 bp intronic sequence</title><p>To determine whether the region containing the binding sites for BKLF and YY1 is involved in the activity of the 142 bp intronic region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c13">13</xref>), the 44 bp and 44-mut bp sequences were inserted as monomers or as multimers (two or four) in chimeric constructs between the AFP promoter region (&#x02013;1023 to &#x0002b;33) and the CAT reporter gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd544f1">1</xref>A and Materials and Methods). The different constructs were transfected into HepG2 cells and CAT activities were compared. The results are summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd544f2">2</xref>. They show that the constructs containing the 44 bp sequence are more active than the constructs lacking this sequence or containing the 44-mut bp sequence. Furthermore, their respective activities increase with the number of copies of the 44 bp sequence. The 44 bp sequence thus behaves as an enhancer, acting on the upstream promoter. Moreover, the constructs bearing the 44-mut bp sequence are less active than the constructs lacking the 44 bp sequence, suggesting that the mutation transforms the 44 bp sequence into a negative element. Since the mutated sequence no longer binds BKLF and is a better target for YY1, these results strongly suggest that BKLF and YY1 control the activity of the 44 bp sequence oppositely, BKLF stimulating its activity and YY1 repressing it.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of a variant AFP mRNA</title><p>Computer analysis of the intron 1 sequence not only revealed the presence of putative binding sites for transcription factors but also indicated the presence of two TATA boxes. One or two alternative promoters could thus exist in the region determined to be the first intron of the AFP gene. In order to test this hypothesis, RT&#x02013;PCR amplification was done on RNA preparations using forward primers complementary to sequences of the first intron (<italic>prointra1</italic> located downstream of the second TATA box and <italic>prointra2</italic> located between the two TATA boxes; see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd544f3">3</xref>A). For the first strand cDNA synthesis another primer, <italic>mAFP2</italic>, complementary to a sequence of exon 6, was used. Finally, a primer corresponding to a sequence in the first exon, <italic>mAFP1</italic>, was used as a control to amplify the cDNA complementary to the traditional mRNA originally described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c47">47</xref>). With the <italic>mAFP1</italic> and <italic>mAFP2</italic> primers and using RNA preparations from mouse yolk sac and fetal and adult liver, an 838 bp fragment was amplified in the yolk sac and fetal liver cases (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd544f3">3</xref>B, lanes 2 and 4). In addition, a cDNA of 992 bp was amplified from the yolk sac and fetal liver with <italic>prointra1</italic> and <italic>mAFP2</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd544f3">3</xref>B, lane 3, yolk sac, and lane 5, fetal liver) but no amplification was obtained using the <italic>prointra2</italic> and <italic>mAFP2</italic> primers, indicating the existence of a transcript which covers the <italic>prointra1</italic> sequence (downstream of the second TATA box) but not that of <italic>prointra2</italic> (upstream of the second TATA box). No cDNA was produced from the adult liver with any primer pair (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd544f3">3</xref>B, lanes 6 and 7). The sequence of the 992 bp RT&#x02013;PCR product was determined and revealed that this cDNA corresponded to the expected one: this cDNA starts at the beginning of <italic>prointra1</italic>, reaches and includes exon 2 and ends in exon 6, thereby defining an alternative exon 1 (exon 1&#x02032;, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd544f3">3</xref>A). A novel transcription start site is thus active in this region, which we will call P2, designating the traditional AFP promoter P1. We will continue to use the base numbering of Tilghman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c47">47</xref>) and in this context the P2 promoter is thus located between position &#x0002b;470 (corresponding to the end of the <italic>prointra2</italic> primer) and &#x0002b;722 (corresponding to&#x000a0;the beginning of the <italic>prointra1</italic> primer). The <italic>prointra1</italic> and <italic>mAFP2</italic> primers were also used for RT&#x02013;PCR amplification with RNA preparations from murine AFP-producing hepatoma cells (BWTG3) and the corresponding human primers were used with RNA preparations from human AFP-producing hepatoma cells (HepG2). In both cases no amplification product was obtained.</p><p>The AFP mRNAs controlled by promoters P1 and P2 thus co-exist in the murine yolk sac and fetal liver. Both are absent in the murine adult liver and only one (the P1 mRNA) is present in hepatoma cells, suggesting that the two AFP transcripts are subject to different regulation mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of the transcription start site controlled by the P2 promoter</title><p>The transcriptional start site controlled by the P2 promoter was identified by primer extension and RNase protection experiments carried out on total RNA purified from murine yolk sac and fetal liver. Using a reverse primer corresponding to the sequence located between &#x0002b;591 and &#x0002b;575 bp, a major transcription start site was identified at position &#x0002b;541 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd544f4">4</xref>A), &#x0223c;66 bp downstream of the second TATAA box. The RNA probe (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd544f4">4</xref>C and Materials and Methods) was hybridized to total RNA and subjected to digestion by RNase T1 and RNase A in order to remove unhybridized RNA. A protected fragment of &#x0223c;200 bp was detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd544f4">4</xref>B). This size corresponds to that of a segment extending from the <italic>prointra1</italic> primer 5&#x02032;-end to the position of the start site (&#x0002b;541) identified by the above primer extension experiment. The signal observed after RNase protection was stronger with yolk sac RNA than with fetal liver RNA, suggesting that the P2 promoter is more active in the yolk sac. Sequence analysis of the region downstream of the P2 promoter revealed a putative AUG translation start site (at &#x0002b;838 bp) in exon 1&#x02032; which is in-frame with the traditional exon 2.</p></sec><sec><title>Activity of the AFP promoters during the early steps of gene transcription activation</title><p>It has been suggested that EBs may serve as an <italic>in vitro</italic> system to study the early steps of AFP activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c48">48</xref>). We used the potential of aggregated ES cells to differentiate <italic>in vitro</italic> in EBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c49">49</xref>) to assess the role of the P2 promoter in turning on AFP transcription. Homologous recombination in ES cells was used to produce cells with a <italic>knock-in</italic> AFP gene in which the bacterial LacZ gene replaces part of the gene: either the sequence from &#x0002b;72 to &#x0002b;2773 bp (pAFP K.O-1) or that from &#x0002b;973 to &#x0002b;2773 bp (pAFP K.O-2) (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd544f5">5</xref>). The pAFP-KO.2 chimeric gene contains the P2 promoter described above (at &#x0002b;541 bp) whereas the pAFP-KO.1 chimeric gene does not. Previous studies with EBs showed that AFP expression starts a few days before the appearance of autonomous beating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c48">48</xref>). In our study we observed that during EB differentiation, expression of &#x003b2;-galactosidase was detected 5 days earlier with cells containing the pAFP K.O-2 transgene than with those containing the pAFP K.O-1 vector and that &#x003b2;-galactosidase expression by EBs containing the pAFP K.O-2 vector was observed a few days before the appearance of autonomous beating cells, just like AFP expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c48">48</xref>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd544f5">5</xref>B). These results suggest that the P2 promoter is responsible for earlier expression of the AFP gene.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In a previous study we suggested that a region located in the first intron of the mouse AFP gene and containing a methylable cytosine at &#x0002b;347 bp behaves as an enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c13">13</xref>). We report here that this cytosine is included in a CACCC box and that a 44 bp segment centered on this motif binds nuclear factors. One of these factors is BKLF, a transcription factor which belongs to the Sp&#x0002f;XKLF family and binds the CACCC motif with high affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c31">31</xref>). Another factor is YY1, a multifunctional zinc finger protein that activates or represses gene transcription in a promoter context-dependent manner and is capable of acting as an initiator of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c46">46</xref>). In transfection experiments, the 44 bp segment stimulates the activity of the upstream AFP promoter but a mutation destroying the CACCC motif eliminates the binding of BKLF and abrogates this stimulatory activity. Furthermore, the mutated element, on the one hand, acquires an inhibitory activity and, on the other hand, binds YY1 more efficiently. These observations strongly suggest that BKLF acts as a positive factor whereas YY1 acts as an inhibitor and that the binding of YY1 is hindered by BKLF.</p><p>The first intron of the mouse AFP gene also contains two TATA boxes, downstream of the BKLF and YY1 binding sites, suggesting that this region could thus behave as a promoter. In recent years several examples of alternative promoters that direct the transcription of multiple RNA transcripts from a single gene have been described (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c54">54</xref>). We thus tested whether an alternative promoter exists in the AFP gene and using RT&#x02013;PCR we could demonstrate the existence of a previously undetected mRNA isoform. The combination of primer extension analysis and protection assay has revealed that transcription initiates 66 bp downstream of a TATA sequence located at position &#x0002b;475 (according to the numbering of ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c47">47</xref>). These results thus show that an alternative promoter is located in the region known as intron 1 (promoter P2 at &#x0002b;541). We showed that production of the novel transcript is, as for the traditional one, regulated in a tissue-specific and developmental manner. It is present in the yolk sac, less abundant in the fetal liver and absent in the adult liver. The use of these two alternative promoters will result in the production of at least two mRNA isoforms that differ in their 5&#x02032;-untranslated region. A putative AUG codon was found 297 bp downstream of the new transcriptional start site and is in-frame with the traditional exon 2, located at &#x0002b;838 bp. The novel variant mRNA must thus contain a relatively long 5&#x02032;-untranslated region and the N-terminal region of the corresponding protein could be different from that of the traditional AFP, at least before processing. Different 5&#x02032; mRNA sequences can lead to variations in translation efficiencies of the mRNA, different cellular distributions of the proteins and finally to proteins with different functions.</p><p>From a study of transgenic mice generated with a transgene lacking the AFP exonic and intronic sequences, it has been concluded that proper transcriptional control of the AFP gene does not require intragenic sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd544c17">17</xref>). However, this analysis started at day 16.5, i.e. with a relatively long delay after the AFP gene had been switched on. We have shown that EBs carrying a <italic>knock-in</italic> gene containing both the P1 and P2 promoters produce transcript which is turned on 5 days before that of EBs carrying a <italic>knock-in</italic> gene containing the P1 promoter only. The P2 promoter thus probably contributes to earlier gene expression. <italic>Knock-in</italic> mice carrying the <italic>knock-in</italic> genes with either the P1 promoter alone or with both the P1 and P2 promoters will be interesting to analyze in this respect.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd544f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Gel retardation assays with hepatoma cell (HepG2) extracts and different probes.
