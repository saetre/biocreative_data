Most segmental progerias are associated with accelerated fibroblast senescence, suggesting that cellular senescence is a likely contributing mechanism. Contrary to expectations, neither accelerated senescence nor acute oxidative stress hypersensitivity was detected in primary fibroblast or erythroblast cultures from multiple progeroid mouse models for defects in the nucleotide excision DNA repair pathway, which share premature aging features including postnatal growth retardation, cerebellar ataxia, and death before weaning. Instead, we report a prominent phenotypic overlap with long-lived dwarfism and calorie restriction during postnatal development (2 wk of age), including reduced size, reduced body temperature, hypoglycemia, and perturbation of the growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor 1 neuroendocrine axis. These symptoms were also present at 2 wk of age in a novel progeroid nucleotide excision repair-deficient mouse model (XPD<sup>G602D/R722W</sup>/XPA<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) that survived weaning with high penetrance. However, despite persistent cachectic dwarfism, blood glucose and serum insulin-like growth factor 1 levels returned to normal by 10 wk, with hypoglycemia reappearing near premature death at 5 mo of age. These data strongly suggest changes in energy metabolism as part of an adaptive response during the stressful period of postnatal growth. Interestingly, a similar perturbation of the postnatal growth axis was not detected in another progeroid mouse model, the double-strand DNA break repair deficient <italic>Ku80</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse. Specific (but not all) types of genome instability may thus engage a conserved response to stress that evolved to cope with environmental pressures such as food shortage.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Oxidative damage to cellular components, including fats, proteins, and DNA, is an inevitable consequence of cellular energy use and may underlie both normal and pathological aging. Calorie restriction delays the aging process and extends lifespan in a number of lower organisms including rodents. Inborn defects in the postnatal growth axis resulting in dwarfism can also extend lifespan. Both may function via overlapping pathways impacting on energy metabolism. Here, we report a novel DNA repair-deficient mouse model with symptoms of the related premature aging disorders Cockayne syndrome and trichothiodystrophy, namely reduced fat deposits, neurological dysfunction, failure to thrive, and reduced lifespan. Surprisingly, we also observed traits usually associated with extended longevity as found in calorie restriction and dwarfism, including reduced blood sugar and reduced insulin-like growth factor-1. These characteristics were present at 2 wk of age, that is, during the period of rapid postnatal development, but returned to normal by sexual maturation at 10 wk. Furthermore, they were absent altogether in another premature aging mouse model with a distinct DNA repair defect. Specific types of unrepaired DNA damage may thus elicit a preservative organismal response affecting energy metabolism that is similar to the one that evolved to cope with the stress of food shortage.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>van de Ven M, Andressoo JO, Holcomb VB, von Lindern M, Jong WMC, et al.

However, unlike XPCS/XPA and TTD/XPA, CH/XPA mice survived the stressful weaning period with high penetrance (&#x0223c;80&#x00025;), reaching an average body weight about half that of littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020192-g001">Figure 1</xref>A).</p><p>Despite their small size, we consistently noted unusual daytime feeding behavior in CH/XPA mice, prompting an investigation into their average daily food intake.

We conclude that food consumption corrected for body weight in CH/XPA mice was equal to or greater than that of littermate controls and thus does not explain their smaller size. Furthermore, at 10 wk of age, CH/XPA mice weighed on average 71&#x00025; of littermate XPA controls and had a cachectic appearance. Corrected for body weight, white adipose tissue deposits were on average 48&#x00025; of those of controls (perigonadal 41&#x00025;, mesenteric 52&#x00025;, adrenal 37&#x00025;, and subcutaneous 57&#x00025;; overall <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.01).

For example, Ames and Snell dwarf mice suffer congenital hypopituitarism and lack a number of pituitary hormones including GH from birth.

These data strongly argue against any structural defect in the components of the somatotropic axis or glucose homeostasis itself. This also makes what is happening in CH/XPA mice potentially quite different from what has been proposed for progeroid SIRT6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Based on these animals' low blood glucose and serum IGF-1, failure to thrive, and death with high penetrance before weaning &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020192-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d;, the authors proposed an important role for SIRT6 in maintaining organismal homeostasis, in addition to a role in DNA repair via the base excision repair (BER) pathway. In CH/XPA mice, we believe that the reduced blood sugar and serum IGF-1 during early postnatal development are components of an adaptive response to some form of stress experienced during this period before weaning. Although the nature of this stress is unknown, it appears to be initiated soon after birth and may involve the dramatic transition from prenatal to postnatal environment, including a different oxygen concentration and a switch in energy acquisition source from the mother's blood via her bloodstream to the mother's milk via the pup's own digestive system, combined with a period of rapid growth.</p><p>Interestingly, although serum IGF-1 levels remained in the normal range at least some time before the death of the CH/XPA animals, blood glucose levels dropped significantly below those of age-matched controls, indicating that low IGF-1 levels do not always precede low glucose. We also observed reduced glucose levels in 15 of the oldest survivors of a longevity cohort of WT mice.

If reduced IGF-1 mRNA correlates with increased longevity, why were liver IGF-1 mRNA levels observed here lowest in XPCS/XPA animals with the shortest lifespan and intermediate in CH/XPA mice with intermediate longevity? Our data demonstrate that IGF-1 dampening is reversible (at least in the CH/XPA mice) and thus most likely an adaptive response to genotoxic stress. When considering the benefits of reduced IGF-1, one must also in this case consider the magnitude of the stress that triggers this response. At some level of damage, this stress may overrule the efficacy of the response even at its maximal beneficial level. According to this interpretation, the magnitude of the dampening of the postnatal growth axis does not correlate directly to lifespan extension, but to the magnitude of the perceived stress, be it starvation or genome instability, and is independent of whether that stress response is successful in extending longevity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020192-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). Thus in XPCS/XPA and TTD/XPA mice, this results in death before weaning with high penetrance despite the maximal stress response; compound heterozygosity at the <italic>Xpd</italic> locus, which partially complements this defect, results in a less robust stress response because of less or slower damage accumulation, resulting in longer lifespan. Whether or not this response is adaptive or maladaptive and what actually triggers it (i.e., central nervous system dysfunction or malnutrition) remain important questions for future research.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Uncoupling of Postnatal Growth Axis Dampening from Dwarfism in Progeroid Genome Instability Disorders</title><p>In contrast to certain progeroid NER disorders, cultured <italic>Ku80<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> fibroblasts display cell-autonomous proliferative defects &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020192-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, <italic>Ku80<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> dwarfism is not exclusively postnatal (animals are already smaller at birth &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020192-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;), and we found no evidence of perturbation of the GH/IGF-1 postnatal growth axis at 2 wk, as in progeroid NER disorder, or at 10 wk, near the peak of somatotroph axis activity. This suggests a model in which cachectic dwarfism and progeria can be caused by at least two fundamentally distinct mechanisms: perturbation of postnatal growth signaling independent of cell-autonomous proliferative defects, as in NER progeria, or cell-autonomous proliferative defects without perturbation of the somatotroph axis, as in KU80 deficiency. Because these two scenarios are not necessarily mutually exclusive (for example, <italic>Ercc1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> and <italic>Xpg<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice display symptoms of NER progeria &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020192-t001">Table 1</xref>&#x0005d; but also have cell-autonomous proliferative defects; SIRT6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice with a reported BER deficiency also display cell-autonomous proliferative defects in addition to reduced serum IGF-1), dwarfism can likely result from combinations of both. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020192-g007">Figure 7</xref>B, we summarize how defects in growth factor environment and cell-autonomous proliferative capacity may independently or together produce the symptoms of segmental progeria due to NER dysfunction or other defects in genome maintenance.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Taken together, these data reveal perturbation of the GH/IGF-1 axis as a novel mechanism underlying the common symptoms of progeroid NER syndromes. Downregulation of IGF-1 may thus be part of a general stress response activated not only upon conditions such as food scarcity but also in response to the accumulation of certain types of DNA damage via congenital repair defects and possibly natural aging. In support of this interpretation, end-of-life pathology in TTD mice is consistent with both segmental accelerated aging (e.g., increased lipofuscin accumulation in the liver) and calorie restriction (e.g., reduced incidence of pituitary adenomas) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020192-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d;; TTD liver gene expression also resembled that of long-lived dwarf mice (Y. Suh, J. Y. Park, M. O. Cho, S. Leonard, B. Calder , unpublished data). Similarly, transcriptome analysis of CSB/XPA livers revealed significant downregulation of the somatotroph axis as well as upregulation of antioxidant defense &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020192-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. Finally, reduced serum IGF-1 and glucose levels were observed in segmental progeroid SIRT6 knock-out mice, with a tentative link to a defect in DNA repair via the BER pathway &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020192-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d;. The relevance of these findings from mouse models to the related human disorders remains to be determined. Downregulation of neuroendocrine GH/IGF-1 signaling has not been a consistent finding in CS or TTD patients, although the relative paucity of both patients and data prevents firm conclusions from being drawn &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020192-b016">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020192-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. However, as evidenced by the reduced cancer incidence in hypopituitary dwarf mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020192-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;, it is a plausible mechanism contributing to the lack of cancer observed in these individuals &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020192-b016">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020192-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice.</title><p><italic>Xpa<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, Xpd<sup>TTD</sup></italic> (XPD<sup>R722W</sup>) and <italic>Xpd<sup>XPCS</sup></italic> (XPD<sup>G602D</sup>) mice were generated as described previously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020192-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020192-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020192-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;.

Decreased IGF-1 signaling usually correlates positively with increased longevity; in XPD/XPA mutants lower serum IGF-1 (<italic>y</italic>-axis on the left) instead correlates inversely with lifespan. To explain this apparent paradox, we interpret serum IGF-1 levels as indicative of the magnitude of the perceived genotoxic stress (red arrows, <italic>y</italic>-axis on the right). This genotoxic stress may overrule the efficacy of reduced IGF-1 in XPCS/XPA and TTD/XPA animals, while in CH/XPA animals compound heterozygosity partially complements the defect, relieving genotoxic stress and reducing the corresponding stress response.</p><p>(B) Model for the differential contribution of cell-autonomous proliferative defects and systemic growth axis perturbation to progeria in genome instability disorders. Growth signals from the GH/IGF-1 somatotropic axis are dampened in progeroid NER syndrome (small red arrow), leading to postnatal growth deficiency; cells removed from this environment and provided adequate growth signals proliferate normally (dotted arrow represents WT proliferative capacity). In other segmental progerias, such as SIRT6 deficiency with a reported defect in BER, both appear to be affected. Alternately, cellular proliferation can be affected without apparent involvement of the somatotropic axis as in NHEJ-deficient <italic>Ku80<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.0020192.g007"/></fig><table-wrap id="pgen-0020192-t001" content-type="2col" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Characteristics of Progeroid NER Syndrome in Mice</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.0020192.t001"/></table-wrap></sec><fn-group><fn id="n105" fn-type="present-address"><p>&#x000a4; Current address: Institute of Biotechnology, University of Helsinki, Finland</p></fn><fn id="ack3" fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Competing interests.</bold> The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn id="n102" fn-type="previously-at"><p>A previous version of this article appeared as an Early Online Release on October 2, 2006 (doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pgen.0020192.eor">10.1371/journal.pgen.0020192.eor</ext-link>).</p></fn><fn id="ack1" fn-type="con"><p><bold>Author contributions.</bold> MvdV, JOA, YS, PH, JHJH, GTJvdH, and JRM conceived and designed the experiments.
