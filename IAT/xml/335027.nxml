A transcription unit of 5kb was identified which is composed of eight protein encoding exons. Three classes of transcripts were shown to differ only in the 3'-end and to code for three protein isoforms each with a different C-terminal amino acid sequence. Each transcript is shown to arise through the differential expression of three isotype-specific exons at the 3'-end of the gene by a developmentally regulated process of 3'-end formation and alternate splicing pathways of the pre-mRNA. In contrast, the 5'-end of the gene is simple in structure and each mRNA is transcribed from the same promoter sequence. A comparison of the organization of the Drosophila and murine genes and the primary amino acid sequence between a total of four species indicates that the GPDH gene-enzyme system is highly conserved and is evolving slowly.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00138-0155.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8553"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00138-0156.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8554"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00138-0157.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8555"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00138-0158.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8556"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00138-0159.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8557"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00138-0160.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8558"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00138-0161.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8559"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00138-0162.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8560"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00138-0163.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8561"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00138-0164.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8562"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00138-0165.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8563"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00138-0166.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8564"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00138-0167.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8565"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00138-0168.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8566"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00138-0169.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8567"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
