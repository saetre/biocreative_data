We examined the respective contribution of mutations in PR and Gag to PI resistance and RC and their interdependence using a panel of HIV-1 molecular clones carrying different sequences from six patients who had failed multiple lines of treatment. Mutations in Gag strongly and directly contributed to PI resistance besides compensating for fitness loss. This effect was essentially carried by the C-terminal region of Gag (containing NC-SP2-p6) with little or no contribution from MA, CA, and SP1. The effect of Gag on resistance depended on the presence of cleavage site mutations A431V or I437V in NC-SP2-p6 and correlated with processing of the NC/SP2 cleavage site. By contrast, reverting the A431V or I437V mutation in these highly evolved sequences had little effect on RC. Mutations in the NC-SP2-p6 region of Gag can be dually selected as compensatory and as direct PI resistance mutations, with cleavage at the NC-SP2 site behaving as a rate-limiting step in PI resistance. Further compensatory mutations render viral RC independent of the A431V or I437V mutations while their effect on resistance persists.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Protease inhibitors are among the most active antiviral drugs used in the treatment of Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection.

HIV-1 resistance to protease inhibitors often results in impaired protease function and in the loss of the replicative capacity of the virus, an effect that can be partially corrected by selection of compensatory mutations in one of the natural substrates of the protease, the Gag protein. In this study, we have found that Gag mutations not only correct viral replicative capacity but also play a major and direct role in resistance. We observed that this effect is essentially mediated by mutations in the C-terminal region of Gag, and that it correlates with the extent of cleavage downstream of the Gag nucleocapsid protein.

Protease inhibitors (PI) are the backbone of some of the most active combinations of antiretroviral drugs used in the treatment of HIV-infected patients. The long-term efficacy of these compounds, however, is threatened by the emergence of viral resistance and subsequent spread of resistant virus. HIV-1 resistance to PIs is promoted by gradual accumulation of amino-acid substitutions in PR, resulting in altered PI binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000345-Condra1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000345-Clavel1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Resistance-promoting changes in PR generally also decrease viral replicative capacity (RC) due to decreased processing of the natural substrate. Accordingly, additional mutations accumulate in PR over time that mainly compensate for these losses in RC, but may also contribute to resistance directly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000345-Condra1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000345-Mammano1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000345-Borman1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The biological effect of PI resistance mutations thus has to be viewed as the product of their effect on enzyme inhibition (resistance) and on enzyme activity (RC).</p><p>Besides mutations directly affecting PR, several mutations in the Gag polyprotein, the main substrate of PR, have been found to play a significant role in the evolution of PI resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000345-Doyon1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000345-Nijhuis1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

Particular attention has been turned to mutations in the region surrounding the NC-SP2-P6 cleavage sites at the C-terminus of Gag. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000345-g001">Figure 1</xref> gives an overdrive of these mutations and of their position in the NC-SP2-p6 region of HIV-1 Gag. The most frequently observed cleavage site mutations in this region are substitution A431V, located at position P2 of the NC-SP2 cleavage site, mutation L449F at position P1' of the SP2-P6 cleavage site, and mutations K436R and I437V, situated immediately downstream of the NC-SP2 site. Interestingly, some of these mutations appear to depend upon the presence of specific mutations in PR: Mutation A431V is mostly observed in PI-resistant viruses carrying mutations V82A and/or M46I in PR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000345-Bally1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

Neither of these two substitutions are seen in wild-type, protease inhibitor-na&#x000ef;ve viruses. Substitution P453L is a polymorphism found in some inhibitor-na&#x000ef;ve viruses. It is, however, seen with significantly higher frequency in resistant viruses carrying the I84V mutation in PR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000345-Bally1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> and also specifically seen in resistant viruses carrying the I50V PR mutation, in association with L449F <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000345-Maguire1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><fig id="ppat-1000345-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000345.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Principal mutations in the NC-SP2-P6 region of HIV-1 Gag selected in viruses exposed to protease inhibitors <italic>in vivo</italic> or <italic>in vitro</italic>.</title><p>The upper part of the figure lists cleavage site mutations most often observed in viruses exposed to protease inhibitors <italic>in vivo</italic>.

First, although some studies have identified Gag polymorphisms outside of cleavage sites that appeared to be important for the replicative capacity of viruses with PR mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000345-Ho1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000345-MatsuokaAizawa1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, the extent to which changes in the matrix (MA), capsid (CA), nucleocapsid (NC) proteins and in adjoining cleavage sites participate in evolution of viruses under PI pressure <italic>in vivo</italic> has not been fully evaluated. Second, the potential impact of Gag cleavage site mutations on viral resistance, in addition to their well established compensatory effect on viruses carrying PI resistance mutations, remains to be established. Nijhuis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000345-Nijhuis1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> recently reported the emergence of viruses carrying mutations K436E and I437V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000345-g001">Figure 1</xref>) within the SP2 linker peptide of Gag following <italic>in vitro</italic> selection for HIV-1 resistance to an experimental PI. These mutations in Gag preceded the detection of mutations in PR, and decreased HIV susceptibility to several PIs. It is currently not clear, however, whether mutations in Gag have a selective impact on the level of resistance under PI pressure <italic>in vivo</italic>, and whether this impact could be independent of the effect of these mutations on viral RC.</p><p>In this study, we have constructed recombinant viruses carrying different Gag-Pol segments from the plasma of HIV-1 infected subjects in whom viral resistance had evolved to high levels following prolonged antiretroviral treatment failure. Recombinant viruses were tested phenotypically for resistance and replicative capacity. In most cases, the loss of RC resulting from resistance mutations in PR was partially compensated by the NC-SP2-P6 region of Gag while addition of the MA and CA domains had no effect. The presence of patient-derived NC-SP2-P6 resulted in strong increases in the IC50 of most PIs, establishing the important role of this region in determining resistance. Selective reversion of mutations A431V or I437V in a subset of these recombinant viruses produced a strong reduction in resistance, but only a minor effect on replication capacity. The effects on viral resistance correlated with processing at the NC-SP2 cleavage site, revealing the importance of this cleavage event for HIV-1 resistance to PIs. Our results suggest a second pathway of resistance in patients failing a PI-containing regimen, establish a direct effect of Gag cleavage site mutations on antiviral resistance beyond their previously described compensatory role, and identify NC-SP2 cleavage as a limiting step in resistance development <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Construction of recombinants carrying patient-derived Gag-Pol sequences</title><p>Gag-Pol HIV-1 sequences from 6 patients were studied.

Six distinct PIs were tested: indinavir (IDV), nelfinavir (NFV), amprenavir (APV), saquinavir (SQV), lopinavir (LPV) and atazanavir (ATV). Viruses carrying patient-derived PR, RT and complete Gag sequences (BS clones) were strongly resistant to most PIs tested, in accordance with clinical failure of the respective patients. In contrast, resistance was found markedly lower in viruses carrying only patient-derived PR and RT in absence of any patient-derived Gag sequences (XS clones). This finding emphasizes the critical importance of HIV-1 Gag in viral resistance to PIs. When a shorter segment of Gag encompassing the NC-SP2-P6 region was added to the same highly mutated PR and RT sequences (AS clones), resistance levels were comparable to those measured with clones carrying the full Gag coding sequence (BS clones), strongly suggesting that most of the resistance impact of Gag is restricted to the NC-SP2-p6 region.

presence of patient-derived Gag sequences had a strong positive impact on the RC of the multiply resistant viral clones. The RC of XS clones, which lacked patient-derived Gag, was markedly lower than that of BS clones, carrying the whole Gag sequence from patient plasma: the mean RC of XS clones was 5.6&#x00025; of NL4-3, and the mean change in RC for XS clones relative to cognate BS clones was a 19.5-fold decrease. The greatest such effect was seen with the VIS13 virus (53.6-fold decrease) and the lowest with VIS16 (2.2-fold decrease). Similar to what was seen for resistance, the RC of most BS clones did not differ from that of cognate AS clones, again emphasizing the absence of a significant impact of MA and CA on resistance-associated loss of RC. It is noteworthy that substantial variation in RC was seen among the BS clones from different patients, with the lowest (VIS16) at 31.9&#x000b1;6.0&#x00025; and the highest (VIS13) at 117.9&#x000b1;30.3&#x00025;. Similarly, marked variation in RC was observed among BX clones, which only carried patient-derived Gag in absence of mutated PR and RT. For 4 of the clones, the RC of BX clones was higher than that of the cognate BS clone, suggesting that resistance mutations in PR and/or RT continued to exert some deleterious effect on RC in spite of compensatory mutations in Gag. For 2 viruses, however, the RC of the BX clone was lower than that of the BS clone (VIS13, VIS18). In these cases, the RC of the BX clone was also lower than that of the AS clone, whereas the RC of BS and AS clones were similar. Taken together, these findings are consistent with the possibility that these viruses carried mutations in the NC-SP2-p6 region able to facilitate replication of viruses with resistance mutations in PR and RT, but whose presence is deleterious for replication of viruses carrying wild-type PR and RT sequences.</p><p>Overall, the increase in RC resulting from the presence of patient-derived Gag sequences in clones carrying highly mutated PR and RT sequences was almost strictly parallel to the increase in resistance observed with the same clones. In general, however, the effect measured on RC was stronger than the resistance effect. Thus, for example, the mean change in IDV resistance for XS clones relative to BS clones was a 5.2-fold decrease, compared to the 19.5-fold loss in RC.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Individual role of NC-SP2 cleavage site mutations A431V and I437V in the ability of patient-derived Gag sequences to enhance RC and resistance</title><p>Having established that the determinants in Gag able to exert an enhancing effect on HIV-1 RC and resistance to PIs are essentially restricted to the NC-SP2-p6 region, we sought to evaluate the precise role of NC-SP2 mutations A431V and I437V in this phenomenon. We therefore selected XS clones from 3 patients and introduced the A431V (seen in VIS13 and VIS18 viruses) or the I437V (seen in VIS16) mutations into the NL4-3-derived Gag sequences, yielding the VIS13XS431V, the VIS16XS437V and the VIS18XS431V mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000345-g004">Figure 4</xref>). In parallel, these NC-SP2 cleavage site mutations were reverted back to wild-type in the patient-derived Gag sequences of the corresponding BS clones, yielding the VIS13BS431A, VIS16BS437I and VIS18BS431A mutants.</p><fig id="ppat-1000345-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000345.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Modification of cleavage site sequences by site-directed mutagenesis.</title><p>Schematic representation of the mutations reverted or introduced in Gag cleavage sites by site directed-mutagenesis, as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>.

In these two viral backgrounds, the decrease in IC50 resulting from reversion of the NC-SP2 cleavage site mutations was equivalent to that seen when replacing the whole Gag region from patient virus with that of NL4-3 (i.e., in the XS clones). Coherent with this observation, when mutations A431V and I437V were introduced in the XS clones, a strong increase in IC50 was seen, back to levels close to those seen with the BS clones. This observation strongly suggests that in highly resistant viruses, the resistance impact of the NC-SP2-p6 region is essentially carried by NC-SP2 cleavage site mutations. A slightly different and less clear picture was seen with virus VIS18, where the IC50 effect of reversion of A431V was relatively modest, in particular with IDV, and where this effect did not seem to be quite as pronounced as that seen with the XS clone. Nonetheless, introduction of A431V in VIS18XS produced a strong and significant increase in IC50 to all 3 tested drugs, to levels comparable to those seen with VIS18BS.</p><fig id="ppat-1000345-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000345.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Resistance phenotype of viral clones carrying mutations or reversions in Gag cleavage sites.</title><p>Each panel shows the IC50 of the indicated protease inhibitor for a set of clones whose construction was based on the same patient-derived HIV-1 sequences.

Reversion of NC-SP2 cleavage site mutations resulted in a moderate or no reduction in RC, contrasting with the much more dramatic effect of these changes on the resistance phenotype. Furthermore, the effect on RC was far less pronounced than that of the total removal of patient-derived Gag sequences, as seen in XS clones. In VIS13, reversion of A431V from VIS13BS reduced RC by about half, a reduction that was strikingly lower than that seen with VIS13XS. In VIS18, the reversion of A431V from VIS18BS did not significantly change RC, contrasting with the strong reduction in RC seen in VIS18XS. In VIS16, the change in RC produced by reversion of I437V was again marginal, but in this virus, only a small change in RC was seen when comparing the BS and the XS clone. These results show that NC-SP2 mutations are not sufficient to explain the losses of RC that characterize clones with highly mutated PR and RT sequences and in which patient-derived Gag sequences are absent. They suggest that sequence determinants in NC-SP2-P6 outside of the NC-SP2 cleavage site account in part for this phenomenon, confirming the published results of Myint et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000345-Myint1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Remarkably, however, when NC-SP2 cleavage site mutations were introduced in the XS clones, in which all Gag sequences are derived from NL4-3, we observed almost complete restoration of RC back to levels measured in BS clones. This surprising result shows that in viruses having evolved under prolonged selective pressure by PIs, RC is dependent upon complex interactions between NC-SP2 cleavage site mutations and their environing sequences, while single Gag mutations have a much stronger effect on RC when introduced into an otherwise wild-type background.</p><fig id="ppat-1000345-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000345.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Replicative capacity of viral clones carrying mutations or reversions in Gag cleavage sites.</title><p>Each panel shows the RC (in &#x00025; relative to NL4-3 RC) of a set of clones whose construction was based on the same patient-derived HIV-1 sequences.

Given the remarkable effect of NC-SP2 cleavage site mutations on the RC and on the levels of resistance expressed by viruses with highly resistant PR, we examined extent that these phenotypic changes were reflected by differences in PR cleavage at this particular site. Virions from clones VIS13BS, VIS13BS431A, VIS13XS, and VIS13XS431V were produced by HeLa cells in the absence or in the presence of lopinavir at two concentrations. The protein content of purified virions was analyzed by quantitative western blotting using antibodies against CA and NC.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000345-g007">Figure 7</xref> shows representative results from one out of three independent experiments. Analysis of the CA-reactive products revealed a strong inhibition of wild-type HIV-1 NL4-3 Gag processing at 50 nM LPV, while processing of VIS13BS derived virus was much less inhibited even at a concentration of 2,5 &#x000b5;M. No significant difference in CA processing was observed when VIS13XS or the derivatives with alterations in position 431 were compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000345-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). In contrast, processing of the NC-SP2 cleavage site was strongly dependent on the amino acid in position 431 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000345-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). This was reflected by the relative amounts of fully processed NC and the intermediate cleavage product NC-SP2, while only very small amounts of the NC-SP2-p6 product were detectable in all cases. For virus VIS13BS, which carried all patient-derived Gag sequences including mutation A431V, fully processed NC amounted to &#x0223c;80&#x00025; of all NC-reactive products in the presence of 0,5 &#x000b5;M LPV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000345-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). Furthermore, mature NC was still present at &#x0003e;60&#x00025; of all NC-reactive species in the presence of 2,5 &#x000b5;M LPV, a concentration amounting to approximately twice the IC50 of VIS13BS. Reversion of A431V in VIS13BS (clone VISBS431A) produced a clear change in this pattern with NC-SP2 amounting to &#x0223c;65&#x00025; of all NC-reactive species at 2,5 &#x000b5;M LPV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000345-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). A very similar pattern was seen with VIS13XS, in which all Gag sequences were derived from NL4-3.

Our results reveal that mutations in the NC-SP2-p6 region of Gag directly contribute to PI resistance in addition to their compensatory role, an effect that correlates with the extent of proteolytic processing of the NC-SP2 cleavage site. In contrast, in these samples from patients having failed multiple lines of antiretroviral therapy, the upstream MA-CA-SP1 region of Gag does not appear to influence PI resistance.

The mechanism of this compensation has been documented for mutation A431V, which emerges mostly in viruses carrying resistance mutation V82A in PR. Interestingly, this Gag mutation does not act through direct steric compensation of the structural change in the substrate-binding domain of PR, but creates an additional point of contact between the substrate and the substrate-binding cavity of the enzyme. This contact is independent of the presence of resistance mutations, thereby producing a non-specific increase in enzymatic activity at the mutated site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000345-PrabuJeyabalan1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Comparison of recombinant viruses carrying whole patient-derived Gag sequences together with their cognate PR and RT sequences (BS viruses) with recombinant viruses carrying patient-derived PR and RT only (XS viruses) revealed a remarkable contribution of Gag cleavage site mutations A431V and I437V in the NC-SP2-p6 region to the emergence of PI resistance <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000345-t001">Table 1</xref>). When the cleavage site mutations were removed by site-directed mutagenesis in clones carrying whole patient-derived Gag-PR-RT sequences, 2 to 5-fold reductions in resistance were observed, at least for certain drugs. Furthermore, inserting these mutations into viruses carrying patient-derived PR-RT sequences, but NL4-3-derived Gag sequences usually resulted in viruses whose resistance was equivalent to, or even higher, than that observed for viruses carrying only patient-derived Gag-Pol sequences. The observation that cleavage site mutations A431V and I437V were actually acting as resistance mutations in these highly evolved, highly resistant clinical viruses, is complementary to a recent study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000345-Nijhuis1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, which reported <italic>in vitro</italic> selection for resistance to an experimental PI using a laboratory strain of HIV-1 leading to emergence of mutations in SP2 at position 436 and 437 before any changes in PR.</p><p>In contrast, the impact of the cleavage site mutations A431V or I437V on viral RC was more nuanced. When cleavage site mutations were removed by site-directed mutagenesis in clones carrying patient-derived Gag-PR-RT sequences, RC was impaired in some cases, but not to the extent that resistance was impaired. Furthermore, a considerably greater loss of RC was observed when the entire patient-derived Gag was replaced by Gag sequences from the reference NL4-3 virus. Thus, although the introduction of cleavage site mutations into viruses carrying NL4-3 Gag sequences and patient-derived PR-RT sequences fully restored viral RC in all cases, the reversion of the same cleavage site mutations from a patient-derived Gag sequence had, at most, only a small impact on RC. Taken together, these findings suggest that other, as yet undefined, mutations had occurred in gag in these patient-derived viruses that partially (VIS 13, VIS16), or completely (VIS18) compensated for the loss of fitness resulting from protease resistance mutations, at least in the absence of PI treatment. These findings are consistent with those of Myint et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000345-Myint1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, who showed that changes in the p6 region of Gag could participate in partial correction of resistance-associated loss of RC. Furthermore, the context-dependent effects of NC-SP2 cleavage site mutations on RC indicate that these changes can be dually selected: (i) as compensatory mutations restoring RC of PR mutated viruses without further changes in gag and (ii) as direct PI resistance mutations. Upon prolonged treatment, further mutations in Gag outside the cleavage site may render viral RC independent of the A431V or I437V mutations while the effect of these mutations on resistance and thus their selective power <italic>in vivo</italic> persists. The nature of the Gag mutations outside of cleavage site that appear to contribute to viral RC was not investigated in this study. As seen on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000345-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, numerous polymorphisms, including insertions and duplications in the p6 region of Gag, differed among the viral clones studied here, most of which being frequently observed in HIV-1 sequence databases. Of note, our clones did not carry the polymorphisms described by Myint et al. as being able to exert a compensatory effect on HIV-1 RC. We therefore hypothesize that the RC effect seen in some of our clones following reversion of cleavage site mutations is likely mediated by complex combinations of non-unique natural polymorphisms, which may vary from one virus to another according to their overall Gag genetic context.</p><p>The mechanism through which mutations in PR substrates can promote resistance by themselves, independently of their effect on RC, either in the presence or in the absence of resistance mutations in PR has yet to be explained. As discussed earlier, viral resistance to PIs involves a balance between two competing PR ligands: the inhibitor and the Gag or Gag-Pol polyproteins. <italic>In vitro</italic>, the affinity constant of PIs for their target is most often in the sub-nM range, while the affinity constant of Gag or Pol cleavage sites for PR, which varies according to the cleavage site, has been evaluated as being in the mM range <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000345-Moore1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. How an increase in the affinity constants of the latter ligand can displace binding of the former is unclear. One explanation, however, may relate to the different stoichiometry of PR relative to its natural substrates at the site of HIV virion maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000345-Briggs1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, compared to that of PR relative to free, active, unbound PIs at these sites. Clearly, further work, involving precise evaluation of intracellular concentrations of PIs at the site of viral assembly, would be needed in order to better understand these phenomena.</p><p>The other main observation of our study is that changes in Gag that promote increases in resistance and in RC in highly evolved, highly resistant, viruses are essentially restricted to the NC-SP2-p6 region of Gag. In our panel of viruses, little effect of MA-CA-SP1 regions was measured either in resistance or in RC. The notable interstrain variability in some domains of HIV-1 MA and CA, and in particular the strong variability in the CA-SP1 cleavage site, do not appear to play a significant role in resistance. Two viruses constituted possible exceptions. In virus VIS09, the RC of the AS clone, carrying only patient-derived NC-SP2-p6 in combination with cognate PR and RT patient sequences, was significantly different from that of the BS clone, which carried whole Gag sequences from patient plasma. The resistance levels of the VIS09 AS clone, however, were not significantly different from those measured with the BS clone. In virus VIS20, the same phenomenon was observed, albeit on a smaller scale, and the difference in RC between AS and BS clones did not reach statistical significance. These observations further support the idea that mutations other than NC-SP2-p6 cleavage site mutations can help compensate for losses of viral RC associated with PI resistance, and further suggest that mutations occurring outside of the NC-SP2-p6 region can participate in this process. These mutations do not, however, appear to have appreciable impact on drug resistance.</p><p>The absence of effect of MA-CA-SP1 sequences on drug resistance, and their only modest impact on viral fitness, strongly suggests that cleavage events in the NC-SP2-p6 region have a critical impact on resistance and fitness, and may constitute rate-limiting events for HIV virion maturation both in the absence and in the presence of PIs. This conclusion was confirmed by western blot experiments examining the extent of cleavage of Gag proteins in a series of VIS13-derived recombinant and mutants viruses. We first observed that increasing LPV concentration had a similar effect regarding CA processing in all viruses carrying resistance mutations in PR. This was different from the recent <italic>in vitro</italic> selection experiments, where mutations in SP2 at position 436 and 437 increased overall Gag processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000345-Nijhuis1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. We found, however, that adding or removing the NC-SP2 cleavage site mutation A431V in different VIS13-derived clones did have an effect on the amount of fully processed NC relative to its partially cleaved precursor NC-SP2. This effect was seen both in the absence or in the presence of inhibitor, consistent with the expectations from the structural analysis of the A431V mutant peptide with wild-type and mutant PR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000345-PrabuJeyabalan1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Importantly, the NC/NC-SP2 processing efficiency fully correlated with the resistance phenotypes of the respective viruses. This finding is in apparent contradiction with the results of mutagenesis experiments reporting that mutant virions lacking cleavage at the NC-SP2 site were close to being fully infectious <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000345-Coren1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Several explanations may be proposed to reconcile our findings with those of Coren et al. First, the assay systems used to monitor infectivity are not fully comparable and may differ in their sensitivity to small changes in viral infectivity. Second, these authors have essentially evaluated the effect of mutagenesis of NC-SP2 with wild-type HIV PR from a laboratory molecular clone in absence of protease inhibitor. It can be hypothesized that the rate-limiting nature of cleavage at this site may be more important in the context of primary PR sequences, of resistant PR enzymes, and/or in virions assembled and matured in the presence of protease inhibitors. In this regard, it is noteworthy that the NC-SP2 cleavage site sequence is highly conserved among HIV-1 strains that have never been exposed to PIs, and that in vitro, mature NC has been found to exert optimal chaperone function when compared to other Gag cleavage products, including NC-SP2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000345-Cruceanu1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. In our experiments, the dramatic effects of mutation A431V on resistance, its context-dependent impact on RC, and its strong influence on the ratio of NC to NC-SP2, strongly argues in favor of a critical role of this cleavage event <italic>in vivo</italic>, in viruses having escaped to pharmacological pressure by protease inhibitors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cells</title><p>HeLa cells and P4 cells (HeLa-CD4 LTR-LacZ) were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10&#x00025; fetal calf serum and antibiotics.
