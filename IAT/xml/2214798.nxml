Human genetic disorders primarily affecting skeletal muscle glycogen turnover are well-recognised, but rare. We previously reported that a frameshift/premature stop mutation in <italic>PPP1R3A</italic>, the gene encoding R<sub>GL</sub>, a key regulator of muscle glycogen metabolism, was present in 1.36&#x00025; of participants from a population of white individuals in the UK. However, the functional implications of the mutation were not known. The objective of this study was to characterise the molecular and physiological consequences of this genetic variant.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>In this study we found a similar prevalence of the variant in an independent UK white population of 744 participants (1.46&#x00025;) and, using in vivo <sup>13</sup>C magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies, demonstrate that human carriers (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 6) of the variant have low basal (65&#x00025; lower, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.002) and postprandial muscle glycogen levels. Mice engineered to express the equivalent mutation had similarly decreased muscle glycogen levels (40&#x00025; lower in heterozygous knock-in mice, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). In muscle tissue from these mice, failure of the truncated mutant to bind glycogen and colocalize with glycogen synthase (GS) decreased GS and increased glycogen phosphorylase activity states, which account for the decreased glycogen content.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Thus, <italic>PPP1R3A</italic> C1984&#x00394;AG (stop codon 668) is, to our knowledge, the first prevalent mutation described that directly impairs glycogen synthesis and decreases glycogen levels in human skeletal muscle. The fact that it is present in &#x0223c;1 in 70 UK whites increases the potential biomedical relevance of these observations.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Stephen O'Rahilly and colleagues describe the effect of a mutation in<italic>PPP1R3A</italic>, present in 1.36% of participants from one UK population, that directly impairs glycogen synthesis and decreases glycogen levels in human skeletal muscle.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="editor"><title>Editors' Summary</title><sec id="sb1a"><title>Background.</title><p>The human body gets the energy it needs for day-to-day living from food in a process called metabolism. However, not all the energy released by metabolism is used immediately. Some is stored in skeletal muscles as glycogen, a glucose polymer that is used during high intensity exercise. After eating, chemicals in the digestive system release glucose (a type of sugar) from food into the bloodstream where it triggers insulin release from the pancreas. Insulin instructs muscle, liver and fat cells to remove glucose from the bloodstream to keep the amount of sugar in the blood at a safe level. The cells use the glucose immediately as fuel or convert it into glycogen or fat for storage. Glycogen turnover (the depletion and replacement of glycogen stores) is tightly controlled by glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase, enzymes that make and destroy glycogen, respectively. A third enzyme called protein phosphatase 1 promotes net glycogen synthesis by activating glycogen synthase and inactivating glycogen phosphorylase. The activity of protein phosphatase 1 is regulated by a family of &#x0201c;targeting subunits.&#x0201d; In muscle, one of these targeting subunits, called R<sub>GL,</sub> facilitates protein phosphatase 1 action on glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>Several known human genetic disorders affect the breakdown of muscle glycogen but few genetic changes (mutations) have been found that decrease the synthesis of muscle glycogen. Researchers are interested in discovering mutations that affect glycogen turnover and other aspects of metabolism because some of these may be involved in the development of diabetes, an important metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar levels. In this study, the researchers have investigated how a recently identified mutation in <italic>PPP1R3A</italic>, the gene that encodes R<sub>GL</sub>, affects glycogen synthesis. This mutation&#x02014;<italic>PPP1R3A FS</italic>&#x02014;was previously found in 1.36&#x00025; of a UK white population. It causes the production of a short version of R<sub>GL</sub> that lacks the part of the molecule that tethers R<sub>GL</sub> to a cellular structure called the sarcoplasmic reticulum but leaves its glycogen binding domain intact.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>To confirm that <italic>PPP1R3A FS</italic> is a common mutation in the UK white population, the researchers sequenced the gene in 744 healthy adults enrolled in the Oxford Biobank (which hopes to uncover metabolically important genetic variations by monitoring the health of a large number of 30- to 50-year-old people from whom DNA has been collected). 1.46&#x00025; of these people had the <italic>PPP1R3A FS</italic> mutation. To examine glycogen storage in carriers of the mutation, the researchers used a technique called in vivo <sup>13</sup>C magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Basal muscle glycogen levels and those reached after a meal were lower in these individuals than in people without the mutation but their blood sugar and insulin levels were normal. Finally, to examine how the mutation reduces muscle glycogen, the researchers made mice carrying the <italic>PPP1R3A FS</italic> mutation. Like the human carriers, these mice had less glycogen than normal in their muscles. Unexpectedly, in biochemical experiments the truncated R<sub>GL</sub> protein made by the mutant mice did not bind to glycogen or co-localize with glycogen synthase. This lack of binding decreased the activity of glycogen synthase and increased the activity of glycogen phosphorylase, thus decreasing muscle glycogen.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These findings identify the <italic>PPP1R3A FS</italic> mutation as the first prevalent mutation known to impair glycogen synthesis and to decrease glycogen levels in human skeletal muscles. They also confirm that this mutation is very common in UK whites. Although these human carriers do not report any exercise intolerance, detailed studies are needed to test whether the mutation has any effect on skeletal muscle performance. In addition, suggest the researchers, the mutation might be involved in the development of type 2 diabetes. Impaired insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis, which is a feature of insulin-resistant muscle and liver cells, is thought to be a key event in the development of type 2 diabetes. Although some previous results indicate that the <italic>PPP1R3A FS</italic> mutations can sometimes predispose people to develop insulin resistance, only a large population-based study in multiple ethnic groups will reveal whether the <italic>PPP1R3A FS</italic> mutation has an important impact on the development of type 2 diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050027">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050027</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Wikipedia has pages on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism">metabolism</ext-link> and on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen">glycogen</ext-link> (note that Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit; available in several languages)</p></list-item><list-item><p>The MedlinePlus encyclopedia provides information about <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001214.htm">diabetes</ext-link> (in English and Spanish)</p></list-item><list-item><p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/">UK Biobank</ext-link> is looking for genetic variations among human populations that are associated with metabolic and other disorders</p></list-item><list-item><p>Web sites are available with brief descriptions of the research programs of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cgkp.org.uk/interviews/orahilly.htm">Stephen O'Rahilly</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biochemistry.iu.edu/body.cfm?id=2952&#x00026;oTopID=3097">Anna DePaoli-Roach</ext-link></p></list-item></list></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Savage DB, Zhai L, Ravikumar B, Choi CS, Snaar JE (2008) A prevalent variant in <italic>PPP1R3A</italic> impairs glycogen synthesis and reduces muscle glycogen content in humans and mice.

This clone is 13 kb and extends from 2 kb upstream of exon 2 to 7 kb downstream of the R<sub>GL</sub> stop codon. The short recombination arm fragment consists of 1.2 kb of intron 3 and was inserted upstream of the 5&#x02032; LoxP site flanking the Neo cassette at the XhoI and NotI sites in the pPGKNeobpAlox2PGKDTA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050027-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). The long recombination arm containing the FS mutation was constructed with three fragments. Part 1 was engineered to contain the FS premature stop codon found in the human participants at the corresponding position in the mouse <italic>Ppp1r3a</italic> by amplifying a region from 500 bp upstream of exon 4 to &#x0223c; 1,000 bp of exon 4. The following oligonucleotide primers were used: forward 5&#x02032;-TTTGCTAGCGCCGTTGACAAGTAACATGAGCCTTAT-3&#x02032; and reverse 5&#x02032;-AAACCATGGTTATTCTCTCTTGATTTTCCGGGTTTCCAGAACGTTCCATTT-3&#x02032;. The reverse primer encodes the altered six amino acids found in the human mutation followed by a stop codon and an NcoI site. Part 2 was a 2.2 kb NcoI-BstEII amplified fragment. Part 3 was the 4.6 kb restriction enzyme&#x02013;digested BstEII-BStz171. The three fragments, totalling 8.3 kb, were inserted downstream of the 3&#x02032; LoxP site flanking the PGK-Neo gene at the NheI and EcoRV sites. Part 1 was completely sequenced to ensure that the correct mutation was introduced and that no unintended mutations were present. All junctions in the final construct were confirmed by sequencing and restriction enzyme digestion. The R<sub>GL</sub> kin targeting vector also contains the diphtheria toxin A gene (PGK-DTA) for selection against random integration. The vector was linearized at the unique AhdI site and electroporated into W4 ES cells. G418-resistant cell clones were initially screened for targeting by PCR with primers ADPR 424, 5&#x02032;-GCTAGACTTGATGGTAAGTGTTCTGGTTGCACAG-3&#x02032; outside of the short recombination arm and ADPR 422, 5&#x02032;-CGCGAAGGGGCCACCAAAGAAGGGAGCCGGTTG-3&#x02032;, in the PGK-Neo region. Positive clones were further analyzed for the presence of the mutation by utilizing ADPR 425, 5&#x02032;-CCCCGGAAATCAAGAGAGAATAACCATGG-3&#x02032;, which specifically recognizes the mutated sequence and not the corresponding wild type (WT), and ADPR 406, 5&#x02032;-TGCGAATTCTCACCTGCCTTGAGCTTCGAGTTC-3&#x02032; located downstream. From this double screen, two positive clones were identified and correct targeting was confirmed by Southern blots of ES cell genomic DNA digested with NheI. Two fragments of 10.3 and 3.4 kb, corresponding to the WT and to the targeted allele, respectively, were detected with the 5&#x02032; probe, and 10.3 kb and 8.8 kb fragments with the 3&#x02032; probe (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050027-sg002">Figure S2</xref>A). Both clones, confirmed to be correctly targeted, were expanded and electroporated with a PGK-NLS/Cre plasmid. Resulting clones were screened by PCR for excision of the Neo cassette (efficiency 40&#x00025;, 73/190) and 12 were analyzed and confirmed by Southern blot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050027-sg002">Figure S2</xref>B). Two clones, after karyotyping, were injected into C57Bl/6J blastocysts, which were then implanted in the uterus of pseudopregnant female mice.

In order to gain insights into the mechanisms involved in the decreased glycogen content we assessed R<sub>GL</sub> binding to GS and glycogen. Antibodies directed against both the N-terminal 262 residues and C-terminal 325-1042 amino acids of R<sub>GL</sub> immunoprecipitated most of the full-length and truncated R<sub>GL</sub> (note that the truncation is at residue 643), but did not coimmunoprecipitate GS, indicating that neither WT nor mutant R<sub>GL</sub> binds GS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050027-g003">Figure 3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050027-g003">3</xref>C). This surprising result was confirmed by the reciprocal experiment in which GS was pulled down. We utilized a fusion protein (GST-GN&#x0005b;297&#x02013;333&#x0005d; of GST and the residues 297&#x02013;333 of glycogenin (GN), the glycogen priming protein &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050027-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;, which interact with GS in two-hybrid assays and in coexpression studies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050027-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. While GST-GN(297&#x02013;333) pulled down GS almost completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050027-g004">Figure 4</xref>A), neither the WT nor the truncated R<sub>GL</sub> were found associated with GS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050027-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). Finally, high-speed ultracentrifugation was used to precipitate glycogen and sarcoplasmic reticulum from murine muscle extracts. The vast majority of WT R<sub>GL</sub> and GS, and a substantial proportion of GP were recovered in the high-speed pellet, indicating that they were all bound to glycogen (R<sub>GL</sub> also binds to sarcoplasmic reticulum) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050027-g005">Figure 5</xref>). However, truncated R<sub>GL</sub> was confined to the supernatant fraction, suggesting that the region between residue 637 and the C-terminal end of R<sub>GL</sub> may contribute to glycogen binding in addition to associating with sarcoplasmic reticulum. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that the inability of the truncated R<sub>GL</sub> to sediment in the high-speed pellet may be due to loss of the hydrophobic, membrane-associating domain, the fact that all the GS, which is well known to bind to glycogen, is present in the pellet argues that the ability of R<sub>GL</sub> trunc to bind glycogen is decreased. In addition, after solubilising membranes with Triton X-100 in the muscle extract, we still found a significant proportion of full-length R<sub>GL</sub> and all of the GS in the high-speed pellet, while the truncated R<sub>GL</sub> was primarily in the supernatant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050027-sg003">Figure S3</xref>).

It is important to note that degradation was observed by Lerin et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050027-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d; only when cells were grown under nonphysiological conditions of zero glucose, a state that does not occur in humans and mice. The reduction in GS activity is nicely explained by the failure of truncated R<sub>GL</sub> to colocalize with GS and therefore to direct PP1c phosphatase activity to GS. As GS is largely bound to glycogen, the inability of the truncated R<sub>GL</sub> to colocalize with GS, despite the fact that it retains the glycogen-binding domain, suggests that the glycogen-binding affinity of truncated R<sub>GL</sub> is decreased.</p><p>This observation is somewhat surprising, but several alternative explanations can be advanced. First, although the glycogen-binding domain in R<sub>GL</sub> is essential it may not be sufficient and additional sites in the C-terminal third of the protein may also be involved in glycogen binding. Second, deletion of the C-terminal third of the protein may affect the overall protein conformation, impairing binding to glycogen. Third, it is possible that association with the sarcoplasmic reticulum is critical for glycogen binding, since our truncated R<sub>GL</sub> lacks the C-terminal hydrophobic segment and cannot associate with sarcoplasmic reticulum &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050027-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. However, the sedimentation of full-length R<sub>GL</sub> and GS, but not truncated R<sub>GL</sub>, in the high-speed pellet after Triton X-100 solubilisation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050027-sg003">Figure S3</xref>), argues that binding of the full-length form to glycogen is independent of sarcoplasmic reticulum association. Contrary to previous proposals &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050027-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;, we also provide compelling evidence that GS does not stably interact with R<sub>GL</sub> in the physiological tissue. Studies implicating a direct interaction between R<sub>GL</sub> and GS utilized nonphysiological and overexpressing systems &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050027-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. We used both coimmunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays to show that neither full length nor truncated R<sub>GL</sub> binds GS. These observations support the notion that the basic function of R<sub>GL</sub> is to target PP1c to glycogen, thereby promoting dephosphorylation of glycogen bound GS and GP, a catalytic process that does not require stable interaction.</p><p>Given that the <italic>PPP1R3A FS</italic> variant is prevalent in UK white populations and that human physiological studies strongly implicate impaired insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis in the pathogenesis of insulin-resistant type 2 diabetes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050027-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050027-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;, is there any evidence that it is a significant &#x0201c;diabetes genetic variant&#x0201d;? We originally identified the <italic>PPP1R3A FS</italic> mutation in a large kindred with severe insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050027-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. In that kindred only those individuals harbouring a second unlinked mutation in <italic>PPARG</italic> were severely insulin resistant. The <italic>PPARG</italic> mutation is a loss-of-function mutation, but did not manifest dominant negative activity, which is a feature of the other <italic>PPARG</italic> variants shown to be associated with partial lipodystrophy and severe insulin resistance &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050027-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. In a second family, weight gain appeared to induce disproportionate insulin resistance in <italic>PPP1R3A FS</italic> carriers &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050027-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. Taken together, these data suggest that carriers of the <italic>PPP1R3A FS</italic> variant may be predisposed to develop severe insulin resistance in the setting of adipose tissue dysfunction.</p><p>In an effort to replicate this interaction in mice, we crossed R<sub>GL</sub> kin mice with PPAR&#x003b3; heterozygous knockouts &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050027-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d; but the double heterozygosity failed to alter glucose tolerance or insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050027-sg004">Figure S4</xref>). Mouse and human muscle glycogen metabolism is very different (mouse glycogen content is much lower than that of human muscle), and the phenotype of PPAR&#x003b3; haploinsufficient mice is very different to that of humans with the <italic>PPARG</italic> FS variant. PPAR&#x003b3; &#x0002b;/&#x02212; mice are protected against diet- and age-induced insulin resistance &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050027-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;, whereas humans with the <italic>PPARG FS</italic> variant, which appears to behave as a null allele &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050027-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;, manifest exaggerated hypertriglyceridaemia and insulin resistance with weight gain (unpublished data). Our original studies in Cambridgeshire volunteers did involve individuals with type 2 diabetes and controls, and the variant was significantly (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.03) enriched in the diabetic group &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050027-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. However, given a population prevalence of &#x0223c;1.46&#x00025; and an apparently subtle phenotype, it will require very large population-based studies in multiple ethnic groups to determine whether it has a significant impact on type 2 diabetes. The <italic>PPP1R3A FS</italic> variant is not captured by existing fixed single nucleotide polymorphism arrays, so one cannot infer anything about its impact on diabetes risk from the recently reported type 2 diabetes genomewide association studies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050027-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. The FS mutation could also have functional implications for skeletal muscle performance. Anecdotally, human carriers of the <italic>PPP1R3A FS</italic> variant do not report exercise intolerance or muscle weakness. Studies of exercise tolerance combined with stable isotope tracing of metabolic fluxes will be needed to formally address this question in humans.</p><p>In summary, we have identified a <italic>PPP1R3A FS</italic> variant, which encodes a truncated protein that is mistargeted within the cell, that decreases muscle GS activity, and that increases phosphorylase activity, thereby decreasing muscle glycogen content in humans and mice. This metabolic change by itself does not alter glucose tolerance or insulin sensitivity. The findings are notable because this is a prevalent genetic mutation that clearly impairs muscle glycogen synthesis in humans. These data also demonstrate that functionally important mutations occurring at appreciable population frequencies contribute to the genetic architecture of human metabolic variation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed-0050027-sg001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>Strategy for the Generation of the Frameshift Mutant Mouse <italic>Ppp1r3a</italic> Locus</title><p>(16 KB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.0050027.sg001.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed-0050027-sg002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><title>Generation of Mice with the <italic>Ppp1r3a</italic> (R<sub>GL</sub>) Frameshift Mutation</title><p>(A) Southern blots of initially targeted embryonic stem (ES) cell clones and after Cre recombinase excision of the Neo cassette.
