Although cutaneous primary afferent neurones are known to have lowered thermal thresholds in inflammation, whether their mechanical thresholds are altered remains controversial. The transient receptor potential channel A1 (TRPA1) is a receptor localized to putative nociceptive neurones and is implicated in mechanical and thermal nociception. Herein, we examined changes in the properties of single primary afferents in normal and acutely inflamed rats and determined whether specific nociceptive properties, particularly mechanical thresholds, are altered in the subpopulation of afferents that responded to the TRPA1 agonist cinnamaldehyde (TRPA1-positive afferents). TRPA1-positive afferents in normal animals belonged to the mechanonociceptive populations, many of which also responded to heat or capsaicin but only a few of which responded to cold. In acute inflammation, a greater proportion of afferents responded to cinnamaldehyde and an increased proportion of dorsal root ganglion neurones expressed TRPA1 protein. Functionally, in inflammation, TRPA1-positive afferents showed significantly reduced mechanical thresholds and enhanced activity to agonist stimulation. Inflammation altered thermal thresholds in both TRPA1-positive and TRPA1-negative afferents. Our data show that a subset of afferents is sensitized to mechanical stimulation by inflammation and that these afferents are defined by expression of TRPA1.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>complete Freund's adjuvant</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>mechanonociception</kwd><kwd>pain</kwd><kwd>primary afferent</kwd><kwd>transient receptor potential channel A1</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Inflammation is associated with altered pain perception, such as pain on innocuous stimulation (allodynia) and enhanced pain to noxious stimulation (hyperalgesia). The transient receptor potential channel A1 (TRPA1) is expressed in a population of primary sensory neurones and is co-expressed with putative markers of nociceptive afferents, such as transient receptor potential channel V1 (TRPV1), substance P and calcitonin gene related peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">Story <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Kobayashi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>).

TRPA1 is activated by a wide range of natural and synthetic compounds, including many of the pungent compounds in spices, e.g. allyl isothiocyanate (mustard oil) and cinnamaldehyde (cinnamon oil), and environmental irritants and other exogenous and endogenous aldehyde-containing compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bandell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Jordt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">McNamara <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">Trevisani <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). TRPA1 agonists applied to the skin in humans cause spontaneous pain and heat and mechanical hyperalgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Namer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), whereas in rodents, intraplantar or topical cinnamaldehyde causes acute nocifensive behaviour, mechanical allodynia and heat hyperalgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bandell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">Proudfoot <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Altered nociception in the acute inflammation caused by formalin has recently been reported to be mediated through TRPA1-expressing afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">McNamara <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). In inflammation, TRPA1 is also activated or sensitized by stimulation of endogenous pro-inflammatory receptors, such as the bradykinin B2 receptor or nerve growth factor receptor, potentially contributing towards altered nociception in acute inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bandell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Jordt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Diogenes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Intrathecal antisense TRPA1 reduces inflammation-associated cold hyperalgesia but not mechanical allodynia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Obata <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). In contrast, pharmacological inhibition of TRPA1 affects both cold and mechanical behavioural changes in more acute (hours) inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Petrus <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, inflammation increases the numbers of neurones expressing TRPA1 mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Obata <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p><p>These data suggest that TRPA1 plays a role in the functional changes seen in primary afferent neurones in inflammation. The multiple sensory changes evoked by TRPA1 agonists have led to the proposal that TRPA1 could be a polymodal nociceptive transducer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Kwan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). The functional properties of TRPA1-expressing afferents have yet to be reported in either normal animals or in inflammation. Nociceptors are known to alter their functional properties in inflammation, with altered thresholds and the development of ongoing spontaneous activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Guilbaud <italic>et al.</italic>, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">Schaible &#x00026; Schmidt, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Grigg <italic>et al.</italic>, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Djouhri <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that, as a putative polymodal transducer, TRPA1 would be principally found in polymodal nociceptors and that the properties of TRPA1-expressing afferents would be altered in acute inflammation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>All experiments were carried out in accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986 and associated guidelines. Male Wistar rats (250&#x02013;350 g) were used in all experiments. Animals were given access to food and water <italic>ad libitum</italic> and housed in accordance with UK Home Office regulations. A total of 84 animals were used in these studies.</p></sec><sec><title>CFA-induced inflammation</title><p>Animals were briefly anaesthetized using 4% halothane in O<sub>2</sub> (2 L/min) and maintained areflexive on 2% halothane in O<sub>2</sub>. Once areflexia was achieved, 50 &#x003bc;L of complete Freund's adjuvant (1 mg.mL<sup>-1</sup>) was injected into each of two sites at either side of the tibiotarsal joint (total injected volume 100 &#x003bc;L) for subsequent neurophysiological recording of cutaneous afferents (<italic>n</italic>= 8 rats). Local injections around the tibiotarsal joint cause both a pronounced arthritis and extensive cutaneous inflammation encompassing the majority of the foot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Donaldson <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>). Furthermore, animals exhibit both mechanical allodynia and thermal (heat) hyperalgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Donaldson &#x00026; Chillingworth, 2007</xref>). After complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) injection, rats were returned to the home cage, allowed to recover and monitored daily for joint swelling.</p></sec><sec><title>Neurophysiological and pharmacological characterization of primary afferents</title><p>Electrophysiology was performed on two groups of animals, those that had received an injection of CFA injection around the ankle joint 3 days previously (<italic>n</italic>= 8) and uninjected naive animals (<italic>n</italic>= 64).</p><p>Animals were anaesthetized (sodium pentobarbital, 60 mg/kg i.p.) and maintained deeply anaesthetized and areflexive (sodium pentobarbital, 20 mg/kg/h i.v.). The trachea was cannulated to maintain the airway and the external jugular vein and an artery (external carotid and/or femoral) were cannulated for anaesthetic administration, blood pressure monitoring and/or drug delivery. The body temperature was maintained within physiological limits by means of a feedback-controlled heater and rectal thermister. At the end of all experiments, rats were killed by an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (60mg).</p><p>The right saphenous nerve was exposed mid-thigh via an incision from the inguinal fossa to a point just distal to the knee joint and was isolated from the surrounding tissue. A pool of warmed paraffin oil was made of the surrounding skin to prevent dehydration and, following removal of the epineurium, fine filaments of the saphenous nerve were teased to enable differential recording of neuronal activity via bipolar platinum wire electrodes. Filaments were teased until they contained a small number (often &#x02264; 2 but occasionally 3) of identifiable afferents. Multiple filaments were studied in each animal in order to reduce the number of animals used. When collecting data from several filaments in the same animal, only units with non-overlapping receptive fields were characterized, so as to avoid sensitization by previously applied stimuli. Action potentials were amplified and passed through an analogue-to-digital converter (1401, Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, UK). Spikes were recorded and analysed using <sc>spike</sc> 2 v5 software (Cambridge Electronic Design).</p><p>The receptive fields of primary afferent fibres were initially identified by monopolar electrical stimulation of discrete (1 mm diameter) areas of the hindpaw (up to 100 V, 0.5 ms duration) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Kress <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>) and conduction velocities were determined. C- and A-fibre conduction velocity boundaries were determined from saphenous nerve compound action potentials recorded in the same region of the saphenous nerve, performed in animals of the same sex and weight as those used for subsequent experiments. Using compound action potentials we determined that, in our preparation, the conduction velocities of C-fibres were always &#x0003c; 1 m/s and those of A-&#x003b4;-fibres were between 5 and 15 m/s. All of the more rapidly conducting cutaneous afferents were classed as A&#x003b2;-fibres but, as histological studies suggest that TRPA1 is found in the small, more slowly conducting afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Jordt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Kobayashi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Obata <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), A&#x003b2; units were not studied further.</p><p>Following the identification of the primary afferent fibre receptive field and conduction velocity measurements, the mechanical and thermal thresholds of the afferent neurones (units) were determined. The mechanical thresholds were determined using calibrated von Frey hairs (Linton Instruments, Norfolk, UK) as has been reported in many previous studies in both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Kumazawa &#x00026; Perl, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Lynn &#x00026; Carpenter, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Leem <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Koltzenburg <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). Filaments were applied to the most sensitive region of the receptive field for approximately 3 s. The weight of the lowest force filament that reproducibly evoked activity was defined as the threshold of the unit, as previously described using a similar method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Dina <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). It should be noted that hand-held von Frey hairs give an approximation of the mechanical thresholds of primary afferent units as the application of a range of hairs exerts incremental, discrete forces rather than a continuous force on the receptive field. Units that did not respond to stimuli &#x0003e; 180 g were not included in the analysis as it could not be determined whether these units were &#x02018;silent&#x02019; nociceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Michaelis <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>) or whether the receptive field could not be located. In some cases units were also tested with gentle moving mechanical stimulation (brushing) to define unit type.</p><p>Thermal thresholds were determined using a Peltier device (built in-house, surface area ca. 8 mm<sup>2</sup>) to heat or cool the cutaneous receptive field of the unit under study. The Peltier was placed on the receptive field in contact with the skin. In the event of this evoking activity in any low-threshold afferents in the filament under study, the Peltier was repositioned to eliminate this before thermal stimulation began, to ensure that thermal responses were not contaminated with low-threshold afferent activity. The Peltier temperature was ramped from a holding temperature of 30&#x02013;5&#x000b0;C (&#x0223c;2&#x000b0;C/s) and then, after an interstimulus interval of no less than 2 min, from 30&#x000b0;C to 50&#x000b0;C (&#x0223c;5&#x000b0;C/s). Occasionally the cold stimulus was reduced to 0&#x000b0;C if a clear cold response was not evident at 5&#x000b0;C. C-cold units were initially identified by their characteristic bursting discharge at room temperature (20-25&#x000b0;C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Hensel, 1981</xref>). Using the same thermal stimuli, C-cold units responded vigorously to cold stimulation and were inhibited by heat stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Hensel, 1981</xref>). The Peltier temperature at which afferent firing began was taken as the heat or cold threshold for each unit.</p><p>&#x02018;Classical&#x02019; cold-responsive fibres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Hensel &#x00026; Zotterman, 1951</xref>) were also identified in these experiments. The temperature at which ongoing activity in these fibres begins is above that of the normal cutaneous temperature (28&#x02013;30&#x000b0;C) and so these afferents were easily identified by their ongoing activity. This stimulus/response pattern meant that the cold activation threshold (i.e. the temperature at which firing began in response to cooling) for these afferents could not be easily determined. In addition, none of these units were TRPA1-positive and therefore these units were also excluded from further threshold analysis.</p><p>If a unit responded to at least two out of noxious mechanical, chemical, heat and cold stimulation it was classified as a polymodal nociceptor. Units that only responded to mechanical stimuli were classified as nociceptive if the threshold was greater than 1 g (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Lynn &#x00026; Carpenter, 1982</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Close intra-arterial drug administration</title><p>For close intra-arterial drug administration, the left femoral artery was cannulated in the groin and the cannula advanced ca. 25 mm to the bifurcation of the descending aorta. In experiments in which units were not seen to respond to intra-arterial drug administration, the position of the cannula at the aortic bifurcation was confirmed visually at the end of the experiment. Agonists were administered in a 100 &#x003bc;L bolus (10% ethanol, 10% Tween 80, 80% saline) washed into the hindpaw with 400 &#x003bc;L of heparinized saline (50 U/mL). Antagonists were delivered in the same manner 60 s prior to agonist delivery and a minimum of 5 min was left between agonist/antagonist doses. In experiments in which afferent responses to capsaicin (10 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) and/or cinnamaldehyde (80 m<sc>m</sc>) were determined, agonists were injected as described with a minimum of 5 min between injections. The elicited activity was then quantified as detailed in the Data and statistical analysis section below. Units that responded to both, or either, agonists were counted and the overlap in responsive populations calculated. Preliminary studies showed that the cinnamaldehyde-evoked response did not desensitize after three consecutive injections. No more than three injections were made per animal.</p></sec><sec><title>TRPA1 expression in DRG in acute inflammation</title><p>Animals were briefly anaesthetized using 4% halothane in O<sub>2</sub> (2 L/min) and maintained areflexive on 2% halothane in O<sub>2</sub>. Once areflexia was achieved, 100 &#x003bc;L of CFA (1 mg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, UK) was injected through the patella ligament into the right knee joint to induce arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Davis &#x00026; Perkins, 1993</xref>) (<italic>n</italic>= 6). Controls were uninjected (<italic>n</italic>= 6).</p><p>The knee joint diameter was measured with callipers across the knee joint before CFA injection and every 2 days thereafter for 7 days after CFA injection. Animals were killed at the peak of swelling and behavioural changes (3 days) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">Wilson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Kelly <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>) and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) removed for immunohistochemical staining for TRPA1.</p><p>The DRG were embedded in TissueTek (Sakura Finetek) and snap frozen. DRG (L4, ipsilateral to the arthritis) were sectioned in the transverse plane at 8 &#x003bc;m, thaw-mounted onto slides coated with aminopropyltriethoxysilane (Sigma-Aldrich) and processed for immunohistochemistry as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Dumitrescu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), with some modifications. Sections separated by more than 50 &#x003bc;m were selected for processing, from the middle third of the DRG. Aldehydes are known to covalently bind to TRPA1, so sections were postfixed with Zamboni's fixative rather than 4% paraformaldehyde, as preliminary data suggested that paraformaldehyde fixation resulted in poor TRPA1 staining. Sections were incubated overnight with a primary antibody raised against the N-terminus of TRPA1 (generous gift of Prof. Jaime Garcia-Anoveros, Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, IL, USA; previously characterized against rodent DRG; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Nagata <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>) at 4&#x000b0;C at a dilution of 1 : 100. Slides were then extensively washed in phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and the signal visualized using diaminobenzidine. Control sections were processed without the primary antibody. The percentages of TRPA1-expressing cells were calculated by counting the numbers of positive and negative cells with cytoplasmic staining, as defined by the blinded operator (JPD), in non-serial secretions (to avoid double counting) from each animal, with reference to control sections that were not exposed to the primary antibody. We did not attempt to quantify cell size distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Chopra <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). The negative control indicated that nuclear staining in both DRG neurones and satellite cells was non-specific. TRPA1-expressing cells were counted in each of two sections from four to six animals per group and mean values for each animal were calculated and used in subsequent statistical analysis. Because a defined stereological approach was not employed, the percentages of neurones calculated may represent a biased estimate of the actual numbers of TRPA1-positive neurones.</p></sec><sec><title>Drugs</title><p>All drugs were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich except for capsaicin, which was obtained from Tocris (Bristol, UK). Sodium pentobarbital was obtained in its sodium salt form and was made up in house (60 mg/mL) to allow i.p. and i.v. injection for anaesthetic induction and maintenance respectively. Drugs for intra-arterial injection were delivered in 10% ethanol, 10% Tween 80 and 80% saline (cinnamaldehyde, capsaicin and capsazepine) or saline (ruthenium red) at the concentrations shown in the text.</p></sec><sec><title>Data and statistical analysis</title><p>Data are expressed as detailed in the figure legends.

TRPA1-positive afferents were identified using cinnamaldehyde (80 m<sc>m</sc>), a selective TRPA1 agonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bandell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), administered by close intra-arterial injection. This evoked robust activity in a population of primary afferent fibres (TRPA1-positive). Cinnamaldehyde applied over a longer period of time resulted in more prolonged activity (data not shown).</p><p>The TRPA1-positive afferents innervating normal skin had significantly higher mechanical thresholds than TRPA1-negative units (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref>, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01), indicative of TRPA1 expression on nociceptive afferents. All of the TRPA1-positive units were nociceptors. Some polymodal units had mechanical thresholds of &#x0003c; 1 g; these all had thermal thresholds in the noxious range, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Lynn &#x00026; Carpenter, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">Willis &#x00026; Coggeshall, 2004</xref>).

In inflammation, the mechanical activation thresholds of only TRPA1-expressing neurones decreased, whereas the thermal thresholds altered to a similar degree in both TRPA1-expressing and non-TRPA1-expressing afferents. TRPA1-positive afferents were sensitized to both agonist and physiological stimuli in inflammation. Our findings also show that TRPA1 is restricted to a subpopulation of nociceptive afferents, all of which are mechanosensitive, some of which are heat sensitive but very few of which are cold sensitive. These data support and extend previous histochemical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">Story <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Jordt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Kobayashi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Nagata <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>) and functional studies on TRPA1-expressing afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">Schmidt <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Diogenes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The TRPA1-positive afferent population comprises C-fibre high-threshold mechanoreceptors and polymodal receptors, and so was not restricted to polymodal nociceptors as we initially hypothesized. Polymodal nociceptors encode information on noxious mechanical, heat and cold stimuli, are usually responsive to inflammatory mediators, and their properties are often dramatically affected in inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Andrew &#x00026; Greenspan, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">Schaible <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Importantly, in inflammation, the mechanical thresholds of the TRPA1-positive afferents were significantly lowered compared with normal animals, whereas the thresholds of TRPA1-negative afferents did not change. During inflammation the thresholds of the TRPA1-positive cells fell to values similar to TRPA1-negative units in non-inflamed rats. These lowered thresholds, together with the recent findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Petrus <italic>et al.</italic> (2007)</xref>, imply that the inflammatory mechanical allodynia is mediated through a change in the properties of TRPA1-positive primary afferents. In contrast, however, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Obata <italic>et al.</italic> (2005)</xref>, in elegant studies using intrathecal TRPA1 antisense, did not find an effect of TRPA1-positive knockdown on inflammatory mechanical hyperalgesia. The reason for the disparity between these results is not clear.</p><p>Lowered mechanical thresholds could come about through increased sensitivity of TRPA1-positive mechanoreceptors and/or <italic>de-novo</italic> TRPA1 expression in afferents that have lower mechanical thresholds. The number of DRG neurones expressing TRPA1 increases in inflammation (these data; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Obata <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>) so there is evidence to support the latter mechanism. There is no increase in cell size of TRPA1 mRNA-expressing cells after CFA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Obata <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), indicating that this increased expression does not occur in large A-fibre, low-threshold neurones. With regard to the mechanical thresholds of individual afferents, it is thought that the mechanical thresholds of fine cutaneous primary afferent nociceptors are not affected by inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Andrew &#x00026; Greenspan, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Koltzenburg, 1999</xref>) and behavioural changes in the mechanical withdrawal thresholds are attributed to central effects. Indeed mustard oil, a TRPA1 agonist, applied to skin lowered the mechanical thresholds of high-threshold dorsal horn neurones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">Woolf <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>). In contrast, a lowering of the afferent mechanical thresholds is accepted as contributing to behavioural allodynia in arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">Schaible <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). There are reports of lowered mechanical thresholds in primary afferent neurones of different species following inflammation or tissue damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Cooper <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Davis <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Randich <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">Yamashita <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Pogatzki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), administration of inflammatory mediators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Martin <italic>et al.</italic>, 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Ahlgren <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>) and in arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Guilbaud <italic>et al.</italic>, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">Schaible &#x00026; Schmidt, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Grigg <italic>et al.</italic>, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Grubb <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>). In contrast, others report no change in rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Reeh <italic>et al.</italic>, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Kirchhoff <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Koltzenburg <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">Schlegel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>) and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Olausson, 1998</xref>). Potential differences between reports that find no change in mechanical threshold and our work are not immediately obvious but could include the site of inflammation, superficial/cutaneous or deeper tissues, and <italic>in vitro</italic> vs. <italic>in vivo</italic> preparations. We saw lowered mechanical thresholds only in the TRPA1-expressing afferents, in agreement with other reports where changes in mechanical thresholds were only seen in some, but not all, C-fibres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Randich <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">Yamashita <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). Where afferent responses are pooled, as they are in most studies, any lowered threshold in a specific subpopulation, such as TRPA1-positive, could be missed. There is, in addition, the possibility that altered thresholds may not be observed, due to the nature of the stimulus applied using hand-held von Frey hairs (e.g. application of incremental rather than continuous mechanical stimuli and accurate repositioning of filaments for repeated stimulation). These potential methodological weaknesses did not, however, influence our ability to detect changes in the mechanical threshold in inflammation.</p><p>Inflammation also resulted in an enhanced response to cinnamaldehyde, showing agonist sensitization of TRPA1 receptors in inflammation, and an increased number of responsive neurones. These findings would suggest that the chemosensitivity of TRPA1-positive afferent fibres is enhanced in inflammation. Thus, where endogenous inflammatory aldehydes, such as 4-hydroxynonenal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">Trevisani <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>) or other inflammatory mediators that sensitize TRPA1, are increased [such as protease activated receptor 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Dai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>) or bradykinin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bandell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Bautista <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>)], more activity could be evoked than in uninflamed tissues. The combination of the sensitization and increased numbers of TRPA1 C-fibre afferents would lead to increased nociceptive input to the spinal cord in inflammation.</p><p>The majority of TRPA1-positive afferents also responded to capsaicin, in both normal and inflamed rats, indicating an almost 100% functional overlap of TRPA1 and TRPV1. Unsurprisingly, inflammation resulted in a lowered heat threshold in all of the afferents studied. The surprising finding with respect to heat was that in normal animals TRPA1-positive afferents had significantly lower heat thresholds than the TRPA1-negative population. Given that there are functional interactions between TRPA1 and TRPV1 <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bandell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Bautista <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Jeske <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Akopian <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Ruparel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), it is interesting to speculate that a TRPA1/TRPV1 interaction may be responsible for the lower heat thresholds seen in the polymodal C-fibres that express TRPA1 in comparison to those that do not. That both TRPA1-positive and TRPA1-negative afferents developed lowered heat thresholds in inflammation is probably attributable to the sensitization of TRPV1 in inflammation, which is present in afferents of both groups (these data; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Kobayashi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>) and is known to contribute to heat sensitization of afferents in inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Davis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">Story <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Although we identified a large number of tonically active C-cold afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Hensel &#x00026; Zotterman, 1951</xref>), none of these were activated by cinnamaldehyde. In addition, in these fibres cold thresholds are difficult to determine as they encode temperature through dynamic changes in firing pattern rather than onset of firing at a specific temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Hensel &#x00026; Zotterman, 1951</xref>), and these were therefore not included in these analyses. We identified very few TRPA1-positive cold-activated C-fibres, so interpretation of a possible role of these afferents in cold nociception is very limited. The threshold of the cold-responsive C-fibre afferents was raised in inflammation, indicating the development of a cold allodynia mediated through changes in primary afferent properties, consistent with reported behavioural changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Obata <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Due to the low number of TRPA1-positive cold-responsive afferents identified we cannot draw definite conclusions on the possible role of TRPA1 in C-fibre nociceptors in inflammatory cold allodynia. Interestingly, we also identified a few TRPA1-positive cold-sensitive A&#x003b4; units in normal animals. A&#x003b4; but not C-fibres are particularly important in cold behavioural changes in nerve injury and icilin-evoked responses are enhanced in neuropathic rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Kosugi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). It is possible that further study of TRPA1 in A-fibres, many of which are cold-responsive at very low stimulus temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">Simone &#x00026; Kajander, 1997</xref>), may reveal a contribution of this class of fibres to the behavioural changes seen in inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Obata <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p><p>The aim of this study was to determine how the properties of TRPA1-expressing neurones are changed in inflammation <italic>in vivo</italic>. We identified an increase in the proportion of TRPA1-positive afferents, an increase in agonist sensitivity and lowered mechanical thresholds only in the TRPA1-positive fibres in inflammation. Together, these changes in primary afferents may contribute to enhanced afferent activity in inflammatory states.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We gratefully acknowledge Prof. Jaime Garcia-Anoveros (Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, IL, USA) for the generous gift of the TRPA1 antibody.
