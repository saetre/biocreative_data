During early steps of neural development, the hindbrain is transiently organized in segments along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis, which are called rhombomeres (r). This transient segmental organization is necessary for the correct specification of the different neuronal subtypes, the location of the cranial nerve exit points, and the migration streams of the neural crest cells from the dorsal hindbrain towards the branchial arches. Rhombomeres display a specific combinatory of gene expression that confers molecular identity to the rhombomeric territories, and they are compartment-like units with cell lineage restriction (for reviews see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]).</p><p>Refinement of the AP identities within the hindbrain requires the establishment of local signaling centers, which emit signals that pattern territories in their vicinity. Two signaling centers which emit FGF and WNT signals are located within the hindbrain: the Isthmic Organizer (IsO), at the level of the Midbrain-Hindbrain Boundary (MHB) (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]), and the 'r4-FGF source' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. FGFs emitted from the central and caudal hindbrain have been demonstrated to be crucial for hindbrain specification. In zebrafish, <italic>fgf3 </italic>and <italic>fgf8 </italic>from r4 have redundant functions in patterning the hindbrain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], whereas in chick and mouse <italic>Fgf3 </italic>dynamically expressed in the r4-r6 region is needed for the specification of the caudal hindbrain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Gain-of-function experiments in zebrafish suggested that FGFs from the hindbrain cooperate with the transcription factor <italic>vHnf1 </italic>in the specification of the caudal hindbrain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This cooperation occurs early during neurulation and leads to the induction of two genes involved in rhombomeric specification, <italic>Krox20 </italic>for r5 and <italic>MafB </italic>for r5 and r6. Results in chick suggest that <italic>vHnf1 </italic>operates upstream of FGF signaling in this regulation: <italic>vHnf1 </italic>not only cooperates with <italic>Fgf3 </italic>in the induction of <italic>Krox20 </italic>and <italic>MafB </italic>, but also regulates <italic>Fgf3 </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Analyses of the <italic>Krox20 </italic>and <italic>MafB </italic>regulatory regions in mice have shown that they contain functional vHNF1-binding sites, suggesting that <italic>vHnf1 </italic>can control these genes in a direct manner as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>One of the questions that have challenged developmental biologists in the last years is how FGF signaling can generate such a different array of responses in the several developmental events in which is involved. It is known that these very diverse outcomes are context dependent, with FGF signaling acting in a cellular environment defined by previous and current signaling activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. One of the most accepted hypotheses considers that the activation and tuning of different intracellular pathways downstream FGF signaling can generate part of this variability. Among those, the FGF-downstream intracellular cascades Ras-ERK1/2 and PI3K-Akt are those that have mostly been related to embryonic patterning events. Different and in some cases contradictory models have been proposed for the involvement of Ras-ERK1/2 and PI3K-Akt pathways in different tissues and systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In addition, the FGF signaling system is tightly regulated by a series of modulators, which exert their functions at different levels of the pathway, from the FGFR to specific components of the different intracellular pathways (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]). The expression of these genes is induced by FGF activity itself and regional and temporal variation in their levels of expression is though to tune FGF signaling to the appropriate levels for each particular event. The term 'synexpression group' has been adopted to designate sets of genes that share complex spatio-temporal expression patterns and have a functional relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Synexpression groups form expression cassettes that can be found at different times and locations during development. The FGF factors, such as <italic>Fgf8 </italic>and <italic>Fgf4</italic>, and FGFRs (<italic>FGFR1-4</italic>), together with negative modulators of FGF signaling (<italic>MKP3, SPRY2</italic>, <italic>Sef </italic>and <italic>Spred </italic>), the positive modulator <italic>FLRT3 </italic>and transcription factors such as the members of the Ets-type family <italic>Pea3, Erm </italic>and <italic>Er81 </italic>have been designated as the 'FGF synexpression group' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The aim of the present work was to dissect the FGF-intracellular cascade involved in caudal hindbrain patterning. Further to our previous observations on the regulation of <italic>Fgf3 </italic>in the chick hindbrain, we provide evidence suggesting that <italic>Fgf3 </italic>is a direct transcriptional target of <italic>vHnf1</italic>. We provide a detailed spatial and temporal map of expression of key components of the FGF signaling system such as <italic>MKP3</italic>, <italic>Pea3 </italic>and of Ras-ERK1/2 and PI3K-Akt activity in the hindbrain at early stages of embryonic development. We also analyze the functional activity of the intracellular pathways downstream FGF signaling using specific chemical inhibitors. The results show that <italic>MKP3 </italic>expression colocalizes with activated ERK1/2 and it is sensitive to inhibition of Ras-ERK1/2. This pathway mediates the functions of FGF3 signaling in caudal hindbrain specification regulating the expression of <italic>Krox20 </italic>and <italic>MafB </italic>, without involvement of the PI3K-Akt pathway. Altogether these data provide new insights in the repertoire of FGF pathway genes associated to hindbrain development and on the role of FGF signaling in caudal hindbrain specification.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Fgf3 is rapidly induced after vHnf1 overexpression</title><p>Previous work indicated that <italic>Fgf3 </italic>was downstream of <italic>vHnf1 </italic>in the induction of caudal rhombomeric markers such as <italic>Krox20 </italic>and <italic>MafB </italic>. <italic>vHnf1 </italic>operates in a specific time-window and is not able to induce <italic>Fgf3</italic>, <italic>MafB </italic>or <italic>Krox20 </italic>at late stages of hindbrain patterning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. One important question was to know whether <italic>Fgf3 </italic>was a direct downstream target of <italic>vHnf1</italic>. To address this issue we studied the time course of <italic>Fgf3 </italic>induction after <italic>mvHnf1 </italic>overexpression. We designed a semiquantitative RT-PCR approach to determine the kinetics of <italic>Fgf3 </italic>induction. Embryos of 3-4ss (HH8) were electroporated with <italic>mvHnf1 </italic>and incubated at 38&#x000b0;C during different time periods (15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 3 h, 6 h). After incubation, the hindbrain tissue was isolated and processed for RT-PCR amplification. 15 min after electroporation, a band of 600 bp corresponding to <italic>mvHnf1 </italic>expression at both 25 and 27 cycles was amplified (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1Aa, B</xref>), indicating the amount of ectopic <italic>mvHnf1 </italic>already transcribed in the embryo. The number of cycles used, 25 and 27, was to show that we were not under saturation conditions. At the same time point, a weaker 450 bp band corresponding to the endogenous <italic>cFgf3 </italic>expression was amplified by RT-PCR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1Aa, B</xref>). To avoid biased results and to be able to compare between different time points, the ratio of intensity <italic>cFgf3/mvHnf1 </italic>was always used to analyze the data. As incubation time increased (30 min and 1 h), the intensity of the <italic>cFgf3 </italic>band was progressively stronger in respect to the <italic>mvHnf1 </italic>band (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1Ab-c, B</xref>). From 1 h onwards, the intensity of the <italic>cFgf3 </italic>band was relatively similar for all time points, suggesting that either the reaction reached saturation or <italic>vHnf1 </italic>was not able to induce <italic>cFgf3 </italic>transcription anymore (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1Ad, B</xref>). Thus, as early as 30 min after electroporation the endogenous expression of <italic>Fgf3 </italic>was increased and by 1 h a plateau was reached (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Control experiments were performed with a form of <italic>vHnf1 </italic>containing the Q136E substitution in the POU-specific domain that completely abolishes DNA-binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The construct was overexpressed and embryos were incubated at 38&#x000b0;C during 6 h (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1Ae</xref>). The <italic>cFgf3 </italic>relative levels of expression were much higher in experimental samples than in the control (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1Ad</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1Ae</xref>, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> for quantification).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold><italic>Fgf3 </italic>is rapidly induced after <italic>mvHnf1 </italic>overexpression</bold>.

The RT-PCR semiquantitative analysis shows that <italic>Fgf3 </italic>is rapidly induced after <italic>vHnf1 </italic>overexpression, suggesting a direct transcriptional regulation. Although regulatory analysis of the mouse <italic>Fgf3 </italic>gene revealed a DNA region driving <italic>Fgf3 </italic>expression to the hindbrain, this enhancer region does not fully recapitulate the dynamics of <italic>Fgf3 </italic>expression within the hindbrain and it did not bring much light into the transcription factor binding candidates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Akt and ERK1/2 pathways are active in the caudal hindbrain</title><p>The FGF signals exert their function by activating different intracellular pathways. Although five intracellular pathways are known to be downstream of FGF signaling, mainly Ras-ERK1/2 and, to a lesser extent, PI3K-Akt have been related to embryonic processes in different tissues and models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Given that FGF signaling controls <italic>Krox20 </italic>and <italic>MafB </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], our next question was to study which of these intracellular networks were activated downstream <italic>Fgf3 </italic>in the caudal hindbrain.</p><p>For this purpose, the activated forms of FGF effectors within the hindbrain at early stages of embryonic development were analyzed. Caudal hindbrain tissue from HH8-HH9 stage embryos was isolated and western blot analysis was performed to detect the Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylated forms (pAkt and pERK1/2). When antibodies against both the total and the phosphorylated forms of Akt were used in protein extracts of isolated hindbrains, a 60 kD band corresponding to Akt was obtained in both cases (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). This result suggests that the PI3K-Akt pathway is active at these stages of hindbrain patterning. Western blot analysis detecting either the total or the phosphorylated forms of ERK1/2 revealed that Ras-ERK1/2 pathway was also active during this period (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). As positive controls for ERK1/2 and Akt activation, protein extracts of whole embryos were used (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Phosphorylated forms of Akt and ERK1/2 are present in the caudal hindbrain</bold>.

With this in mind, we performed whole-mount immunodetection of pERK1/2 with embryos at HH8-HH10 stages. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b-h</xref>, pERK1/2 was detected in embryonic territories within or close to FGF reported sources such as: the anterior neural ridge (ANR), the mid-hindbrain boundary (MHB), the precardiac mesoderm (pm), the primitive strike (ps), the caudal neural plate, and the presomitic and intermediate mesoderm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b-e</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]).

Different models are proposed for the involvement of Ras-ERK1/2 and PI3K-Akt pathways in patterning events.

Jurkat cells were treated and processed for protein extraction and western blot analysis was performed to reveal total and phosphorylated forms of Akt and ERK1/2. As expected, cells that were treated with PD184352 gave negative signal for pERK1/2 but not for pAkt. Conversely, cells that were treated with LY29402 did not phosphorylate Akt but did ERK1/2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). In all cases, total forms of ERK1/2 and Akt were detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). However, when Jurkat T cells were treated with SU5402, pErk1/2 was downregulated but pAkt levels were maintained (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). This is explained by the fact that Jurkat cells are PTEN mutants: PTEN is inactivated and as consequence, PI3K action in the activation of Akt is reinforced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. This can be reverted by the application of LY294002 which directly inhibits PI3K, but not by SU5402 which is more upstream in the pathway, just at the level of the RTKs (Receptor Tyrosin Kinases).</p><p>Next, we tested the inhibitors in embryonic explants. HH7<sup>+</sup>-HH8 embryos were explanted and incubated during 6 h at 38&#x000b0;C in the presence or absence of the inhibitors.

When explanted embryos were treated with SU5402, pAkt was downregulated but levels of pERK1/2 were maintained.

However, several other players may be involved in regulating the expression of <italic>Fgf3</italic>. This can be inferred from the complex and dynamic expression profile that this gene displays within the hindbrain. Indeed, we previously demonstrated that <italic>vHnf1 </italic>can only induce <italic>Fgf3 </italic>in a discrete period of time that comprises the earliest steps of neurulation, from 0-1ss to 7ss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].

In addition to this, a recent report proposes that <italic>Fgf3 </italic>expression in the chick hindbrain requires inhibition of BMP signaling by follistatin and active FGF signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. However, in our hands, neither electroporation of <italic>mFgf3 </italic>nor loss-of-function of FGF by chemical inhibitors was able to induce or abolish <italic>cFgf3 </italic>at short periods. Most probably, this discrepancy is due to differences in the length of treatment and the embryonic stage of the specimens.</p><p>The fact that the <italic>Fgf3 </italic>expression profile within the hindbrain is not exactly coincident in the different vertebrate species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] suggests that its regulation presents substantial species-specific differences.

We have scanned the annotated chick <italic>Fgf3 </italic>locus to identify potential vHNF1-binding sites in the <italic>Fgf3 </italic>regulatory regions, but DNA sequence analysis did not led us to identify any regulatory region of relevance. BLAST analysis similarly failed to find conserved sequence elements present amongst disparate genomes in the databases. Therefore, identifying the potential vHNF1-binding sites in this region represents a major goal in understanding the molecular mechanisms required for <italic>Fgf3 </italic>expression in the hindbrain.</p></sec><sec><title>A local gradient of ERK1/2 activity coincides with early expression of Fgf3 and FGF activity readouts in the caudal hindbrain</title><p>We studied FGF signaling during hindbrain patterning by analyzing the profile of the FGF-activated Ras-ERK1/2 pathway. We show that the activated form of ERK1/2, pERK1/2, is localized at early stages of development in embryonic territories that are within or close to FGF sources, such as: the forebrain influenced by FGF8/12/13 from the ANR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], the midbrain and the hindbrain influenced by FGF8 and FGF3 respectively, the precardiac mesoderm influenced by FGF8 from the endoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] and the otic placode under the influence of FGF3 from the hindbrain and FGF19 from the mesoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. This is in agreement with other works in mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>] and chick [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], in which the localization of pERK1/2 is compared with the expression profile of <italic>FGFRs1-4</italic>, <italic>MKP3 </italic>and the <italic>Pea3 </italic>subfamily of Ets factors during early embryonic development. HH8 embryos display a pERK1/2 gradient extending anteriorly and posteriorly from the caudal hindbrain. This gradient is consistent with the expression of <italic>Fgf3 </italic>in this territory. At later stages, pERK1/2 is localized throughout the hindbrain, being more intense in the MHB. Therefore, our results suggest that the initial activation of pERK1/2 in the caudal hindbrain depends on a local FGF source within this area rather than being the tail of a gradient established in more rostral areas. This idea is supported by our analysis of the FGF-activity readout <italic>MKP3</italic>. <italic>MKP3 </italic>is expressed in two domains within the hindbrain, a more rostral one in the MHB and a more posterior one in the caudal hindbrain. Between these two domains there is a region of the rostral hindbrain that does not express <italic>MKP3</italic>, suggesting that this region has lower levels of ERK1/2 activity. On the contrary, although <italic>Pea3 </italic>is also initiated in two different domains, at later stages it is expressed throughout the hindbrain. This could reflect that <italic>MKP3 </italic>and <italic>Pea3 </italic>transcriptions require different thresholds of ERK1/2 activity to be induced. We have analyzed the expression of <italic>Spry2 </italic>and <italic>FLRT3</italic>, two other genes belonging to the FGF synexpression group. The negative modulator <italic>Spry2 </italic>is highly expressed in the MHB and r1 but shows weak and very transient expression in the hindbrain (data not shown). This expression does not fully coincide with the expressions of <italic>Fgf3 </italic>or <italic>MKP3 </italic>in the caudal hindbrain since it is slightly anterior to them. The positive modulator of FGF activity <italic>FLRT3 </italic>was observed in the anterior part of the neural tube but not in the caudal hindbrain (data not shown). This gene is later restricted to the MHB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Therefore, genes from the FGF synexpression group are expressed in a dynamic and tissue-dependent manner. Since the role of these genes is to regulate FGF signaling (<italic>MKP3</italic>, <italic>Spry2, FLRT3</italic>) or to modulate gene expression in response to FGF signals (<italic>Pea3</italic>, <italic>Erm </italic>, <italic>Er81</italic>), it is likely that regional and temporal variation in the levels of expression of these genes during embryogenesis can tune FGF signaling in each particular event.

Therefore, this indicates that <italic>MKP3 </italic>is a highly sensitive FGF readout that responds quickly to variations in FGF signaling within the hindbrain. This quick response could be important to differentiate between punctual and sustained stimulation of the FGF-ERK1/2 pathway and, therefore, for modulating the different array of responses that this pathway can promote.</p><p>The expression of the rhombomeric markers <italic>Krox20 </italic>and <italic>MafB </italic>is only dependent on the Ras-ERK1/2 pathway. Thus, FGF signaling mediates caudal hindbrain patterning through the Ras-ERK1/2 pathway. Previous findings in zebrafish support this hypothesis: when <italic>vhnf1 </italic>is co-expressed with a constitutively active form of ERK in the zebrafish embryo the <italic>val/MafB </italic>gene is ectopically induced, just as occurs when co-expression of <italic>vhnf1 </italic>and <italic>fgf3 </italic>is performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In addition, FGF blocking inhibits <italic>Krox20 </italic>and <italic>MafB </italic>expression only if inhibitor treatment is done before the onset of these genes, this is 5ss for <italic>MafB </italic>and 7ss for <italic>Krox20</italic>. Thus, it seems that <italic>vHnf1 </italic>and FGF-ERK1/2 signaling are needed for early establishment of <italic>Krox20 </italic>and <italic>MafB </italic>expression rather that for their maintenance. Consistently, certain evidences suggest that maintenance of <italic>Krox20 </italic>and <italic>MafB </italic>expression depends on autoregulatory mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>].

Finally, <italic>vHnf1 </italic>and <italic>Fgf3 </italic>would cooperate via Ras-ERK1/2 to induce <italic>MafB </italic>and <italic>Krox20 </italic>in the caudal hindbrain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and FGF signaling would be regulated by <italic>MKP3</italic>.</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Model depicting the cooperation of <italic>vHnf1 </italic>and FGF signals in the induction of <italic>MafB </italic>and <italic>Krox20 </italic>in the caudal hindbrain</bold>. (a) <italic>vHnf1 </italic>is very early expressed in the caudal neural plate with a sharp boundary laying in the prospective r4/r5 boundary.

Coinciding with the onset of <italic>Krox20 </italic>in r5, <italic>vHnf1 </italic>progressively regresses to r6 between 7 and 10ss.

Therefore, these results suggest that the Ras-ERK1/2 pathway is involved in mediating FGF signaling during caudal hindbrain patterning with no apparent contribution of the PI3K-Akt pathway. Taken together, the data presented in this work and previous knowledge leads us to propose a model in which <italic>vHnf1 </italic>is the molecular switch that initiates the process of r5 and r6 specification. <italic>vHnf1 </italic>rapidly induces <italic>Fgf3 </italic>in the caudal hindbrain, which activates the Ras-ERK1/2 pathway. <italic>vHnf1 </italic>and <italic>Fgf3-ERK1/2 </italic>co-operate for the induction of <italic>MafB </italic>expression in r5 and r6 at 4-5ss and <italic>Krox20 </italic>in r5 at 6-7ss.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Embryos and staging</title><p>Chick embryos were obtained from fertilized hens' eggs (Granja Gibert, Tarragona, Spain) and incubated in humidified atmosphere at 38&#x000b0;C.
