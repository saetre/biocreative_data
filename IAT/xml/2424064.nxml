Thus, most genes related to cell differentiation are suppressed indirectly.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Identification of direct targets of transcription factors (TFs) is a necessary step to reconstruct gene regulatory networks in living cells. Although traditional single-gene experiments (e.g., assaying promoter activity using a promoter-reporter gene construct) remain most reliable in testing direct targets, there is also a need for high-throughput approaches that would allow one to detect the majority of most important target genes. Two experimental methods contribute most to such a high-throughput search of target genes: gene expression profiling of TF-manipulated cells and genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. However, expression profiling may yield many genes that respond indirectly, whereas ChIP may yield many non-functional binding sites, i.e., binding sites that were detected by ChIP, but were not functional for transcriptional regulation. Therefore, the state of the art is to take the intersection between these two sets of genes (i.e. select genes that responded to the manipulation of a TF and have binding sites) and consider it as a set of tentative target genes (TTGs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However, the intersection of these sets of genes may still contain numerous false positives &#x02013; genes that respond indirectly and have non-functional ChIP-binding sites. Another problem is that there is no method to statistically quantify the proportion of false positives in the set of TTGs.</p><p>To address these issues, we developed a new method to identify TTGs, which reduces the proportion of false positives by applying the False Discovery Rate (FDR) criterion to individual groups of genes that differ in the direction, magnitude, and time of response to the manipulation of a TF. The computational strategy included optimization of Scores of Potential Function (SPF) of binding sites that separated best the training and control sets of genes, and estimation of the FDR from the frequency distribution of SPF among control genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>A flow chart showing algorithm used to identify tentative target genes for a transcription factor.</bold> The algorithm includes the optimization of Scores of Potential Function (SPF) based on the comparison of training and control sets of genes, and the estimation of False Discovery Rates (FDR) within individual groups of responding genes.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-9-269-1"/></fig><p>This method is applied here to the mouse <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>(<italic>Oct3/4</italic>, <italic>Oct4</italic>) gene which is the major TF that controls self-renewal and pluripotency in ES cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Lists of potential target genes of POU5F1 were recently generated using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and gene expression profiling of cells with suppressed <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Most studies used shRNA for <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>suppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], but these methods can generate off-target effects, and gene repression is often weak. In these studies, expression profiling was carried out with 1 day intervals which limited the temporal resolution in detecting gene response. Matoba et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] increased the reliability of prediction of <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>primary targets by using a tet-inducible system to suppress <italic>Pou5f1</italic>. This method eliminated false-positives related to potential off-target effects of shRNA used to suppress <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>in earlier studies. However, gene expression was still measured in 1 day intervals, and microarrays did not include all the mouse genes. In this paper we present a new microarray experiment with the same tet-inducible system but with multiple time points within 24 hr to capture early responses to <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>suppression. These data were analyzed together with published genome-wide ChIP data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. We found that most TTGs of <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>in ES cells were activated by <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>and only a limited number of genes were suppressed, which implies that the main function of <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>binding to promoters of target genes is activation of gene expression rather than suppression. The same method was then applied to find target genes of <italic>Sox2 </italic>and <italic>Nanog </italic>based mostly on previously published data. A list of data sets used in this study is shown in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>. Because the interaction between POU5F1, SOX2, and NANOG is supported by immunoprecipitation, functional analysis, and co-localization of binding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], we explored the relationships between their target genes. These results are discussed in relation to the mechanism of pluripotency maintenance in ES cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>1. Time course microarray data</title><p>We previously reported time course microarray data of mouse ES cells, in which the level of <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>expression was reduced in tetracycline (Tet)-controllable manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Global gene expression profiles were obtained from ES samples at 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hr [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. To obtain earlier effects of <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>repression, here we used the same ZHBTc4 ES cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and measured the global gene expression profiles at 0, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hr after adding Tet. Because the 24 hr time point was present in both experiments, the microarray data at 24 hr was used to merge two data sets (see Methods) (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). In ZHBTc4 ES cells, the level of <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>mRNA was reduced to one-thirds within 3 hrs after adding Tet, whereas the same reduction of POU5F1 protein level was observed in 6 hrs (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). The cells show no morphological changes associated with differentiation during the first 24 hrs after adding Tet, but the cells begin to be flattened after 48 hrs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. We found 6197 genes with a statistically significant (FDR &#x0003c;= 0.05, fold change &#x0003e;= 1.5) response to <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>suppression (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). A subset of these genes with &#x0003e; 2 fold change (<italic>N </italic>= 2600) overlapped reasonably (<italic>N </italic>= 1319, 50.7%) with gene lists identified earlier using <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>knockdown with shRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5A</xref>). The majority (<italic>N </italic>= 1185, 96.7%) of 1225 genes common between our study and the published study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], changed their expression in the same direction after <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>suppression, which was significantly greater than expected from random matches (chi-square = 685, p = 10<sup>-150</sup>) (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5B</xref>). Discrepancies between data sets may be explained by off-target effects of shRNA in earlier studies and by a larger coverage of genes in our microarrays. Genes that were previously considered targets of POU5F1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], but had no response to <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>suppression in our experiments (<italic>N </italic>= 487), were not artifacts of microarray design, because the majority of these genes (<italic>N </italic>= 442) had functional oligos in our microarray that showed statistically significant differential expression in earlier experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Although several methods to analyze time course microarray data have been reported (e.g. clustering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], splines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]), we decided to characterize the pattern of gene expression in a simpler way by 2 major parameters: the time of response when it exceeded 1.5-fold change threshold, and the magnitude of response measured by the maximum logratio of expression change (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>) (see Materials and methods for details). The scatterplot of magnitude of response versus time of response for all genes with statistically significant change of expression (FDR &#x0003c;= 0.05, fold change &#x0003e;= 1.5) shows the global picture of gene expression change after manipulation of the <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The initial response to <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>suppression (&#x0003c; 24 hr) is characterized mostly by down-regulation of many genes. It is followed by the wave of gene up-regulation which becomes more intense after 36 hr. Genes with a strongest response had a tendency to be activated or suppressed earlier than genes with a weaker response. Earliest effects were suppression of TFs <italic>Foxd3</italic>, <italic>Mybl2</italic>, <italic>Zic3</italic>, <italic>Klf2</italic>, and <italic>Nr0b1</italic>. Later but still within 12 hr we observed activation of TFs that are expressed in trophectoderm (<italic>Eomes, Cdx2, Gata2, Irx3</italic>). Interestingly, genes that are considered important for pluripotency in ES cells (<italic>Sox2, Nanog, Klf4, Zfp42</italic>) responded with a considerable delay (&#x0003e; 24 hr).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Gene expression responses to the suppression of <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>(A) or <italic>Sox2 </italic>(B) expression in ES cells.</bold> Time and magnitude of responses were estimated from the time course microarray data using 1.5-fold expression changes as a threshold (C), and then used as coordinates in a scatter-plot. Tentative target genes were identified as shown in Fig 1.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-9-269-2"/></fig><p>Gene expression profiling of ES cells after suppression of <italic>Sox2 </italic>was carried out using the same protocol (Tet-inducible transgene cell line 2TS22C; the same array platform) as the experiment on <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Thus, results on <italic>Sox2 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>) were fully compatible with that for <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>experiment.</p><p>The proportion of genes that responded to the suppression of <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>and <italic>Sox2 </italic>increased in a similar manner over time (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), and the proportion of common genes also increased with time (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A, B</xref>). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed that gene expression response to <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>and <italic>Sox2 </italic>suppression was similar when projected on the first principal component (PC1) (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). PC1 seems to represent a transition of ES cells from a pluripotent state to more differentiated states because it is associated with a decreased expression of ES cell specific genes (e.g., <italic>Nanog</italic>, <italic>Zfp42</italic>, <italic>Nr0b1</italic>, <italic>Tcl1</italic>, <italic>Dppa3</italic>, <italic>Klf4</italic>, <italic>Jarid2</italic>), and increased expression of genes related to differentiation (e.g., <italic>Esx1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic>, <italic>Gata6</italic>, <italic>H19</italic>, <italic>Hoxa1</italic>, <italic>Msx2</italic>, <italic>Plat</italic>, keratins). The second principal component (PC2) represented minor fraction of genes that responded differentially to the suppression of <italic>Sox2 </italic>and <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Comparison of gene expression responses to suppression of <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>and <italic>Sox2</italic>:</bold> (A) number of genes with &#x0003e; 2 fold change in gene expression after suppression of <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>and <italic>Sox2</italic>; (B) proportion of genes with consistent responses (i.e., common genes whose expression changed in the same direction) and inconsistent responses (i.e., common genes whose expression changed in the opposite direction) to <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>and <italic>Sox2 </italic>suppression among the combined list of genes that responded by &#x0003e; 2 fold to either of these transcription factors; (C-D) Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of gene expression response to the suppression of <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>and <italic>Sox2 </italic>based on combined data.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-9-269-3"/></fig><p>We did not have (Tet)-inducible <italic>Nanog </italic>ES cells, and thus had to use the following three experimental results: (i) time course (1 to 7 days) of shRNA-mediated knockdown in ES cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], (ii) shRNA-mediated knockdown of <italic>Nanog </italic>in ES cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], and (iii) stable over-expression of <italic>Nanog </italic>performed in our laboratory (see Materials and methods). The first data set was analyzed in a way similar to the <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>data set; however because the experiment was done without replications we combined data points (data from day 3 and 4, and data from day 5, 6, and 7) as replications for statistical analysis (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>). Combined data points showed similar gene expression profiles based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (data not shown). In the latter 2 data sets, we classified genes only based on expression change (positive vs. negative, and &#x0003e; 2 fold change vs. &#x0003c; 2 fold change), and used these classes for estimating the FDR (Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref>). When we combined these 3 data sets, the direction of gene response was inverted for the experiment with <italic>Nanog </italic>over-expression to make it compatible with other data, and genes showing contradictory change were ignored. Because data on <italic>Nanog </italic>was obtained with different methods than on <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>and <italic>Sox2</italic>, it should be interpreted with caution.</p><p>It is important to note that genes affected by the alterations of <italic>Pou5f1</italic>, <italic>Sox2</italic>, and <italic>Nanog </italic>expression contain not only primary (direct) targets of these TFs, but also secondary/tertiary targets as shown previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>2. Data set of genome-wide Chromatin IP</title><p>We used genome-wide ChIP data of POU5F1 and NANOG, published by Loh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. All raw data were remapped to the mouse genome sequences and analyzed with the genome annotation using components of CisView software, which includes information on the transcription start sites (TSSs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. As we pointed out in our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], some known POU5F1 target genes were missed in the POU5F1-target gene list assembled by Loh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] partly due to the use of a stringent criteria (i.e., &#x02265; 4 ditags). We therefore decided to use both POU5F1 and NANOG ChIP data, when we searched for POU5F1 target or NANOG target. Significant co-localization of POU5F1, SOX2, and NANOG binding sites have been clearly shown recently by ChIP-chip analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In mouse, the strength of NANOG binding (measured by the number of ChIP-PET ditags) was positively associated with the strength of POU5F1 binding to the same region according to our re-analysis of ChIP data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S10">10</xref>). Our analysis of TF binding motifs in DNA regions identified by ChIP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] showed that ChIP-NANOG regions (isolated with NANOG antibody) had a high abundance of OCT-SOX composite binding motifs also known as HMG/POU cassettes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>). This finding also confirms co-localization of POU5F1, SOX2, and NANOG binding sites. Moreover, ChIP-NANOG regions that did not overlap with any ChIP-POU5F1 regions also had an increased abundance of OCT-SOX composite binding motifs (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>). This indicates that NANOG binding can be used as additional evidence of POU5F1 and SOX2 binding and vise versa. Therefore, it is reasonable to use a combination of POU5F1 and NANOG ChIP data for finding POU5F1 targets. For example, in the original ChIP-PET analysis by Loh et al., only binding sites with &#x02265; 4 ditags were considered reliable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In contrast, in our modified approach we could utilize POU5F1 binding sites with only 2 or 3 ditags on condition that they had additional NANOG ditags. This approach increases the sensitivity of finding TF binding sites, but it may have a down side of possibly being too inclusive.</p><p>We also used genome-wide ChIP data for SOX2 obtained from human ES cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, the human ChIP data were analyzed separately and used only to provide additional gene list for SOX2 targets (see the section 5 below for the details).</p></sec><sec><title>3. Evaluating the ChIP-binding sites with a score of potential function (SPF)</title><p>Presence of a ChIP-binding site of a TF in the promoter of a gene is not yet an evidence of transcription regulation because TF binding may be related to other cellular functions or may be not functional at all. To evaluate the potential functionality of POU5F1 binding sites in transcription regulation we developed a score of potential function (SPF), which was estimated using an ad hoc equation:</p><p><disp-formula id="bmcM1"><label>(1)</label>SPF = [<italic>N</italic><sub>1</sub><sup><italic>a </italic></sup>+ (<italic>b</italic>&#x000b7;<italic>N</italic><sub>2</sub>)<sup><italic>a</italic></sup>]&#x000b7;[max(<italic>D</italic>, 1000)/10000]<sup><italic>c </italic></sup>+ <italic>d</italic>&#x000b7;<italic>X</italic>,</disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>N</italic><sub>1 </sub>and <italic>N</italic><sub>2 </sub>are the number of ChIP-PET ditags for POU5F1 and NANOG (data from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]), respectively, <italic>D </italic>is the distance from binding region to TSS, <italic>X </italic>= 1 for CpG-rich regions and 0 otherwise, and <italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic>, <italic>c</italic>, and <italic>d </italic>are adjustable parameters. As we discussed above, we used data on NANOG binding so that it can provide additional evidence of binding site function. Expression levels of <italic>Nanog </italic>changed &#x0003e; 48 hr after <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>suppression; thus, the training sets did not contain genes which responded to <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>suppression indirectly via the effect of <italic>Nanog</italic>, and the use of NANOG binding could not affect SPF in favor of indirect effects. The SPF was optimized to best separate between the training set of genes that responded to <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>suppression and control set of genes that were not affected by <italic>Pou5f1</italic>. We used 2 training sets of genes that were down-regulated (<italic>N </italic>= 782) and up-regulated (<italic>N </italic>= 519), respectively, by at least 2 fold and responded non-transiently to <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>suppression within the time window from 6 to 48 hr (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S11">11</xref>). Genes that responded earlier than 6 hr may have been affected by other factors besides the gradually decreasing amount of POU5F1 protein, and genes that responded later than 48 hr are more likely to be affected indirectly. The control set of genes (<italic>N </italic>= 3048, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S11">11</xref>) contained genes with medium- or high-quality promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] represented by a responsive oligo in the microarray, which did not respond to <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>and had no differential expression between ES and TS cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Adjustable parameters were changed to maximize the <italic>t</italic>-statistics for the difference in average SPF values between the training and control set of genes (see Methods for details). To avoid circular reference by estimating SPF for genes in the training and control set with parameters optimized for the same genes, we used the bootstrap resampling method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Scores for POU5F1 binding sites were positively affected by the number of ChIP ditags and negatively affected by the distance from TSS and by CpG richness of the sequence (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S12">12</xref>). Down-regulated genes were more widely separated from control genes by their average SPF than up-regulated genes based on <italic>t </italic>statistics (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S12">12</xref>). Characteristics of binding sites with highest SPF for each gene are given in Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S13">13</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S14">14</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>4. Identification of Tentative Target Genes (TTGs) for POU5F1</title><p>We developed a novel algorithm to identify direct targets of a TF by first separating genes that responded to TF-manipulation into groups according to their expression patterns: direction (up-regulation vs. down-regulation), magnitude (&#x0003e; 2 fold vs. &#x0003c; 2 fold change) and time (in 12 hr intervals) of response. We then applied the FDR criterion to each group individually (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Genes with transient response were handled separately from genes with constitutive response. FDR was estimated in two steps: first <italic>p</italic>-values were estimated for each gene on the basis of the SPF of a binding site in the promoter and cumulative probability distribution of SPF for binding sites in promoters of control genes. The probability distribution of SPF in the control set of genes was approximated by a linear function log<sub><italic>e</italic></sub>(<italic>p</italic>|SPF &#x0003e; <italic>x</italic>) = <italic>a </italic>+ <italic>b&#x000b7;x </italic>(Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S15">15</xref>), and then the regression was used to calculate <italic>p</italic>-values. FDR was then calculated in each group of genes as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Numerical examples showing the advantage of this approach are given in the Methods section.</p><p>Assuming that we can tolerate up to 20% of false positives, we set FDR threshold to 0.2 and identified 420 TTGs of POU5F1 (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). The list of genes included the majority of known POU5F1 targets (<italic>Sox2</italic>, <italic>Nanog</italic>, <italic>Zfp42</italic>, <italic>Klf4</italic>, <italic>Esrrb</italic>, <italic>Utf1</italic>, <italic>Lefty1</italic>, <italic>Otx2</italic>, <italic>Spp1</italic>, <italic>Upp1</italic>, <italic>Fbxo15</italic>, <italic>Dppa5</italic>, <italic>Cdyl</italic>, <italic>Cdx2</italic>), which supports the validity of our analysis. Although one-fifths of these TTGs are in theory false positives due to FDR &#x02264; 0.2, we believe that this is the best result we can obtain with the current technology and uniform data analysis applied to all the genes. Some genes with strong response to <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>were not included in the list of TTGs (e.g., <italic>Fgf4</italic>), because the FDR values were slightly above the accepted threshold. We, therefore, assembled an additional list of 65 genes (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S16">16</xref>) that are likely to be targets of POU5F1 although they did not pass our statistical criteria. These genes had either relatively low FDR values or additional evidence of their regulation by <italic>Pou5f1</italic>.</p><p>A list of target genes identified in this paper matched reasonably with lists of genes identified in earlier studies. Of 420 TTGs identified for <italic>Pou5f1</italic>, 82 genes overlapped with a list of genes identified in Matoba et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], and 125 genes overlapped with a list of genes identified in Loh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S17">17</xref>). TTGs that were identified in earlier studies, but not identified in the current study fell into two categories: (i) TTGs that had weak binding sites; and (ii) TTGs that did not respond significantly to <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>manipulation in our experiment, as judged by the distribution of a simple score estimated as a product of SPF and absolute magnitude of gene expression response to <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>suppression (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S18">18</xref>). The scores for TTGs identified in this paper were substantially higher than those for non-matching genes from the earlier papers, indicating that the current list of TTGs was high quality. Furthermore, there was significant overlap between TTGs identified in the current work and TTGs identified in the previous meta-analysis of gene expression in ES cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]: out of 83 genes with current gene symbols, 33 genes were identified as TTGs of POU5F1 in the current work.</p><p>Interestingly, we found that <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>functions mostly as a positive regulator of target gene expression in ES cells: among 420 TTGs of POU5F1, the majority (<italic>N </italic>= 372; 88.6%) were down-regulated after <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>suppression and only 48 TTGs were up-regulated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). This was a surprise, because <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>is thought to suppress the expression of genes associated with cell differentiation. To address this issue, we analyzed 420 POU5F1-TTGs and 65 additional TTGs (from Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S16">16</xref>) based on Gene Ontology (GO) terms (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S19">19</xref>) and literature (PubMed) and found 4 major categories for positive regulation and 1 category for negative regulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). One notable category among genes activated by <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>was the "suppressors of cell differentiation," which was comprised of many known and hypothetical transcriptional repressors and signaling repressors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). These include polycomb genes such as <italic>Suz12 </italic>and <italic>Phc1</italic>, which are known to repress genes associated with differentiation in ES cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Zinc finger TFs are also known as suppressors of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. For example, <italic>Klf4 </italic>directly suppresses the expressions of <italic>p53 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], <italic>HDC </italic>(<italic>Hdc</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and <italic>Sp1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], although <italic>Klf4 </italic>also activates a number of genes, including <italic>Lefty1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Some of zinc finger TFs activated by <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>(e.g., <italic>Zfp57</italic>, <italic>Zfp74</italic>, <italic>Zfp459</italic>) have KRAB domains, which are involved in gene-silencing and heterochromatin formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Some chromatin remodeling proteins are also known for suppressing gene expressions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. For example, <italic>Dnmt3b </italic>is a de novo DNA methyltransferase which can contribute to transcription silencing, although the gene seems dispensable for pluripotency maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. <italic>Cdyl </italic>is a transcriptional co-repressor which is active via its CoA-pocket domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. TFs with Jumonji domain (<italic>JmjC</italic>) function as histone demethylase and modulate the chromatin status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Inhibitors of helix-loop-helix TF binding (<italic>Id1</italic>, <italic>Id3</italic>, <italic>Id4</italic>) are also included in the list. The "suppression of cell differentiation" category (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) also includes a number of inhibitors of cell signaling, such as phosphatases (<italic>Dusp27</italic>, <italic>Dusp12</italic>, <italic>Inpp5d</italic>), inhibitors of TGFbeta signaling (<italic>Smad7</italic>), WNT inhibitor <italic>Sfrp1</italic>, and IGF inhibitor <italic>Igfbp2</italic>. Proteases are also included in the list: <italic>Htra1 </italic>inactivates TGFbeta signaling possibly via modification of ECM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]; and ubiquitination-related genes (<italic>Ubqln4</italic>, <italic>Ubl3</italic>, <italic>Ubxd4</italic>, <italic>Usp28</italic>) may suppress gene activity via degradation of transcription-activation complexes. The <italic>Pou5f1</italic>, thus, seems to suppress the expression of genes associated with cell differentiation by positively regulating the "suppressors of cell differentiation."</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Major functional groups of tentative target genes (TTGs) of POU5F1.</bold> Genes in blue: genes that passed the criterion for TTGs (FDR &#x0003c; 0.2).

The first group includes mostly known targets of POU5F1. Pluripotency-related genes, <italic>Foxd3 </italic>and <italic>Sall4</italic>, which are known for <italic>Nanog </italic>dependency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], were also TTGs of POU5F1, because in our experiments they responded to <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>suppression long before the change of expression of <italic>Nanog</italic>. Germ line specific gene <italic>Dppa3 </italic>(<italic>Stella, Pgc7</italic>) was another new TTG of POU5F1. The group of "genes associated with cell proliferation" included major regulators of cell cycle (e.g., <italic>Mif</italic>, <italic>Mybl2</italic>, <italic>Myc</italic>, <italic>Mycn</italic>), DNA metabolism/repair genes, growth factors, and others, which are consistent with the earlier report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. <italic>Mybl2 </italic>(<italic>b-Myb, Bmyb</italic>) and <italic>Myc </italic>promote cell transition from G1 phase to S phase, and therefore contribute to the unique cell cycle structure (long S phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]) in ES cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The regulation of ES cell proliferation by <italic>Tcl1 </italic>has also been demonstrated previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Surprisingly, the group of "genes associated with morphogenesis", which included many embryonic growth factors, receptors, TFs, and signal transduction genes, appeared positively regulated by <italic>Pou5f1</italic>. Possibly, <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>is not the only transcription regulator of these genes because many of them remain active in developing embryo even after full silencing of <italic>Pou5f1</italic>.</p><p>In contrast, a small number of TTGs labeled as "differentiation-related genes" (e.g., <italic>Cdx2 </italic>and <italic>Eomes</italic>), was negatively regulated by <italic>Pou5f1</italic>. It has been shown that POU5F1 can block the transcriptional auto-activation of <italic>Cdx2 </italic>by CDX2 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Although these genes have POU5F1 binding sites identified by ChIP, the functionality of these sites as transcription repressors has not been confirmed experimentally. If these binding sites are indeed involved in repression of transcription, then this mechanism may complement other more generic mechanisms of repression of genes associated with differentiation. For example, <italic>Arrb1</italic>, <italic>Cdx2</italic>, <italic>Cidea</italic>, <italic>Eomes</italic>, <italic>Fgf5</italic>, and <italic>Gadd45g </italic>have bivalent chromatin domains (carrying both activating H3K4 tri-methylation and repressing H3K27 tri-methylation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], and thus can be repressed via polycomb genes.</p><p>Thus, the main function of POU5F1 binding to promoters is activation of target genes, whereas suppression of genes related to cell differentiation is mostly indirect and mediated by specialized gene silencing mechanisms, many components of which are activated directly by <italic>Pou5f1</italic>. The <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>may have additional molecular functions besides direct regulation of transcription (e.g., inactivation of CDX2 protein via direct binding with POU5F1 protein in heterochromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]); however these effects are beyond the scope of this paper. POU5F1 can interact directly with transcriptional repression complexes in ES cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], but it is not clear to what extent this interaction involves sequence-specific binding of POU5F1 to DNA.</p></sec><sec><title>5. Identification of target genes for SOX2 and NANOG</title><p>Target genes for SOX2 and NANOG were identified using the same strategy as for POU5F1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Data sources used for this analysis are summarized in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>. Many TTGs of SOX2 and NANOG overlapped with TTGs of POU5F1 (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S20">20</xref>).

Consistent with this notion, new lists of TTGs identified in this paper based on both ChIP data and expression profiling data showed that out of 700 combined TTGs of POU5F1, SOX2, and NANOG, only 209 genes (29.9%) were affected by one of these TFs; other TTGs were affected by 2 or 3 TFs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S21">21</xref>).

To eliminate possible indirect effects, we used our observation that manipulation of each of these 3 genes changed the expression of other genes with a substantial delay (&#x0003e; 34 hr), which makes it possible to separate gene networks affected by each TF. We plotted another Venn diagram where effects of <italic>Pou5f1</italic>, <italic>Sox2</italic>, and <italic>Nanog </italic>were counted only if target genes responded before the response time of other members within this group of 3 major TFs associated with ES cell pluripotency (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Even after removal of these possible indirect effects, correlation between effects of <italic>Pou5f1</italic>, <italic>Sox2</italic>, and <italic>Nanog </italic>remained strong.</p><p>We also examined a possibility that these co-regulations occurred by chance.

Permutation was limited to genes with strong binding sites to avoid the possibility that apparent correlation between effects of <italic>Pou5f1</italic>, <italic>Sox2</italic>, and <italic>Nanog </italic>simply resulted from the use of the same ChIP dataset for selecting TTGs for these TFs. The number of genes activated by both <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>and <italic>Nanog </italic>(<italic>N </italic>= 63) was also significantly higher than expected from permutation (31.96 genes; chi-square = 10.43, <italic>p </italic>= 0.001). In contrast, co-activation of genes by <italic>Sox2 </italic>and <italic>Nanog </italic>appeared non-significant: only 31 genes were activated by both TFs versus expected 17.99 genes (chi-square = 3.51, <italic>p </italic>= 0.06). Effect of <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>and <italic>Sox2 </italic>was similar not only in activation but also in suppression of target genes.

Small number of genes responding to <italic>Nanog </italic>manipulation can be partially explained by the fact that suppression of <italic>Nanog </italic>did not change the expression of <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>in both knockdown and overexpression experiments, and therefore, there were no indirect effects mediated by <italic>Pou5f1</italic>. Only 5 genes responded to <italic>Nanog </italic>suppression more strongly and faster compared to their response to <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>suppression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>, lower left quadrant). Genes that responded more strongly (but not necessary faster) to <italic>Nanog </italic>suppression compared to <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>suppression (<italic>N </italic>= 13) were enriched in genes associated with growth factor activity (<italic>Bmp4</italic>, <italic>Spred2</italic>, <italic>Spry4</italic>, <italic>Igfbp2</italic>).

The method uses two data inputs: genome-wide time-course expression profiling data after the manipulation of TF expression level; and genome-wide ChIP data. We have applied this method to key pluripotency genes &#x02013; <italic>Pou5f1</italic>, <italic>Sox2</italic>, and <italic>Nanog</italic>, and identified their TTGs in ES cells. Because the majority of TTGs were activated and only a few of them were suppressed, we conclude for the first time that the main function of <italic>Pou5f1</italic>, <italic>Sox2</italic>, and <italic>Nanog </italic>when they are bound to promoters is activation of gene expression rather than suppression. Thus, the role of these TFs in suppression of genes associated with differentiation is mostly indirect and is mediated via specialized gene silencing mechanisms. This idea is supported by our observation that transcription of many components of these silencing pathways is directly activated by <italic>Pou5f1</italic>, <italic>Sox2</italic>, and <italic>Nanog</italic>. These 3 genes may have additional molecular functions that are not related to binding to the promoters of target genes, but these functions cannot be inferred from ChIP data and therefore require different methods of analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Microarray experiments</title><p>For microarray experiments we used ZHBTc4 ES cells with a Tet-inducible <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>transgene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].

Tetracycline was added at 24 hr after cell plating, and then cells were harvested at 0 hr (before adding tetracycline), 3 hr, 6 hr, 12 hr, and 24 hr (2 replications each). RNA samples for later time points (24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hr) were obtained from our earlier experiment with 3 replications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Two <italic>Nanog </italic>over-expressing clones were tested: integrated and episomal transgene.

All the microarray data are available at the public GEO website [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. The data and analysis software are also available at the NIA Array Analysis website [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Because some arrays showed slight reduction of Cy5 signal (UMR) due to ozone bleaching we compensated for this effect as follows. First we selected 100 genes with the highest variances of Cy5 signal and with average log10-signal &#x0003e; 2.5, and estimated the average Cy5 signal for these genes in each array which roughly represented the degree of bleaching effect. Then we used a linear regression to fit Cy5 log signal for each gene as a function of the bleaching effect (average log Cy5 signal of 100 genes described above), and the Cy3 signal in the same array. Then the effect of bleaching was subtracted. If after this correction, log Cy5 signal in array differed by &#x0003e; 3&#x000b7;SD from the mean log Cy5 signal it was replaced by the mean. Data on earlier time points (3&#x02013;24 hr) was combined with data on later time points (24&#x02013;120 hr)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] that was adjusted as follows: <italic>x</italic>'<sub><italic>t </italic></sub>= <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>t </italic></sub>- <italic>x</italic><sub>24 </sub>+ <italic>y</italic><sub>24</sub>, where <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>t </italic></sub>and <italic>x</italic>'<sub><italic>t </italic></sub>are log gene expression for time point &#x0003e; 24 hr before and after adjustment, respectively, <italic>x</italic><sub>24 </sub>is log gene expression in the experiment of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], and <italic>y</italic><sub>24 </sub>is log gene expression in the new experiment. For the majority of genes we used the same oligo sequence in both data sets that were combined. However, for some genes that had no common oligo we combined data from different oligos. Data on genes that had no oligo (or no sensitive oligo) in NIA Mouse 22 K Microarray Dev2 (<italic>N </italic>= 109) were taken from NIA Mouse 22 K Microarray Dev1 presented in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Information on <italic>Cdx2 </italic>is based on PCR data (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S23">23</xref>) because our microarray probe for this gene was not responsive. Source of data for each gene is listed in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>.</p><p>Statistical analysis was done using the NIA Array Analysis software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. To reduce the number of false positives we used the maximum of the actual error variances for a gene and the average error variance estimated from 500 genes with similar signal intensity. Difference in expression was considered significant on the basis of false discovery rate FDR &#x02264; 0.05, which accounts for the effect of multiple hypotheses testing. Time of gene response to <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>suppression was estimated as the time when interpolated gene expression reached the level of 1.5 fold difference compared to the 0 hr initial time point, and the magnitude of response was estimated as the maximum log-ratio of gene expression (either positive or negative) compared to 0 hr (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Expression change was considered transient if after reaching its peak (positive or negative), it declined to &#x0003c; 1.5 fold change or became inverted. Gene ontology (GO) analysis was done using the NIA Mouse Gene Index software, which evaluates statistical significance using the hypergeometric probability distribution with parameters: FDR = 0.05, over-representation ratio &#x0003e; 1.5 fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of tentative target genes (TTGs)</title><p>To identify TTGs we optimized parameters of the score of potential function (SPF) (equation 1) to distinguish best between training and control sets of genes. Training sets were genes that were down-regulated or up-regulated by at least 2 fold and responded non-transiently to <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>suppression within the time window from 6 to 48 hr (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S11">11</xref>). Genes that responded too early (&#x0003c; 6 hr) were not included in the training set because there may have been not enough time for the concentration of <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>protein to drop substantially (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>), and therefore the response may have been caused by other factors. Similarly genes that responded late (&#x0003e; 48) were not included in the training set because many of them may be affected indirectly. The set of control genes was defined as a set of genes with high-quality or medium-quality promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]which did not respond to suppression of <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>in ZHBTc4 ES cells (FDR &#x0003e; 0.05) and were not differentially expressed between ES and TS cells (FDR &#x0003e; 0.05) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>gene is expressed in ES cells but not in TS cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>], therefore we expected that the expression of <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>target genes was different in these types of cells. No change in gene expression measured by microarray may have resulted from non-responding oligos. Thus, we further narrowed down the list of control genes to those genes that showed differential expression (FDR &#x02264; 0.05 and &#x0003e; 1.5 fold change) between ovary and testis measured with the same array platform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] to confirm the functionality of oligos. SPF was estimated based on the strength of <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>and <italic>Nanog </italic>binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], distance from TSS, and CpG-richness of the DNA region. TSS coordinates in mouse genome assembly mm6 were taken from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and coordinates of ChIP-PET regions were converted to genome version mm6 using UCSC batch conversion tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Association between binding sites and TSSs was established using the following rules: (1) if distance to TSS of gene A was &#x0003e; 3 fold greater than distance to TSS of gene B, then binding site was associated only with gene B, otherwise it was associated with both A and B; (2) if genes A and B have a common bidirectional promoter with distance between TSSs &#x0003c; 1 K then binding sites were associated with both genes; (3) non-RefSeq genes were ignored unless they responded to <italic>Pou5f1 </italic>manipulation (this rule was needed to avoid association with antisense regulatory transcripts); and (4) distance between binding site and TSS was limited to 200 K. CpG-rich regions were those that contained minimum of 8 CpG pairs within 250 bp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Initially we included the effect of repeats and binding motifs in SPF, but then we removed them because they were not significant. Optimization was done separately for 2 training sets of genes that were down-regulated and up-regulated after suppression of <italic>Pou5f1</italic>. To optimize the parameters of the SPF we used the simplex method implemented in a Perl script based on the published algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. At each step of optimization, scores were re-calculated according to modified parameters, binding sites with the highest score were selected for each gene, and then these scores were compared between training genes and control genes using <italic>t</italic>-statistics. To avoid a circular reference by estimating SPF for genes in the training and control set with parameters optimized for the same genes, we used the bootstrap resampling method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Both training and control sets of genes were randomly split into 10 portions, and optimization was repeated 10 times with one portion of training and control genes excluded. Then, parameters (<italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic>, <italic>c</italic>, and <italic>d</italic>) in equation (1) were averaged; however when estimating SPFs for genes that belong to the <italic>i</italic>-th portion of training or control genes we averaged only those values that were optimized without the <italic>i</italic>-th portion of genes. The probability distribution of binding scores among control genes was used for estimating the <italic>p</italic>-value, and then the FDR was estimated using the method of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] in each group of genes that differ by time, direction, and magnitude of response to manipulation of the TF. TTGs were selected using FDR = 0.2 as a threshold. Because each group has a large number of genes (median = 160), FDR in each group can be interpreted as the proportion of false positives among genes that are assumed significant in this group. Thus, the total proportion of false positives among pooled significant genes from all groups should also be close to the FDR threshold. This method is based on the assumption that SPF represents correctly the role of binding sites in transcription regulation. This assumption is not always true because SPF estimation is based on the limited information that is available; thus binding sites with the highest SPF for each gene are not necessary the ones that act as main regulatory switches. The quality of analysis can be improved as additional information becomes available (e.g., luciferase assay and location of insulators).</p></sec><sec><title>Numerical examples</title><p>The purpose of these examples is to show the advantage of the proposed method for detecting direct target genes compared to the traditional approach when all genes that responded to manipulation of a TF and have a binding site in their promoter are considered direct targets. Our method for identification of direct targets of a TF is based on splitting the genes that responded to TF manipulation into groups according to the direction, magnitude and time of their response, and then applying the FDR criterion within each group (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In the first example we assume that all true binding sites are known, and therefore there is no need for using SPF. There are 5000 genes that responded to manipulation of TF which are split into 10 groups according to the direction, magnitude and time of response. For simplicity we assume that all groups have equal number of genes, and only 2 of these groups contained true direct target genes. The proportion of target genes in these 2 groups was 40% and in other groups it was 0%. Binding sites are present in promoters of all true target genes and in 20% of other genes (non-functional binding). If we consider all responding genes with binding sites as TTGs, then we would find 1320 of these genes which include 69.7% of false positives. Using our approach, we select genes with binding sites only in 2 groups of responding genes that had a significantly higher proportion of genes with binding sites (52% versus 20% in control). As a result, 520 TTGs are detected and they contain only 23% of false positives. Here our method yielded a 3-fold reduction in the proportion of false positives. The second example, which is more realistic, assumes that there is no clear-cut distinction between true and false binding sites. Instead, binding sites are characterized quantitatively by SPF. We modify the previous example by assuming that true target genes have a normal distribution of SPF with M = 7 and SD = 2, whereas other genes have a normal distribution of SPF with M = 3 and SD = 2. Assuming that we can tolerate 25% of false positives, we set FDR threshold to 0.25. Using the method of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and p-values from the probability distribution of SPF in control genes, we estimated that this FDR = 0.25 corresponds to the threshold of SPF = 5.75 in groups that contain true target genes, and is unattainable in groups without true target genes. As a result, 347 TTGs are identified, and 52 of them are false positives (15%). Proposed method reduced the proportion of false positives by &#x0003e; 3 fold and increased the number of identified true target genes by 47%. The actual proportion of false positives appeared slightly lower than the target FDR rate because we assumed that the distribution of SPF among true targets is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Real-time quantitative RT-PCR</title><p>Primers for quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) were designed and tested for SYBR Green chemistry using an established in-house protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>].
