In a normal adult pancreas, a slow rate of &#x003b2;-cell renewal is responsible for maintenance of an adequate functional &#x003b2;-cell mass. This rate is accelerated in conditions of increased demands for insulin, such as pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>) and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>). Work in an animal model demonstrated that new &#x003b2;-cells are generated in adult mice predominantly by replication of preexisting &#x003b2;-cells rather than by neogenesis from insulin-negative stem/progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>). This finding has raised hopes for recapitulation of &#x003b2;-cell expansion in cultures of adult human islets. However, previous attempts at in vitro expansion of adult human &#x003b2;-cells resulted in a limited number of cell population doublings and loss of insulin expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>). Insulin-negative cells with a considerable proliferative capacity were derived from cultured human islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>). Insulin expression in these cells could be induced by changing the culture conditions; however, its levels were low and varied among donors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>). One possible interpretation of these results is that &#x003b2;-cells survive, dedifferentiate, and divide in culture. Recently, we applied a genetic cell lineage tracing approach for labeling cultured adult human islets and demonstrated that, in contrast to mouse &#x003b2;-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>), dedifferentiated, label-positive cells derived from human &#x003b2;-cells could be induced to significantly proliferate in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>). These cells may be of value for development of cell therapy for type 1 diabetes, since they may retain some &#x003b2;-cell&#x02013;specific chromatin structure to allow their redifferentiation. Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in &#x003b2;-cell dedifferentiation and replication in vitro may facilitate the expansion and redifferentiation of these cells.</p><p>In the developing pancreas, important cell-fate decisions, including the switch from proliferation to differentiation, and the choice between exocrine and endocrine fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>), as well as among different endocrine fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>), are regulated by the NOTCH signaling pathway. Expression of NOTCH ligands on a differentiating cell inhibits development of the same phenotype in neighboring cells, in a mechanism termed lateral inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>). Ligand binding to NOTCH receptors on a neighboring cell results in cleavage of the NOTCH intracellular domain (NICD), which enters the nucleus and forms a complex that modulates gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>). The hairy and enhancer of split (HES) family of transcriptional regulators is a major target of the NICD complex. In fetal pancreata, HES-1 acts as an inhibitor of neurogenin 3 (<italic>NGN3</italic>) gene expression, which is required for islet development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>). In addition, HES-1 regulates the cell cycle by inhibiting expression of genes encoding the cyclin kinase inhibitors p27 and p57 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>). Some evidence suggests that it may also inhibit insulin gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>). Overall, HES-1 is associated with promoting cell replication and preventing cell differentiation. Forced expression of NOTCH inhibits pancreas cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>), while mice with null mutations in genes encoding NOTCH pathway components exhibit accelerated differentiation of endocrine pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>). The NOTCH pathway is not normally expressed in the adult pancreas; however, it is activated in conditions associated with cell dedifferentiation and replication, such as regeneration following experimental pancreatitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>), pancreatic neoplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>), metaplasia of cultured pancreatic exocrine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>), and in rat &#x003b2;-cells exposed to cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesized that &#x003b2;-cell dedifferentiation and entrance into the cell cycle in vitro involve induction of the NOTCH pathway. Our findings demonstrate a considerable activation of the NOTCH pathway in these cells, which correlates with downregulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p57 and loss of insulin expression. Inhibition of HES-1 expression using small hairpin RNA (shRNA) results in reduced replication of cultured &#x003b2;-cells and a decrease in cell dedifferentiation. These findings suggest possible molecular targets for prevention of &#x003b2;-cell dedifferentiation in culture or induction of cell redifferentiation following in vitro expansion.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Islet cell culture.</title><p>Islets were received 2&#x02013;3 days following isolation.

Islet cells cultured for 1&#x02013;2 days were washed with PBS and infected at multiplicity of infection 2.5:1 in CMRL-1066 medium containing 8 &#x003bc;g/ml polybrene overnight. The medium was then replaced with regular culture medium. Four days after infection, the cells were selected for puromycin resistance (1 &#x003bc;g/ml) for 3 days. Two weeks after infection, the cells were harvested for further analysis. For &#x003b3;-secretase inhibition, 5 &#x003bc;mol/l of <sc>l</sc>-685,458 (Calbiochem) were added to cells at passage 2 (P2) for 17 h.

The specificity of the rabbit anti&#x02013;HES-1 antibody from Chemicon was determined using LAN-5 human neuroblastoma cells as a negative control and human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells as a positive control. The lack of HES-1 expression in LAN-5 cells and its presence in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells were demonstrated using immunoblotting with a different HES-1 antibody (see below).

Islets from each donor were dissociated and expanded in culture as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>). Quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) analyses of RNA extracted from these cells during the first 2 weeks of culture revealed a rapid dedifferentiation, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>), which was manifested in a drastic decrease in insulin mRNA levels, averaging 166-fold (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 8.7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup> at P2) (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>) (see data on cells from individual donors in online appendix Fig. 1 &#x0005b;available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/db07-1323">http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/db07-1323</ext-link>&#x0005d;). Concomitant with this decrease, an increase in <italic>HES1</italic> mRNA was observed in cells from all donors, averaging 4.6-fold (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.006 at P2) within the first 2 weeks of culture (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). A similar increase was noted in HES-1 protein levels (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>). At both RNA and protein levels, the wave of HES-1 upregulation peaked within the first 2 weeks of culture and was downregulated thereafter. To demonstrate that HES-1 upregulation in this system was dependent on NOTCH activation, we used an inhibitor of &#x003b3;-secretase, the protease complex required for generation of NICD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>). As seen in <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>, cell incubation with the inhibitor resulted in 10-fold lower HES-1 levels, supporting a NOTCH-dependent mechanism. Immunostaining could not detect significant HES-1 expression in nuclei of cells with intense insulin staining (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref>). In contrast, HES-1 was clearly detected in insulin-negative cells. To monitor HES-1 expression in dedifferentiated cells derived from &#x003b2;-cells, &#x003b2;-cells in freshly isolated islets were heritably labeled using a cell lineage tracing approach recently developed in our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>). The labeling approach is based on cell infection with a mixture of two lentivirus vectors: one expressing Cre recombinase under the insulin promoter (RIP-Cre) and the other a reporter cassette in which the CMV promoter is separated from an eGFP gene by a loxP-flanked stop region. Removal of the stop region in &#x003b2;-cells infected by both viruses activates eGFP expression specifically in these cells, thereby allowing continuous tracking of &#x003b2;-cell fate after insulin expression is lost. Residual insulin expression in &#x003b2;-cells during the initial days in culture provides a sufficient window of time for RIP-Cre expression and eGFP activation. Using this method, 57.5 &#x000b1; 8.9&#x00025; of insulin-positive cells were labeled with eGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>). Analysis of the cells expanded in culture following labeling revealed HES-1 staining in cells that lost insulin expression but maintained eGFP expression, demonstrating that they were derived from &#x003b2;-cells (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref>). A total of 89.3 &#x000b1; 0.1&#x00025; of eGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> insulin-negative cells were HES-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (based on counting &#x0003e;200 cells in cultures from each of three donors).</p></sec><sec><title>Changes in expression of components of the NOTCH pathway in cultured human &#x003b2;-cells.</title><p>qPCR analyses revealed changes in levels of transcripts encoding the four members of the NOTCH family. <italic>NOTCH1</italic> transcripts were upregulated on average by 3.6-fold within the first 2 weeks of culture (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.02 at P2) (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). A similar increase was detected in the <italic>NOTCH1</italic> 120-kd transmembrane fragment (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>), paralleling the changes in HES-1 levels (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>). <italic>NOTCH2</italic> and <italic>NOTCH3</italic> were significantly upregulated on average by 9.7-fold (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 8.8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> at P2) and 10.1-fold (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 1.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> at P2), respectively, within the first 2 weeks of culture. Overall, the activation of <italic>NOTCH1&#x02013;3</italic> paralleled that of HES-1. In contrast, <italic>NOTCH4</italic> was drastically downregulated, on average 50-fold (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 3.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> at P2) from its level in primary islets. As with <italic>HES1</italic> upregulation, <italic>NOTCH1&#x02013;3</italic> upregulation peaked within the first 2 weeks of culture and was downregulated thereafter. Transcripts encoding presenilin-1, a component of the &#x003b3;-secretase complex, and recombination signal-binding protein 1 for J-&#x003ba; (RBPJK), a protein that participates in the NICD nuclear complex, were not significantly changed in the cultured cells (data not shown). In contrast, transcripts for NOTCH ligands were downregulated during the initial weeks of culture (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). <italic>DELTA1</italic> transcripts were downregulated on average 3.3-fold (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 1.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> at P2) within the first 2 weeks of culture. <italic>JAG1</italic> transcripts were not significantly changed (data not shown). <italic>JAG2</italic> transcripts were downregulated on average 5.5-fold (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 1.9 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> at P2) within the first 2 weeks of culture. The increased activity of the NOTCH pathway was manifested by appearance of NICD in cell nuclei, as revealed by immunostaining (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>). Similar to the pattern of HES-1 immunostaining, staining for NICD could not be detected in cells intensely stained for insulin. NICD staining was detected in all (100&#x00025;) lineage-labeled, insulin-negative cells identified as originating from &#x003b2;-cells by eGFP expression (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>) (based on counting &#x0003e;200 cells in cultures from each of three donors).</p></sec><sec><title>Changes in expression of cell cycle inhibitors.</title><p>To evaluate the consequences of increased HES-1 expression in the cultured islet cells, we analyzed changes in transcripts of genes encoding cyclin kinase inhibitors, which are among the main targets of repression by HES-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>). Transcripts encoding p57, which is thought to be the main cell cycle inhibitor in human &#x003b2;-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>), were downregulated, on average, 2.9-fold (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.004 at P2) within the first 2 weeks of culture (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>). A further reduction was observed at P3, averaging 7.1-fold, compared with P0 (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.002). This finding was supported by immunostaining for p57, which showed its presence in all (100&#x00025;) lineage-labeled insulin-positive eGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells and its absence in all (100&#x00025;) insulin-negative eGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells (based on counting &#x0003e;200 cells in cultures from each of three donors) (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>). In contrast to p57, transcripts for p21 were upregulated in cells from all donors, and those for p27 varied considerably among donors (data not shown). The downregulation of p57 transcripts and protein correlated with cell entrance into the cell cycle, as manifested by Ki67 staining in p57-negative eGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>C</italic></xref>). The nuclear area of replicating cells was 2.5- to 4-fold larger than that of insulin-positive cells, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>). The increase in cell size is likely associated with recruitment of quiescent &#x003b2;-cells into the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Inhibition of HES-1 expression prevents induction of &#x003b2;-cell replication.</title><p>To further correlate the induction of &#x003b2;-cell replication with HES-1 upregulation, HES-1 induction during the initial weeks of culture was inhibited using shRNA. Following screening of four <italic>HES1</italic> shRNA sequences for activity in 293T cells, one of four (TRCN18993) was selected as most efficient, based on reduction in HES-1 protein levels, as analyzed by immunoblotting (data not shown). Isolated human islets were dissociated, and the cells were infected with a lentivirus encoding <italic>HES1</italic> shRNA before culture under standard conditions. Selection for drug resistance allowed elimination of uninfected cells. Cells infected with a nontarget shRNA lentivirus and selected under similar conditions served as control. As seen in <xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>, cell infection with the <italic>HES1</italic> shRNA virus resulted in up to six-times-lower HES-1 protein levels, compared with cells infected with the control virus. The lower HES-1 levels were associated with a diminished cell proliferation compared with cells infected with the control vector, as judged by staining for BrdU incorporation (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>). In addition, staining for Ki67 in eGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells demonstrated a lower replication rate among cells derived from &#x003b2;-cells (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>). The reduced replication in cells infected with the <italic>HES1</italic> shRNA virus did not correlate with an increase in cell apoptosis, as judged by immunoblotting analysis for cleaved PARP (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>). In addition, terminal uridine deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling assay did not detect significant changes between cells at P2 treated with either virus and cells at P0 among insulin-expressing cells or the total cell population (averaging 1.41, 2.19, and 1.64&#x00025; apoptotic cells among insulin-positive cells at P0, P2 cells treated with <italic>HES1</italic> shRNA, and P2 cells treated with nontarget virus, respectively, based on counting 500 cells in cultures from each of three donors). The reduced proliferation of cells infected with the <italic>HES1</italic> shRNA virus correlated with a 5.7-fold (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.001) higher level of p57 transcripts, compared with those in cells infected with the control virus (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>D</italic></xref>) (see data on cells from individual donors in online appendix Fig. 2). The levels of p57 transcripts obtained with <italic>HES1</italic> shRNA were 3.3-fold higher (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.04) compared with P0. The reduced HES-1 levels did not significantly affect the levels of <italic>NOTCH</italic> transcripts, which is consistent with the position of HES-1 downstream of NOTCH in the pathway (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>D</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Inhibition of HES-1 expression reduces &#x003b2;-cell dedifferentiation.</title><p>The lower HES-1 levels in cells expressing <italic>HES1</italic> shRNA resulted in a reduced rate of cell dedifferentiation, as manifested by higher levels of transcripts encoding differentiated &#x003b2;-cell markers. Thus, levels of insulin transcripts were 6.6-fold higher (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 5.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>) compared with cells infected with the control virus (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). Similarly, transcript levels for the &#x003b2;-cell transcription factors <italic>PDX1</italic> and <italic>NEUROD1</italic> were 4.4-fold (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.005) and 3.3-fold (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.004) higher, respectively, in cells expressing <italic>HES1</italic> shRNA (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). The levels of <italic>PDX1</italic> and <italic>NEUROD1</italic> transcripts in cells expressing <italic>HES1</italic> shRNA were 0.52 and 0.54 of those in primary islets, respectively. In contrast, the levels of insulin transcripts in cells expressing <italic>HES1</italic> shRNA were ninefold lower compared with those in primary islets. In agreement with the higher insulin mRNA levels, insulin immunostaining detected a fourfold (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.016) higher number of insulin-positive cells in cultures expressing <italic>HES1</italic> shRNA compared with those treated with the control virus (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>). The fraction of insulin-positive cells among eGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells was also threefold higher in the presence of <italic>HES1</italic> shRNA, indicating that fewer &#x003b2;-cells underwent dedifferentiation (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic></xref>). Insulin content in cells expressing <italic>HES1</italic> shRNA was 3.5-fold higher (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.03) compared with cells treated with the control virus (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>A</italic></xref>), although these levels were 14-fold lower compared with intact islets before trypsinization. Cells at P2 maintained the same two- to threefold increase in insulin secretion in response to glucose observed in intact islets (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref>). However, insulin secretion from cells expressing <italic>HES1</italic> shRNA was 6.8-fold higher (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.006) compared with cells treated with the control virus, in response to 16 mmol/l glucose (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref>). Nevertheless, cells expressing <italic>HES1</italic> shRNA secreted a much higher fraction of their insulin content (15.5&#x00025;), compared with intact islets (3.9&#x00025;), during a 30-min assay. (Cells infected with the nontarget virus secreted 19.7&#x00025; of their content.)</p><p>To verify that these results were due to specific inhibition of HES-1 expression, the studies were reproduced with two additional <italic>HES1</italic> shRNAs, TRCN18990 and TRCN18991. As seen in <xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>A</italic></xref>, cell infection with viruses encoding these shRNAs resulted in reduction in cellular HES-1 protein levels. The reduction in HES-1 correlated with 5.3-fold (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 3.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>) and 2.2-fold (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 6.6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>) higher levels of p57 transcripts in cells expressing the two <italic>HES1</italic> shRNAs, respectively, compared with the levels in cells infected with the nontarget virus. The levels of insulin transcripts were 3.4-fold (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 1.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>) and 1.9-fold (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 2.8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>) higher, respectively. The levels of <italic>PDX1</italic> transcripts were 4.0-fold (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 9.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>) and 2.5-fold (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 1.9 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>) higher, respectively, and the levels of <italic>NEUROD1</italic> transcripts were 7.7-fold (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 3.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>) and 3.1-fold (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>) higher, respectively. These results are comparable with those obtained using <italic>HES1</italic> shRNA TRCN18993, indicating that the effects on cell proliferation and differentiation were caused by specific inhibition of HES-1 expression.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Our findings demonstrate that culture of dissociated adult human islet cells in serum-containing medium, which induces &#x003b2;-cell dedifferentiation and replication, involves activation of elements of the NOTCH pathway. Transcript levels for <italic>NOTCH1&#x02013;3</italic> and <italic>HES1</italic> are upregulated. In contrast, transcripts for <italic>NOTCH4</italic>, and the NOTCH ligands <italic>DELTA1</italic> and <italic>JAG2</italic>, are downregulated. These changes were initially observed in a mixed population of islet cells, which likely included contaminating duct and exocrine cells. Using virus-mediated cell lineage tracing, we then determined that these changes occurred in &#x003b2;-cells. The upregulation of the NOTCH pathway correlated with cell dedifferentiation, as manifested by a dramatic decrease in insulin transcripts, and by cell entrance into the cell cycle, as manifested by downregulation of p57 transcripts and an increase in Ki67 staining. The findings at the RNA level were supported by immunostaining, which demonstrated a negative correlation between the presence of HES-1 or NICD in the nucleus and insulin expression in eGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells, which marked their origin from &#x003b2;-cells. These in situ analyses also detected a positive correlation between p57 and insulin expression, confirming the view that &#x003b2;-cell replication involves dedifferentiation.</p><p>The key role of HES-1 in these events was revealed by inhibiting its upregulation with shRNA. In these cells, the decrease in p57 was prevented and cell proliferation was greatly reduced. While cell dedifferentiation was not completely prevented, it was significantly inhibited compared with cells in which HES-1 upregulation was not repressed. This was manifested by higher levels of insulin transcripts and fraction of cells immunostaining for insulin, as well as transcripts encoding &#x003b2;-cell transcription factors. In addition, loss of insulin content and secretion was less pronounced. These findings suggest that a partial cell dedifferentiation is independent of HES-1 activity and cell replication; however, induction of advanced dedifferentiation and cell replication requires HES-1 upregulation. This interpretation is supported by the finding that the bulk of decrease in insulin mRNA occurs during the first week, thus preceding the peak in HES-1 mRNA levels. It is therefore possible that loss of most of the insulin content is a precondition for &#x003b2;-cell entrance into cell cycle in vitro.</p><p>Given the fact that upregulation of the NOTCH pathway in islet cell cultures followed cell dissociation into single cells, it is unlikely that it was trigerred by a cell-associated ligand, as in the lateral inhibition model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>). Rather, it is possible that this pathway is activated in response to soluble serum components, as was demonstrated in a number of cultured cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>). This possibility is supported by our findings of decreased expression of NOTCH ligands in islet cell cultures concomitant with HES-1 upregulation. This is reminiscent of the low levels of NOTCH ligands in the embryonic pancreas cells expressing HES-1, which are directed for further proliferation rather than differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>).</p><p>Among the four members of the <italic>NOTCH</italic> family that were analyzed, <italic>NOTCH1</italic>, <italic>NOTCH2</italic>, and <italic>NOTCH3</italic> transcripts were upregulated, while <italic>NOTCH4</italic> transcripts were greatly downregulated. While expression of <italic>NOTCH1</italic> and <italic>NOTCH2</italic> was implicated in islet development, <italic>NOTCH3</italic> and <italic>NOTCH4</italic> expression was documented in mesenchymal and endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>). Downregulation of <italic>NOTCH4</italic> may reflect the elimination of a NOTCH4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> subpopulation, which is present in the original islet cell suspension but for some reason is not maintained in continuous culture.</p><p>The wave of HES-1 upregulation peaked within the first 2 weeks of culture and was downregulated thereafter. Nevertheless, the effects of HES-1 were not reversed, as manifested by continuous replication of cells derived from dedifferentiated &#x003b2;-cells for up to 16 population doublings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>). The levels of p57 and insulin transcripts did not rebound thereafter, suggesting that their reinduction requires other signals in addition to the decrease in the inhibitory effect of HES-1. This finding suggests a transient role of HES-1 upregulation that is limited to the initial adaptation of islet cells to culture, after which cell replication may continue in the presence of the lower HES-1 levels found in nonreplicating cells.</p><p>In summary, our findings provide evidence for activation of the NOTCH pathway in adult cells and offer an in vitro model system for studying interactions within this pathway. In addition, the findings emphasize the role of components of the NOTCH pathway in the transition of quiescent &#x003b2;-cells into a dedifferentiated, proliferative state in vitro. Our findings demonstrate a negative correlation between replication and maintenance of differentiated function in cultured &#x003b2;-cells, suggesting that significant cell expansion inevitably involves dedifferentiation and will require the development of methods for cell redifferentiation following expansion. Components of the NOTCH pathway may represent molecular targets for induction of redifferentiation of the expanded cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Online-Only Appendix</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="db07-1323_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="db07-1323_db07-1323[1].suppl.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Human islets were provided by the Cell Isolation and Transplantation Center at the University of Geneva School of Medicine and San Raffaele Hospital, Milan, Italy, through the European Consortium for Islet Transplantation &#x0201c;Islets for Research&#x0201d; distribution program, sponsored by the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation award 6-2005-1178, and by the Diabetes Cell Therapy unit, Faculty of Medicine, Lille 2 University.
