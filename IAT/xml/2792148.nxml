PSACH is characterized by generalized epi-metaphyseal dysplasia, short-limbed dwarfism, joint laxity and early onset osteoarthritis. MED is a milder disease with radiographic features often restricted to the epiphyses of the long bones. PSACH and some forms of MED result from mutations in cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), a pentameric glycoprotein found in cartilage, tendon, ligament and muscle. PSACH-MED patients often have a mild myopathy characterized by mildly increased plasma creatine kinase levels, a variation in myofibre size and/or small atrophic fibres. In some instances, patients are referred to neuromuscular clinics prior to the diagnosis of an underlying skeletal dysplasia; however, the myopathy associated with PSACH-MED has not previously been studied. In this study, we present a detailed study of skeletal muscle, tendon and ligament from a mouse model of mild PSACH harbouring a COMP mutation. Mutant mice exhibited a progressive muscle weakness associated with an increased number of muscle fibres with central nuclei at the perimysium and at the myotendinous junction. Furthermore, the distribution of collagen fibril diameters in the mutant tendons and ligaments was altered towards thicker collagen fibrils, and the tendons became more lax in cyclic strain tests. We hypothesize that the myopathy in PSACH-MED originates from an underlying tendon and ligament pathology that is a direct result of structural abnormalities to the collagen fibril architecture. This is the first comprehensive characterization of the musculoskeletal phenotype of PSACH-MED and is directly relevant to the clinical management of these patients.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Pseudoachondroplasia (PSACH: MIM 177170) is an autosomal dominant skeletal dysplasia characterized by short-limbed dwarfism, epi-metaphyseal dysplasia, joint laxity and early onset osteoarthritis (OA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C2">2</xref>). Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED: MIM 132400) is predominantly an autosomal dominant skeletal dysplasia belonging to the same bone dysplasia family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C3">3</xref>), but it is generally milder, and the radiographic features are primarily restricted to the epiphyses. MED patients can also suffer from joint laxity and early onset OA.</p><p>PSACH and some forms of MED (EDM1) result from mutations in the gene encoding cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP: MIM 600310) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C5">5</xref>), which is a 550 kDa pentameric extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoprotein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C6">6</xref>) found in cartilage, tendon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C7">7</xref>), ligament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C8">8</xref>) and skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C9">9</xref>). COMP is thought to act as a bridging molecule within the ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C10">10</xref>). Indeed, COMP interacts with numerous ECM proteins including types I, II, IX, XI and XII collagen, decorin, fibronectin and matrilin-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C15">15</xref>), and a role for COMP as a catalyst in collagen fibrillogenesis has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C16">16</xref>).</p><p>Each COMP monomer consists of a coiled-coil oligomerization domain, four EGF-like domains, eight TSP type 3 (T3) repeats and a large C-terminal globular domain (CTD). PSACH-MED mutations in COMP cluster in two distinct regions: the type 3 repeats (&#x0223c;85% of the mutations identified to date) and the CTD (&#x0223c;15% of the mutations identified to date) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C17">17</xref>). Extensive research over the last 10 years has demonstrated that mutant COMP protein harbouring structural changes in the type 3 repeats is retained within patient chondrocytes, eventually resulting in rER stress and increased cell death both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in</italic> vivo (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C18">18</xref>). In contrast, some of the COMP-CTD mutations allow the secretion of mutant protein but low levels of ER/cell-stress are still observed, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C20">20</xref>).</p><p>PSACH-MED patients have a well-characterized ligamentous laxity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C2">2</xref>), and the ligaments from patients with COMP-T3 mutations can exhibit a disorganized collagen fibril network, with both variable fibril diameters and lateral fusion of neighbouring fibrils (unpublished data) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C15">15</xref>). Conflicting data exist concerning the retention of mutant COMP in tendon and ligament cells. For example, no apparent intracellular retention of mutant COMP was noted in ligament cells cultured <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C21">21</xref>), although the retention of mutant protein was observed <italic>in vivo</italic> in ligament cells from a PSACH patient with a COMP-T3 mutation (p.Gly465Ser; unpublished data). In common with ligament cells, tenocytes from patients with <italic>COMP</italic> mutations retain mutant COMP in the rER <italic>in vivo</italic> and in cells cultured in monolayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C23">23</xref>), whereas in another study, no protein retention was evident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C24">24</xref>).</p><p>An overlooked clinical complication in some patients with PSACH-MED, specifically those with mutations in the CTD of COMP, is mild myopathy. This can be characterized clinically by a difficulty in standing up and a tendency to tire easily, and biochemically by mildly increased plasma creatine kinase (PCK) levels, differences in fibre diameters and/or atrophic fibres observed in muscle samples obtained through biopsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C26">26</xref>). Furthermore, MED patients with mutations in the &#x003b1;3(IX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C27">27</xref>) or &#x003b1;2(IX) (M.D.B., submitted for publication) chains of type IX collagen have also been reported as having mild myopathy. However, the muscular, tendon and ligament complications of the PSACH-MED phenotype have not yet been studied in detail, primarily because of the difficulty in obtaining suitable pathological samples.</p><p>Here we report a detailed study of the phenotypic and morphological effect of a C-terminal COMP mutation on skeletal muscle, Achilles tendon and spinal ligament in a mouse model of mild PSACH-MED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C20">20</xref>). We show that the mutant mice exhibit a progressive mild myopathy, localized specifically to the perimysium and myotendinous junction (MTJ) and characterized by a dramatic increase in the number of fibres with central nuclei (i.e. indicative of remodelling). We also present evidence that this CTD mutation in COMP affects the morphology and biomechanical characteristics of murine Achilles tendon and spinal ligament, which is consistent with a proposed role for COMP in collagen fibrillogenesis. Our results led us to the hypothesis that the PSACH-MED associated myopathy is a secondary consequence of an underlying tendinopathy and that joint laxity seen in patients is a direct consequence of structural abnormalities to the tissue's ECM.</p><p>This is the first comprehensive characterization of the musculoskeletal phenotype of the PSACH-MED dysplasia family, and it may directly influence the clinical management of PSACH-MED patients in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Comp T585M mutant mice exhibit a mild and progressive muscle weakness</title><p>To assess muscle weakness in the <italic>Comp</italic> T585M mutant mouse model, we performed forelimb grip-strength tests on male mice at 3 and 9 weeks of age (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP466F1">1</xref>A).

To examine skeletal muscle morphology by histology, whole legs were dissected from 3 and 6 week-old mice and sectioned in a transverse plane until the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles were clearly visible. Tissue sections were stained with Gomori's trichrome stain, which stained the collagenous tissue blue, skeletal muscle red and the nuclei black. The number of fibres with central nuclei (i.e. indicative of fibre stress and remodelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C29">29</xref>)) was determined throughout the muscle tissue and expressed as a percentage of the total number of fibres (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP466F2">2</xref>).

This initial observation was indicative of a mild myopathy and we wished to establish the precise localization of the abnormal fibres seen in the mutant muscle. Following stratification, a larger proportion of fibres with central nuclei were present specifically at the MTJ and around the perimysium in the mutant tissue compared with the wild-type controls [Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP466F2">2</xref> (MTJ 3 weeks); &#x0223c;43%; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.005 by independent samples <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>n</italic> = 3].

In this study, we showed that mutations in <italic>Comp</italic> that cause PSACH-MED result in altered collagen fibril diameters in force-loaded tendons and ligaments and is associated with a mild muscle myopathy in the absence of a detectable muscle pathology.</p><p>One of the clinical complications recently recognized as a part of the PSACH-MED phenotype is a mild myopathy, which in some cases may manifest earlier than the skeletal phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C27">27</xref>). In these instances, the patients are reported as having difficulties with standing up or tire easily during exercise and are often referred to the clinic with an unclassified &#x02018;neuromuscular disorder&#x02019; prior to the diagnosis of a underlying skeletal dysplasia. On the basis of these and other reported cases, it has been suggested that if a child presents with a &#x02018;difficult to explain&#x02019; myopathy (i.e. waddling gait, increasing muscle weakness, but with none or only mild changes in a muscle biopsy), the child should be referred for a skeletal survey with a view to identifying an underlying skeletal dysplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C46">46</xref>). Interestingly, in many PSACH-MED patients with a reported myopathy, a causative mutation was identified in the CTD of COMP. In these patients, the myopathy was not comprehensively documented, but included features such as mildly elevated PCK levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C25">25</xref>), basophilic and/or atrophic muscle fibres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C17">17</xref>). Furthermore, a mild myopathy has also been reported in several MED families with type IX collagen mutations, a protein which is not expressed in skeletal muscle, but is present in tendons at the insertion of the tendon into the bone (i.e. the enthesis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C47">47</xref>). In these families, the proband was also referred to a neuromuscular clinic for the evaluation of proximal muscle weakness prior to the diagnosis of MED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C27">27</xref>) (M.D.B., submitted for publication).</p><p>The musculoskeletal complications of the PSACH-MED phenotype have not been studied in detail, primarily due to the difficulty in obtaining suitable pathological samples and aged/site-matched controls. A detailed analysis of the myopathy associated with <italic>COMP</italic> mutations would therefore enable earlier diagnosis of mild PSACH-MED, improve our understanding of the disease mechanisms and ultimately improve patient care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C48">48</xref>). In this study, we have clinically demonstrated muscle weakness in mutant mice and analysed the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles and Achilles tendon to gain insights into the key pathological features and disease mechanisms of this mild myopathy.</p><p><italic>Comp</italic> T585M mutant mice, which we have previously characterized as a relevant model of mild PSACH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C20">20</xref>), also suffer from a progressive myopathy as demonstrated by grip strength testing. Furthermore, when we analysed skeletal muscle from the mutant mice, we found a progressive increase in the number of myofibres with central nuclei, specifically around the perimysium and the MTJ. This observation is indicative of skeletal muscle stress and the subsequent remodelling of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles in these specific areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C29">29</xref>). To test that the myopathy in mutant mice was not a generalized muscle pathology, we analysed the skeletal muscle tissue of wild-type and mutant mice in detail. We used immunohistochemistry to determine the localization of several important ECM proteins in murine skeletal muscle and did not detect any differences in the distribution of wild-type and mutant COMP, or in the distribution of types I, IV and VI collagen, desmin or vimentin. We have also confirmed that COMP was present in the ECM of skeletal muscle, specifically in the endo- and perimysium, and that there were no differences in its localization between wild-type and mutant tissues. Interestingly, these observations are in direct contrast to changes in the localization of mutant COMP seen in the cartilage growth plates of <italic>Comp</italic> T585M mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C20">20</xref>) and suggests that the ECM of muscle and cartilage may assemble and respond differently to the presence of mutant COMP. We have previously shown that mild ER stress was detected in chondrocytes from mutant mice expressing <italic>Comp</italic> T585M. However, the analysis of an ER stress marker (BiP) and an apoptosis marker (Bcl-2) showed no differences between the wild-type and mutant cells. Overall, these data suggest that although secreted by myocytes and present in the ECM, mutant COMP did not have an effect on general skeletal muscle architecture and did not elicit an ER stress response in the mutant cells.</p><p>It has been shown that the transmission of forces between the skeletal muscle and tendon depends on the interaction of the muscle fibres with the surrounding ECM and also on the collagen fibrillar organization of the tendon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C37">37</xref>). Perimysium has been shown to form a connective tissue with a &#x02018;lattice-like&#x02019; structure and is important for conveying forces between the tendon and skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C49">49</xref>). These observations led us to hypothesize that myopathy in the mutant mice may, in fact, be the result of an underlying tendinopathy. Therefore, to gain insight into the mechanisms underlying the restricted localization of the myopathic changes, we studied the ultrastructure of the Achilles tendon from wild-type and mutant mice at 3 and 9 weeks of age. Tendons are an important skeletal tissue since they act as buffers for muscle stretch during locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C50">50</xref>). We have shown that <italic>Comp</italic> is expressed in murine tendon and ligament by a variety of techniques, and that the localization of mutant COMP was not altered in mutant tissues. To determine the effect of mutant COMP on collagen organization, we measured the diameters of collagen fibrils in the Achilles tendon of wild-type and <italic>Comp</italic> T585M mutant mice. Interestingly, we found that the distribution of collagen fibril diameters in the mutant tendon was dramatically altered, with a higher proportion of larger diameter fibrils. There was a similar difference in the distribution of collagen fibrils in wild-type and mutant spinal ligament, further supporting a role for COMP in collagen fibrillogenesis. The total area occupied by the collagen fibrils was not altered between the wild-type and mutant tendons, but the number of fibrils per unit area of tendon was decreased in the mutant mice. Furthermore, the overall &#x02018;interfibrillar area&#x02019; was not altered in the mutant tendons, suggesting that the amount of inter-territorial matrix in the wild-type and mutant tendons was similar. PGs comprise &#x0223c;0.5% of tendon dry weight and play a role in tendon fibril spacing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C37">37</xref>). We therefore analysed the PG content of wild-type and mutant Achilles tendons from 3 week-old mice and found that the PG content was similar for both genotypes.</p><p>The abnormal changes seen in collagen fibril diameters in the mutant tendon might be due directly to the mutation in the CTD of COMP. For example, this region of COMP contains a potential collagen-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C15">15</xref>), and a role for COMP as a catalyst in collagen fibrillogenesis has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C16">16</xref>). It is therefore possible that this C-terminal COMP mutation (T585M), which is close to the potential collagen-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C17">17</xref>), has a detrimental effect on the &#x02018;catalyst&#x02019; function of COMP that could alter collagen fibril diameter in the mutant tissue and ultimately its biomechanical properties. The detrimental effect of COMP mutations on collagen fibrillogenesis has been previously demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C51">51</xref>). In addition, we also observed an increase in the number of fused/bifurcating collagen fibrils in mutant tendon and ligament compared with the wild-type tissues. Similar observations have previously been seen in a ligament sample from a PSACH. In wild-type animals, fibril bifurcation is abundant in mouse fetal tendon tissue, but decreases with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C52">52</xref>). Furthermore, increased fibril bifurcations have also been found in tendon scar tissue and at the scar to tissue junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C53">53</xref>), and it has been suggested that an increase in fibril bifurcations may be indicative of wound healing and that they may be required to connect neighbouring fibrils to transform the force properly from the scar to the residual tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C53">53</xref>). It has been proposed that the tendon biomechanical function depends on the precise collagen fibre alignment in the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C54">54</xref>). It is therefore interesting to speculate that owing to the altered biomechanical properties of the mutant tendons, some microdamage could occur in the mutant tendon, and the increased number of fused fibrils may be indicative of repair mechanisms in the mutant tissue, which could in turn affect the biomechanical properties of the tissue.</p><p>Finally, the cross-sectional area of whole mutant tendons was also significantly less than that of the wild-type tendons. This may be due to tendon remodelling and/or disuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C55">55</xref>). It could also potentially be a compensatory mechanism for the thicker collagen fibrils in the mutant tendons, which would make the mutant tissue stiffer. The dimensions of tendons directly influence their ability to stretch, store and release kinetic energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C56">56</xref>). In physiological conditions, the cross-sectional area of the tendon, relative to that of the fascicles of the attached muscle, dictates the maximum tensile stress to which a tendon can be subjected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C57">57</xref>). The smaller cross-sectional area of mutant tendons, and the abnormal structural similarities between mutant tendons and ligaments, may therefore explain the joint laxity seen in PSACH-MED patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C2">2</xref>). In addition, the variability in the diameters of individual collagen fibrils can have a dramatic impact on the tissue's biomechanical properties. The biomechanical properties of tendons are directly related to fibril length, diameter and modulus and inversely to interfibrillar spacing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C58">58</xref>), and thick fibrils are predicted to withstand higher tensile forces owing to the higher number of intrafibrillar crosslinks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C59">59</xref>).</p><p>To assess the biomechanical properties of the wild-type and mutant tendons, we performed a series of tensile strength experiments. In a stretch-to-failure experiment, mutant tendons were able to withstand higher stresses and were stretched more before failure. However, when the mutant tissues were tested in a cyclic strain experiment, they became more lax with an increasing number of cycles, which is analogous to the progressive joint laxity observed in PSACH-MED patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C2">2</xref>). Lax tendons would also be less suitable for conveying the appropriate forces from muscle to bone, which might help explain the neuromuscular symptoms seen in PSACH-MED patients. By analogy to the structural changes seen in mouse mutant tendon and ligament, we can hypothesize that joint laxity in PSACH-MED patients might also stem from an altered distribution of collagen fibrils.</p><p>Tendons are known to adapt to mechanical load requirements, and inactivity has been shown to decrease collagen turnover in tendon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C61">61</xref>). It was also shown that training increased the cross-sectional area of tendons in pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C62">62</xref>) and that an increase in cross-sectional area of tendons correlates with an increase in tendon stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C37">37</xref>). Collagen fibril diameters also shift towards thicker fibrils with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C63">63</xref>), resulting in less compliant tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C50">50</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that the tendon and ligament pathology seen in this mouse model of mild PSACH, and in PSACH-MED patients, becomes exacerbated with age as short-limbed dwarfism and increasing joint pain greatly reduce the patients' mobility. The increased joint laxity may in turn have an effect on the joint stability and the progression of degenerative joint disease in PSACH patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C45">45</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we have shown that COMP is expressed in the Achilles tendon and skeletal muscle of adult mice. We have demonstrated that <italic>Comp</italic> T585M mutant mice suffer from a progressive myopathy that is specifically localized to the perimysium and the MTJ. The distribution of collagen fibril diameters is altered in the mutant tendon and ligament, whereas the PG content is comparable between the wild-type and mutant tissues. The biomechanical properties of mutant tendon are dramatically altered, making the tissue more resilient to failure stresses, but ultimately more lax following cyclic strain. We therefore hypothesize that the mild myopathy reported in PSACH-MED results from altered forces transmitted by the mutant tendon, and that the joint laxity may be directly due to the structural abnormalities in the ligament. Furthermore, our study suggests that the difficulties in walking and easy tiredness experienced by some PSACH-MED patients might be a combination of the skeletal phenotype and an underlying tendinopathy. Since tendons are able to adapt to mechanical load and environmental requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP466C64">64</xref>), certain physiotherapeutic treatments may help alleviate some of clinical symptoms of PSACH-MED, such as muscle weakness and joint instability. Our detailed characterization of the mild myopathy and tendinopathy in the mouse model of mild PSACH may also help in the management and early diagnosis of some forms of PSACH-MED, specifically in those children that present with tiredness and muscle weakness prior to the diagnosis of an underlying skeletal dysplasia.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Transgenic mice</title><p>The generation and phenotypic characterization of the mice used in this study is described in detail in Pirog-Garcia <italic>et al</italic>.
