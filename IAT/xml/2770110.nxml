Several genes have been identified on MSYq, but because they are present in more than 40 copies each, their functions cannot be investigated using traditional gene targeting. Here, we generate transgenic mice producing small interfering RNAs that specifically target the transcripts of the MSYq-encoded multicopy gene <italic>Sly</italic> (<italic>Sycp3</italic>-<italic>like Y-linked</italic>). Microarray analyses performed on these <italic>Sly</italic>-deficient males and on MSYq-deficient males show a remarkable up-regulation of sex chromosome genes in spermatids. SLY protein colocalizes with the X and Y chromatin in spermatids of normal males, and <italic>Sly</italic> deficiency leads to defective repressive marks on the sex chromatin, such as reduced levels of the heterochromatin protein CBX1 and of histone H3 methylated at lysine 9. <italic>Sly</italic>-deficient mice, just like MSYq-deficient mice, have severe impairment of sperm differentiation and are near sterile. We propose that their spermiogenesis phenotype is a consequence of the change in spermatid gene expression following <italic>Sly</italic> deficiency. To our knowledge, this is the first successful targeted disruption of the function of a multicopy gene (or of any Y gene). It shows that SLY has a predominant role in PSCR, either via direct interaction with the spermatid sex chromatin or via interaction with sex chromatin protein partners. <italic>Sly</italic> deficiency is the major underlying cause of the spectrum of anomalies identified 17 y ago in MSYq-deficient males. Our results also suggest that the expansion of sex-linked spermatid-expressed genes in mouse is a consequence of the enhancement of PSCR that accompanies <italic>Sly</italic> amplification.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>During meiosis in the male mouse, the X and Y chromosomes are transcriptionally silenced, and retain a significant degree of repression after meiosis. Postmeiotically, X and Y chromosome&#x02013;encoded genes are consequently expressed at a low level, with the exception of genes present in many copies, which can achieve a higher level of expression. Gene amplification is a notable feature of the X and Y chromosomes, and it has been proposed that this serves to compensate for the postmeiotic repression. The long arm of the mouse Y chromosome (MSYq) has multicopy genes organized in clusters over several megabases. On the basis of analysis of mice carrying MSYq deletions, we proposed that MSYq encodes genetic information that is crucial for postmeiotic repression of the sex chromosomes and for sperm differentiation. The gene(s) responsible for these functions were, however, unknown. In this study, using transgenically delivered small interfering RNA, we disrupted the function of <italic>Sly</italic>, a gene that is present in more than 100 copies on MSYq. <italic>Sly</italic>-deficient males have major sperm differentiation problems together with a remarkable postmeiotic derepression of genes encoded on the X and Y chromosomes. Furthermore, the epigenetic modifications normally associated with sex chromosome repression are altered. Our data thus show that the SLY protein is required to mediate postmeiotic repression of the X and Y chromosomes. It is likely that the sperm differentiation problems in <italic>Sly</italic>-deficient males are largely a consequence of the derepression of the sex chromosomes in spermatids. We propose that the postmeiotic repressive effect of <italic>Sly</italic> on genes encoded on the X and Y chromosomes drove their massive amplification in the mouse.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="19"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>During spermatogenesis, germ cells progress through three phases to become functional sperm: proliferation, meiosis, and spermiogenesis.

As is the case for 9/10MSYq<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and 2/3 MSYq<sup>&#x02212;</sup> males, testis weights for the shSLY males did not differ from controls; sperm numbers were reduced but within the fertile range (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000244.s012">Table S1</xref>). However, when mated for a period of 7 mo, sh367 mice had markedly fewer offspring and litters when compared to transgene-negative siblings (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000244-t001">Table 1</xref>). The in vitro fertilizing ability of epididymal sperm samples was also dramatically reduced relative to controls with only one of 662 eggs developing to the two-cell stage (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000244-t001">Table 1</xref>), and the quality of sperm motility appeared to be impaired as shown by the increase in the proportion of non-progressively motile sperm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000244.s012">Table S1</xref>).

Nevertheless, it is important to bear in mind that 9/10MSYq<sup>&#x02212;</sup> mice differ from shSLY mice in that the former are deficient in other MSYq-encoded transcripts (i.e., <italic>Ssty1</italic>, <italic>Ssty2</italic>, <italic>Asty</italic>, and <italic>Orly</italic>), which could contribute to the severity of their sperm defects.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>X-Y Gene Amplification in Mouse Is a Consequence of the Enhancement of PSCR Resulting from <italic>Sly</italic> Amplification</title><p>There is now substantial data documenting that many sex-linked spermatid-expressed genes in the mouse are highly amplified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000244-Mueller1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000244-Hansen1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000244-Ferguson1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, with MSYq genes being especially highly amplified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000244-Toure1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000244-Ellis3">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> (J.

However, a challenge for the hypothesis is to explain why the same degree of amplification is not seen on the Y chromosome of other species (J. Alfoldi and D. C. Page, personal communication). This can be resolved by our finding that one of the amplified mouse-specific genes, <italic>Sly</italic>, regulates PSCR (our present data). We therefore propose that the mouse-specific expansion of sex-linked spermatid-expressed gene copy number is a downstream consequence of the enhancement of PSCR that accompanied <italic>Sly</italic> amplification.</p><p>So what drove <italic>Sly</italic> amplification? The straightforward answer would be that this was necessary in order to maintain <italic>Sly</italic> function in the face of the enhancement of PSCR, but this creates the paradox that <italic>Sly</italic> has become amplified in order to escape its own repressive effects. This in turn implies that the enhancement of PSCR must also have been of selective advantage; otherwise, this function of <italic>Sly</italic> would have been lost. One possibility is that the enhancement of PSCR was a weapon in a postmeiotic genomic conflict, where one or more of the genes on the X chromosome acts to distort the sex ratio in favor of females, whereas <italic>Sly</italic> acts via PSCR to repress the distorter gene(s) and restore a normal sex ratio. The fact that 2/3MSYq<sup>&#x02212;</sup> mice have a sex ratio distortion in favor of females is strong evidence that MSYq does encode a factor or factors that are suppressing sex ratio distortion. For shSLY mice, we observed a mild sex ratio skew of borderline significance. It may be possible to create further shSLY lines with a milder phenotype more comparable to that of 2/3MSYq<sup>&#x02212;</sup> mice to enable us to obtain more extensive breeding data than that obtained with the severely subfertile mice in the present study.

Primer sequences are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000244.s014">Table S3</xref>. Samples from four transgenic mice and three nontransgenic siblings (negative controls), all at 2 mo of age, were analyzed. All reactions were carried out in triplicate per assay, and &#x003b2;-actin was included on every plate as a loading control. The difference in PCR cycles with respect to &#x003b2;-actin (&#x00394;Ct) for a given experimental sample was subtracted from the mean &#x00394;Ct of the reference samples (negative siblings) (&#x00394;&#x00394;Ct). For the quantification of <italic>Sly</italic> knock-down, values were further normalized to &#x00394;&#x00394;Ct values of the spermatid-specific control <italic>Acrv1</italic>. This was to have a more robust analysis when compared with 2/3MSYq<sup>&#x02212;</sup> mice, which have variability in spermatid content.</p><p>For microarray analyses, absolute expression values were obtained by single-color hybridizations (Illumina BeadChip, mouse whole-genome array, v2) for three sh367 transgenic individuals and matched littermate controls (negative siblings), and RNA from each individual was hybridized separately. A similar analysis was performed on 2/3MSYq<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, 9/10MSYq<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, and MSYq<sup>&#x02212;</sup> samples and appropriate age/strain-matched controls. In each case, pooled RNA from two or three individuals was used as the sample. Differentially expressed genes were grouped into five categories based on their expression ratios across all genotypes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000244.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Similar microarray analyses were performed on juvenile testes (17 d postpartum) from three sh367 males and three littermate controls (negative siblings). There was no significant change of gene expression between the two groups. Microarray analyses were also performed on purified spermatid fractions from two groups of sh367 transgenic mice, two groups of sh367 negative siblings, and two groups of 2/3MSYq<sup>&#x02212;</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>For comparisons of the incidence of sperm head abnormalities and of sperm motility (after conversion of percentages to angles), and of the CBX1 and H3K9me3 PMSC/chromocenter intensity ratios, differences between genotypes were assessed by ANOVA using the Generalized Linear Model provided by NCSS statistical data analysis software. Chi-square analysis was used to compare sex ratio and IVF data; for the sex ratio, we used a one-tailed test of significance since we sought to test whether there was a sex ratio distortion in favor of females (as seen in 2/3MSYq<sup>&#x02212;</sup> mice). Student <italic>t</italic>-test was used to compare the data obtained for fecundity, sperm number, testis weight, Northern and Western blot quantification, and real-time PCR (performed on the &#x00394;&#x00394;Ct values). For microarray analysis, quantile normalization of all expression data was performed using BeadStudio (Illumina). Data for the normal/mutant sh367 animals were compared in BeadStudio, using the Illumina custom error model with a false discovery rate of 5&#x00025;. For the cluster analysis, normalized data for all samples were imported into Inforsense Discovery Studio (Inforsense), log<sub>2</sub>-transformed, and expression ratios calculated relative to the appropriate controls. Hierarchical clustering was then performed on the ratio values, using Pearson correlation as the distance metric.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio.1000244.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p><bold>Tests of the efficiency and specificity of shSLY constructs in HEK293 cells.</bold> (A) Western blot detection of SLY and GFP proteins in HEK293 cells cotransfected with SLY-expressing vector (pCMV-SLY) and one pCX-eGFP-shRNA construct (sh136, sh367, or shIRR). shIRR construct has the same structure as sh136 and sh367 but expresses an irrelevant shRNA sequence (sequence available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000244.s014">Table S3</xref>).
