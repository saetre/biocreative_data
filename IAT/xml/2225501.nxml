Even though most <italic>Salmonella</italic> intestinal infections are self-limited, the illness usually lasts 3&#x02013;5 days and is estimated to cost &#x00024;1.4 billon/year in lost wages, expense of recalls, and medical costs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001603-Roberts1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, there has been a steady increase in the prevalence of antibiotic resistant <italic>S</italic>. <italic>enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium (hereafter called <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001603-Helms1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, and a recent study from CDC found that 20&#x00025; of victims in food borne epidemics caused by antibiotic resistant <italic>S. enterica</italic> required hospitalization, emphasizing that even gastroenteritis can be a serious disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001603-Varma1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p><italic>S. enterica</italic> are invasive enteric pathogens, but the pathogenesis of diarrhea in <italic>Salmonella</italic> gastroenteritis is poorly understood. Many investigators have focused on mechanisms of cell invasion using cultured epithelial cells. This led to the discovery of a type 3 secretion system (TTSS) that is encoded by a Salmonella pathogenicity island (SPI-1). The TTSS mediates epithelial cell invasion by injecting bacterial products into host cells that rearrange the host cytoskeleton, causing localized membrane ruffling where the bacteria enter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001603-Jones1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001603-Galan1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001603-Schlumberger1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Uptake of <italic>Salmonella</italic> also triggers a complex transcriptional response in epithelial cells that results in expression of many NF-&#x003ba;B regulated genes. Since most of those genes encode pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines this response has the potential to initiate inflammation, and inflammation is a prominent feature of <italic>Salmonella</italic> gastroenteritis. The induction and basal secretion of chemokines by polarized epithelial cells occurs rapidly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001603-Eckmann1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001603-Elewaut1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Many of the <italic>Salmonella</italic> -induced changes initially observed in cultured cell lines have been confirmed in vivo in bovines and in human intestinal xenografts in SCID mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001603-Tsolis1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001603-Bertelsen1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. However, it is likely that <italic>Salmonella</italic> induce additional epithelial responses that are not apparent in vitro because cell lines do not recapitulate all of the properties of the native intestinal epithelium.</p><p>Mice do not develop diarrhea when orally infected with <italic>S. enterica</italic>, which has greatly hampered the study of the pathogenesis of intestinal infection. However, a mouse model of <italic>Salmonella</italic> colitis in streptomycin-pretreated mice was developed more than fifty years ago by Bohnhoff <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001603-Bohnhoff1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Over the subsequent 20 years several groups used this model to show that oral streptomycin makes mice 100,000 fold more susceptible to oral <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection, and that alterations in the normal intestinal microflora are responsible for their increased susceptibility. Indeed, germ free mice are also susceptible to <italic>Salmonella</italic> colitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001603-Ruitenberg1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. This model languished until Hardt's group in Switzerland recently revived it. They confirmed that the streptomycin-treated BALB/c and C57BL/6 (B6) mice get an acute colitis when infected orally with <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001603-Barthel1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Most importantly, they showed that SPI-1 mutants of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium (<italic>invJ</italic> and <italic>invG</italic> ) did not produce colitis, though they still could infect the cecum as well as wild type (WT) <italic>Salmonella,</italic> and they were also invasive as measured by CFU in the mesenteric lymph nodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001603-Barthel1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Hapfelmeier <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001603-Hapfelmeier1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> then showed that SPI-1 effector molecules SipA, SopE, and SopE2 were involved in producing the pathology of <italic>Salmonella</italic> colitis. Thus, they established the physiological relevance of the model.</p><p>Nearly all reported experiments on <italic>Salmonella</italic> colitis in mice have been done with <italic>Nramp1<sup>G169D</sup></italic> mutant mice (ItyS) that are so susceptible to systemic <italic>Salmonella</italic> infections that they die 4&#x02013;5 days after oral infection. Perhaps because of that, most studies of <italic>Salmonella</italic> colitis in mice have focused on cecal inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001603-Hapfelmeier1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001603-Barthel1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001603-Coburn1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Although investigators refer to it as a model of <italic>Salmonella</italic> colitis, inflammation and gross pathology are focused on the cecum with some inflammation in the contiguous colon. <italic>Nramp1</italic> is encoded by a gene on chromosome 1 that is now called <italic>Slc11a1</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001603-Vidal1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

We expected the BALB/c.D2<sup>Nramp1</sup> congenic mice to survive and to spontaneously clear the infection, but instead they started to lose weight by day 5&#x02013;6 after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001603-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) and they had visible evidence of diarrhea as manifested by fecal soiling of their peri-anal fur.

We repeated the experiment to do quantitative microbiology on the tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001603-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).

For this measurement it was necessary for us to analyze the fecal material from the distal colon rather than defecated stool, since mice with diarrhea scores of 4&#x02013;5 did not pass formed stools. Because the colon absorbs water from the feces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001603-Kunzelman1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, we cannot be certain that the water content of defecated feces and the water content of the fecal material in the distal colon would have been the same, had we been able to collect defecated feces from the infected mice. However, using uninfected mice the water content of defecated feces with that of feces taken from the distal 2 cm, or from the distal 3 cm of the colon (unpublished results, jf), and there was no significant difference. Thus, in normal mice the bulk of water is absorbed more proximally in the colon and that encourages us that our measurement of fecal water is a valid surrogate for the signs that are used clinically to define diarrhea.</p><p>We used this mouse model to begin to investigate pathogen and host factors that contribute to diarrhea due to <italic>S. enterica</italic> infections. <italic>S. enterica</italic> are a common cause of infectious diarrhea, but the mechanism of diarrhea in this infection is not well understood.

Our focus was on the pathogenesis of diarrhea, although we realized that diarrhea may be secondary to the inflammatory response.</p><p>To begin to assess the role of bacterial virulence factors in <italic>Salmonella</italic> colitis in mice we infected them with SPI-1 (<italic>invA</italic>) or <italic>phoP</italic> mutants.

Hapfelmeier <italic>et al</italic> reported that the residual inflammation caused by infection with a SPI-1 mutant was reduced significantly if mice had a mutation in MyD88, which abrogates most signaling through TLRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001603-Hapfelmeier2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, inflammation produced by a SPI-2 mutant (expressing an intact SPI-1) was not much reduced in MyD88 mutant mice. This implies that <italic>Salmonella</italic> can induce colonic inflammation in two ways. SPI-1 promotes epithelial invasion, which stimulates those cells to make chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001603-Jung1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, independent of MyD88 signaling. SPI-1 mutants do not stimulate epithelial cells but they do survive inside macrophages (SPI-2 is intact) and those cells are stimulated to make cytokines and chemokines in a MyD88-dependent fashion. Which TLR is responsible for the inflammation caused by SPI-1 mutants is not known but both TLR4 and TLR5 are expressed by infiltrating macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001603-Uematsu1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We too found that WT and a SPI-1 mutant (<italic>invA</italic>) invaded the cecum and caused significant inflammation, but we found that WT <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection spread distally to infect and inflame most of the colon by day 8/9 after infection, while the SPI-1 (<italic>invA</italic>) mutant remained largely confined to the cecum, as did the pathology. Most importantly, the diarrhea scores and the water content of the feces from mice infected with the <italic>invA</italic> mutant were significantly lower than the scores produced by WT Salmonella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001603-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The localization of inflammation produced by <italic>invA</italic> to the cecum may explain why <italic>invA</italic> did not cause significant diarrhea in this model of colitis. It is not clear why the cecum was more susceptible to <italic>invA</italic> infections than the rest of the colon. The terminal ileum enters the cecum and that part of the colon is patulous, which may allow more time for the bacteria to be in contact with the mucosa. Alternatively, there may be differences in the residual flora of the cecum and the rest of the colon, though we did not study that. <italic>invA Salmonella</italic> may also be taken up by M cells that overlie Peyer's patches, which are present in the cecum. Hoever, Hapfelmeier et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001603-Hapfelmeier2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> showed that WT and SPI-1 mutants can invade the ceca of LT&#x003b2;R -/- mice, which have no Peyer's patches or GALT, so we cannot attribute susceptibility to the lymphoid aggregates that normally are in the mouse cecum.</p><p>We also studied a <italic>phoP</italic> mutant in this model. PhoP mutants do not survive inside macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001603-Miller1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. PhoP/Q is a two component transcriptional regulator that regulates expression of many <italic>Salmonella</italic> genes, including genes that modify LPS and make the bacteria more resistant to antimicrobial peptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001603-Ernst1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. A <italic>phoP</italic> mutant was nearly avirulent in our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001603-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The mutant infected the cecum and caused localized inflammation, increased fecal water content, and mild diarrhea by day 2 after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001603-g004">Figure 4</xref>), as might be expected since the <italic>phoP</italic> mutation may even enhance epithelial cell invasion in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001603-Behlau1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. However, BALB/c.D2 mice rapidly reduced the numbers of <italic>Salmonella</italic> over the next week. The rapid clearance of <italic>phoP</italic>- bacteria from the colon was reflected in markedly reduced inflammation in the colon; on days 8/ 9 after infection there was no evidence of diarrhea and no inflammation in the cecum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001603-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). Thus, <italic>phoP</italic> mutant <italic>Salmonella</italic> could invade but could not survive in the colon, and they did not cause ongoing inflammation or a high diarrhea score, and they caused only a transient increase in fecal water content. We conclude from this that epithelial cell invasion by <italic>Salmonella</italic> is not sufficient to produce diarrhea in this model, though it may transiently impair epithelial cell function enough to decrease net water absorption.</p><p>PhoP/Q regulates many genes and it is not clear which of them are necessary for virulence.

Therefore, we tested <italic>pmrA</italic> and <italic>pmrF</italic> mutants for their ability to cause colitis, and they were fully virulent. Thus, the profound attenuation of a <italic>phoP/Q</italic> mutant in the colitis model is not due to lack of expression of any of the <italic>pmrA-</italic>coregulated genes. PmrA/B control only a subset of the genes that regulate modifications of the LPS, and <italic>pmrA</italic> mutants remain resistant to some antimicrobial peptides such as cathelicidin. <italic>phoP</italic> mutants are more susceptible to cathelicidins, which may explain why <italic>phoP</italic> mutants are avirulent in this model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001603-Shi1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The above results suggest that inflammation was connected with diarrhea. If inflammation is somehow responsible for diarrhea in <italic>Salmonella</italic> gastroenteritis, we reasoned that inflammatory mediators made by the host may contribute to diarrhea. We assessed the contribution of one host factor, reactive oxygen species (ROS), by infecting gp91<sup>phox</sup> -deficient mice, which cannot generate ROS. Since the gp91<sup>phox</sup> mutation is on a B6 genetic background, and gp91<sup>phox</sup> is an X-linked gene, we were able to breed gp91<sup>phox</sup> -/- mice on an ItyR genetic background by crossing homozygous female B6.gp91<sup>phox</sup> -/- mice with male TF6 (Nramp1<sup>G169</sup> transgenics). We then compared male F1 mice that had CGD with female littermates, who were carriers of the mutation and did not have CGD because of the Lyon effect. We found that male mice with CGD developed severe diarrhea when infected with 14028s, as severe as, or possibly worse than the controls. These results show that ROS from the host are not necessary to produce diarrhea. Not surprisingly, the male mice with CGD were also much more susceptible to <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection than were their sisters. These results extend the observations of Shiloh et al who reported that B6 mice with CGD are more susceptible to systemic <italic>Salmonella</italic> infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001603-Shiloh1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. We also used the ItyR gp91<sup>phox</sup> -/- mice to determine whether CGD mice were susceptible to oral infection with the <italic>phoP</italic> mutant, and they were not. This result implies that ROS are not required to kill <italic>phoP</italic> mutant <italic>Salmonella</italic> in vivo, and that there are non-oxidative killing mechanisms in mice that are an effective defense against <italic>phoP</italic> mutants but not WT <italic>Salmonella</italic>.</p><p>While we were doing these experiments Stecher et al reported that 2 strains of genetically resistant mice(ItyR) developed a severe form of <italic>Salmonella</italic> colitis, though the analysis presented was only of the cecal pathology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001603-Stecher1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. In their experiments DBA/2 mice died of a progressive systemic infection, but the BALB/c.D2<sup>Nramp1</sup> congenic mice that we studied did not die of infection. We are still uncertain why BALB/c.D2<sup>Nramp1</sup> congenic mice died, but they probably died from colitis and not from overwhelming systemic <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection. In addition to Nramp1, there are a number of polymorphic genes in mice that influence resistance to systemic <italic>Salmonella</italic> infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001603-Roy1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, and these could explain the difference between the course of infection in BALB/c.D2<sup>Nramp1</sup> congenic mice and the strains studied by Stecher et al.</p><p>In summary, we have developed a model of <italic>Salmonella</italic> colitis that mimics a severe form of human <italic>Salmonella</italic> gastroenteritis that is manifested as dysentery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001603-McGovern1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001603-Day1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001603-Chao1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>.

If we could not obtain feces from a mouse because of diarrhea we did not include that mouse in our calculations. Feces were weighed before we processed them and we calculated CFU/gram of feces.</p><p>The scoring system that we used to assess the severity of the diarrhea is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001603-t001">Table 1</xref>. To determine the water content of the feces we removed all the luminal contents from the distal 3 cm of the colon and placed them into Eppendorf tubes. The tubes with the lids off were weighed and then dried in a SpeedVac (Thermo Savant, Waltham, MA) for 4-6 hours until all samples were dry. The tubes were reweighed and the percentage decrease in weight was calculated.
