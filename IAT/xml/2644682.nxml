The founding member MAL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] resides in lipid rafts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and is required in apical vesicle transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The MAL family also includes less characterised members, including BENE, which is also a raft-associated integral membrane protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], plasmolipin, a 20 kDa proteolipid expressed in compact myelin and epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and chemokine-like factor superfamily 8 (CKLFSF8), a novel regulator of EGF-induced signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. MAL2 was identified as a partner for tumor protein D52-like proteins through yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) expression screening of a human breast carcinoma library [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The MAL2 protein is now known to be expressed in many epithelial cell types, as well as peripheral neurons, mast cells and dendritic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In HepG2 hepatoma cells, MAL2 resides exclusively within lipid rafts, and represents an essential component for indirect basolateral-to-apical transcytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], where it shows a highly dynamic subcellular localisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. MAL2 has also been reported to be distributed in both lipid raft and non-raft fractions in primary thyrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and PC-3 prostate carcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], predicting additional, uncharacterised cellular functions for MAL2 outside lipid rafts.</p><p>The initial identification of <italic>MAL2 </italic>suggested its overexpression in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], which is supported by the <italic>MAL2 </italic>gene being found at chromosome 8q24, which is frequently gained in breast and other cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Several studies have now identified <italic>MAL2 </italic>amplification and/or overexpression in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Overexpression of <italic>MAL2 </italic>has also been reported in other cancers, including primary ovarian carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and ascites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and pancreatic carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], where <italic>MAL2 </italic>has since been employed as a discriminator of pancreatic carcinoma versus chronic pancreatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Expression profiling has also indicated <italic>MAL2 </italic>overexpression in malignant pleural mesothelioma of the epithelial type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], and in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Immunohistochemical analyses first revealed differential MAL2 expression in renal carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], with this being recently confirmed in chromophobe renal cell carcinoma versus oncocytoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>Despite numerous reports of MAL2 overexpression in breast cancer, little is known about how increased MAL2 expression may provide an advantage to cancer cells. While MAL2 cellular localisation and function have been explored in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], the only known MAL2 partners are members of the D52-like protein family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Interactions between MAL2 and both D52 and D53 have since been identified in a large scale Y2H analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], which supports further use of the Y2H system to analyse MAL2 function. We therefore carried out a Y2H screening of a breast carcinoma cDNA expression library [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] to identify novel MAL2 binding partners. One protein thus identified was mucin 1 (MUC1), a transmembrane protein expressed on the apical surface of epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and overexpressed in multiple cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], in part through <italic>MUC1 </italic>gene amplification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Like other mucins, MUC1 protects and lubricates normal glandular epithelia, whereas MUC1 overexpression in cancer alters many cellular properties, including intercellular adhesion and immune recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. As MUC1 therefore represented a candidate MAL2 partner of particular interest, subsequent experiments were performed to confirm MAL2/MUC1 interactions, and examine their significance in breast epithelial and cancer cells. As we will describe, this work identifies a MAL2 as a cytoplasmic MUC1 partner which binds MUC1 in non-lipid raft fractions, and may regulate MUC1 expression and/or subcellular distribution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plasmid constructs</title><p>Bait proteins for use in the Y2H system were expressed from the pAS2-1 vector (Clontech, Mountain View, California, USA), and prey proteins were expressed from the pACT2 (Clontech) or pAD-GAL4 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) vectors.

Testing whether MUC1 (prey#1, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>) could reproducibly bind MAL2 and/or the related protein MAL showed that MUC1 could bind both MAL2 and MAL baits in the Y2H system (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). In contrast, D52-like baits bound MAL2 prey as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], but not MAL (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). Since MAL and MAL2 sequences differ in their N-terminal regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and a full-length MAL2 prey was originally isolated using a D54 bait [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], the MAL2 N-terminal domain (M<sup>1</sup>-T<sup>34</sup>) was hypothesised to represent the interaction interface with D52-like proteins. Deleting this region abolished interactions with all D52-like proteins tested, but did not affect interactions with MUC1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>), suggesting that MUC1 and D52-like proteins bind discrete regions of MAL2.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>(a) Schematic diagram of MUC1 preys (prey#1-prey#7) isolated during Y2H screen.

To map the MUC1 binding domain in MAL2, additional N-terminal MAL2 deletion mutants were constructed, to serially delete the four MAL2 TM domains (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>). The TM domains were specifically targeted as the MUC1 TM domain was encoded by all prey constructs isolated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>).

We therefore undertook a Y2H screen to identify MAL2 binding partners expressed in human breast cancer tissue, which identified a number of novel putative binding proteins, including MUC1. MUC1 represented a candidate partner of particular interest, given the fact that it is overexpressed in cancer types where MAL2 overexpression has also been reported, and as MUC1 overexpression contributes to cancer progression through a number of mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Interactions between human MUC1 and MAL2 proteins are also broadly consistent with the previously reported interactions between the yeast signalling mucin Msb2 and the tetraspanin protein Sho1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Subsequent results collectively identify MAL2 as a novel cytoplasmic MUC1 partner, and a possible regulator of MUC1 expression and/or subcellular distribution. It is striking to note that MAL2, a chromosome 8q24 amplification target, has now been shown to bind MUC1 and D52, both of which are amplified and/or overexpressed in breast and other cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] strongly suggesting that these proteins have co-operating functions in cancer cells.</p><p>While a recent study by Kinlough <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] indicated that palmitoylation is the dominant feature modulating MUC1 recycling to the plasma membrane, the mechanisms by which MUC1 is targeted and maintained at the plasma membrane are not fully understood. Since ectopic Myc-MAL2 expression in MCF-10A cells was associated with increased MUC1 detection at the cell periphery in the present study, MAL2 may play a direct or indirect role in MUC1 targeting. Interestingly, MAL2 incompletely co-localised with peripheral MUC1 in MCF-10A/Myc-MAL2 cells, which supports previous findings that altering MAL2 expression can alter cargo accumulation distant to the predominant site of MAL2 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, ectopic Myc-MAL2 expression also produced an apparent expansion of cell surface domains in MCF-10A cells, which may also contribute to increased MUC1 detection at the cell periphery. Similar observations have been made in a previous study where MAL overexpression altered the morphology of MDCK cells, by seemingly expanding apical cell surface domains through increased apical delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Finally, we also noted that ectopic MAL2 expression produced an increase in MUC1 detection across Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble protein fractions in MCF-10A/Myc-MAL2 cells, indicating that Myc-MAL2 may positively regulate MUC1 expression. This may also lead to increased peripheral MUC1 detection. While it remains to be determined whether MAL2 can alter MUC1 distribution in other cell types, the broad expression of MAL2 within epithelia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] is consistent with MAL2 contributing to MUC1 targetting under physiological conditions. It will also be of interest to examine whether MAL2 can similarly regulate MUC1 secretion.</p><p>If MAL2 similarly regulates MUC1 expression and/or distribution in cancer cells, increased MAL2 levels could alter cancer cell biology in several ways. Increased MUC1 localisation at the cell surface could reduce intercellular adhesion and promote invasiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], and increased MAL2 expression would thus be expected to have adverse significance in cancer cells. Accordingly, <italic>MAL2 </italic>has been included within a gene signature of poor prognosis in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], and <italic>MAL2 </italic>overexpression was associated with resistance to doxorubicin therapy in breast cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. MAL2 overexpression might also reduce cytoplasmic MUC1 accumulation, which has been indicated to be an adverse finding in breast and ovarian carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>], tumor types which also overexpress <italic>MAL2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].

Further direct analyses are therefore required to determine whether MAL2 and MUC1 levels are positively correlated in cancer types commonly expressing these proteins, and whether MAL2 expression is significantly associated with cell surface expression of MUC1 in cancer cells.</p><p>The present study also provides the first report that MUC1 localises within lipid raft fractions in breast carcinoma cells, and raises the possibility that some of MUC1's signalling functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] may occur within lipid rafts. Previous studies reported that MUC1 in T-lymphocyte cell lines was insoluble in cold Triton X-100 and associated with low density membrane fractions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>], yet Kinlough <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] showed MUC1 from MDCK cells was fully soluble in Triton X-100. The reported differences in MUC1 solubility may be due to cell specific differences in membrane composition and their selectivity for detergents, as reported by Schuck <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>], or alternatively MUC1 may not reside in lipid rafts in all cell types. We demonstrated associations between MUC1 and MAL2 in Triton X-100 soluble fractions, in agreement with MUC1 and MAL2 being predominantly detected in non-raft fractions in all cell lines analysed, which was also noted for the MAL2 partner D52. While we were unable to determine whether MAL2 and MUC1 associate within lipid rafts, our results indicate that MAL2 associates with MUC1 and potentially other proteins outside lipid raft membrane microdomains, as indicated for other tetraspanins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>], and highlights the fact that MAL2 may have independent functions within and outside lipid rafts.</p><p>Our analysis of MAL2 partners has also indicated that MAL2 may represent a multifunctional transmembrane adaptor protein, capable of binding more than one partner simultaneously. We noted that both MAL2 and D52 co-immunoprecipitated with MUC1 in the present study, despite the fact that direct interactions between MUC1 and D52 were not detected in the Y2H system. Independent interaction domains for MAL2/MUC1 and MAL2/D52 binding were also indicated by the MAL2 N-terminal domain being required to bind D52-like proteins, yet the first TM domain was required for binding MUC1. Correspondingly, D52-like proteins did not bind MAL, whose N-terminal sequence is poorly conserved with respect to that of MAL2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], yet MUC1 bound both MAL and MAL2 in the Y2H system. These results therefore predict shared and isoform-specific functions for MAL-like proteins, through shared and discrete binding partners.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study has identified MAL2 as a novel cytoplasmic MUC1 partner and a potential regulator of MUC1 subcellular distribution. MAL2/MUC1 interactions were detected in Triton X-100-soluble membrane fractions, indicating that MAL2 has specific functions within non-raft membrane compartments in breast cancer cells. Since <italic>MAL2 </italic>is known to be amplified and overexpressed in breast and other cancers, it is striking that MAL2 has now been shown to bind two proteins, MUC1 and D52, which are also amplified and/or overexpressed. Based on these results, and a previous study highlighting the co-amplification of <italic>MAL2 </italic>and <italic>D52 </italic>genes in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], it will be interesting to examine whether <italic>MAL2 </italic>and <italic>MUC1 </italic>are commonly amplified and overexpressed in breast cancer, and whether MAL2 expression is significantly associated with cell surface expression of MUC1.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>TM: transmembrane; EGF: epidermal growth factor; CKLFSF8: chemokine-like factor superfamily8; Y2H: yeast two-hybrid; cfu: colony forming unit; MAL: Mal T-cell differentiation protein; MUC1: mucin 1; CAV1: caveolin-1; PCR: polymerase chain reaction; BSA: bovine serum albumin; M&#x003b2;CD: methyl &#x003b2;-cyclodextrin.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SF contributed to the Y2H screening and analyses, carried out all other experiments, and drafted the manuscript.
