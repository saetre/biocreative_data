Here we report development of an animal model of acute severe dopamine deficiency by using mice lacking the dopamine transporter. In the absence of transporter-mediated recycling mechanisms, dopamine levels become entirely dependent on de novo synthesis. Acute pharmacological inhibition of dopamine synthesis in these mice induces transient elimination of striatal dopamine accompanied by the development of a striking behavioral phenotype manifested as severe akinesia, rigidity, tremor, and ptosis. This phenotype can be reversed by administration of the dopamine precursor, L-DOPA, or by nonselective dopamine agonists. Surprisingly, several amphetamine derivatives were also effective in reversing these behavioral abnormalities in a dopamine-independent manner. Identification of dopamine transporter- and dopamine-independent locomotor actions of amphetamines suggests a novel paradigm in the search for prospective anti-Parkinsonian drugs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Identification of dopamine transporter- and dopamine- independent locomotor actions of amphetamines suggests a novel paradigm in the search for prospective anti-Parkinsonian drugs.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The phenylethylamine derivative dopamine (DA) is critically involved in a wide variety of vital functions such as locomotion, feeding, emotion, and reward &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b01">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b03">3</xref>&#x0005d;. Major DA systems in the brain originate from brainstem DA neurons located in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA).

Due to these limitations of existing therapeutic approaches, the development of better anti-Parkinsonian drugs remains a major objective of PD research.

We have developed mice lacking a functional DAT (DAT-KO mice) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b11">11</xref>&#x0005d; that display remarkable alterations in the compartmentalization of DA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b37">37</xref>&#x0005d;. Lack of the DAT-mediated inward transport in these mice results in an elevated extracellular DA and at least 95&#x00025; decreased intracellular DA stores. Unlike normal animals, these mice demonstrate remarkable dependence of the remaining DA on ongoing synthesis, and pharmacologic blockade of DA synthesis in DAT-KO mice provides an effective approach to eliminate DA acutely &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b13">13</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Substituted phenylethylamine derivatives, amphetamines, that are structurally similar to DA and the endogenous trace amine &#x003b2;-phenylethylamine, represent a well-known group of compounds that potently affect psychomotor functions. Amphetamines are known to interact with plasma membrane monoamine transporters, including DAT, norepinephrine (NE) transporter (NET), and serotonin transporter.

Intriguingly, recent studies have identified novel transporter-independent targets of amphetamines. It has been shown that amphetamines, as well as &#x003b2;-phenylethylamine, some monoamine metabolites, and several drugs affecting monoaminergic transmission, can directly activate specific G protein&#x02013;coupled trace amine (trace amine 1 &#x0005b;TA1&#x0005d;) receptors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b42">42</xref>&#x0005d; with currently unknown functional consequences &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b44">44</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>We report here that the pharmacologic inhibition of the rate-limiting enzyme of DA synthesis, TH, almost immediately depletes brain DA to undetectable levels in DAT-KO mice and induces a transient recapitulation of essentially all PD symptoms for up to 16 h. DA-deficient DAT-KO mice (DDD mice) thus represent an acute PD model that is useful for studying the efficacy of compounds that potentially can restore control of locomotion in the absence of any contribution of the dopaminergic system. By using this approach, we found that several amphetamine derivatives can counteract the behavioral manifestations of severe DA deficiency, suggesting that, in addition to well-known DA-mediated effects, amphetamine-like compounds can also affect motor functions in a DA- and DAT-independent manner.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>A Pharmacologic Approach for Provoking Selective DA Deficiency in DAT-KO Mice</title><p>The ability of &#x003b1;-methyl-<italic>p</italic>-tyrosine (&#x003b1;MT), a potent irreversible inhibitor of TH &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b46">46</xref>&#x0005d;, to impede production of brain DA suggests a simple, but straightforward, strategy for producing an acute PD mouse model. However, numerous studies have documented that treatment of normal animals with &#x003b1;MT results only in a relatively slow and partial depletion of DA in brain tissues that is not sufficient for generation of PD-like symptoms &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b46">46</xref>&#x0005d;. This limited depletion is based upon how DA is stored. It is believed that the large intraneuronal DA storage pool that normally exists in striatal DA terminals provides sufficient DA to release and recycle back into releasing terminals up to the time when newly synthesized TH starts to regain its functional role &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b46">46</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, in a normal animal, complete depletion of striatal DA is unachievable by TH inhibition alone, and additional depletion of vesicular DA by VMAT2 inhibitors, such as reserpine is required &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b49">49</xref>&#x0005d;. Protocols designed for wild-type &#x0005b;WT&#x0005d; mice that use a dual inhibitor strategy (VMAT2 plus TH inhibitors) deplete DA to 1&#x00025;&#x02013;2&#x00025; of control levels &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b50">50</xref>&#x0005d;, but the levels of other monoamine neurotransmitters that are substrates for VMAT2 are also severely affected. This nonselective targeting of monoaminergic signaling generally results in very complicated phenotypes that are not necessarily reflective of classic PD.</p><p>In the absence of any pharmacologic treatment, the intraneuronal vesicular stores of DA in the striatum of DAT-KO mice are already profoundly depleted by at least 20-fold &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b12">12</xref>&#x0005d;. This selective depletion of DA in dopaminergic terminals of DAT-KO mice, as well as analogous depletion observed in mice lacking NET &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b51">51</xref>&#x0005d; or serotonin transporter &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b52">52</xref>&#x0005d; with NE and serotonin (5-HT), respectively, reflects the critical role of transporter-mediated recycling in the maintenance of intracellular storage pools &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b13">13</xref>&#x0005d;. With loss of the major intracellular storage pool of DA in DAT-KO mice, both the intracellular and extracellular levels of DA in the striatum become critically dependent upon ongoing DA synthesis. Therefore in DAT-KO mice, acute TH inhibition alone by &#x003b1;MT is sufficient to induce profound depletion of DA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b37">37</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>To explore this phenomenon in detail, we first measured the time-course of striatal DA depletion in DAT-KO and control mice following treatment with &#x003b1;MT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030271-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In agreement with previous studies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b13">13</xref>&#x0005d;, we observed that in saline-treated DAT-KO mice, striatal tissue levels of DA were about 20-fold lower than in WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030271-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). The systemic administration of &#x003b1;MT (250 mg/kg IP) to DAT-KO mice produced rapid (15 min) and virtually complete (down to 5&#x00025; of control levels in DAT-KO mice that is equivalent to less than 0.2&#x00025; of WT control levels) depletion of striatal DA. In contrast, in WT mice the same treatment resulted in a relatively slow (4 h) depletion of only 60&#x00025; of striatal tissue DA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030271-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). The duration of the depletion in DAT-KO mice was extensive, lasting up to 16 h, until a recovery of DA, related to the de novo synthesis of TH, occurs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b45">45</xref>&#x0005d;. Notably, the rate of recovery of striatal DA levels was approximately the same in WT and DAT-KO mice.</p><p>Because DA itself serves as a precursor for neuronal production of NE in NE neurons, the inhibition of TH should also impact NE production. To test the impact of TH inhibition on the NE system, the frontal cortex tissue NE concentrations were measured in WT and DAT-KO mice. As opposed to the DAT, NET expression is not altered in DAT-KO mice so that the storage pool, which is by far the predominant reservoir of NE in NE-enriched regions such as the frontal cortex, should not be significantly altered in these mutants. Accordingly, the levels of NE in the frontal cortex tissue of saline-treated DAT-KO mice did not vary from that of WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030271-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). Furthermore, &#x003b1;MT (250 mg/kg IP) treatment induced similar NE depletion in WT and DAT-KO mice by about 60&#x00025; in 8 h after treatment. Importantly, the rates of partial NE depletion and recovery were almost identical between WT and DAT-KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030271-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). Thus, TH inhibition in DAT-KO mice induces rapid severe depletion of DA, but only partially and slowly affects NE, indicating selectivity of this marked depletion to neurons expressing the DAT.</p><p>In order to demonstrate that targeting of TH by &#x003b1;MT depletes the functional extracellular pool of DA in living animals, we measured extracellular levels of striatal DA in freely moving mice by in vivo microdialysis. In agreement with total tissue DA data, &#x003b1;MT treatment essentially eliminated extracellular DA levels in DAT-KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030271-g001">Figure 1</xref>F), whereas only a partial decrease was observed in WT mice. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030271-g001">Figure 1</xref>E). Thus, both intracellular and extracellular DA levels in the striatum of DAT-KO mice are critically dependent upon ongoing synthesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>DA Depletion in DAT-KO Mice Results in a Loss of Motor Control</title><p>It is well known that DA plays a pivotal role in the control of various aspects of locomotor behaviors.

These behaviors were analyzed in WT and DAT-KO mice for 4 h after a &#x003b1;MT treatment when depletion of DA is most severe in DAT-KO mice but with relatively minor effect on NE levels (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030271-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In all these measures DDD mice differed significantly from their WT littermates or saline-treated controls. Importantly, these abnormal behaviors in DDD mice, with the exception of ptosis, became maximal during the 30- to 60-min period following &#x003b1;MT exposure, thus correlating with the rate of DA depletion. Ptosis developed substantially later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030271-g003">Figure 3</xref>H), suggesting an additional contribution of NE depletion to the full magnitude of this response &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b59">59</xref>&#x0005d;. Importantly, the righting reflex of DDD mice was normal at all time periods analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030271-g003">Figure 3</xref>I), indicating that this akinesia is not related to global sedation but rather to deficient movement control. It should be noted also that this global phenotype, which might be viewed as &#x0201c;freezing,&#x0201d; can be on some occasions temporarily disrupted by an acoustic startle or other stressful stimulus. However, after manifesting a few movements, the animals return to an akinetic state (data not shown). Strikingly, DDD mice, when placed in water, were able to swim with periods of floating and active swimming for at least a 3-min period (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv001">Video S1</xref>), indicating that under certain conditions, movement can occur essentially without DA. Finally, in agreement with neurochemical data (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030271-g001">Figure 1</xref>B), the recovery from this profound akinetic phenotype in DDD mice occurs approximately 16&#x02013;24 h following treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030271-g003">Figure 3</xref>J). The full recovery of animals allows repeated treatment with &#x003b1;MT, and, in fact, DAT-KO mice chronically treated with &#x003b1;MT (100 mg/kg, IP, once every 3 d) for a period of 40 wk showed no negative consequences &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b60">60</xref>&#x0005d;.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>L-DOPA and Nonselective DA Agonists Restore Motor Activity in DDD Mice</title><p>The locomotor restoring effects exhibited by L-DOPA and DA agonists in various models of DA deficiency form one of the best-established paradigms in neuroscience &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b03">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b61">61</xref>&#x0005d;.

Furthermore, several treatments, although not inducing forward locomotion per se, were, nevertheless, somewhat effective in reversing other manifestations of DA deficiency.

However, in DDD mice, there is only a minimal amount of DA remaining (&#x0003c;0.2&#x00025;) and the lack of the DAT precludes the possibility of amphetamine-mediated DA efflux. In fact, in vivo microdialysis studies confirmed that (+)-MDMA, at the effective dose necessary to induce significant locomotor activation in DDD mice, did not produce any detectable increase in striatal extracellular DA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030271-g006">Figure 6</xref>D). Moreover, this locomotor stimulation by (+)-MDMA was not inhibited by simultaneous blockade of D1/D2 DA receptors when DDD mice were pretreated with a combination of the D1 and D2 DA receptor antagonists, SCH23390 and raclopride (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030271-g006">Figure 6</xref>C). Similarly, this pretreatment did not prevent the effects of amphetamine and phentermine on the akinesia and rigidity in DDD mice in grasping and akinesia tests (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>).

Taken together, these data indicate that (+)-MDMA can affect movement control in a DA-independent manner &#x0005b;64&#x0005d; and, most importantly, provide a proof-of-principle that pharmacologic activation of nondopaminergic neuronal pathways may be sufficient to restore movement even in the absence of DA neurotransmission.</p><p>It should be noted that the locomotor-stimulating effect of (+)-MDMA in DDD mice was observed only after high doses of the drug, which may be potentially neurotoxic &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b64">38</xref>&#x0005d;.

However the important role of DAT in the control and maintenance of the intraneuronal DA storage pool frequently remains overlooked. It is generally assumed that the intraneuronal storage of DA is replenished primarily from newly synthesized DA with some contribution from recycled DA. However, several lines of evidence support a predominant role of DAT-mediated recycling of DA for the maintenance of the large storage pool in DA terminals. First, mice lacking the DAT display dramatically decreased (20-fold) striatal tissue DA content, that mostly represents intraneuronal DA concentrations. Second, as we demonstrate in the present study, the remaining DA in all compartments is extremely sensitive to TH inhibition. Furthermore, pharmacologic studies have shown that significant DA depletion may occur after administration of DAT inhibitors, particularly after chronic drug treatment &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b13">13</xref>&#x0005d;.

The lack of an active recycling mechanism in DAT-KO mice results in a profound depletion of intraneuronal concentrations of DA leaving the remaining DA entirely dependent on ongoing synthesis. As a result, inhibition of DA synthesis essentially eliminates striatal DA in these mice leading to the extreme behavioral manifestations. In fact, DDD mice demonstrate a unique set of behaviors that reproduces symptoms of PD with high fidelity. Thus, the lack of DA combined with the striking and highly reproducible behavioral phenotype in these mice can be used as an excellent tool to evaluate the potential of drugs that can affect locomotion in a DA-independent manner. Furthermore, by adapting the dose of &#x003b1;MT to produce various degrees of DA depletion, these mice can also be employed to find novel approaches to restore movement under conditions of partially impaired DA transmission that might be more relevant to most PD cases.</p><p>Several rodent models have been developed to understand pathological processes leading to PD and/or to screen for novel therapeutic strategies &#x0005b;29,30,34&#x02212;36,71&#x0005d;.

Furthermore, rapid and effective elimination of DA in DDD mice may provide a simple in vivo approach to study DA receptor signaling &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b82">82</xref>&#x0005d; and/or to define neuronal circuitry involved in locomotor control &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b83">83</xref>&#x0005d;.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>DA-Independent Locomotor Action of Amphetamines</title><p>Intriguingly, in both DD and DDD mice <italic>d</italic>-amphetamine was effective in restoring at least some aspects of locomotor behaviors. In DD mice, <italic>d</italic>-amphetamine (5 mg/kg IP) induced potent locomotor activation essentially up to the levels observed in WT controls. At the same time, a second treatment 2 h later by the same dose of the drug failed to induce locomotion in DD mice suggesting that this effect is dependent upon residual (after L-DOPA administration) DA which might be depleted by the first treatment with the drug &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b76">76</xref>&#x0005d;. In DDD mice, <italic>d</italic>-amphetamine itself was not able to induce forward locomotion at doses up to 60 mg/kg, but it produced significant effects on other manifestations of DA deficiency. Moreover, co-administration of relatively moderate doses of amphetamine (15 and 20 mg/kg) with a subthreshold dose of L-DOPA resulted in a marked locomotor activation of DDD mice. Thus, some DA tone seems to be necessary to express the full magnitude of locomotor activation by amphetamine, but it is evident that there is a DA-independent component of action that contributes to the overall effect of the drug. Further evidence for this idea relates to the fact that many other amphetamine derivatives are also active in reversing certain behavioral manifestations in DDD mice. Strikingly, both single and repeated treatment with (+)-MDMA was effective in inducing forward locomotion essentially without any contribution of DA. It is important to note that a potent anticataleptic effect of MDMA in haloperidol-treated rats &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b84">84</xref>&#x0005d; and antiakinetic effects in 6-OH-DA&#x02013;lesioned rats &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b85">85</xref>&#x0005d; and MPTP-treated monkeys &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b64">64</xref>&#x0005d; have been recently reported. The present observations support these findings and suggest that these actions are not unique to MDMA but may be extended to other amphetamines. Further characterization of these unexpected effects of amphetamines may provide a novel framework in the search for potential anti-Parkinsonian drugs.</p><p>Amphetamine derivatives are known mainly as indirect enhancers of monoaminergic (DA, NE, and 5-HT) transmission via complex interactions with the plasma membrane monoamine transporters and the vesicular storage of these monoamines &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b07">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b39">39</xref>&#x0005d;.

Furthermore, a blockade of D1/D2 DA receptors was ineffective in preventing the locomotor stimulating action of (+)-MDMA. Thus, it is virtually impossible that the observed effects of MDMA and other amphetamines in DDD mice are directly related to DA transmission. Although it is possible that this effect may be due to transporter-mediated action of amphetamines on NE or 5-HT transmission &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b86">86</xref>&#x0005d;, it should be noted that among several NE- and 5-HT&#x02013;related drugs tested (desipramine, clonidine, the NE precursor DOPS, fluoxetine, 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine, 5-methyl-N,N-dimethyltryptamine, &#x003b1;-ethyltryptamine, and 5-HT1B agonist RU24969), none were effective in DDD mice in tests of forward locomotion or akinesia and rigidity (data not shown). Similarly, no locomotor effect of MAO-A or MAO-B inhibitors was observed in these mice, indicating that the locomotor effect of amphetamines may not be explained by MAO-inhibitory action &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b38">38</xref>&#x0005d;.

It is reasonable to suggest that activation of TA1 receptors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b42">42</xref>&#x0005d; or other trace amine receptors may provide a potential mechanism for DA-independent locomotor effect of MDMA and amphetamines in DDD mice. In line with this hypothesis, we observed that the DAT blocker nomifensine that can activate TA1 receptor, but not GBR12909 which is devoid this activity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b42">42</xref>&#x0005d;, is able to affect motor control in DDD mice. It should be noted, however, that in our initial exploration in DDD mice, we did not observe clear locomotor effects for any trace amine tested; but only a few doses, routes of administration, and combinations with enzyme inhibitors were investigated. Further detailed investigations will be needed to clarify the mechanism of locomotor action of amphetamines in DDD mice.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, these results provide additional functional evidence for the critical role of DAT in the maintenance of DA storage in presynaptic terminals. Rapid and effective abolishment of DA by inhibition of DA synthesis in DAT-KO mice provides a novel approach to develop severe DA deficiency that might be used to identify neuronal mechanisms involved in motor control in the absence of DA. Amphetamines are capable of affecting neuronal systems involved in motor control through mechanisms independent of DAT, in particular, and DA in general.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title/><sec id="s4a1"><title>Animals</title><p>DAT-KO mice were generated as previously described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030271-b11">11</xref>&#x0005d;.
