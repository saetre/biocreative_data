Serine, however, is activated sufficiently rapidly that an editing mechanism is required to remove the products of misactivation. The distinction between the nominally isosteric trio of cysteine, alpha-aminobutyrate and serine by the activation site of the enzyme is attributed to the effect of small differences in size on steric repulsion, the C-O bond length being somewhat shorter than either the C-C or C-S and the van der Waals' radius of -O- being smaller than that of -S- or -CH2-. The smaller amino acid glycine is also readily activated and its reaction products rapidly removed by hydrolytic editing.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00411-0190.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4627"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00411-0191.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4628"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00411-0192.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4629"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00411-0193.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4630"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00411-0194.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4631"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00411-0195.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4632"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00411-0196.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4633"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00411-0197.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4634"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00411-0198.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4635"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00411-0199.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4636"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00411-0200.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4637"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
