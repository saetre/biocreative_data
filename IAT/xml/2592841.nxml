Cell adhesion&#x02013;regulated signaling is important for synaptic development and function, but little is known about differentiation of the presynaptic compartment. In this study, we describe a pathway that promotes presynaptic development involving p120catenin (p120ctn), the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase Fer, the protein phosphatase SHP-2, and &#x003b2;-catenin. Presynaptic Fer depletion prevents localization of active zone constituents and synaptic vesicles and inhibits excitatory synapse formation and synaptic transmission. Depletion of p120ctn or SHP-2 similarly disrupts synaptic vesicle localization with active SHP-2, restoring synapse formation in the absence of Fer. Fer or SHP-2 depletion results in elevated tyrosine phosphorylation of &#x003b2;-catenin. &#x003b2;-Catenin overexpression restores normal synaptic vesicle localization in the absence of Fer or SHP-2. Our results indicate that a presynaptic signaling pathway through p120ctn, Fer, SHP-2, and &#x003b2;-catenin promotes excitatory synapse development and function.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>S.X.

Presynaptic assembly requires targeted delivery of constituents of the synaptic plasma membrane, such as calcium channels and target SNARES, synaptic cytomatrix constituents, such as Bassoon and Piccolo, and synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmari et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dresbach et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Krueger et al., 2003</xref>). Synaptic vesicles are docked and released preferentially in a morphologically distinct domain of the nerve terminal named the active zone, which is formed by fusion to the plasmalemma of active zone precursor vesicles called Piccolo&#x02013;Bassoon transport vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dresbach et al., 2006</xref>). Signals from the presynaptic axon promote differentiation of specialized zones on the postsynaptic side of the synapse that include transmitter receptors, scaffold proteins, cytoskeletal constituents, and signaling molecules, whereas reciprocal signals from the postsynaptic cell induce further maturation of the presynaptic nerve terminal. In the mammalian central nervous system, excitatory synapses are formed primarily on dendritic spines, actin-rich structures that concentrate the molecules required for postsynaptic signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tada and Sheng, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McAllister, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Compared with the extensive studies on mechanisms that control spine morphogenesis and postsynaptic protein localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tada and Sheng, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvarez and Sabatini, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bourne and Harris, 2008</xref>), our understanding of presynaptic development is limited. A recent RNAi screen for decreased acetylcholine secretion in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> identified several genes that had not previously been implicated in synapse transmission, including Fer tyrosine kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sieburth et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The mechanisms by which Fer might regulate synapse structure and function have not been studied. Fer has been shown to act in several signaling pathways, including receptor tyrosine kinase and cell adhesion molecule&#x02013;regulated signaling. Recent work using chick retinal neuroepithelial cells has indicated that Fer promotes the integrity of the cadherin complex through phosphorylation of a tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B, which promotes dephosphorylation of &#x003b2;-catenin Y654, thereby promoting cadherin&#x02013;&#x003b2;-catenin interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xu et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast, a separate study showed that Fer increased the phosphorylation of &#x003b2;-catenin Y142, which inhibited the interaction between &#x003b2;-catenin and &#x003b1;-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Piedra et al., 2003</xref>). In this study, we identify an intracellular signaling pathway mediated by p120catenin (p120ctn), Fer, and the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 that regulates &#x003b2;-catenin phosphorylation and promotes presynaptic differentiation through localization of synaptic vesicles and the active zone&#x02013;associated protein Bassoon.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Cell-autonomous ablation of Fer function results in dispersion of synaptic vesicle puncta and cytomatrix of active zone (CAZ) puncta along the axon</title><p>In the mouse hippocampus, Fer is widely expressed, including in CA1 and CA3 neurons (Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807188/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807188/DC1</ext-link>). In cultured hippocampal neurons, Fer is present in punctate structures along both dendrites and axons (Fig. S1 B).

To examine presynaptic development, an expression vector encoding the synaptic vesicle marker synaptophysin-GFP was cotransfected with Fer shRNA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Fluorescence-tagged synaptic vesicle marker proteins have been widely used to visualize presynaptic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmari et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ryan and Reuter, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lim et al., 2008</xref>). Along control neuron axons, synaptophysin-GFP exhibited rounded or slightly elongated &#x0223c;1-&#x003bc;m-long clusters plus smaller and less intense clusters, which is consistent with prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nakata et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Antonova et al., 2001</xref>). In contrast, in the Fer shRNA&#x02013;expressing neurons the synaptophysin-GFP puncta were less well focused and more diffuse. Coexpression of shRNA-resistant Fer restored the normal pattern of synaptic vesicle localization. Coexpression of an shRNA-resistant kinase-dead Fer mutant, however, failed to rescue the presynaptic phenotype, indicating that the kinase activity of Fer is necessary for normal presynaptic development (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Overexpression of kinase-dead Fer also resulted in synaptophysin-GFP diffusion (Fig. S3). To quantitate the effect of shRNA knockdown on presynaptic terminals, we measured the coverage of synaptophysin-GFP puncta along transfected axons at low threshold brightness. The coverage of synaptophysin-GFP along axons was significantly increased in Fer shRNA&#x02013; or kinase-inactive Fer-transfected axons compared with controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, F and G</xref>). In addition, individual synaptophysin-GFP puncta exhibited increased length and decreased intensity in Fer-deficient neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 I</xref> and see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 J</xref>). We confirmed that the knockdown of Fer had similar effects on endogenous proteins as well by immunostaining with antibodies to the excitatory presynaptic marker vGlut1, which exhibited diffused weak intensity localization in Fer-deficient axons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>, arrows) in contrast to concentrated puncta in controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>, arrowheads). Overexpression of wild-type (WT) Fer in control neurons did not result in significant changes in the intensity or size of synaptophysin-GFP puncta (unpublished data).</p><p>We next examined the localization of a protein associated with CAZ using a GFP-tagged Bassoon variant (GFP&#x02013;Bsn95-3938) that has been used to identify the CAZ in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dresbach et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bresler et al., 2004</xref>). GFP-Bassoon colocalized with vGlut1 immunoreactive puncta in control neurons, but in Fer-deficient cells GFP-Bassoon puncta were dispersed along the axons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). We observed this weakening of Bassoon puncta when we checked endogenous Bassoon by immunostaining along the Fer shRNA&#x02013;transfected axons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). The coverage of GFP&#x02013;Bsn95-3938 puncta was significantly increased in Fer-deficient axons compared with that of controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 H</xref>). The individual Bassoon puncta were more diffuse in Fer-deficient axons compared with control axons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 J</xref>). Together, these results indicate that Fer is required for normal localization to synapses of both CAZ constituents and synaptic vesicles.</p></sec><sec><title>Knockdown of Fer increases the motility of presynaptic clusters</title><p>Next, we asked whether the absence of Fer affects the stability of synaptic vesicle clusters. Time-lapse studies have identified two classes of synaptic vesicle&#x02013;associated clusters that can be distinguished by size and mobility: large clusters with relatively low mobility localized at synaptic sites and smaller and more mobile clusters believed to constitute a population of transport vesicles with directed and saltatory movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmari et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Krueger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McAllister, 2007</xref>). In control axons, synaptophysin-GFP labeled both large puncta (&#x0223c;1 &#x003bc;m in major axis length) moving slowly or remaining stable (at 0.031 &#x003bc;m/min on average; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and Video 1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807188/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807188/DC1</ext-link>) and smaller puncta (&#x0003c;0.4 &#x003bc;m in major axis length) moving much faster in the control. In contrast, in neurons expressing Fer shRNA, large puncta were highly mobile along the axons (at 0.276 &#x003bc;m/min on average; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and Videos 2 and 3). These puncta displayed variable velocities and irregular and undirected movement, indicating that these were not transport vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McAllister, 2007</xref>).

To quantify the intensity and pattern of vGlut1-pHluorin and synaptophysin-mOrange puncta, we averaged the intensity every 0.01 &#x003bc;m along the major axis of each puncta. In control neurons, puncta of vGlut1-pHluorin&#x02013;dependent fluorescence colocalized with synaptophysin-mOrange puncta. (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, I and J</xref>). In Fer-deficient neurons, synaptic vesicles are less tightly clustered, so synaptophysin-mOrange puncta are broader with lower peak intensities (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 J</xref>). However, the surface fluorescence of the vGlut1-pHluorin was greatly reduced in these axons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, H and I</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mitchell and Ryan, 2004</xref>).

We transiently depolarized a transfected neuron (vector or Fer shRNA transfected) and measured evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs [eEPSCs]) in an adjacent untransfected neuron (WT). In contrast to the robust eEPSCs triggered by control presynaptic neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>), the eEPSCs were significantly reduced or not detectable after stimulation of Fer-deficient presynaptic neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>).

For the paired neurons with detectable synaptic transmission, we also observed a slight but significant increase in the delay of synaptic transmission in shRNA&#x02192;WT pairs (5.64 &#x000b1; 2.47 ms for Vec&#x02192;WT [<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 15] and 8.05 &#x000b1; 2.47 ms for shRNA&#x02192;WT [<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 7]; P &#x0003d; 0.041).

The model focuses on the role of Fer and cadherin components at the presynaptic compartment (left). (1) Fer is recruited by p120ctn to the cadherin complex. (2) Fer acts on SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase to increase the phosphatase activity at the cadherin complex. This may be done in two ways that need to be characterized further: Fer may increase phosphorylation or modify the protein interaction of SHP-2, thereby increasing the phosphatase activity of SHP-2, or Fer enhances the recruitment of SHP-2 to the cadherin complex. (3) SHP-2 dephosphorylates &#x003b2;-catenin to strengthen the interaction between cadherin and &#x003b2;-catenin. (4) Cadherin adhesion and possibly other cell adhesion regulated by cadherin (e.g., nectin-mediated adhesion) are stabilized. Through this cadherin&#x02013;catenin adhesion complex (5) in the presynaptic compartment, &#x003b2;-catenin acts as a scaffold using its PSD-95/disc large/ZO-1&#x02013;binding domain to trap and stabilize the synaptic vesicles at the synaptic site.

A key feature of presynaptic development is the proper localization of these complexes to synaptic sites. Components of the CAZ are transported as constituents of Piccolo&#x02013;Bassoon transport vesicles, which are inserted into the plasmalemma to form presynaptic active zones, after which additional scaffold proteins and synaptic vesicles are recruited to these sites through poorly understood mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bresler et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McAllister, 2007</xref>). Localization of components of the active zone cytoplasmic matrix as well as synaptic vesicles requires normal Fer function.</p><p>The impairments in synaptic vesicle and active zone localization after presynaptic depletion of Fer resulted in a striking reduction in spine morphogenesis within juxtaposed dendrites. Reciprocal signaling interactions between pre- and postsynaptic compartments are clearly required for normal synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Okabe et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tada and Sheng, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lardi-Studler and Fritschy, 2007</xref>). Numerous observations implicate cell adhesion&#x02013;mediated interactions in synapse localization and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yamada and Nelson, 2007</xref>). For example, N-cadherin promotes spine morphogenesis and stability in cooperation with p120ctn, &#x003b1;N-catenin, leukocyte common antigen&#x02013;related protein, and GluR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Togashi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dunah et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elia et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saglietti et al., 2007</xref>). It is possible that this trans-synaptic effect of Fer deficiency is at least in part mediated through reduced postsynaptic N-cadherin function.</p><p>As assessed by imaging of FM4-64 uptake, pH-sensitive GFP monitoring of exocytosis, and electrophysiological recordings, synaptic function is severely perturbed by Fer deficiency. This may be caused by (a) deficits in excitatory synapse formation, (b) reduced size of synaptic vesicle pools, and/or (c) changes in the structure and function of the presynaptic active zone. Consistent with the first possibility are our results showing reduction in PSD-95 immunoreactivity and dendritic spine density. The observed reduction in EPSC amplitude may also reflect these postsynaptic abnormalities. Reduced numbers of synaptic vesicles are also likely to contribute to the reduced size of evoked responses observed after Fer depletion from presynaptic terminals. Interestingly, in our prior study, depletion of &#x003b2;-catenin resulted in a reduced reserve vesicle pool size without reducing the size of the readily releasable vesicle pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bamji et al., 2003</xref>). In future studies, it will be interesting to examine the role of the p120ctn&#x02013;Fer&#x02013;SHP-2 pathway in controlling calcium influx and clearance, paired-pulse facilitation and depression, and other aspects of synaptic function and plasticity.</p></sec><sec><title>Signaling pathways mediating Fer function in synaptic development</title><p>Regulation of phosphorylation of &#x003b2;-catenin appears to be a significant downstream target of Fer. X-ray structural analysis, in vitro binding assays, and analyses of cellular immunoprecipitates have shown that type I cadherin-promoted stable cell&#x02013;cell junction formation requires &#x003b2;-catenin. Phosphorylation of &#x003b2;-catenin controls its interactions with cadherins and other binding partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huber and Weis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lilien and Balsamo, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xu and Kimelman, 2007</xref>). Studies have revealed that phosphorylation of either Y489 or Y654 reduces the interactions between cadherins and &#x003b2;-catenin, whereas phosphorylation of Y142 reduces interactions between &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roura et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huber and Weis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Piedra et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rhee et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, prior observations indicate that Y654 phosphorylation controls synaptic vesicle localization, spine morphogenesis, AMPA (&#x003b1;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) receptor turnover, and synaptic function. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor&#x02013;stimulated phosphorylation of Y654 reduces cadherin&#x02013;&#x003b2;-catenin association and synaptic vesicle cluster stability and promotes new synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bamji et al., 2006</xref>). Synaptic activity acting through suppression of Cdk5 reduces phosphorylation of Y654, promotes localization of &#x003b2;-catenin to dendritic spines, increases spine size, and enhances synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Murase et al., 2002</xref>). Recently, it has been shown that NMDA (<italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate) receptor&#x02013;dependent long-term depression is mediated through phosphorylation of &#x003b2;-catenin Y654, which results in reduced cadherin&#x02013;&#x003b2;-catenin association and elevated N-cadherin endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tai et al., 2007</xref>). It will be interesting to study whether Fer regulates either AMPA receptor trafficking or NMDA receptor&#x02013;dependent long-term depression.</p><p>It seems unlikely that phosphorylation of Y142, a site that regulates interactions with &#x003b1;-catenin, is involved causally in the regulation of synaptic vesicle localization downstream of Fer. First, we previously demonstrated that deletion of the &#x003b1;-catenin&#x02013;binding site in &#x003b2;-catenin did not prevent synaptic vesicle localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bamji et al., 2003</xref>). Second, although Y142 may be phosphorylated by Fer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Piedra et al., 2003</xref>), we observed increased, not decreased, phosphorylation of &#x003b2;-catenin in Fer-depleted neurons.</p><p>Several phosphatases have been identified in the cadherin complex in various cell types, including SHP-1, SHP-2, PEZ, low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatase, PTP1B, leukocyte common antigen&#x02013;related protein, and RPTP-&#x003bc; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Piedra et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lilien and Balsamo, 2005</xref>). In retina neuroepithelial cells, Fer appears to promote dephosphorylation of &#x003b2;-catenin and cadherin complex integrity through phosphorylation of PTP1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xu et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast, our results indicate that PTP1B is not a major regulator of &#x003b2;-catenin during initial synapse formation by hippocampal neurons. However, we have observed that the knockdown of PTP1B affects the maintenance of the normal synapse number in mature neurons (unpublished data). In developing hippocampal neurons, our data indicate that SHP-2 is an important negative regulator of &#x003b2;-catenin phosphorylation that promotes cadherin complex integrity and presynaptic terminal differentiation. Phosphorylation of Y542 and Y580 on SHP-2 increases the tyrosine phosphatase activity of SHP-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mohi and Neel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pao et al., 2007</xref>). SHP-2 has been shown to be phosphorylated by Fer and to be activated by both phosphorylation and binding of its SH2 domains to other proteins, such as Gab-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kogata et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Our results indicate that both Fer and RhoA bind overlapping sites in the N-terminal domain of p120ctn. Our functional experiments of presynaptic assembly, however, indicate that down-regulation of Rho by p120ctn is not required for presynaptic development. In addition, overexpression of kinase-dead Fer severely impaired localization of synaptic vesicle clusters. Collectively, these observations indicate that the N terminus of p120ctn promotes synaptic terminal differentiation through recruitment of Fer, not Rho. In contrast, our previous experiments on postsynaptic spine morphogenesis demonstrated that p120ctn promotes spine formation and maturation through control of Rho family GTPases as well as enhancement of cadherin stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elia et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, p120ctn has important roles in both pre- and postsynaptic development but promotes differentiation of these two compartments through distinct signaling pathways.</p><p>Finally, although our experiments indicate that Fer acts through SHP-2 to control &#x003b2;-catenin phosphorylation and argue for an important regulatory role of &#x003b2;-catenin in presynaptic differentiation and function, Fer and SHP-2 have been shown to have a diversity of substrates in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ha et al., 2008</xref>). The physiological consequences of presynaptic or postsynaptic &#x003b2;-catenin depletion differ substantially from our observations on synaptic transmission in neurons lacking Fer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bamji et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Okuda et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, localization of Bassoon is impaired in Fer-depleted neurons, although we did not observe an obvious perturbation of Bassoon localization in neurons lacking &#x003b2;-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bamji et al., 2003</xref>). It seems very likely that other downstream targets of Fer in addition to &#x003b2;-catenin will prove important in understanding the role of Fer in synapse differentiation and function.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Reagents and constructs</title><p>Rabbit anti-Fer antiserum was provided by P.
