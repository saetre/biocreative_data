At the physiological concentrations found in saliva, SLPI has a specific antiviral activity against HIV-1 that is related to the perturbation of the virus entry process at a stage posterior to the interaction of the viral surface glycoprotein with the CD4 receptor. Here, we confirm that recombinant SLPI is able to inhibit HIV-1 infection of primary T lymphocytes, and show that SLPI can also inhibit the transfer of HIV-1 virions from primary monocyte-derived dendritic cells to autologous T lymphocytes. At the molecular level, we show that SLPI is a ligand for the phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) and PLSCR4, membrane proteins that are involved in the regulation of the movements of phospholipids between the inner and outer leaflets of the plasma membrane. Interestingly, we reveal that PLSCR1 and PLSCR4 also interact directly with the CD4 receptor at the cell surface of T lymphocytes. We find that the same region of the cytoplasmic domain of PLSCR1 is involved in the binding to CD4 and SLPI. Since SLPI was able to disrupt the association between PLSCR1 and CD4, our data suggest that SLPI inhibits HIV-1 infection by modulating the interaction of the CD4 receptor with PLSCRs. These interactions may constitute new targets for antiviral intervention.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) is a polypeptide of 132 residues (11.7 kDa) secreted by epithelial cells in all the mucous liquids such as saliva, bronchial and nasal secretions, cervical mucus, as well as in the seminal liquid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005006-Thompson1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Like other human and murine scramblases, PLSCR1 shows a type-II membrane organization, and comprises a long cytoplasmic domain of 290 a.a., followed by a single transmembrane helix (a.a. 291&#x02013;309) and a short C-terminal extracellular domain corresponding to the last 9 a.a. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005006-Zhao1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005006-Zhou1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.

At the molecular level, we show that SLPI is a ligand for both PLSCR1 and PLSCR4, and we reveal that PLSCR1 and PLSCR4 interact directly with the CD4 receptor at the cell surface of T lymphocytes. Since the same region of the cytoplasmic domain of PLSCR1 is involved in the binding with CD4 and SLPI, our data suggest a model in which the inhibitory effect of SLPI results from its ability to modulate the interaction of the CD4 receptor with scramblases. The disruption of these interactions between CD4 and scramblases may thus represent new targets for antiviral intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Anti-HIV-1 activity of recombinant SLPI</title><p>In order to further explore its antiviral activity against HIV-1, a recombinant form of SLPI, deleted of the 25 a.a. long signal peptide, and fused to GST (GST-SLPI) was expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and purified on GSH-agarose beads.

Bound proteins were then analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-GFP (upper panels).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0005006.g002"/></fig><p>The specificity of the interaction was also confirmed by biochemical approaches. GST-SLPI(26-132) was first immobilized on GSH-sepharose beads, and then incubated with a lysate from cells expressing GFP-PLSCR1. Bound proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005006-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). GFP-PLSCR1 specifically bound to GST-SLPI, but not to GST or to GST-Arf1 used as negative controls.

To determine whether PLSCR1 was expressed at the plasma membrane in CD4-positive T cells, we first analyzed the cellular distribution of the wild type or truncated forms of PLSCR1 fused to the C-terminus of GFP in Jurkat T cells. After transfection, the cells were fixed and directly examined by fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005006-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). As expected, both the full length GFP-PLSCR1 fusion and the (1&#x02013;310) truncated form, lacking the last 8 C-terminal a.a., were predominantly localized as a rim staining at the plasma membrane (left and central panels, respectively), but a consistent fraction was also observed in an intracellular membrane compartment which largely co-localized with Golgi markers (not shown).

Precipitates were then analyzed by Western blotting with anti-CD4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005006-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, upper panel) and anti-PLSCR1 (lower panel). Endogenous PLSCR1 was detected as a 35-kDa protein only from cell lysate immunoprecipitated with anti-CD4 and not from lysate treated with the control isotypic antibody, demonstrating that PLSCR1 interacts with CD4 in human CD4-positive T-lymphocytes. Interestingly, co-immunoprecipitation experiments performed on 293T cells expressing HA-tagged PLSCR1 in combination with wild type CD4 (WT) or a CD4 mutant lacking the cytoplasmic domain (&#x00394;CT) revealed that the CD4 mutant failed to associate with PLSCR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005006-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). In addition, similar experiments performed in 293T cells showed that PLSCR4 was also able to interact with CD4, and this interaction was again dependant of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005006-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). Since the results reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005006-g004">Figs 4C and 4D</xref> indicated that the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of CD4 (CD4c) was absolutely required to maintain the interactions, we analyzed whether this CD4c domain could be sufficient to associate with PLSCR1 in the two-hybrid system. The 40 a.a. long cytoplasmic domain of CD4 (see on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005006-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>) was thus expressed in the L40 yeast reporter strain as a protein fused with LexA and in combination with the full length PLSCR1 fused to Gal4AD.

However, mutations of the HRF residues found in position 425 to 427 (mutant CD4 HRF/A) did not affect binding to PLSCR1, suggesting that the last 6 residues are essential to maintain the interaction. We could note that the two cysteine residues, that are critical for binding to p56Lck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005006-Zamoyska1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, and data not shown), are not required for binding to PLSCR1 (right panel, mutant CD4 C/S), indicating that the determinants required for interaction with PLSCR1 are different from those involved in the interaction with p56Lck.</p><p>To confirm that the distal region of CD4c was important to support PLSCR1 binding, we developed an ELISA to recapitulate the CD4-PLSCR1 interaction <italic>in vitro</italic>.

Again, the cysteine residues directly involved in p56Lck binding were not required for PLSCR1 binding, since the CD4c peptides had alanine at these positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005006-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>).

Initially revealed from a genetic two-hybrid screening performed to identify SLPI binding proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005006-Tseng1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, we confirm the specificity of the interaction with PLSCR1 by biochemical approaches, and reveal that SLPI also binds to PLSCR4, another member of the scramblase family. Since PLSCR1 is a type II integral membrane protein, we show that SLPI directly binds to a region of PLSCR1 located in the central part of its long cytoplasmic domain. Moreover, we demonstrate that PLSCR1, and also PLSCR4, can interact directly with CD4, the main receptor required for HIV-1 entry into its target cells, such as T lymphocytes and macrophages. These interactions are mediated by determinants found in the cytoplasmic domains of these integral membrane proteins. Interestingly, we demonstrate that CD4 and SLPI bind to the same region of the cytoplasmic domain of PLSCR1 (a.a. 155&#x02013;233). Finally, we show that SLPI competes with CD4 thus modulating its interaction with PLSCR1.</p><p>While recent works focused on the biological functions of PLSCR1, nothing is known regarding the subcellular localization and the functions of PLSCR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005006-Sahu1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, for review). PLSCR1 was originally identified as a membrane protein that promoted acceleration of transbilayer phospholipid movements in response to intracellular calcium, but increasing evidence indicates that PLSCR1 also has biological roles in cell signaling pathways. PLSCR1 has been shown to be engaged when cells are activated through several plasma membrane receptors, including the epidermal growth factor receptor and the high-affinity IgE receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005006-Pastorelli1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. The long cytoplasmic domain of PLSCR1 contains multiple proline-rich motifs within its N-terminal distal region, and these motifs may constitute Src-homology 3 (SH3) domain binding sites, as revealed by the interaction of PLSCR1 with the SH3 domain of the c-Abl tyrosine kinase that in turn phosphorylates PLSCR1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005006-Sun1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the determinants of PLSCR1 required for SLPI binding are located in the central region of the cytoplasmic tail containing cysteine-rich motifs. The minimal part of PLSCR1 sufficient to mediate interaction with SLPI, and with the CD4 receptor (see below), was mapped within a 79 a.a. long region comprised between residues 155 and 233. This region of PLSCR1 contains the cysteine cluster that forms a site for palmitoylation involved in the stabilization of the membrane anchoring of PLSCR1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005006-Wiedmer2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, and this cluster is conserved in PLSCR4. However, substitution of the 6 cysteine residues (Cys184 to Cys189) did not disturb the capacity of PLSCR1 to interact with either SLPI or CD4, indicating that the palmitoylation motif does not directly participate in these interactions. These cysteine residues may indirectly participate since palmitoylation is required for membrane expression of PLSCR1 which, when mutated, is found in the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005006-Chen1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, we found that both PLSCR3 and PLSCR4 are primarily localized at the plasma membrane of T cells when they are expressed as GFP fusions. SLPI, which is secreted in the extracellular medium, therefore needs to cross the plasma membrane for efficient binding to the endofacial domain of PLSCR1 and PLSCR4. It has been recently documented that recombinant SLPI can be translocated through the plasma membrane to reach the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells such as monocytes, macrophages and B lymphocytes where it interacts with cellular effectors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005006-Taggart1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005006-Xu1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005006-Samsom1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>; similarly, we confirmed that the purified GST-SLPI fusion protein used in the present study was also able to penetrate into the cells from the culture medium (data not shown).</p><p>While elafin is formed by a single WAP motif and interacted weakly with PLSCR1, SLPI contains two WAP motifs and each motif was able to support binding to PLSCR1, indicating that both domains may cooperate in an additive manner leading to an optimal interaction with PLSCR1. This also suggests that PLSCR1 binding is not mediated by a linear motif contained within the SLPI primary sequence, but is rather related to the recognition of the conformational structure of the WAP domains. Like other members of the WAP family proteins, SLPI is secreted by epithelial cells and is thus found in all mucosal fluids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005006-Thompson1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, for review). However, more recent studies have revealed that SLPI can be also produced and secreted by cells of the immune system, including neutrophils, B lymphocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005006-Samsom1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005006-Jin1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. This suggests that exogenous SLPI functions as more than a protease inhibitor of leukocyte serine proteases for the protection of tissues at sites of inflammation, but it also participates as an intracellular modulator in some signaling transduction pathways. Similarly, our observations suggest that SLPI is an intracellular ligand which may participate in the modulation of the PLSCR1 and PLSCR4 functions by interacting directly with their cytoplasmic tail.</p><p>The antiviral activity of SLPI against HIV-1 has been documented in several reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005006-Skott1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005006-McNeely2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005006-Shugars1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. SLPI is able to inhibit the replication of primary viral strains both in human primary CD4-positive T lymphocytes and in monocyte-derived macrophages at the physiological concentrations found in saliva (20&#x02013;120 &#x000b5;g/ml). In addition, we show here that SLPI is also able to inhibit the capture of HIV-1 virions from dendritic cells derived from primary blood monocytes and then the transfer of virions towards autologous T lymphocytes, a process which is important <italic>in vivo</italic> for spreading of the virus after mucosal transmission (for review, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005006-Wilflingseder1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>). This inhibitory activity is exerted on viral strains with tropism for either lymphocytes or macrophages. The inhibition of HIV-1 replication by SLPI is independent of its anti-protease activity, does not involve a direct action on virus particles, and is related to a block of the virus entry process at a stage that is posterior to the interaction of the viral gp120 envelope glycoprotein with the CD4 receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005006-Ma1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005006-McNeely2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

In this context, our findings raise a new hypothesis concerning the molecular mechanism of antiviral activity of SLPI.

Although the functions of the interactions of CD4 with PLSCR1 and PLSCR4 in the biology of lymphoid or myeloid cells expressing CD4, as well as in the HIV-1 infection process, remain to be elucidated, the demonstration that the CD4 receptor associates directly with PLSCR1 and PLSCR4 may represent a critical point for the understanding of the antiviral activity of SLPI.

We hypothesize that the data generated herein will help to the development of new antiviral strategies, and we are currently looking to identify chemical compounds disrupting the interaction between CD4 and PLSCR1 by conducting a high throughput screen using the ELISA test developed in the present study (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005006-g006">Fig. 6</xref>) as a primary interaction assay that recapitulates <italic>in vitro</italic> the association of CD4 with scramblases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plasmids</title><sec id="s4a1"><title>Yeast expression vectors</title><p>The vector for expression of the cytoplasmic domain of CD4 fused to LexA has been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005006-Py1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.
