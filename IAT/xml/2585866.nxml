At present, the structures and mechanisms responsible for Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sensing remain unknown. Here, we have used a combination of molecular modeling, density functional&#x02013;binding energy calculations, mutagenesis, and patch clamp to identify the regions of hBest1 involved in Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sensing. We identified a cluster of a five contiguous acidic amino acids in the C terminus immediately after the last transmembrane domain, followed by an EF hand and another regulatory domain that are essential for Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sensing by hBest1. The cluster of five amino acids (293&#x02013;308) is crucial for normal channel gating by Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> because all but two of the 35 mutations we made in this region rendered the channel incapable of being activated by Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. Using homology models built on the crystal structure of calmodulin (CaM), an EF hand (EF1) was identified in hBest1. EF1 was predicted to bind Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> with a slightly higher affinity than the third EF hand of CaM and lower affinity than the second EF hand of troponin C. As predicted by the model, the D312G mutation in the putative Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding loop (312&#x02013;323) reduced the apparent Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> affinity by 20-fold. In addition, the D312G and D323N mutations abolished Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent rundown of the current. Furthermore, analysis of truncation mutants of hBest1 identified a domain adjacent to EF1 that is rich in acidic amino acids (350&#x02013;390) that is required for Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> activation and plays a role in current rundown. These experiments identify a region of hBest1 (312&#x02013;323) that is involved in the gating of hBest1 by Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and suggest a model in which Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> binding to EF1 activates the channel in a process that requires the acidic domain (293&#x02013;308) and another regulatory domain (350&#x02013;390). Many of the &#x0223c;100 disease-causing mutations in hBest1 are located in this region that we have implicated in Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sensing, suggesting that these mutations disrupt hBest1 channel gating by Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: BK, large-conductance Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-activated K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>; CaM, calmodulin; hBest1, human bestrophin-1; RCK, regulator of conductance for K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>; TnC, Troponin C.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Mutations in human bestrophin-1 (hBest1) have been shown to be responsible for several retinopathies including Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Petrukhin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Marquardt et al., 1998</xref>), adult-onset macular dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Seddon et al., 2001</xref>), autosomal dominant vitreochoidopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yardley et al., 2004</xref>), autosomal recessive bestrophinopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burgess et al., 2008</xref>), and canine multifocal retinopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guziewicz et al., 2007</xref>). hBest1 is a Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> ion channel that is activated by intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> with a K<sub>d</sub> of &#x0223c;150 nM (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hartzell et al., 2008</xref>). The structures and mechanisms responsible for Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sensitivity, however, remain unknown. It seems likely that activation of the bestrophin channel is mediated by Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> binding directly to the channel or to an accessory Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding subunit, such as calmodulin (CaM), because channels are activated in excised patches containing hBest4 or dBest1 in the absence of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chien et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tsunenari et al., 2006</xref>). In this article, we focus on the potential role of a conserved region in the cytoplasmic C terminus immediately after the last predicted transmembrane domain in regulation of hBest1 by Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>.</p><p>The most common and well-understood kind of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding sites in proteins are EF hand motifs (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nelson and Chazin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lewit-Bentley and Rety, 2000</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gifford et al., 2007</xref>). These are subdivided into the canonical EF hand as found in the CaM family and the pseudo&#x02013;EF hand structures as found in the S100-like family. The Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding loop of the canonical EF hand is formed primarily by side chain oxygens, whereas the pseudo&#x02013;EF hand Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding site is formed primarily by backbone carbonyl oxygens. In addition, there are other Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding motifs, like the C2 domain, which have a less well-defined primary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brose et al., 1995</xref>). The fact that Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> can be coordinated by backbone carbonyl oxygens as well as by side chain oxygens means that at the present time prediction of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding sites from primary sequence data is challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhou et al., 2006</xref>). In any case, there are no obvious canonical EF hand motifs detected in hBest1 by motif-searching algorithms such as Pfam 22 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/">http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/</ext-link>).</p><p>In trying to fathom the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding site of bestrophins, it has been noted that bestrophins exhibit a highly conserved region immediately after the last predicted transmembrane domain that contains a high concentration of acidic amino acids that might be involved in Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> binding (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tsunenari et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hartzell et al., 2008</xref>). This region exhibits some similarity to the &#x0201c;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> bowl&#x0201d; of the large-conductance Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-activated K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (BK) channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schreiber and Salkoff, 1997</xref>). The Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> bowl was originally defined as a contiguous 28&#x02013;amino acid sequence rich in negatively charged amino acids (glutamate and aspartate) and other amino acids with oxygen-containing side chains (asparagine or glutamine) that could coordinate Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. There is compelling data that the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> bowl is involved in Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sensing by the BK channel. This region directly binds Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bian et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Braun and Sy, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bao et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sheng et al., 2005</xref>), and replacing the five aspartic acids in the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> bowl with asparagines significantly reduces the regulation of the channel by Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, especially at low Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schreiber and Salkoff, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bian et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xia et al., 2002</xref>). Furthermore, a transplanted Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> bowl can confer Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sensitivity to a Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-insensitive K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schreiber et al., 1999</xref>). However, the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> bowl is only one of several loci involved in BK channel regulation by divalent cations. Each BK channel subunit contains two interacting regulator of conductance for K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (RCK) domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Qian et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yusifov et al., 2008</xref>). The Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> bowl is located in RCK2, but several acidic amino acids in RCK1 contribute significantly to Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shi and Cui, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xia et al., 2002</xref>). The role of RCK domains in channel gating has been advanced by the crystallization of a bacterial Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-activated K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channel, MthK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jiang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Qian et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lingle, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yusifov et al., 2008</xref>). In MthK, Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> is thought to open the channel by binding to an octameric assembly of RCK domains. It is proposed that RCK1 and RCK2 interact via the &#x003b1;G-helix turn &#x003b1;F-helix to gate the channel. In addition to the RCK domains, it has also been suggested that there is a potential EF hand&#x02013;like structure adjacent to the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> bowl, but mutation of key Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-coordinating residues in the putative EF hand has small effect compared with mutations in the downstream acidic residues of the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> bowl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Braun and Sy, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sheng et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The acidic domain of the bestrophins resembles the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> bowl in that it contains five contiguous acidic residues (EDDDD) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). This acidic region is adjacent to a region that we believe may resemble a Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding EF hand. We have mutated amino acids in this region in an attempt to define the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding motif of hBest1. We find that this acidic cluster, the predicted EF hand, and another nearby acidic amino acid&#x02013;rich domain are involved in Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent regulation of hBest1. Because many disease-causing mutations in hBest1 are located in this region, we conclude that this region is crucial for gating the channel by Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Constructs and Molecular Biology</title><p>hBest1 tagged with the myc epitope at the C terminus in pRK5 was obtained from J.

Voltage ramps from &#x02212;100 to &#x0002b;100 mV with a duration of 750 msec were given from a holding potential of 0 mV at 10-s intervals. Data analyses were done with Clampfit 9 (MDS Analytical Technologies) and Origin 7 software. The time constant of current rundown was determined by fitting the change in current amplitude with time to a single exponential, using data points after the current had reached a maximum. Because rundown may occur simultaneously with current activation, it is possible that the peak current in the absence of rundown would be larger than measured. We did not correct the peak currents for rundown because we do not know whether rundown begins immediately or whether there is some lag. All averaged data are presented as the mean &#x000b1; SEM.

Both hBest1 segments have similarity to the BK Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> bowl in that they contain five contiguous acidic amino acids (positions 300&#x02013;304 and 380&#x02013;384) flanked by several additional acidic residues. We have previously referred to the first group of acidic amino acids as the &#x0201c;acidic cluster&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hartzell et al., 2008</xref>), and this region was proposed as a potential Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding site by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tsunenari et al., (2006)</xref>. Here, we have made point mutations in 20 amino acids between 293 and 323, with a focus on the acidic cluster and the region immediately after it (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Each amino acid was mutated to at least one other amino acid. All mutations except at positions 298, 307, 312, 316, 320, and 323 produced channels that were essentially nonfunctional. The acidic domain (293&#x02013;308) in particular was very sensitive to mutation. Only two (F298W and T307S) of the 35 mutations (not all are depicted) in this region produced functional channels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). The high sensitivity of this region to mutation suggests that, like the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> bowl in the BK channel, the acidic cluster in hBest1 is extremely important in channel gating. To determine whether mutations in the acidic cluster altered protein expression or trafficking, we measured the amount of protein on the plasma membrane by cell surface biotinylation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). These data show that, at least qualitatively, mutations in the acidic domain did not significantly alter protein expression or trafficking.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Effects of mutations in the hBest1 C terminus on channel function.

The difference is likely explained by different methods for calculating the effects of water solvation: we used Poisson-Boltzmann water solvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tannor et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Marten et al., 1996</xref>), whereas Lepsik and Field used COSMO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lepsik and Field, 2007</xref>). Preliminary calculations of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding energy for the third CaM EF hand using our methodology without solvation gave a binding energy of &#x0223c;400 kcal/mol, which is similar to the value of 200&#x02013;300 kcal/mol calculated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lepsik and Field (2007)</xref>. This suggests that our solvation method may more fully account for the electrostatic screening effect of water.</p><p>To test our method further, we calculated the binding affinities of the first and second EF hands of TnC. The second EF hand of TnC is known to bind Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, whereas the first EF hand does not. The corrected binding energies for the TnC structures are &#x02212;19.0 kcal/mol for the second EF hand and 37.2 kcal/mol for the first EF hand, correctly indicating that Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> binding is highly favorable for the second EF hand, but disfavored for the first EF hand.</p><p>These results suggest that hBest1 binds Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> with an affinity similar to CaM, despite having one interaction with a carbonyl oxygen instead of a carboxyl oxygen as seen in CaM. Small differences in binding energy are probably not meaningful because of certain assumptions we used in model building. Most notably, we assumed that the conformation of the E- and F-helices in hBest1 were similar to those in CaM and constrained these residues during minimization. Nonetheless, the models do provide a structural context for a likely site of Ca<sup>2</sup> binding in hBest1 and in general are consistent with experimental results.</p><p>To determine whether mutations in the putative EF hand loop of hBest1 had an effect on Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> affinity, a structural model of the hBest1 EF hand with the D312G mutation was developed from the wild-type model and refined as described above (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). This mutation would be expected to reduce the binding affinity of hBest1 for Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> based on the mutation removing the D1 carboxylate interaction with Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. The effect of the D312G mutation on Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding energy was predicted using the same density functional method as above, resulting in a corrected binding energy of 6.6 kcal/mol, indicating that Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> binding is unfavorable, compared with &#x02212;6.0 kcal/mol for wild-type hBest1. When the explicit water was added to this model, the binding energy was estimated to be &#x02212;2.4 kcal/mol.

However, deletion of amino acids 380&#x02013;384 (EDEED) or 380&#x02013;389 (EDEEDAHAG) or substitution of amino acids 380&#x02013;384 (EDEED) with alanines (AAAAA) had no significant effect on current rundown or amplitude (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10, A and B</xref>).

These experiments demonstrate that at least three different regions collaborate in gating hBest1 by Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>: an EF hand&#x02013;like domain (EF1), the first acidic cluster located in the cytosolic C terminus adjacent to the last transmembrane domain, and the second acidic region C terminal to EF1. Gating of hBest1 by Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> can be explained entirely by this region because hBest1 lacking the C terminus after amino acid 390 behaves identically to wild type, suggesting that no other Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding site in the C terminus is required for channel function.</p><sec><title>An EF Hand (EF1) Is a Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding Site</title><p>We conclude that EF1 is a key part of the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding site in hBest1 because mutation of amino acids in the predicted Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding loop of EF1 drastically alters the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sensitivity of the channel as well as Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent rundown. The decrease in Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sensitivity produced by these mutations is predicted by density-functional binding energy calculations of the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding loop.</p><p>hBest1 EF1 shares important characteristics with canonical EF hand Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding loops. The canonical EF hand consists of 29 contiguous amino acids containing helix-E, a loop around the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ion, and helix-F. The Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding loop is formed by side chain oxygens from loop residues 1, 3, 5, and 12 and backbone carbonyl oxygens from residue 7 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Residue 1 in the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding loop is an invariant asparate, and the carboxylate group of the side chain plays an essential role in coordinating Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. The mutations we made in the corresponding amino acid in hBest1 (D312N and D312G) significantly altered the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sensitivity of the channel. Residue 12 provides two oxygen ligands, usually from glutamate, but sometimes aspartate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gifford et al., 2007</xref>), as it is in hBest1. Replacing the aspartate in the 12th position of hBest1 EF1 with alanine completely abolished channel activation by Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. The more conservative D323N mutation significantly reduced channel rundown, suggesting an important role of this position in Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-mediated channel function. Mutations at position 3 in the hBest1 EF1 loop (N314D, N314T, and N314A) resulted in nonfunctional channels, suggesting that this position is also critical in Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> coordination. Position 5 in many EF hands is glycine and may be important in allowing flexibility in the loop so that other residues can adopt energetically favorable orientations for coordinating Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. In hBest1, position 5 is not a glycine, but rather glutamine. Mutations at this position (Q316A and Q316N) had no significant effects on channel activation or rundown compared with wild type. Residue 7 coordinates Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> via a backbone carbonyl oxygen in both canonical EF hands and hBest1 EF1. In most EF hands, the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> oxygen distances are between 2 and 3 &#x000c5; and there are between five and eight oxygens per Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pidcock and Moore, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yang et al., 2002</xref>). In this regard, our hBest1 model fits the requirements for a Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding loop.</p></sec><sec><title>The Acidic Clusters</title><p>Mutation of the first acidic cluster of amino acids in hBest1 results in channels that cannot be activated by Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. The nonfunction of these channels is not explained simply by expression or trafficking defects, suggesting that this region of the protein is important either in sensing or responding to Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. The location of this region immediately after the last predicted transmembrane domain suggests that it may be important in channel gating. Amino acids flanking the acidic cluster are also very important in channel gating because mutations of most of the amino acids between position 293 and 306 produce nonfunctional channels.</p><p>Our data shows that there is a second acidic region that is important in Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent channel rundown. This region is located between amino acids 370 and 390. In this region, there are eight acidic amino acids and three additional amino acids with oxygen-containing side chains. Although it was possible to forcibly align and homology-model this region as an EF hand, it seems unlikely that this region binds Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> for several reasons. First, density-functional calculations predicted that Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> binding to this region was not favorable. Furthermore, deletion or neutralization of potential Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-coordinating amino acids (amino acids with oxygen-containing side chains: <sub>380</sub>EDEED<sub>384</sub>, N369A, E371, Q376, and E380) had no effect on Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sensitivity or rundown of the channel. However, it is tempting to speculate that this region may be a nonfunctional EF hand. EF hands are often found as pairs and form a four-helix bundle that exhibits cooperativity in Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lewit-Bentley and Rety, 2000</xref>). In some proteins, such as TnC, one of the paired EF hands is incapable of binding Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, but binding of a single Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ion is sufficient to activate the protein. Proteins having an unpaired EF hand frequently dimerize, resulting in intermolecular coupling of the EF hands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yap et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ravulapalli et al., 2005</xref>). The high cooperativity (n<sub>H</sub> &#x0223c;4) of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> binding that we observe could be a consequence of multimerization of bestrophins, which have been suggested to exist as dimers or tetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sun et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stanton et al., 2006</xref>). The observation that n<sub>H</sub> of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> activation decreases from 4 to &#x0223c;1 with the D312G mutation supports the idea that EF1 normally binds Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> in a cooperative fashion.</p></sec><sec><title>Mechanism of Channel Activation and Rundown</title><p>Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-activated hBest1 current shows an activation phase and rundown phase, suggesting that hBest1 channels have at least three states: closed (no Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> bound), open (Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> bound), and inactivated (rundown). hBest1 current is activated by Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> with a very high affinity (EC<sub>50</sub> &#x0003d; 141 nM), showing that the closed state has a high affinity for Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. Binding of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> induces a conformational change to an open state, but in addition somehow regulates the acidic domain between amino acids 370&#x02013;390 to produce channel rundown. We have little insight into the actual mechanisms of rundown, but interestingly, amino acids 354&#x02013;362 of hBest1, located between EF1 and the second acidic domain, correspond to the region we have previously identified as a regulatory domain in Best3. This region contains a serine that is a predicted PKA/PKC phosphorylation site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Qu et al., 2006b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2007</xref>). This domain may also participate in channel regulation by Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, maybe by a process involving phosphorylation.</p><p>Molecular modeling shows that the D312G mutant requires higher energy to bind Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. Thus, binding of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> may not induce a full open-state channel and rundown may be thwarted. The smaller current amplitude of D312G mutant supports this possibility. Such a partially activated conformation has been reported in the EF hand of myosin light chain (PDB code, 1WDC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Houdusse et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Houdusse and Cohen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nelson and Chazin, 1998</xref>). The channel could be locked in this state due to insufficient energy to switch into the inactivated state.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>Supported by National Institutes of Health grants GM60448 and EY014852.</p><p>Edward N.
