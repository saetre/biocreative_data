The silencing machinery can be stopped by chromatin boundary elements. We performed a screen in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> for proteins that may contribute to the establishment of a chromatin boundary. We found that disruption of histone deacetylase Rpd3p results in defective boundary activity, leading to a Sir-dependent local propagation of transcriptional repression. In <italic>rpd3&#x00394;</italic> cells, the amount of Sir2p that was normally found in the nucleolus decreased and the amount of Sir2p found at telomeres and at HM and its adjacent loci increased, leading to an extension of silent chromatin in those areas. In addition, Rpd3p interacted directly with chromatin at boundary regions to deacetylate histone H4 at lysine 5 and at lysine 12. Either the mutation of histone H4 at lysine 5 or a decrease in the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity of Esa1p abrogated the silencing phenotype associated with <italic>rpd3</italic> mutation, suggesting a novel role for the H4 amino terminus in Rpd3p-mediated heterochromatin boundary regulation. Together, these data provide insight into the molecular mechanisms for the anti-silencing functions of Rpd3p during the formation of heterochromatin boundaries.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The eukaryotic genome is organized into chromosomal domains of distinct structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). The fraction of chromatin that condenses during mitosis and is found decondensed during the interphase of the cell cycle is termed euchromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). In contrast, constitutively compacted chromatin often found at locations like centromeres and telomeres is called heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). In general, euchromatic domains bear transcriptionally active genes, whereas heterochromatic domains are largely inactive transcriptionally, leading to a silencing position effect on genes in the heterochromatic region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Heterochromatin forms a nuclease-resistant structure that can propagate along the chromosome and repress nearby genes in a stochastic manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Boundary elements are often found between heterochromatic and euchromatic regions. The prevailing view of boundary elements, or insulators, is that they are specific DNA elements that actively recruit barrier proteins to inhibit the spread of silent chromatin into euchromatic regions, thereby insulating a euchromatic gene from the influence of silent chromatin that could spread into that transcriptionally active region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10">8&#x02013;10</xref>). Some boundary elements can constitutively recruit epigenetic modification machineries, acting as a chain terminator to the spreading of a repressive chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13 B14 B15">11&#x02013;15</xref>). Other chromatin boundaries are defined by a gradient of chromatin modifications, such as differing degrees of histone hyperacetylation or hypoacetylation on opposing sides of the resulting boundary element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16 B17 B18">16&#x02013;18</xref>). Positions of boundary elements can vary depending on the balance of chromatin modifications resulting from the sum of activities of different enzymatic proteins or complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p><p>The mating loci <italic>HMR</italic> and <italic>HML</italic> and the telomeres of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> are well-characterized silenced chromatin domains that provide distinctive models for studying the formation of heterochromatin structure and the establishment of chromatin boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Heterochromatin propagation depends on the roles of <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements, such as the telomeric DNA repeats and the sites flanking each <italic>HM</italic> locus that are known as silencers, as well as <italic>trans</italic>-acting proteins like the silent information regulator (Sir) complex of proteins and specific silencer-binding or telomere-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The Sir complex, which contains Sir2p, Sir3p and Sir4p, is recruited by DNA-binding proteins that interact directly with the <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements. The Sir complex then propagates along an array of nucleosomes. Current evidence supports a sequential assembly model for Sir spreading where the histone deacetylase (HDAC) Sir2p removes acetyl groups from lysines on nearby nucleosomal histone tails and this promotes the direct binding of Sir3p and Sir4p to histone H3 and H4 N-terminal tails, with the Sir complex showing a preference for interacting with the hypoacetylated H4 tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Studies on the chromatin boundary activity that restricts Sir-dependent spreading of heterochromatin indicate that numerous proteins associated with histone modification or chromatin remodeling, including Sas2p, Gcn5p, Bdf1p and H2A.Z, are involved in blocking gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24 B25 B26">24&#x02013;26</xref>). Since the extent of histone acetylation is increased in transcriptionally active regions, acetylated histones are believed to facilitate an open and loose form of chromatin. A model where increased histone acetylation leads to the formation of euchromatin and prevents the spreading of silent chromatin is supported by several lines of experimental evidence. For example, histone acetyltransferase (HAT) Sas2p and the HDAC Sir2p compete to acetylate and deacetylate yeast histone H4K16, respectively, and the acetylation status of this lysine affects spreading of heterochromatin through a DNA sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Additionally, the HATs Esa1p and/or Gcn5p create a sizable region of hyperacetylated chromatin which serves as a barrier that can inhibit the propagation of silenced chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the established transcription repression roles associated with HDACs, the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Rpd3p, which is a class I HDAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), appears to be required for transcriptional activation of specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28 B29 B30">28&#x02013;30</xref>). Deletion of <italic>RPD3</italic> enhances the silencing of reporter genes inserted into ribosomal DNA (rDNA), the silent mating type locus and subtelomeric loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Interestingly, when <italic>RPD3</italic> and <italic>SIR2</italic> (or <italic>SIR4</italic>) are simultaneously deleted, the expression of reporter genes were restored to wild-type levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). A genome-wide transcription profile of <italic>rpd3&#x00394;</italic> cells also demonstrated that &#x0223c;40% of endogenous genes located within 20&#x02009;kb of telomeres are down-regulated by the <italic>RPD3</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). These lines of evidence support a model where Rpd3p may antagonize the local spread of Sir-mediated silencing from heterochromatin to neighboring euchromatic regions, thus helping to define a heterochromatin boundary. How Rpd3p might function to establish and maintain this heterochromatin boundary remains elusive.</p><p>In this study, we performed a screen for genes that affect chromatin boundary activity. Our genetic and biochemical evidence show that the absence of Rpd3p results in Sir-dependent repression of heterochromatin-adjacent regions. In an <italic>rpd3&#x00394;</italic> mutant, we found that a portion of Sir2p was delocalized from nucleolus and became enriched at the regions of DNA adjacent to telomeres and the silent <italic>HM</italic> loci. Mutation of either histone H4 at K5 or the HAT gene <italic>ESA1</italic> compromised the silencing phenotype associated with <italic>RPD3</italic> disruption. The data presented in this manuscript provide insight into the molecular mechanism for the antagonizing&#x02013;silencing functions of Rpd3p during the formation of heterochromatic boundaries.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids and yeast strains</title><p>Plasmids used in this study are listed as following.

The results described above suggested that Rpd3p is required for defining the boundaries that block the Sir-dependent propagation of silent chromatin. To address how Rpd3p might affect Sir2p's ability to regulate silencing propagation at telomeres and <italic>HM</italic> loci, the immunolocalization of 13Myc&#x02013;Sir2p was examined in fixed wild-type and <italic>rpd3&#x00394;</italic> yeast cells using anti-Myc antibody.

The punctuated Sir2p staining, but not the nucleolar signal, has been previously shown to co-localize with the telomere-binding protein marker Rap1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>), as indicated by the white arrows in the merging image of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A.

Instead, the non-nucleolar staining of Sir2p was significantly enhanced and some of these enhanced regions had Sir2p that co-localized with Rap1p. Simultaneous immunostaining of Sir2p and Nop1p showed an intact nucleolus in the <italic>rpd3&#x00394;</italic> mutant, and co-localization of Sir2p and Nop1p was dramatically weakened by the <italic>RPD3</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C and D), suggesting the nucleolus was intact but Sir2p had moved away from the nucleolus. In <italic>rsc1</italic> or <italic>gcn5</italic> deletion mutant cells, the Sir2p distribution was very similar to that in wild-type cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp233/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1A, B and C</ext-link>), suggesting the change in sub-nuclear localization for Sir2p was specifically dependent upon deletion of <italic>RPD3</italic>. In summary, we found cells deficient for Rpd3p displayed a great amount of Sir2p release from the nucleolus and redistribution to other sub-nuclear loci like telomeres and their adjacent euchromatic regions.

We found that deletion of <italic>RPD3</italic> led to an overall increase in the acetylation of H3 and H4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). More specifically, deletion of <italic>RPD3</italic> led to hyperacetylation of histone H4 at K5 and K12 when compared to wild-type cells; however, H4 acetylation at K8 and K16 were less affected by the <italic>rpd3&#x00394;</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). These results suggest that Rpd3p has a preference for deacetylating H4K5 and H4K12. A ChIP analysis revealed that Rpd3p bound directly to the silent mating type cassette, as well as to the subtelomeric regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B and C and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp233/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2A</ext-link>). Inactivation of Rpd3 deacetylase resulted in an increase in the DNA bound by H4K5Ac and H4K12Ac in the boundary regions but did not show an increase in DNA bound by H4K8Ac in those same regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D and E and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp233/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2B</ext-link>). Together, these findings support a model where Rpd3p or the Rpd3 complex binds to boundary regions to deacetylate histone H4K5 and/or K12, and thus regulates boundary formation directly; however, we could not exclude the possibility that the enhanced acetylation of H4K5 at the subtelomere regions in <italic>rpd3&#x00394;</italic> cells reflects the de-repression of genes in these chromosomal loci. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Rpd3p interacts with chromatin at boundary regions to deacetylate histone H4K5 and K12.

The telomere silencing assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A) showed that the growth of H4 K5Q, H4 K12Q or H4 K5,12Q mutants were indistinguishable from that of the wild-type cells, suggesting these mutations did not affect cell viability.

Additionally, immunolocalization studies of Sir2p showed that in H4 K5Q <italic>rpd3&#x00394;</italic> cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp233/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1F</ext-link>, compared with the H4 wild-type cells in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp233/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1E</ext-link>), most of the Sir2p signal was congregated in the nucleolus instead of diffused within the nucleus as we observed in the <italic>rpd3&#x00394;</italic> cells with wild-type histone proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B and D). These observations indicate that deacetylation of H4K5 by Rpd3p is likely required for restricting the spread of Sir2p into previously euchromatic regions and is important for antagonizing heterochromatic silencing.</p><p>To further validate the dependence of Rpd3p's anti-silencing role on deacetylation of H4K5, we employed the <italic>esa1</italic>(L327S) mutant of Esa1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>) in <italic>rpd3&#x00394;</italic> cells. Esa1p is a HAT that principally acetylates histone H4K5 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). The <italic>esa1</italic>(L327S) mutant in the S288c strain background was temperature sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>), but this mutant in the BY4742 strain background did not exhibit any growth defect at either 30&#x000b0;C or 37&#x000b0;C. At 30&#x000b0;C, the <italic>esa1</italic>(L327S) mutation caused a specific decrease in the amount of acetylated H4K5 that could not be attributed to an overall decrease in H4 levels because these remained constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>E). Additionally, at 30&#x000b0;C, the <italic>esa1</italic> (L327S) inhibited <italic>rpd3&#x00394;</italic> cell growth on the 5&#x02032;-FOA plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>F).

These results indicated that the increased telomere silencing associated with <italic>RPD3</italic> deletion is compromised by inactivation of a HAT, namely Esa1p, that acetylates H4K5.</p></sec><sec><title>Disruption of Rpd3p enhances deposition of H2A.Z at boundary loci</title><p>Previous studies indicated that the histone variant H2A.Z is an intrinsic component of euchromatin and functions to antagonize the formation of Sir-dependent heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). We wondered whether there was crosstalk between Rpd3p and H2A.Z in the anti-silencing process. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, in the <italic>rpd3&#x00394;</italic> mutant, the amount of H2A.Z found at both sides of the <italic>HMR</italic>-proximal boundary region was dramatically increased, suggesting that H2A.Z serves as an alternative mechanism to stop the spreading of silent chromatin in the absence of Rpd3p.

Sir2p is a central component of the repressive Sir complex, and its deacetylase activity is required for Sir spreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). Sir2p is mainly localized to two distinct sub-nuclear domains, the telomere and the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). The nucleolus has been proposed to serve as a reservoir for Sir2p storage, competing with subtelomeric regions and <italic>HM</italic> loci for a limiting supply of Sir2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>). In the current study, we found that in <italic>rpd3&#x00394;</italic> cells, a portion of Sir2p was delocalized from nucleolus and was consequentially enriched at the ectopic silencing regions found at telomeres and at <italic>HM</italic> and their adjacent loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). This observation is in agreement with a Sir2p&#x02013;Rpd3 competition hypothesis and is consistent with previous reports by the Boeke and Hampsey laboratories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>). Paradoxically, the decrease of rDNA-associated Sir2p causes a deficiency of rDNA silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>) but in <italic>rpd3&#x00394;</italic> cells the reduction of rDNA-associated Sir2p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) does not weaken, but rather enhances rDNA silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>). Since not all the Sir2p is lost from the nucleolus and rDNA, it is possible that the remaining Sir2p in <italic>rpd3&#x00394;</italic> cells at rDNA loci is sufficient and responsible for the maintenance of rDNA silencing. Alternatively, HDAC Rpd3p may act directly on histones in the rDNA to regulate rDNA silencing, and the consequential improvement of rDNA silencing in <italic>rpd3</italic> deletion cells could be attributed to an increase of histone acetylation as well as some Sir2p remaining in the rDNA loci.</p><p>The K5Q mutation in histone H4 compromised the enhanced telomere position effect in <italic>rpd3&#x00394;</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A and B). Interestingly, the H4K12Q mutation could not attenuate <italic>rpd3&#x00394;</italic>-associated repression, while double mutation of H4 K5,12Q decreased the <italic>rpd3&#x00394;</italic>-associated repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A), suggesting that H4K12 is not as important as H4K5 for mediating the anti-silencing affects of Rpd3p. Considering that H4K5 is one of the principle targets of Rpd3p, it is conceivable that boundary formation in the subtelomeric and <italic>HMR</italic> regions requires H4K5 deacetylation; however, it is difficult to rationalize how an increase in H4 acetylation would be important for the establishment of heterochromatin. Previously completed <italic>in vivo</italic> formaldehyde cross-linking experiments have demonstrated that Sir2p can bind indirectly to chromatin far from telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>), forming a weaker and more transient protein-protein interaction within euchromatic regions. Rpd3p was also associated with the subtelomeric regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). Based on these data, we speculate that both Rpd3p and Sir2p compete for chromatin binding at subtelomeric boundary regions. When Rpd3p was present, the acetylation level of histone H4K5 was negatively regulated by Rpd3p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, D and E), and the Sir2-dependent propagation of silent chromatin was prohibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A&#x02013;D). When Rpd3p was absent, an increase of H4K5 acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, D and E) would have facilitated Sir2p binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C and D). In support of this model, we found that mutation of H4K5 decreased Sir2p binding in <italic>rpd3&#x00394;</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C and D) and mutation of <italic>ESA1</italic> [i.e. <italic>esa1</italic>(L327S)] in <italic>rpd3&#x00394;</italic> cells restored telomere position effect (TPE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>F). Consistently, deletion of Rpd3 caused redistribution of Sir2 from the nucleolus to the telomeres and HM loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). However, the mechanism as to how the increase of H4 acetylation caused by Rpd3 inactivation facilitates the establishment of silent chromatin remains mysterious, and requires further investigation.</p><p>Previous studies revealed that Rpd3p possesses the activity of deacetylating histone H4K12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>). Acetylation of histone H4K12 is required for Sir3p binding during the spreading of heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62 B63 B64">62&#x02013;64</xref>). It has been proposed that deletion of <italic>RPD3</italic> may increase acetylation of H4K12 to facilitate Sir-mediated repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Controversially, de Bruin <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>) reported that the lysine residues in the histone H4-terminal tail are all hypoacetylated at yeast telomeres, and H4K12 is not preferentially acetylated in the silent chromatin at both telomere and silent mating loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). An <italic>in vitro</italic> surface plasmon resonance (SPR) study also showed that acetylation of synthetic H4 peptides (residues 1&#x02013;34) at K5, K8, K12 and K16 decreases Sir3p binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Our ChIP analyses demonstrated that the three lysine residues exhibit comparatively lower acetylation levels at the silent mating type locus and at the proximal regions of telomeres when compared to an internal locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D and E), arguing that H4K12 at silencing loci is not preferentially acetylated, and hypoacetylation of histone H4 tail might be generally important for the formation and establishment of euchromatin.</p><p>The fact that silent chromatin can encroach upon active chromatin poses a fundamentally important question as to how the repressive chromatin does not ultimately invade and occupy entirely all the active regions of the genome. Like deletion of any other anti-silencing factors (e.g. <italic>HTZ1</italic>, <italic>SAS2</italic>), or boundary elements [e.g. the tRNA gene located at the right side of <italic>HMR</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>)], deletion of Rpd3p does not cause cell death, suggesting that the formation and spreading of silent chromatin is eventually stopped, probably by the reestablishment of the boundary. The reason for this is unclear. In telomere silencing, one possibility is that the amount of Sir proteins is limited and lack of enough Sir proteins would passively impair the further spreading of silent chromatin. A second possibility is that Rpd3p only acts on the discrete regions in the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B and C), and inactivation of Rpd3p causes histone hyperacetylation at certain regions that are subsequently bound by Sir2p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>F and G). A third possibility is that a redundant anti-silencing pathway parallelly functions to prevent the spreading of silent chromatin regardless of Rpd3p. This final idea is supported by the observation that disruption of Rpd3p could promote the deposition of H2A.Z at boundary regions to protect euchromatin from ectopic silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Each of these three models for the prevention of the formation of global euchromatin is possible and we look forward to future studies into this topic.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp233/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="gkp233_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="gkp233_1.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="gkp233_nar-02372-m-2008-File004.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>National Science Foundation of China (30&#x02031;800&#x02031;628) and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (20&#x02031;070&#x02031;410&#x02031;744&#x02031;) (to J.Z.); the Postdoctoral Foundation of Chinese Academy of Sciences (2008KIP502); Siebens Foundation BVU School of Science Endowment funds (to B.A.L.); Ministry of Science and Technology (2005CB522&#x02031;402, 2007CB914&#x02031;502) grants (to J.Q.Z.).
