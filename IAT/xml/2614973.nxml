WSSV ORF403 is predicted to encode a protein of 641 amino acids, which contains a C3H2C2 RING structure. In the presence of an E2 conjugating enzyme from shrimp, WSSV403 can ubiquitinate itself <italic>in vitro</italic>, indicating it can function as a viral E3 ligase. Besides, WSSV403 E3 ligase can be activated by a series of E2 variants. Based on RT-PCR and Real time PCR, we detected transcription of WSSV403 in the commercial specific-pathogen-free (SPF) shrimp, suggesting its role as a latency-associated gene. Identified in yeast two-hybrid screening and verified by pull-down assays, WSSV403 is able to bind to a shrimp protein phosphatase (PPs), which was characterized before as an interaction partner for another latent protein WSSV427. Our studies suggest that WSSV403 is a regulator of latency state of WSSV by virtue of its E3 ligase function.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is a virulent shrimp pathogen responsible for high mortality in cultured shrimp, raising major concerns in the aquaculture industry. Disease outbreaks can reach a cumulative mortality of up to 100% within 3 to 7 days of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Its circular dsDNA genome consists of 300 kbp that contains approximately 185 open reading frames (ORFs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], which is one of the largest viral genomes. Database searches reveal that more than 95% of these ORFs do not have any counterparts in other species and WSSV has thus been placed in a new virus family, the <italic>Nimaviridiae</italic>, genus <italic>Whispovirus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>In the past several years, studies of WSSV mainly focused on the viral structural proteins and more than 30 proteins matching WSSV ORFs have been identified as envelop proteins and collagen-like protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Only a few non-structural genes have been characterized. Three latency-associated genes (LAG) were identified from specific-pathogen-free shrimp by microarray [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Among them, ORF89 was found to be a transcription repressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and WSSV427 can interact with a shrimp phosphatase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Microarray has also been employed in WSSV studies to find out three immediate early (IE) genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. At the molecular level, there is little understanding of how WSSV establishes latent infections or of the genes responsible for the transition between latent and lytic infection, which eventually leads to mortality.</p><p>Besides, four proteins of WSSV, namely WSSV199, WSSV222, WSSV249 and WSSV403 contain RING-H2 domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. A previous study has revealed the involvement of the RING finger domain in specific ubiquitination events by acting as the E3 ubiquitin protein ligase. RING finger domains are subdivided into two subgroups, the C3HC4 (RING-HC) subgroup and the C3H2C3 (RING-H2) subgroup. Among these RING proteins from WSSV, WSSV222 mediates the degradation on a shrimp tumor suppressor as a viral E3 ligase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and WSSV249, also acting as an E3 ligase, sequesters the shrimp E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. To fully display function of RING proteins in WSSV, here we focus on WSSV403, another viral E3 candidate, which is potentially involved in the regulation of WSSV latency.</p><p>Specific-pathogen-free (SPF) shrimp are thought to lack WSSV before the three latency-associated genes were identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Commercialized SPF shrimp (BIOTEC, Bangkok, Thailand) have been tested to be WSSV negative using an IQ2000 WSSV detection kit (Farming IntelliGene Technology Corporation). These shrimp have been grown for 6 generations in a controlled environment without any disease outbreak. Therefore, these SPF shrimp could be used as better research material for WSSV latency study without WSSV contamination compared with normal asymptomatic shrimp, especially in those highly-sensitive methods, such as Real time PCR, which could be used to differentiate latency-assoicated genes from normal genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Meanwhile, visible symptoms will take place in normal shrimp due to environmental stress rather than virus contamination, raising the possibility that these shrimp contain WSSV in a dormant state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In this study, both of normal shrimp and these SPF shrimp were used to study WSSV403 latency associated function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Reverse transcription PCR and real time PCR</title><p>Healthy adult <italic>P. vannamei </italic>weighing around 15 g was verified to be free of WSSV by RT-PCR with primers for VP28 prior to infection.

An initial characterization of the putative protein encoded by WSSV ORF403 (AF332093) revealed the presence of a RING finger domain similar to those from WSSV222 and WSSV249 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The presence of a C3H2C3-type RING finger suggested that WSSV403 belongs to the RING-H2 subgroup and could be involved in ubiquitination. To focus on this RING domain, a RING-containing fragment named <italic>403RING </italic>was cloned from <italic>WSSV403</italic>. 403RING protein (211-494aa) was expressed in <italic>E. coli </italic>by pQE vector (Qiagen) as well as full-length WSSV403 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).

To determine if WSSV403 possessed ubiquitination activity <italic>in vitro </italic>and which, if any, E2 enzyme stimulated this activity, purified 403RING was incubated with a range of different E2 enzymes, including a shrimp E2 Pvubc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], in the presence of E1, ubiquitin and ATP. Among these E2s we used, 403RING can be strongly activated as an E3 ligase by Pvubc, ubcH3, ubcH5a, ubcH5c and ubcH6 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), indicating that 403RING can support E3 ligase activity and display a low degree of E2 specificity. Besides 403RING, with Pvubc, the full-length WSSV403 can also be polyubiquitinated by itself (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), confirming its viral E3 function.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>WSSV403 contains a RING domain.

Surprisingly, from normal shrimp RNA sample without WSSV inoculation, <italic>WSSV403 </italic>transcript was also found (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). This result suggests the potential role of <italic>WSSV403 </italic>in latency. Moreover, SPF shrimp samples were tested in RT-PCR for <italic>WSSV403 </italic>expression.

Among 15 clones we obtained on high-stringent plates, by DNA sequencing, 4 clones were found to encode a protein phosphatase which was identified in our laboratory before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Plasmids extracted from these yeast clones were retransformed to yeast for verification. Blue colonies appeared on high-stringent plates with x-&#x003b1;-gal (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A, B</xref>), indicating WSSV403 can interact with shrimp protein phosphatase in yeast.

This result further confirms the physical interaction between WSSV403 and shrimp protein phosphatase. Interestingly, the same shrimp PPs can interact with WSSV427, another latency-associated protein in WSSV, implying that all of the three proteins are involved in WSSV latency regulation pathway.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>WSSV403 can interact with a shrimp protein phosphatase.

Here, one novel latency-associated transcript was identified from SPF shrimp during our studies on RING-containing proteins from WSSV. And its viral gene expression was detected in normal shrimp tissue. Taken together with the other three latency-associated-genes of WSSV found previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], this report further verifies that viral gene transcription takes place in asymptomatic shrimp, and suggests that WSSV genome is present in SPF shrimp and WSSV latent infection takes place in its host tissue. Though some latency-associated genes can inhibit virus lytic stage to maintain virus latency, such as latent gene vFLIP from Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], some other ones contribute to the transit between the latent and lytic stage. For example, the latency-associated transcript gene of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is required for efficient <italic>in vivo </italic>spontaneous reactivation of HSV-1 from latency based on its anti-apoptosis function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In our studies, WSSV403 transcription takes place in normal shrimp during the potential latency of WSSV and increases once the lytic stage starts. This finding suggests that WSSV403 expression should contribute to the activation of lytic stage. And such function of WSSV403 could be repressed by certain factors during the virus latent stage, one of which is probably the protein phosphorylation.</p><p>The interaction between WSSV403 and shrimp protein phosphatase makes it possible for WSSV403 to be a regulator of latent and lytic infection of WSSV, since the regulation on such kind of proteins by protein phosphatases has been implicated in the latent-lytic life cycle for some other model viruses. In herpes simplex virus, inhibition of protein phosphatase 2B results in a increase in the amount of the regulatory protein ICP0, which leads to efficient virus replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The switch from latency to viral replication of Epstein-Barr virus is mediated by Zta, the protein product of EBV gene BZLF1. And transcriptional activation of the BZLF1 promoter is greatly augmented by the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Here, for the interaction between WSSV403 and shrimp PPs, one possibility is that the WSSV403 function depends on its phosphorylation status regulated by the shrimp PPs. WSSV403 E3 function could be activated by dephosphorylation with shrimp PPs. This could lead to WSSV403-mediated ubiquitination on other host proteins in downstream in order to trigger virus replication.</p><p>Further, ubiquitination plays important role in viral latency regulation. For example, RING protein ICP0, a regulator of herpes simplex virus during lytic and latent infection, is well-characterized as an E3 ligase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Latent membrane protein 2A of Epstein-Barr virus utilizes ubiquitin-dependent processes to modulate cellular signaling pathways involved in latency regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. As a RING-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase, WSSV403 is able to interact with its substrates besides E2 conjugating enzymes and to mediate degradation of the substrate, which enables it to regulate other proteins in downstream via ubiquitination pathway. Thus, another model for WSSV403 involved in WSSV latency regulation could be that shrimp PPs is the potential substrate for WSSV403 in ubiquitination. WSSV403 could down-regulate shrimp PPs via ubiquitin-mediated degradation. This reaction could inhibit PPs-mediated dephosphorylation on other viral or host proteins in down-stream, which could be WSSV427. In WSSV, latency-associated protein WSSV427 is another interaction partner for the shrimp PPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], indicating the systematic regulation between viral latent proteins and host proteins. The detailed relation of WSSV403, the shrimp protein phosphatase and WSSV427 will be further explored in future studies. Here, this study identified RING protein WSSV403 as a candidate of latency regulator, which paves the way for clarifying the mechanism of transit from latency to lytic stage in WSSV.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Results here indicate that WSSV403 is a new viral E3 ubiquitin ligase in WSSV. Its latent gene transcription and PPs binding activity suggest that WSSV403 is a regulator of latency state of WSSV by virtue of its E3 ligase function.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>FH carried out the experiments, analyzed the data and drafted the manuscript and JK contributed to the experimental design of the study and critical analysis of the data.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work is supported by Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory.
