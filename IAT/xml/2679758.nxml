NET is the target of psychotropic substances, such as tricyclic antidepressants and the drug of abuse, cocaine. NET mutations have been implicated in depression, anxiety, orthostatic intolerance and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). NET function in adult noradrenergic neurons of the peripheral and central nervous systems is to internalize norepinephrine from the synaptic cleft. By contrast, during embryogenesis norepinephrine (NE) transport promotes differentiation of neural crest stem cells and locus ceruleus progenitors into noradrenergic neurons, whereas NET inhibitors block noradrenergic differentiation. While the structure of NET und the regulation of NET function are well described, little is known about downstream target genes of norepinephrine (NE) transport.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We have prepared gene expression profiles of in vitro differentiating wild type and norepinephrine transporter-deficient (NETKO) mouse neural crest cells using long serial analysis of gene expression (LongSAGE). Comparison analyses have identified a number of important differentially expressed genes, including genes relevant to neural crest formation, noradrenergic neuron differentiation and the phenotype of NETKO mice. Examples of differentially expressed genes that affect noradrenergic cell differentiation include genes in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway, the <italic>Phox2b </italic>binding partner <italic>Tlx2</italic>, the ubiquitin ligase <italic>Praja2</italic>, and the inhibitor of Notch signaling, <italic>Numbl</italic>. Differentially expressed genes that are likely to contribute to the NETKO phenotype include dopamine-&#x003b2;-hydroxylase (<italic>Dbh</italic>), tyrosine hydroxylase (<italic>Th</italic>), the peptide transmitter 'cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript' (<italic>Cart</italic>), and the serotonin receptor subunit <italic>Htr3a</italic>. Real-time PCR confirmed differential expression of key genes not only in neural crest cells, but also in the adult superior cervical ganglion and locus ceruleus. In addition to known genes we have identified novel differentially expressed genes and thus provide a valuable database for future studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Loss of NET function during embryonic development in the mouse deregulates signaling pathways that are critically involved in neural crest formation and noradrenergic cell differentiation. The data further suggest deregulation of signaling pathways in the development and/or function of the NET-deficient peripheral, central and enteric nervous systems.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The NET is a Na<sup>+ </sup>and Cl<sup>-</sup>- dependent transporter, which is expressed by noradrenergic neurons. NET function in adult noradrenergic neurons is the clearing of secreted NE from the synaptic cleft via selective high-affinity uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Drugs that block NE transport, such as the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine and the drug of abuse, cocaine, inhibit NE transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and differentiation of cultured neural crest cells into noradrenergic neuroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. NETKO mice have reduced body temperature (~1&#x000b0;C) and reduced body weight (~20%), they are supersensitive to psychostimulants, such as cocaine and amphetamine, they have reduced intracellular NE, increased NE synthesis and elevated extracellular NE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In humans, abnormal NET function leads to orthostatic intolerance and is involved in depression, anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autonomic dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. NET may have additional functions during noradrenergic cell differentiation, as NET protein is expressed in a variety of different tissues in avian and mouse embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. NET expression in mouse embryonic neural crest cells is regulated by the autocrine growth factors, neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) and transforming growth factor-&#x003b2;1 (TGF-&#x003b2;1; ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]). The role of NET and the regulation of its function in noradrenergic homeostasis and NE signaling are well established. NET function is regulated by extracellular and intracellular signaling pathways that involve several associated proteins, including the SNARE protein syntaxin 1A, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) catalytic subunit (PP2A-C), PICK1, Hic-5, and PP2A anchoring subunit (PP2A-Ar) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Little is known, however, on how absence of the NET gene affects differentiation of neural crest stem cells into noradrenergic cells.</p><p>Here we report results obtained with LongSAGE gene expression profiling and analyses on differentiating noradrenergic neurons/progenitors from the embryonic neural crest, the adult superior cervical ganglion and the locus ceruleus. SAGE has been developed by Velculescu et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] as a tool to quantify the transcriptome. It is based on the isolation and sequencing of unique sequences (tags) from defined positions at the 3' end of each mRNA molecule. SAGE has the advantage of high-efficient gene identification, which allows for unbiased and comprehensive analysis of a large number of differentially expressed genes without prior knowledge of the genes. The principle of LongSAGE is the same as in the original approach, except that it uses another type IIS restriction enzyme, <italic>Mme1</italic>, to generate 17 bp tags, rather than the 10 bp tags in conventional SAGE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Thus LongSAGE allows for annotation of a larger portion of tags than SAGE.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Time course of mouse NET gene expression and function during wild type neural crest cell differentiation in vitro</title><p>To determine the optimal stage of in vitro development for RNA collection, we performed a time-course of NET expression and function in wild type mouse neural crest cell cultures. Both, NET mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, B</xref>) and high affinity <sup>3</sup>H-norepinephrine uptake-positive cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) were first detected on culture day 5 in a subset of neural crest cells. At culture day 5, uptake-positive cells lacked processes and showed the morphology of undifferentiated neural crest cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). By culture day 7, many <sup>3</sup>H-NE uptake-positive cells were multipolar with long processes and they tended to form aggregates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref> arrow), whereas others showed a functional NET but had undifferentiated morphology as determined by the absence of processes (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>, arrowhead). Expression of catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes in mouse neural crest cell cultures starts around culture day 5 and newly catecholamine-positive cells continue to appear in progressively larger numbers, as stem cells persist for several more weeks in culture, self-renew and their progeny continue to differentiate. Thus day 7 cultures capture all stages of in vitro development. They contain neural crest stem cells, undefined NET-negative progenitor cells, cells with NET function and immature morphology, as well as cells with NET function and neuronal morphology as judged by the elaboration of long processes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). For this reason day 7 cultures were chosen as a source of RNA for gene expression profiling. For the purpose of the present study we use expression of catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes and elaboration of processes as measures for neuronal differentiation. Among cells with morphology of differentiated cells, <sup>3</sup>H-NE uptake-positive cells with neuronal morphology were observed only, indicating that in these cultures functional NET was limited to differentiating neuroblasts/neuronal progenitors. This notion is supported by the complete absence in the longSAGE libraries of differentially expressed genes that are characteristic for non-neuronal neural crest derivatives, such as smooth muscle cells, bone/cartilage cells or pigment cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Time course of expression of NET mRNA and NET function in cultured mouse neural crest cells</bold>.

First, the tag distribution between the two libraries and the LongSAGE tag-to-gene mapping in both libraries were similar (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Second, as expected, most genes expressed by in vitro differentiating neural crest cells in day 7 cultures were unchanged because of the deletion of the NET gene (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

The Notch pathway is, however, essential for induction of the neural crest. It is required for initiation of BMP-4 expression, and thus neural crest identity, in cells at the boundary between somatic and neural ectoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Notch signaling is involved in neural crest formation and noradrenergic cell differentiation, as well as in many other systems. Loss of Numbl function leads to a premature depletion of neuronal progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Since <italic>Numbl </italic>transcripts are significantly more abundant in NETKO neural crest cells (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>), this result suggests that deletion of the NET gene causes noradrenergic precursor cells, such as neural crest cells, to preferentially remain in the neuronal progenitor cell compartment. The notion of decreased differentiation due to persisting progenitor state is supported by the 12-fold decrease in the expression of histone deacetylase 2 (<italic>Hdac2</italic>; Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>).

Praja2 ubiquitinates the Smad adaptor protein, Elf, which subsequently leads to its degradation and a decrease in Smad4 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Smad4 is a critical member of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling, as it forms a complex with a receptor-regulated Smad (Samd1, Smad2). The complex subsequently serves as a transcripton factor for Tgf-&#x003b2; target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. In summary, elevated Pja2 expression can inhibit TGF-&#x003b2; signaling and therefore is likely to maintain neural crest cells in their progenitor state by blocking their differentiation into noradrenergic cells. Yet another important family of growth factors involved in noradrenergic differentiation are bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). BMP4 was found to be required for noradrenergic differentiation in chick embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. In agreement with this notion we found in the present study that BMP6 is significantly down-regulated in NETKO neural crest cells (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>NET is an important gene in the central, autonomic and enteric nervous systems, as mutations in the NET gene have been shown to have profound influences in homeostasis and cognition. In this study we have primarily focused on the role of NET in embryonic neural crest development, but also have validated selected data in adult brain and peripheral nervous system tissues. Specifically, we have provided evidence that high-affinity uptake of norepinephrine through NET affects expression of genes that are involved in neural crest formation and in noradrenergic differentiation as measured by expression of catcholamine biosynthetic enzymes and elaboration of processes. The data further suggest changes in enteric nervous system function and possibly brain development/function in the absence of NET function. We have confirmed that expression of noradrenergic biosynthetic enzymes is altered in NETKO mice. Other pertinent differentially expressed genes addressed in detail in this work include Htr3a, <italic>Numbl, App, Praja2 and Tlx2</italic>. We have identified differentially expressed genes that are likely to contribute to the NETKO phenotype, that is over-expression in NETKO cells of <italic>Th, Dbh, Cart, Htr3a </italic>and <italic>Tlx2</italic>. Interestingly these genes are not only expressed in the neural crest-derived autonomic nervous system and in the brain, but they also have key functions in another neural crest derivative, the enteric nervous system. Other differentially expressed transcripts, as for instance Tgfb2 and Hoxa10 (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>), as well as Cdc51 and Hoxb9 (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>), play important roles in cell proliferation and differentiation but have not been addressed in the current study.
