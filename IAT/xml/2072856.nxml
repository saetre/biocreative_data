Recurrent tumors ultimately arise wherein AR has been re-activated.

These substances deemed &#x0201c;endocrine disrupting compounds,&#x0201d; or EDCs, are agents that disrupt or enhance known regulatory functions of the endocrine system and function through multiple mechanisms, including alteration of hormone receptor function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ehp0115-001646">Henley 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63-ehp0115-001646">Welshons et al. 2003</xref>). While mechanisms by which these effects occur and the level of risk posed to humans have yet to be fully elucidated, the biological significance of EDC exposure can be significant. In humans, a putative link has been established between increased abundance of estrogenic EDCs in the environment and both rising hormone-dependent cancer incidence and reduced fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ehp0115-001646">Huff et al. 1996</xref>). Thus, recent investigations have placed particular emphasis on delineating the consequence of estrogenic EDC exposure on reproductive tissues.</p><p>One such agent, 4,4&#x02032;-isopropylidene-2-diphenol (bisphenol A, BPA), has been identified as a mitogen for a subset of prostate cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66-ehp0115-001646">Wetherill et al. 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64-ehp0115-001646">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65-ehp0115-001646">2006</xref>). BPA is a nonplaner plasticizer, which is leached in microgram quantities from polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins into food and water supplies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63-ehp0115-001646">Welshons et al. 2003</xref>). More than 800 million kilograms of this compound are generated annually in the United States, and up to 95% of adults in the United States have detectable BPA in their urine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ehp0115-001646">Calafat et al. 2005</xref>), with adult serum concentrations reported to range in nanomolar concentrations [reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62-ehp0115-001646">Welshons et al. (2006)</xref>]. BPA is known to harbor estrogenic activity; this compound is a weak agonist of both estrogen receptor alpha and beta (ER&#x003b1; and ER&#x003b2;, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-ehp0115-001646">Kuiper et al. 1997</xref>) and is capable of stimulating moderate estrogen-independent proliferation in breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ehp0115-001646">Hess-Wilson et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-ehp0115-001646">Olsen et al. 2003</xref>). The ERs are members of the steroid hormone nuclear receptor family of transcription factors, which are activated by specific steroid hormones and control numerous molecular pathways in hormone responsive tissues, including differentiation and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ehp0115-001646">Ascenzi et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48-ehp0115-001646">Shang and Brown 2002</xref>). Although these reports highlighted a potentially influential role of BPA on ER activity in breast cancer, recent studies reveal BPA as an agonist for mutant androgen receptor (AR) activity in recurrent prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66-ehp0115-001646">Wetherill et al. 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64-ehp0115-001646">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65-ehp0115-001646">2006</xref>).</p><p>Prostatic adenocarcinomas are uniquely dependent on AR activity for growth and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56-ehp0115-001646">Trapman and Brinkmann 1996</xref>). In prostate cancer cells, androgen [testosterone or dihydrotestosterone (DHT) binding activates the receptor to bind DNA at androgen-responsive elements (AREs), recruit co-activators, and initiate a program of gene transcription that induces cellular proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-ehp0115-001646">Lee et al. 1995</xref>). Given the reliance of prostate cancer cells on this signal, nullification of AR activity is the first line of therapeutic intervention for disseminated disease, as achieved through either ligand depletion (androgen ablation strategies) or through the use of direct AR antagonists that prevent formation of active AR transcriptional complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ehp0115-001646">Klotz 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45-ehp0115-001646">Reid et al. 1999</xref>). Although these strategies are initially effective at inducing cell death or cell cycle arrest, recurrent tumors arise within a median of 2&#x02013;3 years, wherein AR activity has been restored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ehp0115-001646">Feldman and Feldman 2001</xref>). One mechanism of AR reactivation is somatic mutation of the AR (estimated to occur in 8&#x02013;25% of recurrent tumors), where specific mutations of the ligand binding domain render the receptor responsive to an expanded host of ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53-ehp0115-001646">Suzuki et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59-ehp0115-001646">Veldscholte et al. 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57-ehp0115-001646">1992a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58-ehp0115-001646">1992b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69-ehp0115-001646">Zhao et al. 2000</xref>). Remarkably, it has been shown that one of the most common tumor-derived mutant forms of the AR, AR-T877A, is responsive to activation by BPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66-ehp0115-001646">Wetherill et al. 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64-ehp0115-001646">2005</xref>). Specifically, it was shown that at environmentally relevant levels of BPA (1 nM), this agent is capable of binding and activating the mutant receptor to induce endogenous expression of <italic>PSA</italic> (prostate specific antigen, a known direct AR target), which is used clinically to monitor prostate cancer development and progression. In cancer cells that express this mutant, low-level BPA exposure induced androgen-independent cellular proliferation, thereby indicating that in the context of AR-T877A, BPA exposure could potentially reduce therapeutic efficacy. This concept was recently validated <italic>in vivo</italic>, wherein BPA accelerated tumor growth after androgen ablation and significantly reduced PSA doubling times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65-ehp0115-001646">Wetherill et al. 2006</xref>). Thus, there is significant evidence that BPA can bolster AR-T877A activity and as a result potentially alter the course of therapeutic response in prostate cancer.</p><p>Given the potent effects of BPA on mutant AR activation and prostate cancer progression, it is imperative to determine the molecular underpinning of BPA action. There are differences in prostatic cellular response to BPA compared with DHT, including magnitude of proliferative response, distinctions in ligand binding, and different ligand-induced kinetics of AR recruitment to gene regulatory regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66-ehp0115-001646">Wetherill et al. 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64-ehp0115-001646">2005</xref>). Moreover, it is known that differential ligands dictate target gene specificity with regard to the nuclear receptors. Although substantial <italic>in vitro</italic> analyses have revealed the direct binding to and activation of mutant ARs by BPA, it is also well documented that BPA can activate ER&#x003b1; and ER&#x003b2;, which are expressed in several prostate cancer cell lines [e.g., LNCaP (human prostatic adenocarcinoma cell line)]. However, the BPA-induced cellular proliferation is dependent on AR activation, as blocking of AR function (using the specific AR antagonist, Casodex) reversed all effects of BPA on tumor cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66-ehp0115-001646">Wetherill et al. 2002</xref>). Therefore, it is believed that the adverse proliferative effect of BPA is directly through the AR. In our present study, only the proliferation-inducing dose of BPA (1 nM) was used for analysis.</p><p>We show by gene expression analyses that low-level, physiologically relevant and proliferation-inducing doses of BPA and DHT elicit overlapping but distinct transcriptional effects in prostate cancer cells expressing the AR-T877A mutation. These data are consistent with previous reports which demonstrate that distinct AR ligands and modes of AR activation alter the specificity of the target genes modified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ehp0115-001646">Davis et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-ehp0115-001646">Matias et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67-ehp0115-001646">Wilson et al. 1993</xref>), and suggest that BPA likely uses mechanisms distinct from DHT to promote cancer cell proliferation. Although these gene-expression differences are complex, interesting and suggestive distinctions were observed. The analyses revealed that BPA exposure in cells expressing AR-T877A triggers a dramatic reduction in expression of ER&#x003b2;, a nuclear receptor suspected to negatively regulate both AR activity and prostate cancer cell proliferation. Modest reductions in ER&#x003b2; were observed after DHT treatment. Strikingly, the ability of BPA to modulate ER&#x003b2; showed cell-type specificity, as alteration in ER&#x003b2; was observed only after DHT (but not BPA) exposure in cells expressing wild-type AR or the AR-H874Y mutant. Together, these data identify ER&#x003b2; as a candidate effector of BPA action in prostate cancer cells expressing the AR-T877A mutant and demonstrate that BPA induces a unique transcriptional signature in prostate cancer cells that may be influenced by AR status.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>DHT and BPA were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Company (St. Louis, MO).

Briefly, AR-T877A&#x02013;expressing prostate cancer cells (LNCaP) were initially cultured in hormone-depleted conditions (CDT), to suppress cell cycle progression and deplete endogenous AR of ligand. After 24 hr, cells were treated with DHT, BPA, or vehicle (0.1% ethanol; EtOH) and pulsed with 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) to measure G<sub>1</sub>-S phase progression. As expected, androgen depletion significantly attenuated cell cycle progression compared with cells cultured in the presence of physiological levels of DHT (0.1 nM) (approximate 3-fold reduction in BrdU incorporation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ehp0115-001646">Figure 1B</xref>).

Similar trends were observed after increasing time periods postligand stimulation or when AR ligand stimulation was applied after prolonged periods of hormone ablation (data not shown).

Briefly, cells were treated as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ehp0115-001646">Figure 1</xref> with either vehicle (EtOH), DHT, or BPA before RNA isolation. A time course was initially performed, where it was determined that BPA-induced PSA expression peaks at 24 hr poststimulation compared with approximately 16 hr after DHT stimulation (data not shown). The delay in peak observation is consistent with previous observations that AR nuclear translocation facilitated by BPA is delayed compared with DHT-induced AR translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66-ehp0115-001646">Wetherill et al. 2002</xref>). Therefore, this time point was chosen for subsequent microarray analyses. RNA for each condition (EtOH, DHT, and BPA) was isolated from three independent experimental cultures to determine the change in transcript levels for each condition and when evaluated in triplicate, genes passing the ANOVA criteria were further analyzed to create a cluster heat map. A heat map was generated using the fold change estimates and averaged across samples. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ehp0115-001646">Figure 2A</xref>, BPA (column 1) and DHT (column 2) showed some similar gene expression profiles with comparable patterns of gene down-regulation (green) and up-regulation (red) relative to the vehicle control. However, column 3 provides a visual mechanism to compare the profile of BPA with that of DHT and exemplifies the differences in the genetic profile induced by the two ligands. An important control and point of reference, <italic>KLK3</italic> (prostate-specific antigen, <italic>PSA</italic>, UniGene ID# Hs.171995) was up-regulated by both BPA and DHT but was more robustly activated by DHT, as can be seen by the green band in lane 3. Statistical analyses revealed that a total of 283 genes showed significant alteration relative to vehicle control (with <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, &#x0003e; 2-fold change in gene expression and average intensity &#x0003e; 100 as criteria for significant changes). Of these, only 51 genes were common to both BPA and DHT (38 up-regulated and 13 down-regulated). However, 88 genes were uniquely regulated by BPA treatment (51 up-regulated and 37 down-regulated), and 144 genes were exclusive to DHT treatment (94 up-regulated and 50 down-regulated) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ehp0115-001646">Figure 2B</xref>). These data suggest that although the proliferative response to DHT or BPA is congruent, the gene profiles after exposure are divergent between the canonical ligand DHT and the environmental contaminant BPA.</p><p>Key target genes critical for DHT-mediated AR-dependent proliferation are largely unknown. Therefore, the expression changes induced by mitogenic BPA or DHT were also analyzed via GO to determine cellular pathways that may be altered by AR activation with these disparate ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ehp0115-001646">Figure 2C</xref>). The GO terms that were affected are of significant interest to prostate development and organ homeostasis and function, as well as prostatic disease, and include genes involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, organogenesis, and growth factor pathways. Among these categories, several previously described direct or suspected AR gene targets were identified in both the DHT- and BPA-treated cohorts, including prostate specific antigen (<italic>KLK3</italic>/ PSA), and <italic>FKBP5</italic> (FK506 binding protein 5; UniGene ID Hs.7557), a member of the immunophilin protein family involved in protein trafficking and folding.

In addition, several potentially key effectors of prostate cancer cell proliferation were identified in the BPA-treated cohort, including <italic>FIGF</italic> (c-fos&#x02013;induced growth factor, also called VEGF-D; UniGene ID Hs.11392), which has been associated with advanced-stage metastatic prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-ehp0115-001646">Kaushal et al. 2005</xref>). The <italic>WISP3</italic> (WNT-1 inducible signaling pathway protein 3, UniGene ID Hs.194678) gene, whose protein product is a member of the CCN (connective tissue growth factor, cysteine-rich protein 61, and nephroblastoma overexpressed gene) family, was also among those induced by BPA. <italic>WISP3</italic> is thought to have important roles in carcinogenesis and has identified functions in cell growth and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-ehp0115-001646">Kleer et al. 2004</xref>).

Using conditions identical to those used for the microarray studies, cells were placed in an environment of androgen ablation and subsequently stimulated with DHT or BPA for 24 hr. Initially, the AR target gene PSA was analyzed. As expected, both DHT and BPA increased PSA mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ehp0115-001646">Figure 3A</xref>, left panel). Conversely, FKBP5 was increased by DHT (8-fold over EtOH) but not significantly induced by BPA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ehp0115-001646">Figure 3A</xref>, right panel). By contrast, BPA treatment increased WISP3 (2-fold over EtOH control), whereas DHT had no significant effect on gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ehp0115-001646">Figure 3A</xref>, right panel). Last, analyses of ER&#x003b2; transcript levels were explored by reverse transcriptase PCR, as reduction of this mRNA was initiated by both DHT and BPA (compare &#x02013;2.6 fold change by DHT with &#x02013;4.8-fold change by BPA in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ehp0115-001646">Figure 2C</xref>). Interestingly, both microarray and reverse transcriptase PCR validation showed that BPA facilitated more significant down-regulation of ER&#x003b2; than DHT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ehp0115-001646">Figure 3A</xref>, right panel, lane 3; 0.46-fold expression compared with EtOH for BPA).</p><p>Real-time PCR was used to accurately quantify the level of ER&#x003b2; transcript down-regulation induced by DHT and BPA treatment of LNCaP prostate cancer cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ehp0115-001646">Figure 3B</xref>, cells cultured under conditions of androgen ablation (EtOH vehicle treatment) demonstrated approximately 20 relative copy numbers of ER&#x003b2; transcript.

CDK4 was used as the loading control. Collectively, these data indicate that although both BPA and DHT can activate mutant AR and resultant cellular proliferation in prostate cancer cells, each agent induces a unique molecular signature, wherein genetic profiles induced by mitogenic doses of DHT or BPA showed both overlapping (e.g., PSA and ER&#x003b2;) and divergent (e.g., FKBP5, WISP3) responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="background"><title>BPA-mediated regulation of ER&#x003b2; is cell-type specific</title><p>The observation that BPA significantly reduced ER&#x003b2; expression was striking, as this receptor plays significant roles in both prostate development and disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ehp0115-001646">Adams et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-ehp0115-001646">Leav et al. 2001</xref>). Therefore, the specificity of BPA-induced ER&#x003b2; down-regulation was determined. The effect of BPA treatment on ER&#x003b2; transcript levels was examined in two additional prostate cancer cell lines, 22Rv1 and LAPC4. 22Rv1 cells are androgen-independent prostate cancer cells that express the AR-H874Y mutant. 22Rv1 cells were treated under identical conditions as previously described, cells were switched to steroid deprived media for 24 hr, then treatments (EtOH vehicle control, DHT or BPA) were added for 24 hr. As shown, cells treated under conditions of hormone ablation demonstrated a relative copy number of 7 (ER&#x003b2; over GAPDH control), as determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR. DHT reduced the level of ER&#x003b2; transcript copy by approximately 50% (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05); however, contrary to observations in LNCaP cells, exposure to BPA had no effect on ER&#x003b2; transcript copy number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ehp0115-001646">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p>The impact of BPA exposure on ER&#x003b2; transcript was examined further in the LAPC4 prostate cancer cell line, which harbors wild-type AR and is androgen dependent.

While these data point toward the potential for BPA to assist tumor cells in escaping therapy, the molecular mechanisms of this process were not well understood. In this study, the molecular consequence of BPA action was identified under conditions in which BPA promotes androgen-independent proliferation. Gene expression analyses revealed that in AR-T877A&#x02013;expressing cells, BPA elicited an overlapping but distinct molecular signature compared with that induced by exposure to canonical AR ligand (DHT). Unexpectedly, detailed examination of the most significant targets demonstrated that BPA exposure elicited dramatic reduction in expression of ER&#x003b2;, a nuclear receptor that is proposed to antagonize AR activity and androgen-dependent proliferation in prostatic epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-ehp0115-001646">Leav et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44-ehp0115-001646">Pravettoni et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60-ehp0115-001646">Weihua et al. 2001</xref>). Comparative analyses revealed that while DHT exposure also reduced ER&#x003b2;, this effect was marginal compared with the BPA response. Last, the ability of BPA (but not DHT) to attenuate ER&#x003b2; function appears to be specific to cell type and putatively receptor specific, as BPA had no detectable effect on ER&#x003b2; expression in cells containing wild-type AR or AR-H874Y. Notably, these also represent cell types in which BPA fails to induce cellular proliferation. Together, these data indicate that the ability of BPA to induce androgen-independent cellular proliferation is associated with AR-T877A expression and a unique gene expression signature that involves down-regulation of ER&#x003b2;.</p><p>Combined with these observations, the concept that BPA induces cell-specific transcriptional profiles is emerging. For example, transcriptional analysis of BPA exposure on breast cancer cells (MCF-7) revealed that BPA up-regulated a significant number of genes involved in cell cycle progression and purine and pyrimidine metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49-ehp0115-001646">Shioda et al. 2006</xref>), reaffirming the proliferative biological action of this compound in estrogen-dependent tissues.

The present observation that BPA initiates ER&#x003b2; down-regulation suggests that this may be one mechanism by which BPA bolsters overall AR activity, thereby promoting a proliferative response. The observation that DHT modestly altered ER&#x003b2; levels was not expected, as ER&#x003b2; has not been well documented as a target (direct or indirect) of androgen action. Of note, however, is that a significant fraction of published microarray studies using the AR-dependent prostate cancer cell lines have been performed using high doses of androgen (&#x02265;10 nM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ehp0115-001646">Dehm and Tindall 2006</xref>), which induce profound cell cycle arrest in prostate cancer cells. Thus, it is possible that effects on ER&#x003b2; may be masked by such experimental conditions. Furthermore, scrutiny of the literature demonstrated that down-regulation of ER&#x003b2; by DHT has been previously observed but had not yet been validated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ehp0115-001646">Arnold et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47-ehp0115-001646">Segawa et al. 2002</xref>). While the complete molecular complexities of mitogenic signaling in prostate cancer cells remain to be elucidated, it would be interesting to continue this line of experimentation with an analysis of gene regulation as a function of time with the various mitogenic ligands. However, together these collective observations put forward the intriguing hypothesis that the proliferative effects of BPA may be at least partially due to the manipulation of ER&#x003b2; levels.</p><p>The ability of BPA to govern ER&#x003b2; levels was observed only in cells expressing the AR-T877A mutant.

Previous work has shown that BPA can activate AR-H874Y and elicit transactivation of target genes in reporter assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64-ehp0115-001646">Wetherill et al. 2005</xref>); however, because of the ligand-independent nature of this cell line, AR activation by either DHT or BPA does not facilitate proliferation in AR-H874Y&#x02013;dependent (22Rv1) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64-ehp0115-001646">Wetherill et al. 2005</xref>). With regard to wild-type AR, BPA is not known to bind to or activate this receptor at the doses used, and LAPC4 cells (which express wild-type AR) are not responsive to androgen-independent cellular proliferation by BPA exposure. By comparison, DHT-mediated reduction of ER&#x003b2; expression was relatively equivalent in each of these lines, thus indicating that the capacity to modulate ER&#x003b2; remains intact. Hence, the ability of BPA to alter ER&#x003b2; levels appears to correlate to the mitogenic capacity of BPA. Future studies will be directed at dissecting the mechanism by which AR ligands alternately regulate ER&#x003b2; and the contribution of differential mutations of AR to this process. In addition, given that BPA can bind to ER&#x003b2; directly, it will also be important to determine whether the impact of BPA on ER&#x003b2; is direct or indirect. Recent work by Susiarjo et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52-ehp0115-001646">Susiarjo et al. 2007</xref>) have demonstrated that the adverse effects of BPA on oocyte development requires ER&#x003b2; further supporting the notion that the salient mode of action for BPA may be through alterations in ER&#x003b2; function. Remarkably, it still remains largely unknown what controls ER&#x003b2; expression in the prostate. Although epigenetic regulation of ER&#x003b2; in prostate cancer has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70-ehp0115-001646">Zhu et al. 2004</xref>), knowledge of what <italic>cis</italic>-acting factors directly interact with the ER&#x003b2; promoter is very limited; AP-2 was recently found to be a promising transcription factor that regulates ER&#x003b2; gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68-ehp0115-001646">Zhang et al., in press</xref>).</p><p>In summary, the present study demonstrates that BPA uses a cell-specific gene expression signature in prostate cancer cells expressing a somatic mutation of AR, and that a major molecular consequence of BPA action is down-regulation of ER&#x003b2; These studies provide insight into a potentially novel mechanism by which BPA can promote AR-T877A activity and androgen-independent cellular proliferation. Given the critical importance of controlling AR activity for prostate cancer therapy, the present study provides the foundation for future investigations directed at dissecting the role of BPA and ER&#x003b2; in controlling prostate cancer growth and/or progression.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>We thank S.
