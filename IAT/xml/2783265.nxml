With respect to muscle fibers, we previously established that a shift from active Notch to excessive TGF-&#x003b2;/pSmad3 induces CDK inhibitors in satellite cells, thereby interfering with productive myogenic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Carlson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Conboy et al., 2003</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>systemic</italic> inhibitor of muscle repair, elevated in old sera, was suggested to be Wnt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Brack et al., 2007</xref>). Here, we examined the age-dependent myogenic activity of sera TGF-&#x003b2;1, and its potential cross-talk with systemic Wnt. We found that sera TGF-&#x003b2;1 becomes elevated within aged humans and mice, while systemic Wnt remained undetectable in these species. Wnt also failed to inhibit satellite cell myogenicity, while TGF-&#x003b2;1 suppressed regenerative potential in a biphasic fashion. Intriguingly, young levels of TGF-&#x003b2;1 were inhibitory and young sera suppressed myogenesis if TGF-&#x003b2;1 was activated.

Summarily, these findings argue against the endocrine path of a TGF-&#x003b2;1-dependent block on muscle regeneration, identify physiological modalities of age-imposed changes in TGF-&#x003b2;1, and introduce new therapeutic strategies for the broad restoration of aged organ repair.</p></abstract><contract-num rid="AG1">R01 AG027252-03 ||AG</contract-num><contract-sponsor id="AG1">National Institute on Aging : NIA</contract-sponsor></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Adult skeletal muscle robustly regenerates throughout an organism's life but, with advancing age, its ability to repair diminishes and ultimately fails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Grounds, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Renault et al., 2002</xref>). Muscle satellite cells play a crucial role in this regenerative process, and are physically situated beneath the basal lamina of myofibers (i.e. differentiated muscle cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Mauro, 1961</xref>). Upon myofiber damage, quiescent satellite cells become activated and begin proliferating as myogenic progenitor cells, which later differentiate into fusion-competent myoblasts and de novo multinucleated myofibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Collins et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Wagers and Conboy, 2005</xref>). Although diminished satellite cell numbers have been implicated in the age-related decline of muscle tissue regeneration, several reports identified key molecular changes within Notch and P-Smad3 signaling in the aged endogenous populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Carlson and Conboy, 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Carlson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Conboy et al., 2003</xref>). In this regard, aging of the satellite cell micro-niche was found to promote under-production of Notch ligand Delta, and over-production of TGF-&#x003b2;. Consequently, satellite cells residing in old muscle fibers express excessive levels of CDK inhibitors, and thus fail to break quiescence and proliferate in response to injury. However, the regenerative responses of aged satellite cells can be rescued, either by forced activation of Notch, or by shRNA targeting of Smad3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Carlson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Conboy et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Schultz and Lipton, 1982</xref>). The regenerative capacity of aged muscle can also be enhanced by exposing old satellite cells to young systemic factors &#x02013; such as when young and old mice are physically connected to share blood circulation (parabiosis), or when aged satellite cells are cultured in the presence of young sera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Carlson and Conboy, 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Conboy et al., 2005</xref>). This improved regeneration of aged muscle is due to the enhanced activity of endogenous, aged satellite cells and not from physical contributions of young cells within the common circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Conboy et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, in addition to local tissue niches, systemic factors in sera also regulate the regenerative responses of organ stem cells and importantly, the aged circulation <italic>inhibits</italic> the regenerative potential of even young satellite cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Brack and Rando, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Carlson and Faulkner, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Carlson and Conboy, 2007a</xref>). This evidence suggests that, in the case of heterochronic parabiosis, the inhibitory factors introduced into shared circulation by old partners were continuously removed, or functionally neutralized, by the young partners.</p><p id="P3">It was reported that the aged circulation inhibits satellite cell responses by acting through the Wnt pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Brack et al., 2007</xref>). These findings raised particular interest, since Wnt proteins are not known to be endocrine in nature, and because Wnt signaling was recently demonstrated to enhance myogenic proliferation and differentiation in both embryonic and adult development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Brack et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Ikeya and Takada, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Le Grand et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Marom et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Shi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Wagner et al., 2000</xref>). A recent study from our laboratory implicated the Transforming-Growth-Factor Beta (TGF-&#x003b2;) family in the local inhibition of aged satellite cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Carlson et al., 2008</xref>). We therefore decided to explore a potential age-dependent endocrine activity of TGF-&#x003b2;, and its potential cross-talk with Wnt. Moreoever, we extrapolated our previous findings by narrowing down the anti-myogenic inhibitory activity to one TGF-&#x003b2; family member, namely TGF-&#x003b2;1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Li et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Shen et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p id="P4">TGF-&#x003b2; proteins are multifunctional cytokines, secreted by numerous cell types. They are capable of signaling to virtually every cell type, and broadly control cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, inflammation and scarring in various tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Derynck and Zhang, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Massague, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Massague and Chen, 2000</xref>). TGF-&#x003b2; ligands are synthesized by cells and secreted as precursor complexes that are composed of mature dimeric C-terminal polypeptides, specifically &#x02013; the latency associated propeptide (LAP), and the latent TGF-&#x003b2; binding protein (LTBP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Annes et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Hyytiainen et al., 2004</xref>). These complexes can be transported in the blood, and are normally targeted to tissue extracellular matrix (ECM) by the appropriate LTBP, where the mature polypeptide is cleaved. These activated ligands are then capable of binding to their specific receptors, thereby initiating TGF-&#x003b2;/P-Smad signal transduction. Several validated small molecule inhibitors, which specifically interfere with TGF-&#x003b2; Receptor I kinase activity, are capable of blocking Smad phosphorylation upon Receptor I ligand binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Gellibert et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Singh et al., 2003</xref>). Similarly, an exogenous, dominant-negative form of TGF-&#x003b2; Receptor II has been shown to effectively prevent TGF-&#x003b2; signaling in several cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Brand et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Tang et al., 1999</xref>).

In this regard, blood cells (mostly platelets and CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes) are known to produce and release high levels of total and biologically-active TGF-&#x003b2; ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Assoian et al., 1983</xref>). Considering the strong morphogenic properties of TGF-&#x003b2;, changes in the levels of either total (latent plus active), or active form alone, are likely to influence immune responses, tissue maintenance and regeneration.</p><p id="P5">The results shown here argue against the notion of systemic TGF-&#x003b2;1 endocrine activity, and strongly suggest that TGF-&#x003b2;, released by the known process of platelet activation during sera collection, inhibits satellite cell responses <italic>in vitro</italic>. These findings also suggest that young sera may contain a functional, natural decoy of TGF-&#x003b2;1, or a competitor of TGF-&#x003b2;1 signaling pathway (either endocrine or released by platelets). Lastly, our results demonstrate that Wnt antagonizes, rather than synergizes with TGF-&#x003b2;1&#x02013;mediated satellite cell response inhibition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Defining the inhibitory range of systemic TGF-&#x003b2;1</title><p id="P6">The TGF-&#x003b2; family is composed of roughly 35 different ligands. In addition to other cytokines (e.g. IGF-1, TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6, etc.), many of these have been implicated in the aging process, in general, and with respect to muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Dorshkind et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Grounds, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Moresi et al., 2008</xref>). Here, we focused on first determining whether the aged circulation is inhibitory to adult myogenesis through the activity of one particular family member - TGF-&#x003b2;1.</p><p id="P7">We specifically postulated that TGF-&#x003b2;1 levels of young sera are benign, or positive to myogenic regulation, while TGF-&#x003b2;1 levels found in aged circulation are inhibitory. To explore this, we first depleted TGF-&#x003b2;1 from young and old mouse serum, followed by re-addition at a range of tested concentrations. Muscle stem cells, derived from young and old mice, were then cultured in the presence of young and old TGF-&#x003b2;1-depleted, or modified, mouse serum. The regenerative responses of these cells were assayed, <italic>in vitro</italic>. Sera was depleted of TGF-&#x003b2;1 by incubation with a TGF-&#x003b2;1-specific antibody (or isotype-matched control IgG), followed by removal of the TGF-&#x003b2;1-antibody complexes (or control IgG antibody complexes) using protein G-coated agarose beads. The success of TGF-&#x003b2;1 depletion was also confirmed by ELISA (not shown). Muscle stem cell myogenic regenerative potential was quantified, based on their ability to generate de-novo myogenic lineages &#x02013; i.e. BrdU-incorporating desmin<sup>+</sup> myoblasts (<italic>myogenic proliferation</italic>) that differentiate into post-mitotic eMyHC<sup>+</sup> myotubes (<italic>myogenic differentiation</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Conboy et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Conboy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Sherwood et al., 2004</xref>).

In agreement with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Carlson and Conboy, 2007a</xref>), myogenic proliferation (24-48 hours of culture) and myogenic differentiation (48-72 hours of culture) were consistently higher for young satellite cells and in young serum at all time points, as compared to old (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1A-D</xref>). Non-myogenic, desmin<sup>-</sup> proliferating fibroblasts were less numerous in cultures with experimentally-calibrated levels of TGF-&#x003b2;1 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), and also declined in cultures with exogenous Wnt 3A addition (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, below). These cells are known to contaminate satellite cell preparations at &#x0223c;2-5%, and to expand in the presence of old serum or high levels of TGF-&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Carlson et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Very interestingly, the productive myogenic proliferation of young and old muscle stem cells was robust in TGF-&#x003b2;1-depleted serum, <italic>only</italic> when low levels of recombinant TGF-&#x003b2;1 were introduced (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-C</xref>). At 1-5ng/ml (and higher), TGF-&#x003b2;1 alone sufficed for the inhibition of satellite cell responses, while myogenesis was positively regulated at 0.2 ng/ml (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-C</xref>). Similarly, myogenic differentiation responses from young cells also peaked in TGF-&#x003b2;1-depleted serum, which received low levels of exogenous recombinant TGF-&#x003b2;1 (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2A</xref>). In contrast, old cell differentiation was improved by TGF-&#x003b2;1-depletion from serum alone, as well as in a low range of recombinant TGF-&#x003b2;1 addition (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2B</xref>). The overall differentiation response from old cells was also diminished, as compared to young cells (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2A, B</xref>). Since myogenic differentiation was assayed at 48-72 hours of culture, and aged satellite cells have elevated TGF-&#x003b2;1 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Carlson et al., 2008</xref>), these data suggest that endogenous TGF-&#x003b2;1 production by old cells, <italic>in vitro</italic>, counteracts the pro-myogenic effect of TGF-&#x003b2;1 depletion from mouse serum (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A-D</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A, B</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Together, these data demonstrate that sera-derived TGF-&#x003b2;1 inhibits satellite cell responses, and that specific levels of TGF-&#x003b2;1 are required for productive myogenic responses. Even with complete TGF-&#x003b2;1 depletion, old serum remained less myogenic than young (by &#x0223c;10-20%), suggesting that while TGF-&#x003b2;1 is a main inhibitor of satellite cell responses, it is not the only suppressor of regeneration present in old sera (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-C</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A, B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Correlating the inhibitory range of TGF-&#x003b2;1 with physiological levels found in young and old sera</title><p id="P10">To further substantiate these conclusions, we correlated the inhibitory range of TGF-&#x003b2;1 with its levels found in young versus aged sera. Specifically, we analyzed TGF-&#x003b2;1 levels as a function of age in mice and in humans (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 A, B</xref>). In mice, TGF-&#x003b2;1 levels sharply increased between 12 months (early post-reproductive age, analogous to 5<sup>th</sup>-6<sup>th</sup> decades in humans) and 24 months (analogous to 8<sup>th</sup>-9<sup>th</sup> decades in humans), <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>. Moreover, this systemic age-related rise was found to be conserved in humans (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), where TGF-&#x003b2;1 plateaus at its highest systemic levels between the 6<sup>th</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup> decades of life (i.e. roughly at the onset and progression of age-imposed regenerative decline). Sera TGF-&#x003b2;1 for both species thus becomes elevated from the end of the reproductive period, to the end of lifespan.</p><p id="P11">Curiously, TGF-&#x003b2;1 levels in young mouse sera (&#x0223c;100ng/ml) are predicted to be inhibitory to satellite cell responses (data shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), even if used at 5-10%, <italic>in vitro</italic>. Therefore, despite apparent pro-myogenic differences between young and old sera, physiological TGF-&#x003b2;1 levels alone do not explain the inhibitory affects of aged sera on myogenic responses. To determine whether these inhibitory affects correlated with biologically-active TGF-&#x003b2;1 levels, a bio-activity assay was performed on non-activated serum samples, using the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) promoter luciferase-reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Abe et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Danielpour et al., 1989</xref>), and by ELISA (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3C, D</xref>). These data clearly demonstrated that while bioactive TGF-&#x003b2;1 was higher in old mouse serum, as compared to young, the levels in either sera were minute (&#x0003e;4ng/ml) and unlikely to be inhibitory in the 5-10% range examined (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3C, D</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Based on published literature, and in agreement with our results, sera and plasma contain little-to-no active TGF-&#x003b2;1. However, the total TGF-&#x003b2;1 released by platelets during sera collection becomes activated (e.g. by cells in culture), evoking an interplay between positive and negative regulators that determines the intracellular signaling strength. The platelet source of TGF-&#x003b2;1 in our serum samples was corroborated, as expected (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3E, F</xref>). We further postulated that, in the case of young sera, TGF-&#x003b2;1 activity is attenuated and may therefore render young sera pro-myogenic. To test this, we compared satellite cell myogenic responses in cultures containing serum with (1) endogenous TGF-&#x003b2; activity, (2) forced-activated endogenous TGF-&#x003b2; and (3) forced-activated endogenous TGF-&#x003b2;, with subsequent TGF-&#x003b2;1-specific antibody neutralization. As shown in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C, D</xref>, young serum became inhibitory to satellite cell responses (and similar in this regard to old sera) when endogenous young levels of TGF-&#x003b2; were forced-activated. Importantly, inhibition of myogenic activity was dependent on TGF-&#x003b2;1 and not related to sera-activation, since TGF-&#x003b2;1-specific neutralization restored myogenicity to these cultures. Additionally, when mixed with standard young serum, forced-activated young serum was dominant in myogenic inhibition &#x02013; suggesting that the presence of negative regulators, rather than the removal of positive regulators, accounts for such affects. These data uncover that the strong inhibitory influence of aged sera (as opposed to the pro-myogenic properties of young sera) are not solely explained by age-related differences in TGF-&#x003b2;1 levels.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Correlation between systemic levels and myogenic effects of Wnt</title><p id="P13">Using a luciferase-reporter assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Brack et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Kaykas et al., 2004</xref>), we also measured the systemic levels of biologically-active Wnt, since an age-dependent increase of circulating Wnt (from &#x0223c;10ng/ml in young to &#x0223c;20ng/ml in old sera) was recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Brack et al., 2007</xref>). In our experiments, Wnt was undetectable in young and old serum from both humans and mice (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A, B</xref>). Measurable levels of Wnt in all samples were substantially less than 5ng/ml (based on a recombinant Wnt standard curve). Interestingly, the relative luciferase activity values were actually higher for young mouse serum, as compared to old (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p id="P14">A rescue of satellite cell responses, in the presence of old serum, was reported to be achieved by the inhibition of Wnt via FRPs. In addition, exogenous Wnt3A was reported to inhibit satellite cell myogenic responses, in favor of fibroblast trans-differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Brack et al., 2007</xref>). We thus investigated whether Wnt was potentially synergistic with the TGF-&#x003b2;1-dependent attenuation of myogenic potential, and if Wnt sera activity might be detected using satellite cell myogenicity assays. To do so, the myogenic potential of young and old satellite cells was examined in the presence of (1) young serum with exogenous Wnt3A (by itself, or simultaneously with exogenous TGF-&#x003b2;1), or (2) old serum with exogenous FRP3 (by itself, or simultaneously with TGF-&#x003b2; neutralization). As shown in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C-F</xref>, exogenous FRP inhibition of Wnt did not rescue myogenic responses in old serum. Moreover, exogenous Wnt3A did not reduce myogenic potential in young serum.

However, in contrast to the induction of a fibroblastic cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Brack et al., 2007</xref>), the presence of non-myogenic fibroblastic cells (e.g. desmin<sup>-</sup>/BrdU<sup>+</sup>) was not increased, but reduced in the presence of exogenous Wnt3A, thereby further validating the pro-myogenic activity of Wnt. Wnt modulation also failed to synergize with the TGF-&#x003b2;1-promoted inhibition of myogenic responses. In contrast, Wnt3A antagonized TGF-&#x003b2;1 and enhanced the generation of satellite cell-derived, fusion-competent proliferating myoblasts (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C-F</xref>).

In our studies, there was less variation in measurable TGF-&#x003b2;1 levels within mice (as compared to humans), likely owing to their environmental and genetic homogeneity. It is also important to note that our reported human TGF-&#x003b2;1 levels are representative of the healthy aging population, as individuals for these studies were pre-screened for confounding medical conditions.

Cryo-sectioning was performed through the entire volume of muscle (typically 50-70 sections total, done at 200&#x003bc;m intervals), thereby serially reconstituting the entire tissue, <italic>ex vivo</italic>. Myofiber regeneration was quantified by counting total newly-regenerated fibers at injury epicenters, per volume of injury (typically &#x0223c;1mm&#x002c6;2) and dividing fibers per area. Immunostaining was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Conboy et al., 2003</xref>). Briefly, after permeablization in PBS+1% FBS+0.25% Triton-X-100, tissues and cells were incubated with primary antibodies in staining buffer (PBS+1% FBS) for 1 hour at room temperature, followed by 1 hour incubation fluorochrome-labeled secondary antibodies (ALEXA, Molecular Probes; Carlsbad, CA, at 1:1000). P-Smad2/3 and BrdU-specific immunostaining required an extra step of 2M HCl treatment (denaturation of DNA) before permeablization. The index of myogenic potential was evaluated, based on BrdU/eMyHC costaining, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Carlson and Conboy, 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Carlson et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Depletion of TGF-&#x003b2; from Culture Media</title><p id="P34">Opti-MEM containing either 10% young or old mouse serum was incubated in the presence of 5 microgram per milliliter TGF-&#x003b2; antibody (R&#x00026;D Systems) overnight at 4&#x000b0;C.
