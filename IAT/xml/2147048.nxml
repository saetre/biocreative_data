Using a B lymphoblast cell model, we previously demonstrated impairment in NRG1&#x003b1;-mediated migration in cells derived from patients with schizophrenia as well as effects of risk alleles in NRG1 and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), a second gene implicated both in schizophrenia susceptibility and in cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Here, we examine cell adhesion, an essential component process of cell motility, using an integrin-mediated cell adhesion assay based on an interaction between ICAM-1 and the CD11a/CD18 integrin heterodimer expressed on lymphoblasts. In our assay, NRG1&#x003b1; induces lymphoblasts to assume varying levels of adhesion characterized by time-dependent fluctuations in the firmness of attachment. The maximum range of variation in adhesion over sixty minutes correlates strongly with NRG1&#x003b1;-induced migration (r<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.61). NRG1&#x003b1;-induced adhesion variation is blocked by erbB2, PI3K, and Akt inhibitors, but not by PLC, ROCK, MLCK, or MEK inhibitors, implicating the erbB2/PI3K/Akt1 signaling pathway in NRG1-stimulated, integrin-mediated cell adhesion. In cell lines from 20 patients with schizophrenia and 20 normal controls, cells from patients show a significant deficiency in the range of NRG1&#x003b1;-induced adhesion (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.0002). In contrast, the response of patient-derived cells to phorbol myristate acetate is unimpaired. The COMT Val108/158Met genotype demonstrates a strong trend towards predicting the range of the NRG1&#x003b1;-induced adhesion response with risk homozygotes having decreased variation in cell adhesion even in normal subjects (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.063).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion/Significance</title><p>Our findings suggest that a mechanism of the NRG1 genetic association with schizophrenia may involve the molecular biology of cell adhesion.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The predominant current view of the pathogenesis of schizophrenia posits that it is a neurodevelopmental disorder related to genetic factors that impact on brain development and plasticity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001369-Lewis1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> Among the steadily increasing number of putative schizophrenia susceptibility genes is Neuregulin-1 (NRG1), which was first found to be associated with increased risk for schizophrenia in an Icelandic population<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001369-Stefansson1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> and subsequently confirmed in several studies of other populations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001369-Harrison1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> NRG1 exists in multiple isoforms, all of which contain an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain that can signal through erbB2, erbB3, or erbB4 receptors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001369-Falls1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> Most NRG1 isoforms exist as transmembrane proteins that are believed to be proteolytically cleaved, allowing the extracellular, EGF-like domain to bind to erbB receptors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001369-Harrison2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> NRG1 is involved in many key neurodevelopmental functions, including neuronal migration, synaptic modulation, and oligodendrocyte development. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001369-Falls1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001369-Corfas1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> Since these functions and others regulated by NRG1 are at least theoretically related to schizophrenia's putative neurodevelopmental origin, NRG1 is a biologically plausible schizophrenia susceptibility gene.

We report that NRG1&#x003b1; induces varying levels of cell adhesion characterized by time-dependent fluctuations in the firmness of attachment as measured with a novel adhesion assay. The maximum range of this variation in adhesion over time (hereafter abbreviated as MRVA) correlates highly with the effectiveness of NRG1&#x003b1;-induced cell migration, indicating that the MRVA measure has biological relevance, at least to these cells. NRG1&#x003b1;-induced MRVA is dependent on erbB2/PI3K/Akt signaling. Furthermore, the MRVA induced by NRG1&#x003b1; is significantly lower in B lymphoblasts derived from patients with schizophrenia compared with those derived from normal controls. Lastly, a single nucleotide polymorphism within COMT, a gene implicated in susceptibility both to schizophrenia and to metastatic cancer, demonstrates a strong trend towards predicting the MRVA of a given cell line, even in normal subjects. Overall, our studies show that NRG1 signaling activates adhesion machinery in a process that is impaired in cells derived from patients with schizophrenia. If these findings in immune cells are conserved in neuronal cell processes, they would argue that a mechanism of the NRG1 genetic association with schizophrenia involves the molecular biology of cell adhesion.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Lymphoblasts express integrins homogeneously</title><p>Lymphocytes predominantly express the CD11a/CD18 integrin heterodimer (&#x003b1;<sub>L</sub>/&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>, which is also known as leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 or LFA-1).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001369-Dedrick1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref> We used flow cytometry to assay baseline integrin expression and to compare expression between cell lines derived from patients with schizophrenia versus normal controls.

To our knowledge, these are the first data showing that NRG1&#x003b1; induces attachment in B lymphoblasts in an assay of cell adhesion, revealing time-dependent fluctuation in net adhesion. In our studies, the MRVA of this NRG1&#x003b1;-induced adhesion response has apparent biological relevance in that it predicts both the degree of the cell migration response to NRG1&#x003b1; as well as differences between schizophrenia cases and normal control subjects. In turn, the MRVA itself may be predicted by a single nucleotide polymorphism within COMT, which is also implicated in metastatic cancer. While exogenous NRG1&#x003b1; increases the cell surface expression of the CD18 integrin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001369.s004">Figure S4</xref>), the stable nature of this effect over time suggests that this increased surface expression is not directly responsible for mediating the temporally varying adhesion response.

We have performed a series of detailed experiments showing convincingly and consistently that this varying adhesion is not random: specifically, 1) particular temporal patterns of attachment and detachment, while not intrinsic to the unstimulated cell itself, seem to be relatively conserved when cells from the same cell line under the same conditions at the same time are subjected to specific stimuli which change their attachment state (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001369.s002">Figure S2</xref>); 2) the MRVA is remarkably reliable within a cell line studied on repeated occasions on different days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001369-g001">Figure 1</xref>); 3) the MRVA is affected in a dose-dependent manner by various relevant signaling pathway inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001369-g003">Figures 3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001369-g004"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001369-g005"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001369-g006"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001369-g007">7</xref>); 4) the MRVA induced by NRG1 predicts other NRG1-related phenomena in these cells, e.g. NRG1-induced migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001369-g002">Figure 2</xref>), in contrast to the PMA-induced MRVA measure, which predicts none of these effects; and 5) the NRG1-induced MRVA is predicted by variation in COMT, and the pattern of this relationship is similar in patients with schizophrenia and in normal subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001369-g009">Figure 9</xref>). We would not expect to find such systematic properties were the effects simply noise. On the contrary, we suspect that this varying level of net adhesion represents, at the individual cell level, an oscillatory phenomenon related to the cell biology of motility, though we are unable to confirm mathematically the oscillatory nature of this phenomenon at this point.</p><p>A second potential concern involves the constraints of the time course experiment itself. In the literature, investigators studying cell adhesion generally look at one specific time point (often 1 hour) as the outcome measure. As our initial studies indicated that NRG1-induced adhesion actually had a time dependency, we chose four evenly spaced time points over that hour to better characterize the varying nature of this adhesion. More time points might be preferable in order to better assess the precise variations that are occurring. Unfortunately, technical and other considerations make assaying at more frequent time points impractical. Theoretically, cell adhesion could be fluctuating with a period on the order of seconds or even more quickly. It is unclear whether such effects would be observable in a population of cells even with continuous sampling, which is not possible with our assay. These considerations notwithstanding, the fact that there are observable mass effects suggests that the cells have a certain degree of synchronization in their modulation of adhesion or else no net effect over time would be expected. This synchronization is not entirely surprising given that all cells likely are starting at roughly the same basal adhesive state, due to similar cell and culture conditions, and then are being exposed to the same exogenous dose of NRG1&#x003b1;. Cell to cell interactions also likely play a role in mediating this mass effect. Nevertheless, the MRVA as described does serve to quantify the range of the adhesion over time in a cell line and is closely related to NRG1&#x003b1;-induced cell motility. The fact that our MRVA measure and our measure of NRG1-induced motility were highly correlated even though the experiments were performed on average 13 months apart, suggests that these are biologic characteristics of a cell line and not artifacts of cell preparation or culture conditions.</p><p>Another potential confounder for which it is difficult to control is the possible effect of endogenous NRG1. It has recently been shown that B lymphoblasts do not express NRG1,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001369-Tan1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref> though the serum in the culture medium likely does contain NRG1. So, even the cells in the control wells are likely being exposed to low levels of NRG1, although the relative levels of stimulation are different from exposure to exogenous NRG1. Pre-exposure to low levels of serum-derived NRG1 may contribute to baseline ICAM-alone MRVA. However, assuming that this serum-derived NRG1 effect is stable over time and independent of exogenous NRG1 stimulation, the fact that we are always comparing NRG1-stimulated cells to control cells controls for any net effects on adhesion that serum-derived NRG1 exerts.</p><p>The last methodological consideration relates to the form of NRG1 employed in these studies. While the &#x003b2; form is more potent and the more widely available form in the central nervous system,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001369-Falls1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> the &#x003b1; form is the type more commonly found in peripheral tissue.

Our demonstration of strong non-specific effects of PLC in maintaining an adhesive state is consistent with the literature, especially given the known importance of both PKC and calcium signaling in promoting cell adhesion. Additionally, the role of MLCK in maintaining an adhesive state was confirmed by our studies. The lack of effect of ROCK inhibition on our adhesion studies was unexpected. However, given ROCK's particular roles in promoting both pro-adhesive and anti-adhesive pathways through effects on MLCK and Rho, respectively, the lack of a robust directional effect on cell adhesion may be due to complex compensatory mechanisms in these pathways. Finally, it recently has been demonstrated that Akt1 plays an important role in integrin activation through an inside-out pathway, emphasizing a regulatory role for Akt1 in cell adhesion and migration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001369-Somanath1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref> Our data not only help support these findings but may provide a potential mechanism towards understanding these regulatory effects.</p><p>While we demonstrated differences in our adhesion assay between our patient-derived and control-derived cells, the molecular basis of this difference is not yet identified. Our results could be specific to NRG1-mediated adhesion; they could reflect diverse sites of molecular pathology in NRG1 signaling related to the erbB/PI3K/Akt pathway; or the data could be related to more general phenomena that converge on cell adhesion. At present, the weight of the evidence suggests that patient-derived lymphoblasts do not have an intrinsic impairment of either cell attachment or detachment, but rather seem unable to modulate their adhesive states from their baseline levels in response to NRG1&#x003b1;.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Potential implications for clinical disease</title><p>The strong relationship between the NRG1-induced adhesion response and the ability of the cells to migrate has potential implications for several clinical disease entities, most notably cancer and schizophrenia.

Nonspecific adhesion was blocked with 3&#x00025; bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma-Aldrich, Allentown, PA) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 2 hours at 4&#x000b0;C. Plates were washed 3 times each with PBS to remove nonadsorbed ICAM and BSA. 50 000 cells/well were added in triplicate to the plates, which were preloaded with control buffer (Hanks' Buffered Salt Solution (HBSS) with calcium and 10 mM HEPES), 50 ng/ml recombinant human NRG1&#x003b1; (R&#x00026;D Systems) in control buffer, or 150 nM phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) (Sigma-Aldrich) in control buffer. The cells were allowed to incubate at 37&#x000b0;C for 15, 30, 45, or 60 minutes. At each of these time intervals, the plates were washed gently 4 times each with HBSS containing calcium using a 12-tip multi-pipettor. 150 &#x000b5;l PBS and 50 &#x000b5;l CyQuant GR dye/lysis buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), which fluorescently labels DNA, were added to each well. Plates were incubated in the dark on an orbital shaker at 100 rpm for 15 minutes and then read 5 times each using a Victor3 1420 Multilabel Counter fluorescence microplate reader (Perkin Elmer, Wellesley, MA). The read-out, therefore, was fluorescence-based quantification of the DNA of the cells that remained attached, and thus served as a proxy to quantify the number of adherent cells. We also performed a series of studies in two cell lines with five minute sampling rates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001369.s003">Figure S3</xref>). While this approach allowed a more complete characterization of the range of varying adhesion, it revealed no evidence of a regular pattern over this time period. Thus, we concluded that sampling noise would not be systematically affected by the 15 minute frequency, which was much less labor intensive and more practical for the full sample.</p><p>In a given experiment for the non-pharmacological inhibitor studies, four cell lines were assayed as a batch. A different plate was used for each time point. The placement of cell lines on each plate was varied such that cell lines derived from patients with schizophrenia versus normal controls were in different positions in different experiments, but in any given individual experiment, both patient-derived and control-derived cell lines were used. While the investigator was not blinded as to the plate arrangement, the washings were done with a 12-tip multi-pipettor such that wells containing different cell lines derived from individuals with and without the diagnosis of schizophrenia were washed at the same time and with the same technique. For the pharmacological assays, one cell line was assayed per experiment. For these studies, the plates were arranged such that the unstimulated wells from all treatment groups were washed at the same time and with the same technique as were the NRG1 wells and the PMA wells.</p><p>The effect of NRG1&#x003b1; stimulation was measured at each time point based on calculation of a ratio (NRG/vehicle) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001369.s001">Figure S1</xref>), which was determined by taking the mean of the triplicate NRG1&#x003b1;-stimulated fluorescence values and dividing by the mean of the triplicate of the control ICAM-alone fluorescence values. This normalization procedure was adopted because raw baseline adhesion states tended to show some drift over time, albeit much less than the pronounced variation in adhesion after NRG1 stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001369.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Thus, the use of this ratio helps to control for other cellular and environmental processes that may impact adhesion. An analogous procedure was done to determine the effect of PMA stimulation, based on a PMA/vehicle ratio at each time point.</p><p>Dose response curves for NRG1&#x003b1; and PMA were performed across five NRG1&#x003b1; doses from 1&#x02013;200 ng/ml and across five PMA doses from 1.5&#x02013;300 nM (not shown). NRG1&#x003b1; had a slight peak in the MRVA around 50 ng/ml, so all cell lines were subjected to this concentration for all experiments. The PMA response was similar at commonly used dosages in the literature (100&#x02013;300 nM) as well as at doses 100 times below those concentrations, so 150 nM was arbitrarily selected for the positive control as it was a modest dose relative to the literature.</p><p>For signaling pathway inhibitor pharmacological assays, cells were incubated with the particular inhibitor in the dark at room temperature for 40&#x02013;60 minutes prior to plating. The inhibitors (AG825, wortmannin, Akt inhibitor X, Rho kinase inhibitor IV, PD98059, U73122, and ML-7) were obtained from Calbiochem, San Diego, CA. Unstimulated control cells for these experiments were incubated with equal volume of vehicle containing the particular inhibitor. Concentrations for inhibition were chosen by the middle concentration being approximately at the average IC<sub>50</sub> reported in the literature (references per manufacturer's catalog).
