We found that silencing Capzb2 in hippocampal neurons resulted in short neurites and misshapen growth cones in which microtubules overgrew into the periphery and completely overlapped with F-actin. In searching for the mechanisms underlying these cytoskeletal abnormalities, we identified &#x003b2;-tubulin as a novel binding partner of Capzb2 and demonstrated that Capzb2 decreases the rate and the extent of tubulin polymerization in vitro. We mapped the region of Capzb2 that was required for the subunit to interact with &#x003b2;-tubulin and inhibit microtubule polymerization. A mutant Capzb2 lacking this region was able to bind F-actin and form a CP heterodimer with &#x003b1;2-subunit. However, this mutant was unable to rescue the growth cone and neurite outgrowth phenotypes caused by Capzb2 knockdown.

Extension of normal neurites requires coordinated interactions between cytoskeletal networks made up of microfilaments (composed of F-actin) and microtubules (formed by tubulin) in structures called growth cones that form at the tips of growing neurites. Capping protein (CP) is a heterodimer that regulates F-actin assembly in a variety of cell types. Surprisingly, the neuronal CP &#x003b2; subunit, Capzb2, not only regulates F-actin assembly, but also inhibits microtubule polymerization by direct interaction with tubulin. We further show that this function of Capzb2 is required for establishment of the normal shape of growth cones and the appropriate length of neurites. Our data thus reveal an unexpected, dual role for CP in the regulation of both microfilaments and microtubules in neurons.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Growth cone morphology and neurite outgrowth are controlled by temporally and spatially coordinated interactions between two major cytoskeletal networks, F-actin and microtubules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000208-Dehmelt1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000208-Zhou1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

In support of this possibility, we found that Capzb2 and &#x003b2;III-tubulin coimmunoprecipitate from brain lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000208-g004">Figure 4A&#x02013;4C</xref>).</p><fig id="pbio-1000208-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1000208.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Capzb2 coimmunoprecipitates with &#x003b2;III-tubulin in brain lysates and decreases tubulin polymerization in vitro.</title><p>(A) In order to avoid overlap of the heavy chain signal (&#x0223c;50 kDa) with the &#x003b2;III-tubulin signal (&#x0223c;55 kDa) in the immunoprecipitation using the Capzb2 monoclonal antibody (mAb), the antibody was coupled to the protein G/A beads through cross-linking. &#x003b2;III-tubulin and Capzb2 signals were each detected following immunoprecipitation from brain lysate with both &#x003b2;III-tubulin rabbit antibody (rAb)-coupled beads and Capzb2 mAb-coupled beads.

In general, two well-defined zones have been observed: a tubulin-rich central zone (C-zone) and an F-actin&#x02013;rich peripheral zone (P-zone). The latter is composed of filopodial spikes separated by the lamellipodia, relatively splayed structures supported by a branched F-actin network. Central and peripheral zones are separated by the transitional zone (T-zone), which in addition to being rich in F-actin, also contains a few microtubules on their route to the P-zone. Within the P-zone, these microtubules preferentially grow along the filopodia, and not within lamellipodia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000208-Dehmelt1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000208-Schaefer1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.

Our data, however, suggest that a direct interaction between Capzb2 and microtubules may also be involved. We demonstrated the association between Capzb2 and &#x003b2;-tubulin by coimmunoprecipitation, GST pull-down, and in vitro binding assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000208-g004">Figures 4A&#x02013;4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000208-g005">5A&#x02013;5H</xref>).

Finally, in the absence of branched F-actin filament meshwork, microtubule distribution in the growth cone is dependent on the presence of Capzb2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000208-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Together, our data suggest that the interaction between Capzb2 and microtubules may contribute to the function of Capzb2 in growth cone formation and neurite outgrowth.

Without the interaction with Capzb2, the growth of microtubules into the periphery of the growth cone is unrestrained. Consequently, microtubules invade all of the filopodia, reaching their distal tips. This results in a complete overlap of microtubules and F-actin in the periphery and the disappearance of the lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000208-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). Thus, the normal growth cone structure characterized by the distinct C-, T-, and P-zones is replaced by fork-like neuritic endings in which the tubulin and F-actin signals completely overlap. The premature disappearance of the growth cone results in the premature termination of neurite growth and thus diminished neurite length.</p><fig id="pbio-1000208-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1000208.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Model of the actin/Capzb2/microtubule interaction in the growth cone.</title><p>(A) In the normal growth cone, Capzb2 in the lamellipodia interacts with microtubules to decrease tubulin polymerization. Note that microtubules are concentrated in the C-zone; only occasionally do microtubules traverse into the T-zone to grow along the filopodia in the P-zone. (B) In the absence of an interaction with Capzb2, growth of microtubules is unrestrained, resulting in the complete overlap between microtubules and the F-actin&#x02013;rich periphery. Note that lamellipodia are absent.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.1000208.g007"/></fig><p>Our study, together with the known function of CP in actin assembly, suggests that Capzb2 may act as a key coordinator of the assembly of F-actin and microtubules, the two major cytoskeletal networks that determine the morphology and dynamics of growth cones. The importance of Capzb2 for neurite outgrowth is particularly interesting in light of the recently established role of Ena/VASP in neuritogenesis in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000208-Kwiatkowski1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.
