In higher organisms H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases also function to pump protons across the plasma membrane of certain specialized cell types. These plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases are involved in processes such as urinary acidification and the maintenance of acid-base homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">Wagner et al. 2004</xref>), bone resorption by osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">Blair et al. 1989</xref>), sperm maturation and viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">Pastor-Soler et al. 2005</xref>), and the invasiveness of some tumour cells and vascular endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">Sennoune and Martinez-Zaguilan 2007</xref>). H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases thus represent potential drug targets in the treatment of diseases such as osteoporosis and cancer.</p><p>H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases consist of two functional sectors, V<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>0</sub>. The peripheral V<sub>1</sub> domain (subunits A-H) binds and hydrolyzes ATP, providing the energy for proton translocation across the integral membrane V<sub>0</sub> domain (subunits a, c, c&#x02032; c&#x02033;, d and e). Whether the c&#x02032; subunit is found in species other than yeast is currently unclear. H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases have been shown to function via a rotary mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">Hirata et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">Imamura et al. 2003</xref>). ATP hydrolysis is carried out by a hexamer of V<sub>1</sub> subunits A and B. Energy from this reaction drives the rotation of a central stalk consisting of V<sub>1</sub> subunits D and F and this is coupled to rotation of the V<sub>0</sub> proteolipid ring made up of c, c&#x02032; and c&#x02033;. Proton translocation across the membrane takes place at the interface between the rotating proteolipid ring and the stationary V<sub>0</sub> subunit a, which is held fixed in relation to the catalytic head by peripheral stalks which consist of subunits C, E, G and H.</p><p>In higher eukaryotes, the B, C, E, G, a, d and e subunits have recently been shown to have multiple forms encoded by different genes and with differing tissue expression patterns (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">Forgac 2007</xref>). Importantly, H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases that function in different physiological processes at different locations appear to contain unique combinations of these subunit isoforms, and thus it may be possible to design isoform-specific inhibitors that could serve as potential therapeutic agents in treating H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase-related diseases. However for this to be feasible, it is important to understand better the overall structure, subunit composition and function of all the components of the proton pump complex.</p><p>The V<sub>0</sub> d subunit is one of the least characterized of all the H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase components, and we have previously shown that in man it exists in two different forms, d1 and d2, encoded by separate genes. These are located on chromosomes 16q22 and 8q21 respectively. The d1 gene is ubiquitously expressed and d2 is predominantly expressed in kidney and osteoclast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">Smith et al. 2002</xref>). The function of the d subunit and its position within the pump complex are still under debate. It associates with the membrane bound V0 domain, probably by protein-protein interactions rather than being directly anchored in the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">Bauerle et al. 1993</xref>).</p><p>Currently there are two hypotheses regarding its localization. The first is based on studies of subunit C in the closely related bacterial A-ATPase (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). The crystal structure of subunit C in <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> has been solved using two crystal forms, hexagonal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">Iwata et al. 2004</xref>) and monoclinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">Numoto et al. 2004</xref>), which reveal that the protein has an alpha-helical three-domain structure. As a result of this and cross-linking experiments, subunit C is thought to have a socket-like function attaching the central stalk subunits D and F to the proteolipid ring, and although the eukaryotic d subunit has only a low level of sequence identity with bacterial subunit C, it has been proposed to be similar in structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">Iwata et al. 2004</xref>). <fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic diagram of the A-ATPase from <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> showing A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>0</sub> domain subunits (<italic>open and hatched symbols</italic> respectively) with subunit C indicated in <italic>red</italic> (adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">Iwata et al. 2004</xref>). <bold>b</bold> 3D structural model of the H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase V<sub>0</sub> domain from bovine brain clathrin coated vesicles, derived from single particle image analysis of electron micrographs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">Wilkens and Forgac 2001</xref>), seen from the top (<italic>1</italic>) and the side (<italic>2</italic>).

The authors of this study have suggested that their structure corresponds to the peripheral density seen partly covering the cytoplasmic opening of the bovine H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase proton channel in the 3D structural model derived from single particle image analysis of electron micrographs by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">Wilkens and Forgac (2001</xref>; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Thus the d subunit would be located above and slightly lateral to the proteolipid ring, possibly forming part of a peripheral stalk, rather than part of the central rotor, as shown schematically in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>.</p><p>Here we report an investigation to determine which model applies to H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases in man. We show that the human H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase d subunits are the structural orthologues of bacterial A-ATPase subunit C, despite the low level of primary sequence identity that exists between them. We also provide the first experimental evidence demonstrating that the d subunit in man forms part of the pump&#x02019;s central stalk and is thus likely to be important in its rotary mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Human tissue</title><p>With ethical approval from the Cambridgeshire Local Research Ethics Committee (03/279), samples of normal human renal tissue were obtained from the discarded portions of nephrectomy specimens removed for renal tumours.

Two hypotheses regarding its localization have been put forward that predicate potentially different roles, the first suggests that it is similar to bacterial A-ATPase subunit C and constitutes part of the central rotor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">Iwata et al. 2004</xref>), and the second, based on yeast studies, proposes a more lateral position as part of a peripheral stalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">Thaker et al. 2007</xref>). The data from our study indicate that the human d1 and d2 subunits are centrally located within the pump, thereby supporting the first hypothesis.</p><p>Using <italic>in silico</italic> structural analysis, we have here demonstrated that the human H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase d subunits show remarkable structural conservation with <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> A-ATPase subunit C, despite their low level of primary sequence identity, indicating that these proteins are likely to be true structural, and presumably functional, orthologues. Therefore, despite the extensive sequence divergence that has occurred, these subunits must have been subjected to strong structural and functional evolutionary pressure during the evolution of bacteria and man.</p><p>The solved structure of bacterial subunit C indicates that the protein has an alpha-helical three-domain structure and an overall shape resembling a bottle-stopper. Cross-linking experiments have shown that it is in close proximity to the L subunits of the proteolipid ring, which correspond to the c, c&#x02032; and c&#x02033; subunits of the eukaryotic H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, as well as subunit F of the central stalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">Iwata et al. 2004</xref>). Further cross-linking experiments have shown that subunits D and F are in turn in close proximity to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">Makyio et al. 2005</xref>). It has thus been proposed that subunit C has a socket-like function attaching the central stalk subunits D and F to the proteolipid ring. If the human d subunits have a similar role to bacterial subunit C, one would predict that they should interact with D and F, and also with components of the proteolipid ring. In this study we have provided the first experimental evidence showing that d1 and d2 do indeed interact directly with the D and F subunits of the human H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. Unfortunately we are presently unable to determine whether the human d subunits are also able to bind to the proteolipid subunits, since there are no antibodies available that recognize these proteins, nor have these proteins ever been successfully expressed <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>Our data do not support the alternative hypothesis&#x02014;that the eukaryotic d subunit is located above and lateral to the proteolipid ring, without any connection to it, possibly forming part of a peripheral stalk, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">Thaker et al. (2007)</xref>. These authors observed structural differences between the bacterial subunit C and the yeast d subunit, with the latter being not only larger, but also more anisometric than subunit C. However, the apparent differences might be due to methodological variation, as they were comparing the subunit C crystal structure with a low-resolution solution structure of the yeast d subunit etermined from small-angle X-ray scattering data. They also suggest that the inability of the <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> orthologue to rescue the phenotype of the yeast d subunit deletion strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">Owegi et al. 2006</xref>) indicates that the proteins are not functional equivalents. This is not necessarily the case as there are several examples of eukaryotic H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase subunits being unable functionally to complement the orthologous yeast subunit deletion strain, for example the mouse G1 and G3 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">Sun-Wada et al. 2003</xref>) and the human a4 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">Su et al. 2008</xref>).</p><p>The idea of peripheral stalk residency for the d subunit came in part from consideration of the 3D structural model of the bovine H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase proton channel generated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">Wilkens and Forgac (2001)</xref>, in which there are two protein densities covering the cytoplasmic opening of the channel. Although as described earlier, the more peripheral one is that proposed by Thaker and collaborators to correspond to subunit d (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), Wilkens and collaborators suggested that the central density has a clear three-domain structure like bacterial subunit C (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) and is thus likely to be the d subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">Wilkens et al. 2005</xref>). Our data support this model for localization of the d subunit within the pump complex. If it forms part of the central stalk, it is likely to play a role in the rotary mechanism of the H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, and therefore be important in the coupling of ATP hydrolysis and proton transport as has been proposed recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">Nishi et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">Owegi et al. 2006</xref>). <fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>The ribbon model of <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> subunit C, viewed from the top, shows the protein&#x02019;s alpha-helical three-domain structure. Looking at the 3D structural model of the bovine H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase V<sub>0</sub> domain from the top (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">Wilkens and Forgac 2001</xref>), it can be seen that the central density, covering the cytoplasmic opening of the proton channel, has a similar three-domain structure (indicated by <italic>asterisks</italic>), suggesting that it corresponds to subunit C and therefore the eukaryotic d subunit</p></caption><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10863_2008_Article_9161_Fig7" id="MO7"/></fig></p><p>It has been suggested that in yeast, the formation of a disulphide bond between Cys<sub>36</sub> and Cys<sub>329</sub> is important for folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">Thaker et al. 2007</xref>). These cysteines are conserved across all eukaryotic species including man, but not in <italic>T. thermophilus</italic>. However, how important disulphide bond formation is to the function of subunit d is unclear, since the protein is normally present in the reducing environment of the cytoplasm where such bonds would not usually persist. Indeed, this bond had little effect on in vitro tertiary structure. Also, a yeast strain expressing a C329A d subunit mutation retained 72% proton transport and 41% ATPase activity levels relative to wild type at its vacuolar membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">Owegi et al. 2006</xref>), suggesting that the substitution is not highly disruptive. Furthermore, the bond between Cys<sub>267</sub> and Cys<sub>322</sub> seen in both hexagonal and monoclinic forms of the bacterial crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">Iwata et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">Numoto et al. 2004</xref>), was proposed by Iwata to be an artefact formed during sample preparation under aerobic conditions. In addition, bacterial H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases containing mutant subunit C with both cysteines replaced by serine are properly assembled and fully functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">Iwata et al. 2004</xref>). All these data suggest that disulphide bond formation is not critical to the function of these orthologous proteins in their native cellular environments.</p><p>In summary, our data indicate that the d subunit in man forms part of the central rotor of the H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. The determination of the location of proton pump components is important, since in order to facilitate the therapeutic targeting of the H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in diseases such as osteoporosis and cancer, it is essential to understand the proper isoform composition and precise localization of subunits within the V<sub>1</sub>/V<sub>0</sub> complex. Such information may aid the development of small molecules that can target exposed regions of the complex in an isoform-specific manner. For example, the possible exclusive co-expression of the a3 and d2 subunit isoforms in the ruffled border of osteoclasts, described previously, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">Smith et al. 2005</xref>), may in the future allow the design of antiresorptive agents that can specifically target this specialized proton pump in the treatment of osteoporosis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Prof. S.
