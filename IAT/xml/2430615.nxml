We have established the involvement of this T3 pathway in the regulation of <italic>in vitro</italic> myoblast differentiation.We have generated mice overexpressing p43 under control of the human &#x003b1;-skeletal actin promoter. In agreement with the previous characterization of this promoter, northern-blot and western-blot experiments confirmed that after birth p43 was specifically overexpressed in skeletal muscle. As expected from <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, in 2-month old mice, p43 overexpression increased mitochondrial genes expression and mitochondrial biogenesis as attested by the increase of mitochondrial mass and mt-DNA copy number. In addition, transgenic mice had a body temperature 0.8&#x000b0;C higher than control ones and displayed lower plasma triiodothyronine levels. Skeletal muscles of transgenic mice were redder than wild-type animals suggesting an increased oxidative metabolism. In line with this observation, in gastrocnemius, we recorded a strong increase in cytochrome oxidase activity and in mitochondrial respiration. Moreover, we observed that p43 drives the formation of oxidative fibers: in soleus muscle, where MyHC IIa fibers were partly replaced by type I fibers; in gastrocnemius muscle, we found an increase in MyHC IIa and IIx expression associated with a reduction in the number of glycolytic fibers type IIb. In addition, we found that PGC-1&#x003b1; and PPAR&#x003b4;, two major regulators of muscle phenotype were up regulated in p43 transgenic mice suggesting that these proteins could be downstream targets of mitochondrial activity. These data indicate that the direct mitochondrial T3 pathway is deeply involved in the acquisition of contractile and metabolic features of muscle fibers in particular by regulating PGC-1&#x003b1; and PPAR&#x003b4;.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Skeletal muscle of vertebrates contain myofibers differing in contractile function, mitochondrial content and metabolic properties. Slow-twitch fibers are characterized by type I myosin heavy chain (MHC) expression and a high mitochondrial density leading to a prominent oxidative metabolism. Fast-twitch fibers express type II MHCs including three subtypes: IIa, IIx and IIb. Type IIb fibers display a reduced mitochondrial density associated with a principally glycolytic metabolism.

This hormone not only stimulates growth of this tissue by increasing the number and diameter of muscle fibers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002501-Sugie1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002501-King1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, but also regulates the transition between neonatal and adult myosin isoforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002501-ButlerBrowne1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> and influences the contractile features of adult muscle fibers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002501-Izumo1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Thyroid hormone acts through nuclear receptors (T3Rs) encoded by the TR&#x003b1; and TR&#x003b2; genes (NR1A1 and NR1A2 according to nuclear hormone receptor nomenclature) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002501-Lazar1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002501-Brent1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. These receptors are ligand-dependent transcription factors that constituvely bind to specific sequences called thyroid hormone response elements (T3RE) located in the promoter of T3 target genes.</p><p>More recently, we have identified in mitochondria two N-terminally truncated forms of the nuclear receptor TR&#x003b1;1, with molecular weight of 43 and 28 kDa (p43 and p28) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002501-Wrutniak1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002501-WrutniakCabello1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. These proteins are synthesized by the use of internal initiation sites of translation occuring in the TR&#x003b1;1 transcript. Despite the occurence of a nuclear localization signal, p43 is specifically imported into the mitochondria according to an atypical process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002501-Casas1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. In gel shift experiments, p43 binds as dimeric complexes involving at least two other truncated forms of nuclear receptors located in mitochondria, mt-RXR and mt-PPAR, to specific sequences of the mitochondrial genome, sharing strong homologies with nuclear T3RE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002501-Casas1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002501-Casas2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002501-Casas3">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Consequently, on isolated mitochondria, p43 stimulates mitochondrial transcription and protein synthesis in the presence of T3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002501-Casas1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Lastly, in CV1 cells, p43 overexpression stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis and respiratory chain activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002501-Wrutniak1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We have previously shown that mitochondrial activity is an important regulator of myoblast differentiation. While inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis by chloramphenicol impaired myoblast differentiation, stimulation of mitochondrial activity by p43 overexpression induced a potent stimulation of terminal differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002501-Rochard1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002501-Seyer1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. This regulation which does not involve changes in ATP stores, allows the expression of nuclear genes involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. In particular, in myoblasts, p43 overexpression stimulates terminal differentiation, by down-regulating c-Myc expression and up regulating myogenin expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002501-Rochard1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002501-Seyer1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, it also induces a preferential expression of the slow myosin isoform, through increasing calcineurin levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002501-Seyer2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>These data led us to examine a potential role of the direct mitochondrial pathway in <italic>in vivo</italic> muscle development and phenotype. To assess the influence of this mitochondrial receptor, we have generated transgenic mice overexpressing p43 under the control of the human &#x003b1;-skeletal actin promoter (HSA), a skeletal muscle specific promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002501-Brennan1">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002501-Miniou1">18</xref>. Here we report, that this overexpression increases mitochondrial gene expression and mitochondrial biogenesis. In addition, p43 induces a shift toward the oxidative phenotype: in soleus, an oxidative muscle, MyHC IIa fibers were partly replaced by type I fibers; in quadriceps, an oxido-glycolytic muscle, we found an increase in the frequency of MyHC IIa and IIx fibers associated with a reduction in the number of glycolytic IIb fibers. These data indicate that the direct mitochondrial pathway is deeply involved in the acquisition of contractile and metabolic features of muscle fibers.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Production of p43 overexpressing mice</title><p>In order to assess the importance of p43 in the control of muscle fiber plasticity and of mitochondrial biogenesis, we have generated mice overexpressing this mitochondrial T3 receptor under control of the 2.2-kb human &#x003b1;-skeletal actin promoter (HSA) flanked by chicken &#x003b2;-globin 5&#x02032;HS4 insulator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002501-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

Mouse oocytes were injected with the construct, and three mouse lines expressing the transgene were obtained. Northern-blot confirmed that p43 is overexpressed in each mouse line.

This feature was recorded in all three mouse lines, despite differences in p43 expression levels. To determine whether this change in muscle color was associated with a fiber type switch, we measured the expression of the four adult MHCs transcripts. RNAs were isolated from quadriceps and soleus skeletal muscles from WT and transgenic mice, and assessed by quantitative PCR. In quadriceps muscle, MyHCIIb transcript levels were lower in transgenic mice than in control mice (&#x02212;58&#x00025;; p&#x0003c;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002501-g006">Figure 6B</xref>).

No difference was observed for MyHCI. These data indicated that in quadriceps muscle, p43 overexpression induced a shift toward a slower contractile phenotype, with an increase in the expression of MyHC IIa and IIx, and a reduction of MyHCIIb. These findings were consistent with the increase in mitochondrial activity previously described. In soleus muscle, a muscle rich in type I and type IIa fibers, we found in transgenic mice an increase in the expression of MyHCI (&#x0002b;191&#x00025;; p&#x0003c;0.05) associated with a reduction of type IIa (&#x02212;44&#x00025;; p&#x0003c;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002501-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). However, no changes were detected for MyHC IIx and IIb which are normally weakly expressed in soleus muscle. In agreement with these findings, on immuno-histological analysis of gastrocnemius muscle, we showed no difference in staining with an antibody raised against MyHC IIa and IIb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002501-g006">Figure 6C</xref>), whereas staining with an antibody only raised against MyHC IIa clearly indicated that IIa fibers were more abondant in transgenic than in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002501-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). In addition, because almost no type I fibers were detected, these data indicate that type IIb fibers were predominantly replaced by type IIa and IIx fibers in gastrocnemius muscle. In transgenic soleus muscle, we found an increase in the number of type I fibers associated with a reduction of type IIa number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002501-g006">Figure 6D</xref>).

P43 expression induced a rise in mitochondrial transcript levels as attested by measurement of COXII and ND2 mRNAs. In addition to this effect, p43 also increased respiratory chain activity as reflected by cytochrome c oxidase activity (COX).

Assessement of the composition of muscle fibers confirms that p43 overexpression induces significant changes in the contractile phenotype of muscle fibers: in soleus muscle, MyHC IIa were partly replaced by type I fibers whereas in quadriceps muscle, we found an increase of MyHC IIa and IIx associated with a reduction in the number of type IIb glycolytic fibers.

The observation that the number of MyHC IIa and IIx fibers were up-regulated in fast muscles (quadriceps) and the number of MyHC I fiber was increased in slow muscles (soleus) of transgenic mice is in agreement with the hypothesis of a limited adaptative range theory where muscles from a slow developmental lineage have the capacity to adapt in the range of I&#x02194;IIa but not type IIb fibers, whereas muscles from a fast developmental lineage can adapt in the range of IIb&#x02194;IIx&#x02194;IIa but not type I fibers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002501-Ausoni1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our data reveal that p43, a mitochondrial T3 receptor can influence the acquisition of muscle fibers phenotype.

However, in contrast to these proteins, p43 is a mitochondrial protein which directly acts on organelle activity, indicating that mitochondria by themselves are able to modify contractile and metabolic features of muscle fibers, and could act upstream of PGC-1&#x003b1; or PPAR&#x003b4; because both of these factors were up regulated in p43 transgenic mice.</p><p>This observation underlines that the mitochondrial-nucleus crosstalk could be involved in muscle specification.

It is probably through this crosstalk that p43 could increase the expression of numerous genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis such as PGC-1&#x003b1;, NRF1, NRF2, Tfam, TFB2m, thus satisfactory explaining the changes of contractile and metabolic features of muscle fibers.</p><p>In addition, our results provides evidence that p43 overexpressing mice leads to an increase in body temperature (about 0.8&#x000b0;C).

It has been reported that PGC-1&#x003b1; and PPAR&#x003b4; overexpression have probably to be considered as major regulators of muscle phenotype. Interestingly, our own data indicate that these factors could be downstream targets of mitochondrial activity. However, as they are also involved in the regulation of mitochondriogenesis, a positive regulatory loop occuring between mitochondrial activity, PGC-1&#x003b1; and PPAR&#x003b4; could be deeply involved in the determination of muscle metabolic and contractile phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002501-g007">Figure 7</xref>). In addition, it appears that the direct T3 mitochondrial pathway mediated by p43, by inducing or stimulating this regulatory loop, is probably able to coordinate the increase in oxidative metabolism and the expression of slower myosin isoforms.

Briefly, thin fibre bundles were excised along the fiber orientation to avoid mechanical damage to the cells.

Fibers were then permeabilized by incubation in solution A supplemented with 50 &#x000b5;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> saponin with gentle shaking for 30 min at 4&#x000b0;C.

Respiratory parameters of fiber bundles (20&#x02013;30 fibers) were recorded at 25&#x000b0;C using a Oroboros oxygraph.
