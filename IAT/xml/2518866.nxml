Mutations in genes and genetic pathways regulating NC development lead to a wide spectrum of human developmental disorders collectively called neurocristopathies. To identify molecular pathways regulating NC development and to understand how alterations in these processes lead to disease, we established an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis screen utilizing a mouse model sensitized for NC defects, <italic>Sox10<sup>LacZ/&#x0002b;</sup></italic>. Out of 71 pedigrees analyzed, we identified and mapped four heritable loci, called <italic>modifier of Sox10 expression pattern 1&#x02013;4</italic> (<italic>msp1&#x02013;4</italic>), which show altered NC patterning. In homozygous <italic>msp1</italic> embryos, <italic>Sox10<sup>LacZ</sup></italic> expression is absent in cranial ganglia, cranial nerves, and the sympathetic chain; however, the development of other <italic>Sox10</italic>-expressing cells appears unaffected by the mutation. Linkage analysis, sequencing, and complementation testing confirmed that <italic>msp1</italic> is a new allele of the receptor tyrosine kinase <italic>Erbb3</italic>, <italic>Erbb3<sup>msp1</sup></italic>, that carries a single amino acid substitution in the extracellular region of the protein. The ENU-induced mutation does not alter protein expression, however, it is sufficient to impair ERBB3 signaling such that the embryonic defects observed in <italic>msp1</italic> resemble those of <italic>Erbb3</italic> null alleles. Biochemical analysis of the mutant protein showed that ERBB3 is expressed on the cell surface, but its ligand-induced phosphorylation is dramatically reduced by the <italic>msp1</italic> mutation. These findings highlight the importance of the mutated residue for ERBB3 receptor function and activation. This study underscores the utility of using an ENU mutagenesis to identify genetic pathways regulating NC development and to dissect the roles of discrete protein domains, both of which contribute to a better understanding of gene function in a cellular and developmental setting.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Genome-wide mutagenesis screens provide a valuable tool to identify genes and genetic pathways regulating complex developmental processes. The neural crest is a population of multipotent cells that gives rise to many different tissue and organ systems. Alterations in the pathways coordinating neural crest formation lead to human developmental disorders. To identify genetic components involved in neural crest development, we combined a whole-genome chemical mutagenesis approach with a mouse strain, <italic>Sox10<sup>LacZ/&#x0002b;</sup></italic>, that marks neural crest progenitors during early embryogenesis. We identified and determined the chromosomal location of four mutant lines that display impaired neural crest patterning. One of the mutant lines identified carries a single amino acid change that is sufficient to alter neural crest development and cause embryonic lethality without impeding upon protein expression, highlighting the importance of the mutated residue for gene function. This study demonstrates the feasibility of mutagenesis screens to identify the molecular players required for neural crest development as well as to dissect protein domain functions.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The neural crest (NC) is a transient population of multipotent stem cells that arises during vertebrate development. Initially specified at the border between neural and non-neural ectoderm at the time of the neural tube closure (embryonic day (E) 8.5 in mice), NC cells undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition and migrate along divergent pathways to distinct regions of the embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000177-Newgreen1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000177-Loring1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. During migration and at the target sites, NC cells respond to various intrinsic and extrinsic factors that specify their differentiation program into specific cell types and tissues, such as neurons and glia of the peripheral and enteric nervous system, smooth muscle cells of the heart outflow tract and cranial blood vessels, chromaffin cells of the adrenal gland, melanocytes of the skin as well as bone and cartilage of the craniofacial structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000177-LeDouarin1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Given their broad developmental potential and contribution to multiple tissue and organ systems, it is not surprising that defects in genes and genetic pathways regulating NC development result in a wide spectrum of developmental disorders, collectively called neurocristopathies. These include various human skeletal dysmorphology syndromes (Apert syndrome and Beare-Stevenson cutis gyrata syndrome), nervous system diseases (Hirschsprung disease) and pigment disorders (albinism and Waardenburg syndrome) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000177-Taneyhill1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

Although the ENU-induced mutation does not alter expression of the ERBB3 protein, we show that the subtle amino acid change is sufficient to disrupt ERBB3 signaling, leading to impaired NC development and embryonic lethality.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>ENU Mutagenesis to Identify Mutations Altering <italic>Sox10</italic> Expression Pattern</title><p>To identify genes involved in NC development, we utilized an ENU-mutagenesis screen for mutations that alter the pattern of <italic>Sox10</italic>-expressing NC cells during mouse embryogenesis.

The ERBB3 protein consists of an extracellular region (EC), a single transmembrane-spanning region, and an intracellular (IC) portion that contains a conserved tyrosine-kinase domain flanked by a carboxy-terminal tail with tyrosine phosphorylation sites. The extracellular region is further subdivided into four domains: domain I, II, III, and IV. Domains I and III are homologous; domains II and IV are homologous. ERBB3 is a kinase-deficient receptor (black X). The D313G is located in the domain II (also known as cysteine-rich region I (CR1)) of ERBB3.

To test the latter hypothesis, we evaluated ERBB3 phosphorylation in <italic>Sox10<sup>LacZ</sup></italic> homozygous mutants. <italic>Sox10<sup>LacZ</sup></italic> homozygotes show reduced <italic>Erbb3</italic>-expressing cells in DRG, cranial and sympathetic ganglia, but <italic>Erbb3</italic> expression persists in somites (similar to <italic>Erbb3</italic> expression in somites and DRG in <italic>Erbb3<sup>msp1/msp1</sup></italic> embryos, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000177-g006">Figure 6B, D, and F</xref>) (Britsch et al., 2001). Analysis of ERBB3 tyrosine phosphorylation in <italic>Sox10<sup>LacZ</sup></italic> homozygous cultures indicated that ERBB3 becomes phosphorylated in the presence of NRG1-&#x003b2;1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000177-g007">Figure 7B</xref>), suggesting that the remaining <italic>Erbb3</italic>-expressing cells in <italic>Sox10</italic> mutants are sufficient to respond to NRG1-&#x003b2;1 stimuli. Therefore the absence of ERBB3 phosphorylation in the <italic>Erbb3<sup>msp1/msp1</sup></italic> cultures is not due to a lack of NRG1-responsive cells, but rather to <italic>msp1</italic>-induced alteration of ERBB3 function.</p><p>To determine whether the <italic>msp1</italic> mutation prevents ERBB3 surface expression, we used a cell surface biotinylation assay on primary embryonic cell cultures. Embryonic cell cultures derived from several independent <italic>Erbb3<sup>msp1/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> intercrosses were stimulated with NRG1-&#x003b2;1 and subsequently labeled with biotin. Wild-type and mutant cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with avidin-conjugated beads and further analyzed by Western blotting. When membranes were probed with the anti-ERBB3 antibody, the band corresponding to the ERBB3 protein was detected in the surface fraction of the <italic>msp1</italic> cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000177-g007">Figure 7C</xref>), indicating that ERBB3 is expressed on the cell membrane. Nonetheless, the band appeared slightly less intense when compared to wild-type. Analysis for tubulin in these samples validated the absence of intracellular protein biotinylation in the surface fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000177-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). Next, we evaluated the phosphorylation status of ERBB3 in the surface fraction using anti-phospho ERBB3 antibody. While ligand-induced phophorylation of ERBB3 was consistently detected in the avidin-precipitated fractions of wild-type cultures, only trace amounts of phosphorylation was observed in the <italic>msp1</italic> embryonic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000177-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). These results indicate that although the majority of ERBB3 is expressed on the cell surface, the mutant receptor is still insufficiently phosphorylated. Interestingly, when <italic>Erbb3<sup>msp1</sup></italic> and <italic>Erbb2</italic> were transiently overexpressed in 293T cells, ERBB3 became phosphorylated in a ligand-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000177.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Collectively, this suggests that <italic>Erbb3<sup>msp1</sup></italic> is a hypomorphic allele and that forced overexpression of the mutant protein can overcome the severe reduction in ERBB3 phosphorylation that we observe <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3a"><title><italic>Sox10</italic> Expression Screen Identifies Loci Essential for NC Development</title><p>A whole-genome ENU mutagenesis screen was designed to identify mutations that alter patterning of <italic>Sox10</italic>-expressing NC derivatives.

Comparative amino acid sequence analysis showed that the mutated amino acid (D313) is conserved among multiple species, suggesting that this residue could be critical for receptor activity. Indeed, biochemical analysis of receptor function revealed that ligand-induced phosphorylation of ERBB3 is disrupted in <italic>Erbb3<sup>msp1/msp1</sup></italic> embryonic cell cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000177-g007">Figure 7A and D</xref>).

However, our cell surface biotinylation assay showed that ERBB3 is expressed on the cell membrane in the <italic>msp1</italic> mutants. We consistently observed a small reduction in surface ERBB3 in the <italic>msp1</italic> embryonic cell cultures, implying that a small proportion of the mutant protein may not be properly folded and trafficked to the cell membrane. While additional studies are needed to conduct a more extensive analysis of the <italic>msp1</italic>-induced effect on ERBB3 stability and conformation, embryonic cell cultures are not the optimal system to address these questions due to the heterogeneous cell populations present in the wild-type and mutant cultures.</p><p>Although ERBB3 is expressed on the cell surface, it still remains insufficiently phosphorylated in the mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000177-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). A second possibility that could contribute to impaired ERBB3 phosphorylation is that the D313G mutation might disrupt the ability of the ERBB3 protein to dimerize with its binding partner and/or bind to a specific ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000177-g008">Figure 8</xref>). ERBB3 lacks kinase activity due to evolutionary substitutions of critical residues within its catalytic domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000177-Guy1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, and thus can only signal within the context of a receptor heterodimer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000177-Sliwkowski1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. In the absence of NRG1, ERBB3 acquires a &#x0201c;tethered&#x0201d; conformation, which renders the receptor inactive. Previous structural studies proposed that, in this conformation, domains I and III are interlocked, thus preventing receptor dimer formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000177-Cho1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, the dimerization arm, a ten-amino acid loop located in domain II (residues 242&#x02013;259 of ERBB3), is bound to domain IV and, therefore, is unable to interact with another receptor. Upon ligand binding, the ERBB3 receptor undergoes a conformational change that allows for heterodimerization to occur. At the center of the dimer interface is a dimerization arm that reaches across and interacts with the dimerization arm of another receptor. The dimerization arm is conserved in all ERBB receptors, and deletions or mutations of these residues have been shown to completely abolish ligand-induced activation of EGFR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000177-Garrett1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000177-Ogiso1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. The <italic>msp1</italic> mutation is within domain II (CR1) of the extracellular region of the receptor. Since this domain is required for the receptor dimerization, one might predict that this mutation indirectly interferes with the ability of the receptor to dimerize with its dimerization partner. It is interesting to note that D313 is located in close proximity to E311 (D313 corresponds to E292 in the mature, processed protein) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000177-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). E311 of ERBB3 corresponds to EGFR residue E317 (E293 in the mature protein), and previous studies with EGFR have shown that upon ligand binding E317 forms a salt bridge with a residue in domain III, facilitating receptor dimerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000177-Dawson1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Given the close proximity of D313 and E311 in ERBB3, it is possible that the D313G mutation interferes with salt bridge formation, thus destabilizing the interaction between domain II/III and preventing ligand-induced dimerization. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the mutation may allosterically disrupt the ability of the receptor to bind to NRG1. While structural modeling provided no clear evidence of either effect, the inability of the ERBB3 receptor to bind to a ligand and/or to dimerize with its dimerization partner would be sufficient to disrupt ligand-induced phosphorylation and impair NRG1/ERBB3 signaling.</p><fig id="pgen-1000177-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000177.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Proposed Mechanism by which the <italic>msp1</italic> Mutation Disrupts ERBB3 Function.</title><p>In the absence of ligand (left), ERBB3 acquires a &#x0201c;tethered&#x0201d; conformation that renders the receptor inactive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000177-Cho1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.

Cells were solubilized in mild-lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1&#x00025; NP-40, 10&#x00025; glycerol) supplemented with 1 mM Na<sub>4</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, 2 mM PMSF and protease inhibitor cocktail (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 30 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C on a shaker, and centrifuged for 15 minutes at 10,000&#x000d7;g. Supernatants were removed and the protein concentration determined by a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). An equal amount of protein (1 mg) of each genotype was precipitated with 100 ul NeutrAvidin agarose beads (Pierce, Rockford, IL) overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with rotation. Beads were washed three times in mild-lysis buffer, and surface proteins were eluted in 50 ul 2&#x000d7; SDS loading buffer supplemented with 50 mM DTT (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Equal volumes (40 ul) of each genotype were separated on 8&#x00025; Tris-Glycine SDS gel, and membranes were blotted with anti-ERBB3 and/or phospho-ERBB3 antibody.</p></sec><sec id="s4l"><title>Site-Directed Mutagenesis</title><p>The <italic>msp1</italic> mutation was introduced in the human <italic>Erbb3</italic> cDNA (Clone ID #6147464, Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL) via QuickChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).
