The cloned 13kb fragment contained the entire constant region gene sequence that is interrupted by three intervening sequences at the junction of domains as previously shown in the gamma 1, gamma 2 b and alpha genes. The amino acid sequence predicted by the nucleotide sequence agrees with that of the mu chain secreted by a myeloma MOPC104E except for 8 residues out of 448 residues. The homologous domains of the mu, gamma 1 and gamma 2b genes are more similar to each other than the different domains of the mu genes are. The result implicates that the class of the immunoglobulin heavy chain genes diverged after the heavy chain genes established the multi-domain structure. The short intervening sequences of the mu and gamma genes are more conserved than the coding sequences except for the COOH-terminal domains. The results implicate that the nucleotide sequence of the intervening sequence is under selective pressure, possibly to maintain a secondary structure of the nuclear RNA to be spliced.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00434-0194.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3933"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00434-0195.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3934"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00434-0196.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3935"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00434-0197.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3936"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00434-0198.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3937"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00434-0199.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3938"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00434-0200.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3939"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00434-0201.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3940"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00434-0202.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3941"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00434-0203.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3942"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00434-0204.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3943"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00434-0205.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3944"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00434-0206.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3945"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
