Recent evidence indicates that Dicer and miRNA may also regulate tumorigenesis. To better characterize the role of miRNA in primary cell growth, we generated Dicer-conditional mice. Ablation of Dicer and loss of mature miRNAs in embryonic fibroblasts up-regulated p19<sup>Arf</sup> and p53 levels, inhibited cell proliferation, and induced a premature senescence phenotype that was also observed in vivo after Dicer ablation in the developing limb and in adult skin. Furthermore, deletion of the Ink4a/Arf or p53 locus could rescue fibroblasts from premature senescence induced by Dicer ablation. Although levels of Ras and Myc oncoproteins appeared unaltered, loss of Dicer resulted in increased DNA damage and p53 activity in these cells. These results reveal that loss of miRNA biogenesis activates a DNA damage checkpoint, up-regulates p19<sup>Arf</sup>-p53 signaling, and induces senescence in primary cells.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>R.

The mature miRNAs assemble into ribonucleoprotein silencing complexes (RISCs) and guide the silencing complex to specific mRNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Du and Zamore, 2005</xref>).</p><p>In mammals, Dicer plays important roles in cell differentiation and tissue morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Harfe et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Muljo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Yang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andl et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harris et al., 2006</xref>), and ablation of Dicer in mice induces embryonic lethality at E6&#x02013;E7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernstein et al., 2003</xref>). Previous studies indicate that Dicer loss correlates with reduced cell proliferation in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kanellopoulou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Murchison et al., 2005</xref>) or increased apoptosis in specific tissues during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Muljo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andl et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harris et al., 2006</xref>), yet global repression of miRNA maturation in cultured cells has also been shown to promote cellular growth, transformation, and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kumar et al., 2007</xref>). Recently, the miR-34 family of miRNAs was found to be a direct transcriptional target of the p53 tumor suppressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bommer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">He et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Raver-Shapira, et al., 2007</xref>), indicating a potential role for miRNAs in tumor suppression.</p><p>To better understand the role of miRNAs in regulating cell growth, we generated mice bearing conditional alleles of <italic>Dicer</italic> and examined the effects of loss of miRNA biogenesis on primary cell growth. Dicer ablation caused a rapid onset of cell senescence in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) in vitro and in developing and adult mouse tissues in vivo. Furthermore, inhibition of miRNA maturation in primary cells induced H2A.X staining, up-regulation of p19<sup>Arf</sup> and p53 tumor suppressor protein levels, phosphorylation of p53, and induction of p53 target genes involved in regulating cell growth and senescence. Deletion of either Ink4a/Arf or p53 genes rescued the cells from premature senescence induced by Dicer ablation. These results reveal that loss of miRNA biogenesis in primary cells induces DNA damage and a premature cell senescence that is mediated by the p19<sup>Arf</sup>-p53 signaling axis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>We performed gene targeting in ES cells using a <italic>Dicer</italic> gene replacement vector, and two Dicer alleles were recovered after Cre excision of the drug selection markers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). ES clones bearing either a Dicer allele with exons 15&#x02013;17 flanked by loxP sites, or a Dicer allele deleted for exons 15&#x02013;17 were isolated. Excision of these exons should result in a Dicer-null allele, as these sequences encode the PAZ domain required for Dicer recognition of pre-miRNA molecules. Furthermore, Cre deletion places the remainder of coding sequences, including those encoding the RNase III domains, in an incorrect translational frame. Blastocyst injections were performed and germline transmission of either the Dicer-null (&#x00394;C) allele or the Dicer-conditional (C) allele was achieved (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Generation of Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> mice and embryonic fibroblasts.</bold> (A) Dicer exons 15&#x02013;17 flanked with loxP sites in targeted ES cells.

Genotyping of embryos harvested from the Dicer<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x00394;C</sup> crosses at varying times during gestation indicated lethality of Dicer<sup>&#x00394;C/&#x00394;C</sup> mice before E8.5 (Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802105/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802105/DC1</ext-link>), and recovery of E7 embryos revealed that 25% (5/20) of the embryos were smaller than wild-type (wt) E7 embryos (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). This phenotype is similar to that reported for a loss of function Dicer allele in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernstein et al., 2003</xref>), confirming that deletion of the floxed region generates a Dicer-null allele.</p><p>Mice heterozygous for the Dicer-conditional allele (Dicer<sup>&#x0002b;/c</sup>) were crossed to produce Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> mice. The expected Mendelian ratio for each genotype was recovered, and Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> mice were indistinguishable from wt mice. In addition, multiple lines of Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> or Dicer<sup>&#x0002b;/c</sup> MEFs were generated from these matings.</p><p>To ablate Dicer function, Cre recombinase was transiently expressed in Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> MEFs by infecting cells with recombinant adenovirus (Ad) encoding Cre. Infection with 200 plaque-forming units of Ad-Cre failed to alter the growth of wt MEFs, yet resulted in a greater than 95% transduction of Cre activity as judged by excision of flox-stop reporter gene alleles in control Gt(ROSA)26 MEFs (unpublished data). Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> MEFs or control wt and Dicer<sup>c/&#x0002b;</sup> MEFs were plated 24 h before Ad-Cre or Ad-control (Ad-&#x003b2;gal reporter virus) infections, and cells maintained at subconfluent densities through 12 or longer days post-induction (dpi) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Southern analysis demonstrated Cre deletion of the floxed exons at 3 dpi (Fig. S1 B). RT-PCR performed on RNA isolated from Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> cells revealed loss of exons 15&#x02013;17 and reduced amounts of Dicer mRNA, suggesting that deletion of exons 15&#x02013;17 also reduced message stability (Fig. S1 C). To confirm loss of miRNA maturation, we examined the global level of mature miRNAs in Dicer-ablated MEFs. miRNA microarray data revealed that &#x0223c;80% of the total mature miRNA molecules were dramatically reduced by 3 dpi, and almost all of the mature miRNA were depleted by day 5 (unpublished data). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Northern analysis revealed that the level of select mature miRNAs in Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> MEFs transduced with exogenous Cre was greatly reduced at 3 dpi (Fig. S1, D and E). Collectively, these results indicate that the addition of Cre to Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> MEFs efficiently depletes Dicer activity and mature miRNAs.</p><p>Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> MEFs were infected with Ad-Cre or Ad-control (Ad-&#x003b2;gal) and recovered at 9 dpi. As a control, wt MEFs were also infected with Ad-Cre or Ad-control. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of asynchronously growing MEFs revealed that Dicer-ablated MEFs were undergoing less DNA replication than Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> MEFs infected with control virus, whereas no difference was seen in the growth rate of wt MEFs transduced with Ad-Cre or with Ad-control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Furthermore, Dicer loss results in a reduction in S phase cells without inducing apoptosis (Fig. S2 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802105/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802105/DC1</ext-link>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Reduced primary cell proliferation and premature senescence in Dicer-ablated primary MEFs.</bold> (A) FACS indicates fewer Dicer-ablated cells undergo DNA replication.

MEFs lacking Dicer proliferate far slower than control-infected MEFs or MEFs retaining Dicer (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Similar results were obtained in Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> MEFs after tamoxifen-induced Dicer ablation in Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> MEFs bearing the CAG-CreER transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hayashi and McMahon, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, induction of Cre activity in Dicer<sup>c/wt</sup> MEFs had no effect on the proliferation of these cells, demonstrating that haploinsufficiency for Dicer does not alter cell growth (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>).</p><p>Although Dicer-ablated MEFs grow more slowly than wt MEFs, the Dicer-ablated cells could be passaged several times before the cells stopped dividing and assumed a large, flattened morphology. To determine if these cells were becoming senescent, Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> MEFs were either mock infected (no virus) or Ad-Cre infected, passaged once at a lower density on 3 dpi, and the media changed every third day. Mock-infected Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> MEFs displayed normal growth characteristics, whereas Dicer-ablated cells displayed flat cell morphology after 9 d in culture. Harvesting and replating cells in fresh media at higher or lower densities failed to stimulate their growth, and approximately half of the Dicer-null cells failed to attach when replated. Increasing the serum content from 10% to 20% also had no effect on Dicer-null MEFs. After 3 wk in culture, foci of cells would appear and begin to expand on the plates. However, genotyping of foci cells revealed that these were MEFs that had escaped Cre-mediated deletion of the Dicer-conditional allele (unpublished data).</p><p>To confirm that Dicer-ablated MEFs were undergoing senescence, the cells were fixed and stained for senescence-associated &#x003b2;-galactosidase (SA-&#x003b2;gal) activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Campisi, 2003</xref>). Little or no staining was detected in the control Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> plates at 9 dpi, whereas SA-&#x003b2;gal activity was readily apparent in the Dicer-ablated cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Repeat experiments using triplicate lines of MEFs were performed, and the percentage of cells showing SA-&#x003b2;gal activity was counted in mock-infected or Ad-Cre infected Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> MEFs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>). Over 40% of the Dicer-ablated MEFs underwent senescence by day 9, compared with less that 5% senescence in nondeleted MEFs, and Dicer-ablated MEFs displayed a 10-fold increase in senescent cells by day 12. Control experiments revealed no difference in SA-&#x003b2;gal activity in wt MEFs at early or late times post-infection using either Ad-Cre or with Ad-control virus (Fig. S2 B).</p><p>Senescent human cells are characterized by the formation of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dimri et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Narita et al., 2003</xref>). In SAHF, chromatin is dramatically reorganized in an Rb- and p53-dependent manner, resulting in striking DAPI-dense accumulations of heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ye et al., 2007</xref>). As expected, the nuclei of Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> MEFs show DAPI-dense chromatin associated with mouse chromocenters (clustered centromeres from multiple chromosomes) before or after mock infection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 F</xref>, left). In contrast, Cre-mediated deletion of Dicer in Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> cells resulted in 20&#x02013;30% of the cells displaying very large aberrant clumps of coalesced heterochromatin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 F</xref>, right), which is observed only in 1&#x02013;5% of mock-infected Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> cells. Although SAHF has not been fully characterized in mouse cells, these DAP1-dense structures in Dicer-ablated cells are reminiscent of the SAHF observed in senescent human cells.</p><p>Senescence can be induced by oncogene activation or by DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Zhang, 2007</xref>), and biogenesis of miRNAs in cell lines has been reported to regulate the expression of oncogenes involved in cell growth control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Johnson et al., 2005</xref>). To examine the effects of Dicer ablation on Myc and Ras levels, we performed Westerns using Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> MEFs infected with either Ad-Cre or Ad-control. However, little difference was observed in the levels of the Myc or Ras (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). In contrast, an increase was readily detected in p53 levels in the Dicer-ablated cells.</p><p>To determine if Dicer loss induced DNA damage, we performed immunofluoresence staining with an antibody to histone H2A.X. Numerous H2A.X-positive foci were seen in Dicer-ablated cells at 12 dpi, but not in control-infected Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> MEFs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). To determine if DNA damage coincides with the onset of senescence, we performed H2A.X staining on Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> MEFs and Dicer-heterozygous MEFs at various times after Ad-Cre infection. Increased DNA damage could be readily detected at 6 dpi in Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> MEFs after infection with Ad-Cre. No difference was seen in the levels of DNA damage in control-infected Dicer-heterozygous MEFs, confirming that the DNA damage in Dicer-ablated MEFs was due to loss of Dicer function (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Dicer ablation induces DNA damage and activates the p19<sup>Arf</sup>-p53 signaling pathway.</bold> (A) Western analysis of Ras, Myc, and p53 levels in Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> MEFs either mock infected (&#x02212;) or Ad-Cre infected (&#x0002b;) at 6, 11, and 15 dpi.

Therefore, we examined the levels of these proteins in Dicer-ablated MEFs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). The data reveal an increase in p19<sup>Arf</sup> levels over time, with higher levels of p19<sup>Arf</sup> consistently found in cells lacking Dicer. Similarly, p21 protein levels are higher in Dicer-ablated MEFs, suggesting that premature senescence in Dicer-ablated MEFs may be due to induction of p19<sup>Arf</sup>-p53-p21 signaling. In addition, activation of p53 could also be detected in Dicer-ablated MEFs as judged by p53-serine18 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Webley et al., 2000</xref>). Control experiments with wt MEFs confirmed that Ad-Cre transduction alone does not alter p19 or p53ser18 phosphorylation (Fig. S2 C).

To confirm that MEFs lacking Dicer could undergo DNA damage&#x02013;induced growth arrest, we examined the response of Dicer-ablated MEFs to adriamycin. FACS analysis in Dicer-ablated cells revealed a large reduction in S phase after DNA damage (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 F</xref>). As expected, DNA replication in p53-null MEFs was only slightly reduced by adriamycin. In contrast, there was no difference in the growth arrest of MEFs lacking Dicer.</p><p>To confirm Dicer loss induces premature senescence by activation of the p19<sup>Arf</sup>-p53 pathway, we bred Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> mice with either Ink4a/Arf-null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Serrano et al., 1996</xref>) or with p53-null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Donehower et al., 1992</xref>) and generated Dicer<sup>c/c</sup>, Ink4a/Arf-null MEFs and Dicer<sup>c/c</sup>, p53-null MEFs. As expected, Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> MEFs lacking either Ink4a/Arf or p53 proliferated faster than Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> MEFs. Deletion of Dicer by Ad-Cre again induced senescence in a majority of Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> MEFs by 12 dpi. However, absence of either Ink4a/Arf or p53 in Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> cells fully rescued the Dicer-ablated MEFs from premature senescence (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 G</xref>). Dicer-ablated cells lacking either Ink4a/Arf or p53 expanded to fill the plates and could be passaged multiple times in culture. Analysis of senescence marker gene expression was performed using total RNA isolated from wt and Ink4a/Arf-null MEFs that retained or lost Dicer. Increased p16 and p19<sup>Arf</sup> expression and expression of the senescence-associated, p53-target genes <italic>p21</italic>, <italic>PAI-1</italic>, and <italic>PAI-2</italic> was observed in MEFs at 10 d post ablation (Fig. S2 D).

To confirm that Dicer prevents cell senescence in vivo, we crossed Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> or Dicer<sup>wt/wt</sup> female mice with CAG-CreER transgenic Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> males, and induced embryonic Cre activation by intraperitoneal tamoxifen injection (3 mg/40 g bodyweight) in females at day 8.5 and 11.5 of pregnancy. Embryos (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 26) were isolated at E14&#x02013;E16, genotyped, and stained for SA-&#x003b2;gal activity. Cre-deletion of Dicer in CAG-CreER transgenic, Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> embryos was confirmed by PCR (Fig. S3 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802105/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802105/DC1</ext-link>). The results demonstrate senescence in cells of the developing limbs in 13 of 13 Cre-transgenic Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). No senescence was detected in the 13 Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> embryos lacking the Cre transgene, or in Cre-transgenic Dicer<sup>c/wt</sup> heterozygous mice. In addition, we crossed Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> mice with K5-Cre transgenic mice that express Cre in keratinocytes and in skin epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zhou et al., 2002</xref>), and examined the follicular cells of K5-Cre&#x0002b;, Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> mice for signs of senescence. All K5-Cre Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> mice displayed loss of hair and a roughening of the epidermis after 2&#x02013;3 mo of age (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>), in keeping with a proposed role for miRNA in the maintenance of hair follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andl et al., 2006</xref>). K5-Cre transgene function in skin was confirmed using the <italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm1Sor</sup></italic>/J mouse (Fig. S3 B).

Analysis of genomic DNA in K5-Cre&#x0002b;, Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> mice documented ablation of Dicer specifically in skin (Fig. S3 C). Fewer and much larger cells were present in the follicular epidermis of mice ablated for Dicer, and SA-&#x003b2;gal activity could be detected in these cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>). Collectively, these data reveal that loss of Dicer can induce a cell senescence phenotype in vivo in embryos and in adult mice, confirming that the premature senescence observed in MEFs after inhibition of miRNA maturation is not an artifact of culture.</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Deletion of Dicer induces cellular senescence in vivo.</bold> (A) SA-&#x003b2;gal staining of embryos after tamoxifen-induced Dicer ablation in utero reveals that loss of Dicer promotes senescence in E16 developing limbs.

Overexpression of specific miRNAs has been associated with several types of human cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Volinia et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Voorhoeve et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brueckner et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, impaired miRNA processing increased the tumorigenic potential of mouse adenocarcinoma cells in orthotopic transplantation experiments, and increased the tumor burden of mice bearing a conditional activated allele of K-Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kumar et al., 2007</xref>). These findings indicate that loss of miRNA processing and an overall reduction in miRNA enhances tumorigenesis. Very recently, the Myc oncoprotein was found to inhibit expression of select miRNAs that have anti-tumorigenic properties in lymphoma cells, offering further support for a role for miRNAs in tumor suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Our data reveal that loss of miRNA biogenesis induces a DNA damage checkpoint in certain primary cells, which promotes p19<sup>Arf</sup>-p53&#x02013;dependent cellular senescence. As p53-mediated senescence has been reported to be an important facet of p53 tumor suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Braig et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2005</xref>), loss of p53 signaling should greatly facilitate the tumorigenic potential of cells with reduced presence of mature miRNAs. Further experiments exploring the effects of p19 or p53 loss on the role of Dicer and miRNA processing in normal cell growth and in tumorigenesis are presently ongoing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Generation of Dicer-conditional mice and Dicer-null mice</title><p>A gene replacement vector was constructed by conventional cloning means using 129SV/J genomic DNA fragments that contained exons 15&#x02013;17 of Dicer, with 2.8 Kbp of 5&#x02032; flanking DNA sequence and 3.6 Kbp of 3&#x02032; flanking DNA sequence. LoxP sites were inserted to flank Dicer exons 15&#x02013;17, and a positive/negative drug selection cassette was inserted adjacent to exon 15 in a Bgl2 site. After electroporation of the linearized targeting vector into AB2.2 ES cells (129S7 strain) and G418 drug selection, multiple targeted ES cells were expanded, and a Cre-expression plasmid was transiently introduced into the ES cells to delete the drug selection cassettes. Selection of the cells in FIAU resulted in the recovery of individual ES clones that either retained the floxed exons 15&#x02013;17 or deleted these exons in the targeted allele, as demonstrated by Southern analysis and by PCR. Several ES cell clones that underwent deletion of the floxed exons or that retained floxed exons 15&#x02013;17 were used to generate chimeric mice by microinjection of the ES cells into C57BL/6 mouse blastocysts. Germline transmission of Dicer-null (&#x00394;C) allele and the Dicer-conditional (c) allele was achieved by breeding high degree chimeric mice to C57BL/6 mice. Genotyping of genomic DNA isolated from tail biopsies of the agouti offspring was performed by Southern analysis performed using an EcoRV digest and a Dicer exon 22 probe to confirm inheritance of the Dicer modified alleles. Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> mice bearing the CAG Cre-ER transgene (Dicer<sup>c/c</sup>, Cre-ER) or the Keratinocyte5-CrePrm transgene (Dicer<sup>c/c</sup>, K5-Cre) were obtained by crossing Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> mice with the Cre mice, and by breeding of the resulting Dicer<sup>&#x0002b;/c</sup>, Cre transgene mice with Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> mice. PCR-based genotyping of Dicer alleles used a combination of three primers: primer 1F-CCAAGATGCAGTGATCATTCC, primer 2F-CCATTGGTGCCAAGACAATG, and primer3R-CAGGCTCCACTCCCTAAC.</p></sec><sec><title>Generation of Dicer-conditional embryonic fibroblasts</title><p>MEFs were generated from E13.5 embryos recovered from timed matings of Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> mice and Dicer<sup>&#x0002b;/c</sup> mice.

Flow cytometric analysis of DNA synthesis and total DNA content was performed by the UMMS FACS Core and Flowjo software.

Similar results were obtained using Ad-Cre, and pBABE-Cre infection of Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> MEFs, and when using tamoxifen activation of Cre in Dicer<sup>c/c</sup>, Cre-ER MEFs. To assess the response of Dicer-ablated cells to DNA damage, three independent lines of Dicer<sup>c/c</sup> MEFs or Dicer<sup>c/c</sup>, Cre-ER MEFs were recovered on day 3 after Cre-induction, and seeded onto 10-cm plates at a density of 7.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells/10-cm plate.
