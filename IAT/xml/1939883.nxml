Because the functional characteristics of the motor are dramatically different for these two forms, it is important to understand whether myosin VI heavy chains are brought together on endocytic vesicles. We have used fluorescence anisotropy measurements to detect fluorescence resonance energy transfer between identical fluorophores (homoFRET) resulting from myosin VI heavy chains being brought into close proximity. We observed that, when associated with clathrin-mediated endocytic vesicles, myosin VI heavy chains are precisely positioned to bring their tail domains in close proximity. Our data show that on endocytic vesicles, myosin VI heavy chains are brought together in an orientation that previous in vitro studies have shown causes dimerization of the motor. Our results are therefore consistent with vesicle-associated myosin VI existing as a processive dimer, capable of its known trafficking function.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Myosin VI is a molecular motor implicated in diverse cell processes, including trafficking endocytic vesicles into the cell, transporting proteins to the leading edge of a migrating cell, and anchoring stereocilia to the hair cells of inner ear sensory epithelia. The motor has been studied in both a monomeric and dimeric form in vitro and is reported to exist as a monomer in the cytoplasm of cells. Because the functional characteristics of the motor are dramatically different for these two forms, an understanding of the activity of myosin VI requires an understanding of its functional form in vivo. To probe the role of myosin VI in vesicle trafficking, we labeled myosin VI truncations with a fluorescent protein and studied the positioning of these constructs on endocytic vesicles. We observed nonradiative transfer of energy between the fluorescent proteins, a process that can only occur if they are brought extremely close together. Our results indicate that, when myosin VI heavy chains bind to endocytic vesicles, they are precisely positioned very close together. Work from other laboratories indicates that myosin VI heavy chains brought together in this manner are capable of dimerization. Our results are therefore consistent with vesicle-associated myosin VI existing as a processive dimer, capable of myosin VI's known trafficking function.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Fluorescence anisotropy measurements are used to demonstrate that, on endocytic vesicles, myosin VI heavy chains are brought together in an orientation consistent with a processive dimer, capable of its known trafficking function.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Altman D, Goswami D, Hasson T, Spudich JA, Mayor S (2007) Precise positioning of myosin VI on endocytic vesicles in vivo.

Though we hypothesize that this is the result of precise positioning of the construct on a UCV, we must also consider the possibility that GFPs are brought into close proximity simply due to the crowding of a high density of GFP-CBD on the UCV surface.</p><p>From our analysis of steady-state GFP-fluorescence emission images of cells expressing GFP-CBD and CBD-GFP, we observed that both constructs are expressed to similar levels in our cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050210-g002">Figure 2</xref>, middle). Furthermore, both constructs exhibit similar ratios of GFP intensities on UCV and in the cytosol, indicating that they are loaded onto vesicles at similar densities and so are similarly crowded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050210-g002">Figure 2</xref>, bottom). Thus, if homoFRET of GFP-CBD were the result of crowding, we would also expect CBD-GFP to exhibit homoFRET when loaded onto UCV. Since this is not the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050210-g004">Figure 4</xref>, middle), crowding cannot be the cause of homoFRET. Instead, the CBD must be positioned on a UCV so that its N-termini are brought together, resulting in homoFRET from an N-terminal (and not a C-terminal) GFP.</p><p>We confirmed this conclusion by examining UCV associated with varying densities of GFP-CBD. If homoFRET were the result of crowding, then reducing the construct concentration on the UCV would reduce close packing of fluorophores and subsequently reduce the occurrence of homoFRET. On the other hand, if homoFRET results from precise positioning of GFP-CBD on UCV, then, even at low densities, the construct will undergo homoFRET.</p><p>To differentiate between these mechanisms, we calculated the steady-state fluorescence emission intensity at the UCV regions selected from the previous steady-state anisotropy analysis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050210-g005">Figure 5</xref> and Materials and Methods). Using these measurements, we probed for effects of GFP-CBD density on homoFRET by looking for effects of varying steady-state fluorescence emission intensity on steady-state fluorescence anisotropy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050210-sg002">Figure S2</xref>).

The lack of correlation indicates that the extent of homoFRET does not depend on the density of UCV-associated GFP-CBD. This supports our conclusion that homoFRET results from precise positioning of GFP-CBD on the vesicle, and not crowding of the fluorophores.</p><p>As expected, when we performed a similar analysis for GFP-CBD regions in the cytosol, where the construct does not undergo homoFRET, we observed no correlation between fluorescence emission intensity and anisotropy.

The instrument response function (IRF) was measured using 10&#x02013;16-nm gold particles dried on a coverslip as a second harmonic generator; full width at half maximum (FWHM) of IRF is approximately 60 ps.</p><p>In our experimental setup, the steady-state anisotropy measured while the laser beam is parked at a single point (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050210-st002">Table S2</xref>) was always higher than the steady-state anisotropy measured using the scanning mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050210-g005">Figure 5</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050210-g005">5</xref>D). This is attributed to a small but detectable depolarization of the excitation laser beam in the scanning mode when using high NA objectives, which is also seen for measurements of a monomeric GFP solution. This effect is negligible for objectives with NA less than 0.8 (unpublished data). A high NA objective was required to discern GFP associated with UCV as puncta distinct from the GFP cytosolic haze.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Fits of time-resolved anisotropy measurements to decay models.</title><p>Fluorescence lifetime and anisotropy decay analyses were done essentially as described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050210-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050210-b036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050210-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;, with minor modifications in the analysis procedure. Briefly, the experimentally measured fluorescence decay is a convolution of the IRF with the intensity decay function. The intensity decay data were fit to the appropriate equations by an iterative reconvolution procedure using a Levenberg-Marquardt minimization algorithm.</p><p>When fitting the models to the decay profiles, <italic>r</italic><sub>o</sub> was constrained to a small window to improve the ability of the fitting algorithm to find the optimal fit. A constrained range of values for <italic>r</italic><sub>o</sub> (0.43 &#x000b1; 0.3) was used for all fits described in the manuscript. This range of values was obtained from unconstrained fitting of cytoplasmically expressed GFP fluorescence emission anisotropy decays (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 8). These fits provided reliable values for the initial anisotropy because the fluorophore does not undergo homoFRET and because the time scale of rotation is much slower than the time scale of the measurement.</p><p>When fitting a model describing two exponential decays to the decay profiles, the two decay times were somewhat constrained to a wide range of values. These constraints involved large windows centered on the expected decay times for the physical processes involved (homoFRET and rotational diffusion). Again, these constraints improved the ability of the fitting algorithm to find the optimal fit.</p><p>It is important to note that the empirical anisotropy decay profile is the convolution of the real-time behavior of the fluorophore with the IRF. This distortion results in an apparent fast decay at the start of all measurements that is an artifact and does not represent anything physical. This artifact is apparent because our sampling rate of 12.2 ps is smaller than the width of the instrument's IRF (&#x0223c;60 ps). This effect is also apparent in the empirical decay for a monomeric GFP in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050210-sg001">Figure S1</xref>).</p><p>The G-Factor was estimated using a fluorescein solution and setting the anisotropy at late times to 0.005. Fluorescence and anisotropy decays were considered well fit if three criteria were met: reduced &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> was less than 1.4, residuals were evenly distributed across the full extent of the data, and visual inspection ensured that the fit accurately described the decay profile.</p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Averaging steady-state images.</title><p>For analysis of steady-state images, <italic>N</italic> nearest-neighbor averaging of a 512 &#x000d7; 512 array of pixel values refers to the following calculation: the pixel value at location (row &#x0003d; <italic>i,</italic> column &#x0003d; <italic>j</italic>) was set to the mean value of pixels spanning rows <italic>i</italic> &#x02212; <italic>N</italic> to <italic>i</italic> &#x0002b; <italic>N</italic> and columns <italic>j</italic> &#x02013; <italic>N</italic> to <italic>j</italic> &#x0002b; <italic>N</italic>.

To account for differences in the optical paths traversed by the perpendicular and parallel emissions, a G-Factor correction was applied to the data as follows. We collected steady-state emission images from a fluorescein sample. Because fluorescein tumbles rapidly relative to the time scale of our measurements, fluorescein provides a pixel-by-pixel readout of the detector output from a source emitting identically in both polarizations. We created a G-Factor image from the parallel and perpendicular fluorescein emission images, and perpendicular images from subsequent experiments were multiplied by this G-Factor image to apply the appropriate correction.</p><p>To create this G-Factor image, dividing the parallel and perpendicular fluorescein images pixel by pixel is insufficient, and results in a correction that is artificially too large. This is because pixel values in the parallel and perpendicular images exhibit Poisson photon noise. To reduce artifacts arising from dividing signals containing noise, the images must first be averaged so as to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. Using simulated data, we determined the extent of averaging required to sufficiently reduce the G-Factor artifact while retaining information about G-Factor variation across the image (unpublished data). To create our G-Factor image, we first applied three-nearest-neighbor averaging to the parallel and perpendicular fluorescein images and then divided the averaged images pixel by pixel. A new G-Factor image was created for each day of experiments.</p><p>After applying the G-Factor correction to the data, anisotropy was calculated at UCV and in cytosolic regions using software developed in ImageJ &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050210-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;.

For example, Volkmer et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050210-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d; measured decay times of 0.17 ns and 2.8 ns.

This apparently reduced initial anisotropy observed in the decay trace is a consequence of the experimental method. It occurs for the following reason: the sample is excited with pulsed polarized excitation every 12 ns, and the time-resolved anisotropy is measured during the 12-ns interval between pulses. However, after a 12-ns interval, not all excited fluorophores have returned to a ground state. Emission from these fluorophores thus &#x0201c;rolls over&#x0201d; to the net emission from the next excitation pulse. Fluorophores that have rolled over have a fluorescence emission that is relatively depolarized due to their rotational diffusion. Thus, this population of fluorophores lowers the initial anisotropy observed in our decays. When fitting anisotropy decay models to the data, we have taken into account this roll-over effect.</p><p>Reduced &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> values for the fits, which were used to validate the goodness of individual fits, are also reported.</p><p>(36 KB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.0050210.st001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio-0050210-st002"><label>Table S2</label><caption><title>Additional Anisotropy Decay Parameters of GFP-Tagged CBD-Constructs</title><p>See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050210-st001">Table S1</xref> legend for more detailed information.</p><p>(37 KB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.0050210.st002.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio-0050210-sv001"><label>Video S1</label><caption><title>Movie of an ARPE-19 Cell Expressing GFP-CBD.</title><p>The video consists of 61 images, captured consecutively.
