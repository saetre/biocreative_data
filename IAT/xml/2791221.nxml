We show that a zebrafish mutant in ETFDH, <italic>xavier</italic>, and fibroblast cells from MADD patients demonstrate similar mitochondrial and metabolic abnormalities, including reduced oxidative phosphorylation, increased aerobic glycolysis, and upregulation of the PPARG-ERK pathway. This metabolic dysfunction is associated with aberrant neural proliferation in <italic>xav</italic>, in addition to other neural phenotypes and paralysis. Strikingly, a PPARG antagonist attenuates aberrant neural proliferation and alleviates paralysis in <italic>xav</italic>, while PPARG agonists increase neural proliferation in wild type embryos. These results show that mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to an increase in aerobic glycolysis, affects neurogenesis through the PPARG-ERK pathway, a potential target for therapeutic intervention.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitochondria, the cellular power plants in most eukaryotic organisms, play pivotal roles in cell signaling, differentiation, and the control of cell cycle, growth and death. Particularly in the nervous system, mitochondrial function is essential in meeting the high energy demand in neurons and glia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008329-Knott1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008329-Mattson1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. During nervous system development, mitochondria regulate neural proliferation and differentiation by supporting the different bioenergetic requirements of highly proliferative neural stem cells compared to postmitotic neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008329-Erecinska1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in various aspects of neuronal and glial dysfunction, aging, as well as in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008329-Knott1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008329-Mattson1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008329-Wallace1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. However, how mitochondria cause and compensate for physiological and pathological challenges, and how this in turn affects neurogenesis, neural development, and nervous system function, remain poorly understood.</p><p>Multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD), also known as glutaric aciduria type II, is an autosomal-recessive inherited disorder caused by mutations in electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) or electron transfer flavoprotein dehydrogenase (ETFDH)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008329-Frerman1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. In mitochondria, ETF, located in the matrix, receives electrons from several dehydrogenases involved in fatty acid oxidation, choline and amino acid metabolism. ETF then transfers electrons to ETFDH, located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, and subsequently, electrons are passed to ubiquinone in the respiratory chain, leading to ATP production<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008329-Ruzicka1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008329-McKean1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. As a result of ETF or ETFDH deficiency, the acyl-CoA dehydrogenases are unable to transfer the electrons generated by dehydrogenation reactions, resulting in the accumulation of various intramitochondrial acyl-CoA esters. There is secondary accumulation of free acids, and other conjugation products (acylcarnitine and acylglycine esters) in blood and urine, including large amounts of the lysine metabolic intermediate glutaric acid, giving the disease its name<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008329-Frerman1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The clinical features of MADD are highly heterogeneous and have been classified as neonatal-onset form with (type I) or without (type II) congenital anomalies, and mild and/or late-onset form (type III). MADD consists of a large spectrum of symptoms, including hypotonia, hypoglycemia, cardiomyopathy, polycystic kidneys, and neurological manifestations such as symmetric warty dysplasia of the cerebral cortex, encephalopathy and leukodystrophy. While there have been case studies reporting the use of riboflavin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008329-Rinaldo1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> and sodium-3-hydroxybutyrate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008329-VanHove1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008329-Bonham1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> as treatment for MADD on a patient-by-patient basis, no systematic therapy has been validated. Moreover, despite the neurodevelopmental and cognitive dysfunction prominent in MADD patients, the anatomical, cellular and molecular abnormalities within the nervous system have not been well documented, and the mechanisms underlying neural phenotypes remain unexplored.</p><p>Here we report the genetic, cellular and molecular characterization of a zebrafish mutant <italic>xav</italic>. We had previously identified <italic>xav</italic> as a mutant that exhibits abnormal motility and aberrant neuromuscular synaptogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008329-Panzer1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. We found that the <italic>xav</italic> mutation resides in ETFDH, which is critical for fatty acid, amino acid and choline metabolism. Because dysfunction of this gene is responsible for human MADD, we performed several cellular and molecular analyses on <italic>xav</italic> mutants and fibroblast cells from MADD patients. Our results advance our understanding of how metabolism affects neural development, link mitochondrial dysfunction and the resulting increase in aerobic glycolysis to neurogenesis via the PPARG-ERK pathway, and suggest this pathway as a target for therapeutic intervention in human MADD.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All zebrafish husbandry and experimentation were conducted under a protocol approved by the University of Pennsylvania's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

This likely reflects an adaptation to insufficient respiration, and is consistent with compensation.</p><p>To further assess mitochondrial defects, we examined the activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is an evolutionarily conserved metabolic sensor that responds to alterations in cellular energy levels to maintain energy balance. AMPK activation occurs in response to ATP depletion and a concomitant increase in the AMP/ATP ratio. Once activated, AMPK phosphorylates numerous downstream substrates thereby initiating a series of responses aimed at restoring cellular energy balance by switching off ATP-consuming, anabolic pathways, such as fatty acid synthesis and protein synthesis and switching on ATP-generating pathways such as fatty acid oxidation and glycolysis.
