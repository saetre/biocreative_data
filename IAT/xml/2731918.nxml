Several target RNA sequences of CUG-BP1 have been predicted, such as the CUG triplet repeat, the GU-rich sequences and the AU-rich element of nuclear pre-mRNAs and/or cytoplasmic mRNA. CUG-BP1 has three RNA-recognition motifs (RRMs), among which the third RRM (RRM3) can bind to the target RNAs on its own. In this study, we solved the solution structure of the CUG-BP1 RRM3 by hetero-nuclear NMR spectroscopy. The CUG-BP1 RRM3 exhibited a noncanonical RRM fold, with the four-stranded &#x003b2;-sheet surface tightly associated with the N-terminal extension. Furthermore, we determined the solution structure of the CUG-BP1 RRM3 in the complex with (UG)<sub>3</sub> RNA, and discovered that the UGU trinucleotide is specifically recognized through extensive stacking interactions and hydrogen bonds within the pocket formed by the &#x003b2;-sheet surface and the N-terminal extension. This study revealed the unique mechanism that enables the CUG-BP1 RRM3 to discriminate the short RNA segment from other sequences, thus providing the molecular basis for the comprehension of the role of the RRM3s in the CELF/Bruno-like family.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The CUG-binding protein 1 (CUG-BP1) was first identified as a protein that binds to the CUG triplet repeat sequence in the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region (UTR) of the pre-mRNA encoding the mytonin protein kinase (Mt-PK), which was suggested to be associated with myotonic dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Subsequently, there have been a number of reports that CUG-BP1 and its homologs bind to specific RNA elements and play various important roles in the post-transcriptional processing of mRNA, such as alternative splicing, translational control and the regulation of mRNA decay.</p><p>Specifically, in the nucleus, CUG-BP1 binds to the CUG repeats in the cardiac troponin T (cTNT) pre-mRNA to regulate the alternative splicing of its pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The zebrafish homolog is involved in the alternative splicing of the &#x003b1;-actinin pre-mRNA upon binding to the Bruno responsive element, which is also referred to as the repeat of uridine and purine elements (UREs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). In the cytoplasm, CUG-BP1 binds to the CUG/CCG sequence in the 5&#x02032; region of the mRNA encoding the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein &#x003b2; (C/EBP&#x003b2;) and regulates the translation to produce a low-molecular-weight isomer of C/EBP&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). CUG-BP1 also reportedly binds to the class III AU-rich element in the TNF&#x003b1; and c-jun mRNAs, as well as to the GC-rich sequence in the 5&#x02032; UTR of the p21 mRNA, and increases the expression levels of their gene-products in the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Moreover, several reports pointed out the importance of CUG-BP1 for the control of mRNA deadenylation and degradation. First, in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte, the embryo deadenylation element [EDEN; U(A/G) repeat in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> maternal mRNAs] was identified as the target sequence of the EDEN-binding protein (EDEN-BP), the <italic>X. laevis</italic> ortholog of CUG-BP1, and the binding of EDEN-BP to EDEN accelerates the deadenylation of the Eg5 mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Further investigations revealed that CUG-BP1 mediates the deadenylation and the decay of the mRNAs, through interactions with the deadenylation enzyme upon binding to a GU-rich element (GRE) in the 3&#x02032; UTR of the TNFR 1B, c-jun, junB, TNF&#x003b1; and c-fos mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9">7&#x02013;9</xref>).</p><p>In the human genome, six proteins have been identified as homologs of CUG-BP1: CUG-BP1, CUG-BP2, CELF3, CELF4, CELF5 and CELF6. They form a protein group referred to as the CUG-BP1 and ETR-like factors (CELF)/Bruno-like family. All of the family members have three RNA recognition motifs (RRM1&#x02013;3): two consecutive N-terminal RRMs and a single C-terminal RRM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Primary structures of the third RRMs of (CELF)/Bruno-like family members and the first RRM of RBMS3.

The conserved signature sequences of RNP1 and RNP2 are indicated by the boxes. The arrowheads indicate the residues that play important roles in the RNA-binding. Two aromatic residues (Tyr406 on &#x003b2;1 and Phe433 on &#x003b2;2), which are characteristic of RRM3, are indicated by the red arrowheads.

In addition, the amino acid sequence of the single-stranded-interacting protein (RBMS3) is compared with the CELF/Bruno-like family members.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkp546f1"/></fig></p><p>RRMs have been found in many kinds of eukaryotic RNA-binding proteins. For instance, 901 RRM-containing human proteins are included in the Pfam release 23.0 database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). RRMs play important roles in sequence-specific RNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14">12&#x02013;14</xref>). In some cases, a single RRM can bind to a structured or a single-stranded RNA in a sequence-specific manner, for example in U1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), U2B&#x02032;&#x02032;/U2A&#x02032; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), Fox-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and SRp20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). On the other hand, two consecutive RRMs often function cooperatively for the recognition of the target RNA, such as in Sxl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), polyadenylate-binding protein (PABP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTBP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) and U2AF65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Furthermore, some RRM-containing proteins have multiple RNA-binding modules and recognize their target RNA molecules specifically by the combination of these RNA-binding modules. For instance, the HuC and HuD proteins, which are members of the Elav-type RRM protein family, have the same domain architecture as CUG-BP1. Their N-terminal consecutive RRMs bind cooperatively to the AU-rich elements in the 3&#x02032; UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), and the C-terminal RRM of HuC reportedly binds to poly(A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). </p><p>The RRM consists of a four-stranded anti-parallel &#x003b2;-sheet packed against two &#x003b1;-helices (&#x003b2;&#x003b1;&#x003b2;&#x003b2;&#x003b1;&#x003b2; topology) and has two conserved motifs, referred to as RNP2 and RNP1, which correspond to the first and third &#x003b2;-strands, respectively. Most RRMs interact with their target RNA molecules on their four-stranded &#x003b2;-sheet surface. Specifically, two well-conserved aromatic amino acids, which are aligned next to each other on RNP1 and RNP2, stack with the bases of nucleic acids. Further examination of the RRM&#x02013;RNA recognition also revealed that in a single RRM, the C-terminal extension of the RRM body frequently plays an important role in increasing the binding strength to RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). On the other hand, in the case of the RNA recognition by tandem RRMs connected by a short interdomain linker, the two RRMs cooperatively provide a large RNA-binding surface for strong binding to the target RNA molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). As described above, there have been several structural reports about RRM&#x02013;RNA interactions. However, the presently available information was not sufficient to allow the prediction of the target RNA sequences for putative RRMs or to understand the diverse RNA recognition modes of the RRMs. Therefore, further structural information about the RRM&#x02013;RNA complexes was desired.</p><p>In the case of CUG-BP1, several types of RNA elements were predicted as the target RNA sequences, as described above. Taken together, the CUG, UG and UA repeats are considered as the fundamental RNA-binding elements of CUG-BP1 thus far. Among the three RRMs of CUG-BP1, the two consecutive N-terminal RRMs (RRM1 and RRM2) cooperatively bind to CUG-repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) and those of the zebrafish CUG-BP1 homolog bind to URE-repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). However, neither RRM1 nor RRM2 is able to bind to the RNA repeats on its own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). On the other hand, the C-terminal RRM3 could bind to the UG repeat by itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>); however, unlike RRM1 and RRM2, it does not target the CUG repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Thus, like the HuC protein, the CELF/Bruno-like family members have multiple RNA-binding modules (RRM1&#x02013;2 and RRM3) that exhibit distinct preferences for the primary and tertiary structures of RNA molecules. In a variety of biological contexts, CUG-BP1 could recognize its respective target RNAs by utilizing various combinations of these binding modules.</p><p>The putative binding sequences for CUG-BP1 (the CUG, UG and UA repeats) are similar to each other. Therefore, in order to elucidate the versatility of CUG-BP1, more precise information about the RNA recognition mechanism of the RNA-binding modules in the CUG-BP1 protein is necessary. However, the mechanism by which CUG-BP1 discriminates between these RNA sequences has remained unclear. Among the three RRMs, RRM3 is the evolutionarily best conserved within the CELF/Bruno-like family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Thus, it is conceivable that the RRM3 of the CELF/Bruno-like family members assumes the principal role for the function of the protein family. Therefore, the elucidation of the sequence preference and the molecular mechanism of the RNA binding of CUG-BP1 RRM3 will clarify the regulation of the CELF/Bruno-like family members.</p><p>Here, we determined solution structure of CUG-BP1 RRM3, and revealed by NMR chemical shift perturbation analysis that it prefers UG repeat sequences rather than CUG and UA repeat sequences. Furthermore, we determined the solution structure of CUG-BP1 RRM3 in complex with (UG)<sub>3</sub> RNA, and elucidated the mechanism for the recognition of the (UG)<sub>3</sub> RNA by CUG-BP1 RRM3. Unlike the canonical RNA recognition mode by a single RRM, the N-terminal extension plays an important role in the RNA recognition by the CUG-BP1 RRM3. Our study, therefore, provides significant insight into the sequence-specific RNA recognition mode of the CUG-BP1 and CELF/Bruno-like family proteins, as well as a comprehensive understanding of the RNA recognition mode mediated by RRM folds.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>The DNA encoding the third RRM domain (Leu382&#x02013;Lys480) of human CUG-BP1 (SwissProt accession no.

In the RNA-free form, the results obtained from the 3D HNHB and HN(CO)HB spectra generally agreed with the pattern of the inter- and intra-NOE intensities.

For the determination of the three-dimensional structures of the RNA molecules, the intermolecular protein&#x02013;RNA NOEs were manually assigned using 2D NOESY spectra with mixing times of 80 and 150 ms. The distance bounds for the protein&#x02013;RNA NOEs were set as follows: the NOEs derived from the RNA molecule in the 2D NOESY spectra with a mixing time of 80 ms were divided into two groups with upper distance bounds of 3.5 and 5.0 &#x000c5;, according to their intensity. Upper distance bounds of 6.0 &#x000c5; were applied for the intermolecular NOEs that could only be identified from 2D NOESY spectra with a mixing time of 150 ms. In total, 90 intermolecular NOEs between CUG-BP1 RRM3 and RNA were used for the structure calculations.</p><p>The structure calculations started from 200 randomized conformers and used the standard CYANA simulated annealing schedule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>), with 40 000 torsion angle dynamics steps per conformer. The 40 conformers with the lowest final CYANA target function values were subjected to restrained energy minimization in implicit solvent (generalized born solvation model) with the program AMBER9, using the AMBER 2003 force field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). The restrained energy refinement consisted of three steps: an initial 500 steps of energy minimization, simulated annealing by 20 ps of Cartesian space molecular dynamics simulation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp546/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>) and a final 2000 steps of energy minimization. Force constants of 32 kcal mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> &#x000c5;<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> for distance restraints, 60/100 kcal mol<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> rad<sup>&#x02013;2</sup> for torsion angle restraints (protein/RNA) and 50 kcal mol<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> rad<sup>&#x02013;2</sup> for &#x003c9; angles were used in the simulated annealing.

Except for the wild-type protein plus the [5&#x02032;-(CUGCUG)-3&#x02032;] sequence, the heat generated due to dilution of the titrants was very small, and thus was ignored for the analysis.

In the case of CUG-BP1 RRM3, five aromatic residues are located on the &#x003b2;-sheet surface: Phe404 and Tyr406 on &#x003b2;1, Phe433 on &#x003b2;2 as well as Phe444 and Phe446 on &#x003b2;3. Among these, Phe404, Phe444 and Phe446 are the well-conserved aromatic amino acid residues in RNP1 and RNP2 in the RRMs. However, the <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>1</sup> angle of Phe404 is &#x02013;60&#x000b0; and that of Phe446 is 180&#x000b0; in the RNA-free form, which are different from those of the corresponding aromatic amino acid residues in the canonical RRMs (180&#x000b0; and &#x02013;60&#x000b0;, respectively).

In the cases of (UA)<sub>3</sub> and (CUG)<sub>2</sub>, according to the increase in the RNA molar ratios (range from 1:0 to 1:2), some of these resonances shifted in a continuous manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A), indicating that for these RNA sequences, the exchange between the RNA-bound and RNA-free forms is fast on the NMR timescale. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, some of the resonances originating from the residues located on the &#x003b2;-sheet surface and the N-terminal extension were significantly affected by the presence of the (CUG)<sub>2</sub> and (UA)<sub>3</sub> RNAs. Eleven residues (Gly397, Asn402, Phe404, Leu408, Val428, Phe433, Lys442, Cys443, Gly445, Gln475 and Leu476) were commonly affected by both of these RNAs.

The G2 base is stacked with Tyr406 and forms a hydrogen bond between the N7 nitrogen atom and the H<sup>&#x003b6;</sup> atom of Lys473 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C). The U3 base is stacked with the well-conserved Phe404 of the RNP2 motif, and its functional moieties are recognized by hydrogen bonds between the O2 atom of U3 and the H<sup>N</sup> proton of Arg478, as well as the O4 atom of U3 and the H<sup>&#x003f5;</sup> atom of Gln475 in the pocket formed by Phe404, Tyr406, Phe444, Phe446, Gln475 and Arg478 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D).

The G4 base was stacked with the conserved Phe446 of the RNP1 motif, and its functional moieties were recognized by hydrogen bonds between the H1 atom of G4 and the O<sup>&#x003b3;</sup> atom of Ser448, the H21 proton of G4 and the O&#x003b3; atom of Ser429, and the H22 proton of G4 and the carbonyl O atom of Ser393, in a pocket formed by Ser393, Gln394, Glu396, Ser429, Lys431, Phe433, Phe446, Ser448 and Lys477 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>E).

The N-terminal extension (Ser393, Gln394 and Glu396) plays an important role in forming this pocket. The Lys477 &#x003b6; protons are located in the proximity of the G4 nucleotide and interact with the O6, N7 and OP2 atoms. At the same time, the Lys477 &#x003b6; protons could interact with the O<sup>&#x003f5;</sup> atom of Glu396 in the N-terminal extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>E). However, the chemical shifts of the &#x003b6; protons of Lys477 were indistinguishable from each other, and the side chain conformation of Lys477 was not defined well enough to unambiguously identify the partner directly interacting with G4. The U5 base was stacked with Phe433 on the &#x003b2;2 strand, and the H3 and O4 atoms of the base were recognized by hydrogen bonds with the main-chain carbonyl and amide groups of Ile434, in a concave region formed by Gln394, Lys431, Phe433, Ile434 and Lys436 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>F).

In the case of the [5&#x02032;-(CUGCUG)-3&#x02032;] sequence, however, a large amount of heat was produced by hydration during the ITC measurement, and we could not fit the raw data to a theoretical curve to obtain an accurate <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp546/DC1">Supplementary Figure S4C</ext-link>). Furthermore, the complex structure revealed that the UGU trinucleotide is the key sequence for the binding.

Thus, we examined the effect of a single alteration at the position of the fourth guanine nucleotide in the target sequence. Assessing the effect of the single alteration of the guanine nucleotide at the fourth position in the [5&#x02032;-(UGUGUG)-3&#x02032;] sequence is difficult, because there are two UGU units in the [5&#x02032;-(UGUGUG)-3&#x02032;] sequence (U1&#x02013;G2&#x02013;U3 and U3&#x02013;G4&#x02013;U5, respectively). Thus, we exchanged the uridine nucleotide at the first position for a cytosine nucleotide, so only one UGU unit was present in the hexamer sequence. We selected the two hexamers, [5&#x02032;-(CGUGUG)-3&#x02032;] and [5&#x02032;-(CGUAUG)-3&#x02032;], and compared their dissociation constants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp546/DC1">Supplementary Figure S4D and E</ext-link>).

To examine the effect of these differences in the N-terminal extension on the RNA-binding activities of the family members, we produced two variants of the CUG-BP1 RRM3 (384&#x02013;480), in which the residues Ala391&#x02013;Gly392&#x02013;Ser393 were replaced by Gln&#x02013;Gln&#x02013;Gln or Pro&#x02013;Gln&#x02013;Gln, respectively. The dissociation constants <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> for binding the (UG)<sub>3</sub> hexanucleotide were 2.5 &#x003bc;M for Gln&#x02013;Gln&#x02013;Gln and 2.9 &#x003bc;M for Pro&#x02013;Gln&#x02013;Gln. These values are almost the same as that for the wild-type CUG-BP1 RRM3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp546/DC1">Supplementary Figure S4F and G</ext-link>). This suggests that in spite of the slight sequence diversity in the N-terminal extension among the family members, except for the Bruno like 4 protein, the RRM3s exhibit similar RNA-binding specificities.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Several previous reports have described the RNA-binding mode and the specificity for the members of the CELF/Bruno-like family. In this study, we solved the solution structure of the third RRM of CUG-BP1 (CUG-BP1 RRM3), an important member of the CELF/Bruno-like family, by NMR. The chemical-shift perturbation analysis revealed that CUG-BP1 RRM3 specifically recognizes the UG repeat sequence, rather than the UA and CUG repeat sequences. Further structural analyses identified a unique molecular mechanism for the recognition of UG repeats by the CUG-BP1 RRM3. The characteristic features of the RNA recognition of the CUG-BP1 RRM3 are the involvement of its N-terminal extension for the formation of the specific nucleotide binding pocket and the unique placement of the four aromatic amino acids (Phe404, Tyr406, Phe433 and Phe446) involved in the stacking interaction of the nucleotide bases on the &#x003b2;-sheet surface.</p><sec><title>The N-terminal extension forms a unique binding pocket in CUG-BP1 RRM3</title><p>The C-terminal extensions of the RRM core reportedly adopt a specific secondary structure and play important roles in the formation of the individual RRM structures, as well as in the specific recognition of RNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). For example, the C-terminal RRM of La protein and the first RRM of U1A protein both have a C-terminal extension that forms an &#x003b1;-helix covering the hydrophobic &#x003b2;-sheet surface of the RRM in the absence of RNA molecules. Especially for the U1A protein, the C-terminal &#x003b1;-helix also plays an important role in the stacking of the bases of the RNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). On the other hand, in the case of PTBP RRM2 and RRM3, the C-terminal extensions lack distinct secondary structures, and they traverse the &#x003b2;-sheet surface of the RRM body and continue to pair with the &#x003b2;2 strand to form a fifth &#x003b2;-strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>The CUG-BP1 RRM3 and the PTBP RRM2 and RRM3 share the common feature that the extension peptide segments (N-terminal for CUG-BP1 and C-terminal for PTBP, respectively) traverse the center of the &#x003b2;-sheet surface of the RRM core and continuously snuggle up to the second &#x003b2;-strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). Although the locations of the extended peptide segments on the &#x003b2;-sheet are almost the same in CUG-BP1 RRM3 and PTBP RRM2 and RRM3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>), the roles of these segments in the recognition of the RNA molecules differ from each other. Namely, in CUG-BP1 RRM3, the characteristic segment Gln394-Gly400 of the N-terminal extension forms a deep pocket that binds the fourth guanine nucleotide with the canonical aromatic amino acid residues on RNP1 (Phe446) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>). This was confirmed by our ITC experiments. The directions of the side chains of Phe404 and Phe446 are important for the formation of the deep pocket on the &#x003b2;-sheet surface with the overlaid peptide. In the free form of CUG-BP1 RRM3, the <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>1</sup> angles of Phe404 and Phe446 are &#x02013;60&#x000b0; and 180&#x000b0;, respectively. In these configurations, the pocket for the G4 nucleotide is not apparent on the surface of RRM3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>A and C). However, binding to the (UG)<sub>3</sub> hexanucleotide changes the <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>1</sup> angles for these residues, to 180&#x000b0; for Phe404 and &#x02013;60&#x000b0; for Phe446, which is necessary for the formation of the deep binding pocket for the G4 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>B and D) [The change in the <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>1</sup> angles mentioned above was confirmed by the change in the pattern of the intra-residue NOEs. For example, in the RNA-free form, the &#x003b6; proton of Phe446 exhibits several NOEs for H&#x003b3;1 of Glu396 and for H&#x003b2;1 of Ser448, reflecting the fact that the <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>1</sup> angle of Phe446 is 180&#x000b0;. In contrast, in the complex form, these NOEs are missing and the &#x003b6; proton of Phe446 exhibits NOEs for the &#x003f5; protons of Phe444, indicating that the <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>1</sup> angle of Phe446 turned to &#x02013;60&#x000b0; (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp546/DC1">Supplementary Figure S5</ext-link>)]. Conceivably, the strict discrimination of the target RNA is thus achieved, as many interactions with the target are necessary to compensate for the energy that is associated with the conformational changes of these aromatic amino acids for the formation of the binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>). <fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Superposition of the 3D structures of the CUG-BP1 RRM3 (light blue) with the fourth guanine nucleotide (blue), and the PTBP RRM2 (gold) with the fourth uridine nucleotide (orange) (PDB ID 2ADB) (stereo view).

The location of Glu396 in CUG-BP1 RRM3 is occupied by hydrophobic amino acids on the C-terminal segment (Leu263 for PTBP RRM2) that form a rigid hydrophobic core, with the aliphatic amino acid residues on the &#x003b2;-sheet surface (I214 and L225 in PTBP RRM2) located at the positions corresponding to Phe404 and Phe446 in CUG-BP1 RRM3. Thus, there is no pocket between the C-terminal segment and the hydrophobic amino acid residues on the &#x003b2;-sheet. Consequently, in the case of the PTBP RRM2, the target RNA mainly contacts the bottom area of the &#x003b2;-sheet, which has a shallow interaction surface.</p><p>As described above, although the characteristic segment (Gln394&#x02013;Gly400) of CUG-BP1 RRM3 is well conserved among the CELF/Bruno-like family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B), slight variations exist among them in the region of Ala391&#x02013;Ser393, just before the conserved segment. However, ITC experiments for the variants of CUG-BP1 RRM3, with the sequence Pro&#x02013;Gln&#x02013;Gln or Gln&#x02013;Gln&#x02013;Gln instead of the Ala&#x02013;Gly&#x02013;Ser sequence corresponding to other members of CELF/Bruno-like family, revealed that the difference in the region has little effect on the RNA-binding activities. This suggests that all of the CELF/Bruno-like family member RRM3s exhibit the same RNA preference and have common functional features.</p><p>A BLAST search for the CUG-BP1 RRM3 sequence, including the N-terminal segment (Ala390&#x02013;Tyr486), indicated that the first RRM of RBMS3 (RNA-binding motif, single-stranded-interacting protein 3) is similar to the CUG-BP1 RRM3 (<italic>E</italic>-value 67). Comparisons of the amino acid sequences of their N-terminal extensions revealed similar amino acid sequences within these RRMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Especially, Glu396 in CUG-BP1 RRM3 is also conserved in RBMS3. As mentioned below, Glu396 in CUG-BP1 RRM3 plays an important role in the formation of the hydrogen-bond network for RNA recognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>E). Thus, it is likely that these proteins have an RNA-recognition mode similar to that of CUG-BP1 RRM3.</p></sec><sec><title>Specific RNA recognition mechanism by the CUG-BP1 RRM3 domain</title><p>The extensive stacking interactions provided by the four aromatic rings of Phe404, Tyr406, Phe433 and Phe446 enable the strong binding of single-stranded RNA by CUG-BP1 RRM3. Three of these aromatic rings, Phe404, Phe446 and Phe433, form the pockets that recognize U3, G4 and U5, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). This explains why the UG repeat is much more preferable than the UA or CUG repeat.</p><p>The base of U3 fits in the pocket by stacking with Phe404, and the O2 and O4 atoms of the U3 base are recognized by hydrogen bonds. Unlike a uridine base, a cytosine base at this position cannot form a hydrogen bonding network. In addition, purine bases may sterically clash within the pocket, and they would lack hydrogen acceptors around this position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Therefore, other bases besides uridine may not be recognized at this position.</p><p>Many of the functional moieties of G4 are well recognized through the hydrogen bonds within the pocket of Phe446, as described in the &#x02018;Results&#x02019; section. As mentioned above, we excluded the interacting partner for Lys477 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>. However, it is likely that Glu396 and Lys477 cooperatively form a network of hydrogen bonds that recognize the G4 base. Interestingly, the Glu396 and Lys477 residue pair is well conserved among the CELF/Bruno-like family members. The substitution of G4 by adenine is predicted to significantly reduce the interaction with the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, middle panel). Actually, ITC experiments for the RNA sequences [5&#x02032;-(CGUGUG)-3&#x02032;] and [5&#x02032;-(CGUAUG)-3&#x02032;] revealed the importance of the fourth guanine nucleotide in the RNA sequence. Interestingly, among the known RRM&#x02013;RNA complex structures, when a guanine nucleotide resides in the position corresponding to G4 in the CUG-BP1 RRM3, all of the base conformations of these guanine nucleotides adopted a <italic>syn</italic> conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). However, the base conformation of G4 in the CUG-BP1 RRM3 adopted an <italic>anti</italic> conformation, suggesting a novel aspect of the RRM&#x02013;RNA interaction.</p><p>Similarly, as the O4 and H3 of the U5 base are well recognized by the main chain amide and carbonyl groups, its substitution by a cytosine base is predicted to result in the loss of all of these hydrogen bonds, and to cause steric hindrance, due to the amino group attached to C4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, lower panel). Therefore, we concluded that this position should be occupied by a uridine residue. Taken together, the UGU triplet is the core for the sequence-specific RNA recognition by the CUG-BP1 RRM3.</p><p>In the case of the G2 nucleotide, no obvious pocket is formed for the base recognition. However, the base of G2 is stacked with Tyr406, which is characteristic of the CUG-BP1 RRM3, and only one hydrogen bond is formed with the side chain of Lys473 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). This hydrogen bond would be preserved by a substitution with an adenine base, without a conformational change of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, middle panel). We concluded that the key RNA sequence for the CUGBP1 RRM3 is the tetraplet (G/A)UGU. In this way, the present structural study revealed the anomalous recognition mechanism of the tetraplet (G/A)UGU sequence by the CUG-BP1 RRM3. Among the several specific RNA elements reported as targets of CELF/Bruno-like family members, the GU-rich sequences [otherwise known as a GRE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>)], the embryo deadenylation element [EDEN; U(A/G) repeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>)], the Bruno responsive element [also referred to as repeat elements of uridine and purine, UREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>)] and the class III AU-rich element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) of (pre-) mRNAs contain UGU units. Importantly, in many cases, the UGU sequences are scattered within repeats of similar UAU units. The strict discrimination of short UGU units from repeats of UAU units by CUG-BP1 RRM3 may thus be necessary for the function of CELF/Bruno-like family members.</p><p>The CUG triplet has been considered as the target sequence for the CUG-BP1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). However, the UGU triplet or UG-repeat, rather than the CUG triplet, is also reportedly important for the binding of the CUG-BP1 family proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). This notion is quite consistent with the present study on the functional importance of CUG-BP1 RRM3.</p></sec><sec><title>The roles of the two RNA-binding sites in the CUG-BP1 protein</title><p>Previously, it was reported that RRM1-RRM2 of CUG-BP1 could also cooperatively bind to the UG-repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). However, the N-terminal extensions of the CUG-BP1 RRM1 and RRM2 lack sequences homologous to that in RRM3. In addition, the characteristic aromatic residues located on the &#x003b2;-sheet in the CUG-BP1 RRM3 (Tyr406, Phe433, Phe444 and Phe446) are not conserved in the CUG-BP1 RRM1 and RRM2. Furthermore, a previous study suggested that RRM1 and RRM2 mainly bind to the CUG-repeat sequence, in contrast to RRM3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). This suggests that the RRM1&#x02013;RRM2 di-domains in CUG-BP1 could bind to the target RNA in a different manner than the RRM3 mono-domain, and that CUG-BP1 targets various RNA sequences by utilizing the distinct RNA-binding affinities of the two independent RNA-binding sites: RRM1&#x02013;RRM2 and RRM3.</p><p>The present structural study revealed the substantial role of CUG-BP1 RRM3 in the recognition and discrimination of the target RNA. The precise structural analysis of the two N-terminal RRMs will lead to a comprehensive understanding of the functions of this protein family.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>ACCESSION NUMBERS</title><p>Protein Data Bank, with the accession codes 2RQ4 and 2RQC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp546/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="gkp546_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="gkp546_nar-00615-r-2009-File011.doc"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="ps" xlink:href="gkp546_nar-00615-r-2009-File012.eps"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="ps" xlink:href="gkp546_nar-00615-r-2009-File013.eps"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="ps" xlink:href="gkp546_nar-00615-r-2009-File014.eps"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="ps" xlink:href="gkp546_nar-00615-r-2009-File015.eps"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="ps" xlink:href="gkp546_nar-00615-r-2009-File016.eps"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>The RIKEN Structural Genomics/Proteomics Initiative (RSGI); the National Project on Protein Structural and Functional Analyses of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan; the Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP) (to the Muto research groups); and by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) and by the Volkswagen Foundation (to P.G.).</p><p><italic>Conflict of interest statement</italic>.
