Male gametogenesis (pollen grain development) is fundamental to plant sexual reproduction. The role of two abundant, pollen-specific AGPs, AGP6, and AGP11, have been investigated here. The pollen specificity of these proteoglycans suggested that they are integral to pollen biogenesis and their strong sequence homology indicated a potential for overlapping function. Indeed, single gene transposon insertion knockouts for both AGPs showed no discernible phenotype. However, in plants homozygous for one of the insertions and heterozygous for the other, in homozygous double mutants, and in RNAi and amiRNA transgenic plants that were down-regulated for both genes, many pollen grains failed to develop normally, leading to their collapse. The microscopic observations of these aborted pollen grains showed a condensed cytoplasm, membrane blebbing and the presence of small lytic vacuoles. Later in development, the generative cells that arise from mitotic divisions were not seen to go into the second mitosis. Anther wall development, the establishment of the endothecium thickenings, the opening of the stomium, and the deposition of the pollen coat were all normal in the knockout and knockdown lines. Our data provide strong evidence that these two proteoglycans have overlapping and important functions in gametophytic pollen grain development.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Arabidopsis</italic></kwd><kwd>arabinogalactan proteins</kwd><kwd>knockouts</kwd><kwd>pollen development</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pollen ontogeny is an attractive model to study cell division and differentiation. The progression from proliferating microspores to terminally differentiated pollen is characterized by a large-scale repression of early programme genes and the activation of a unique late gene-expression programme in mature pollen. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, all microsporocytes will eventually undergo meiosis, resulting in tetrads of haploid microspores, each of which will, in turn, develop into a pollen grain. This pattern of development is quite clear, but little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. Only now, are the roles of specific genes involved in male gametogenesis beginning to be understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Honys <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Quan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Toller <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) are a class of structurally complex proteoglycans, present at the surface of cells throughout the plant kingdom. The protein backbones of AGPs are rich in proline/hydroxyproline, serine, alanine, and threonine and are modified by the addition of type II arabinogalactan polysaccharides and arabinose oligosaccharides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Showalter, 2001</xref>). AGPs can be divided into several classes: classical AGPs, lysine-rich AGPs, AG peptides, fasciclin-like AGPs (FLAs), and other chimeric AGPs. AGP6 and AGP11 are classical AGPs as they have the characteristic 85&#x02013;151 amino acids and consist of an N-terminal signal peptide, a Pro/Hyp-rich AGP central domain and a predicted C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) lipid anchor addition sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Schultz <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Showalter, 2001</xref>). By contrast, lysine-rich AGPs have a small lysine-rich region within the classical AGP domain; AG peptides are typically only 10&#x02013;15 amino acids in length; and FLAs contain both AGP and fasciclin-like domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schultz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yang and Showalter, 2007</xref>). GPI anchored AGPs are believed to be tethered to the external surface of the plasma membrane and are then released to the extracellular matrix as a consequence of the cleavage action of specific phospholipases. GPI anchoring and release may confer localized or polarized targeting and alter the functional properties of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lalanne <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p><p>AGPs have been implicated in diverse developmental processes, including somatic embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">van Hengel and Roberts, 2002</xref>), cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Serpe and Nothnagel, 1994</xref>), cell expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Willats and Knox, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vissenberg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>), programmed cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Motose <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), wound responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guan and Nothnagel, 2004</xref>), root morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Seifert <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), pollen tube growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cheung <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Levitin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), and plant hormonal signalling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Suzuki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Evidence implicating AGPs in sexual reproduction has been obtained by our group, for several plant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coimbra and Salema, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coimbra and Duarte, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Coimbra <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Recently, the selective labelling obtained with AGP glycan monoclonal antibodies during <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> pollen and pistil development, suggested that some AGPs glycan epitopes are markers for gametophytic cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Coimbra <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Despite the presence of tissue-specific carbohydrate epitopes on AGPs, these investigations do not allow the characterization of a single type of AGP, but a set of AGPs with similar epitopes. Antibodies bind to carbohydrate epitopes that are present on AGPs with different protein backbones, and at the same time, individual protein backbones may be differentially glycosylated.</p><p>The expression profiles of AGPs in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> were obtained from several microarray hybridization data sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zimmermann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>).

It is worth noting that, in all lines, anther wall tissues were found to be well preserved and the anthers dehisced similarly to wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2C&#x02013;F</xref>), indicating the pollen-specific nature of the phenotype. The opening of the anthers was further evaluated by scanning electron microscopy observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2G, H</xref>). The collapsed pollen grains phenotype was also characterized by transmission electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2I, J</xref>), which clearly showed the degeneration of pollen contents.</p></sec><sec><title>Down-regulation of <italic>AGP6</italic> and <italic>AGP11</italic> in transgenic plants</title><p>To complement this work, RNAi and amiRNA approaches were used to knock down the expression of the two genes in transgenic plants. 35S promoter-driven RNAi and Pro<italic>AGP6</italic>-driven amiRNA constructs were generated, due to the controversy related to the efficiency of the 35S promoter in pollen.

The phenotype of these transgenic lines was analysed further by electron microscopy observations of anthers. Both types of plants show a normal pattern of development up to the young microspore stage. No differences were observed inside the anther locules, during the whole process of meiotic division up to the tetrad stage of pollen development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>). The collapse of pollen grains starts at the stage of the young microspore and is accompanied by extensive shrinkage of the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref>), blebbing of the plasma membrane, and a striking separation of the plasma membrane from the intine wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4D</xref>) compared to the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4F</xref>). In some of the observed pollen grains, asymmetric cell division occurred, although the second pollen mitosis was never observed and lytic vacuoles appeared in the entire pollen cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4E</xref>). At later stages of development, the collapse of pollen was even more remarkable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4G, H</xref>) due to the degeneration of all the pollen grain contents.

Both are strongly and specifically expressed in pollen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Pereira <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). By careful inspection of the images collected of Pro<italic>AGP6</italic>:GFP plants, no evidence was found of GFP fluorescence outside pollen grains or pollen tubes. The green yellow light emitted by the anther walls at later stages of development are due to the autofluorescence typical of the lignin thickenings of the endothecium. These data contribute to the increasingly comprehensive view of the behaviour of individual genes in each gene family and of the gametophytic reprogramming of gene expression in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p><p>A reverse genetics approach was undertaken in an attempt to characterize further the biological significance of the two genes, <italic>AGP6</italic> and <italic>AGP11</italic>, during pollen development. In the single T-DNA insertional null mutants of either <italic>AGP6</italic> or <italic>AGP11</italic>, no macroscopic or microscopic phenotypic alterations were observed, as compared to wild-type <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, corroborating a suggestion hypothesized earlier that these two genes have redundant functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Pereira <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). These conclusions are conflicting to those reached by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Levitin <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref> who used lines of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> carrying single point mutations in <italic>AGP6</italic>. It is not clear how single point mutations in AGP genes could affect function so dramatically. Even if a proline hydroxylation site or an O-Hyp glycosylation site was affected, the polypeptide chains of AGPs are thought to be abundantly and repetitively glycosylated by the specific population of glycosyltransferases. One sugar chain less may be predicted to have minor consequences.</p><p>The production of double or multiple gene null mutants is of crucial importance to the study of gene function in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p><p>In plants homozygous for one of the insertions and heterozygous for the other and in double homozygous mutant lines, many of the pollen grains failed to develop normally and collapsed, indicating that the genes are important gametophytically for pollen development.</p><p>Mutants are gametophytic if they disrupt genes that act after meiosis in the haploid phase of pollen development, and thus only the pollen grains carrying the mutant allele are expected to be affected. Whereas this may explain the presence of both normal and abnormal pollen in the F<sub>1</sub> heterozygous lines, in the homozygous <italic>agp6 agp11</italic> mutants there was some pollen viability, since a low percentage of the pollen grains were able to develop and germinate into functional pollen tubes, as assessed by the presence of seeds in self-pollinated plants. This indicates either that AGP6 and AGP11 are non-essential for stabilizing pollen grain development, or that an alternative pathway, potentially involving the ectopic or up-regulation of the expression of other AGPs, is able partially to compensate for the loss of the two proteins. Indeed, the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> AGP family contains at least 47 members and several AGPs have been shown to be expressed in pollen grains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schultz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lalanne <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). In many multigene families, redundancy frequently thwarts efforts to obtain a phenotype and thus infer a function for the protein. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Edelman and Gally (2001)</xref> suggested that gene degeneracy should be considered in addition to redundancy, signifying that important development processes may be &#x02018;covered&#x02019; by several proteins, any of which might accomplish the task in the absence of another. For instance, although the MADS box gene, AGAMOUS (AG), is essential for stamen and carpel development, it has been shown that, in some mutant backgrounds, even in the absence of AG, sepals can be converted into carpelloid organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Pinyopich <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). This indicates an AG-independent pathway for carpel development. This may help to explain why some pollen grains developed in the homozygous <italic>agp6 agp11</italic> background.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Levitin <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref> recently showed that AGP6 and AGP11 are involved in pollen tube growth. The authors suggest that the reduction of <italic>AGP6</italic> and of <italic>AGP11</italic> expression by RNAi caused inhibition of pollen tube growth and hampered pollen release. By contrast, it has been shown here that the reduction in fertility is due to the abortion of pollen grains during development. Knockout and knockdown mutants have been studied in detail and the only morphological trait affected by the absence or down-regulation of <italic>AGP6</italic> and <italic>AGP11</italic> is pollen abortion.</p><p>In recent years, a number of AGP mutants have been generated that are helping to identify the function of the products of various gene family members and to provide a framework to explore the underlying mechanisms of AGP function. A study of the overexpression of tomato LeAGP1 linked this protein to cytokinin signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sun <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). AGP30 was shown to be required for root regeneration and seed germination and to enhance the plants response to abcisic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">van Hengel and Roberts, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">van Hengel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). AGP18 is essential for female gametogenesis as functional megaspores in RNAi plants failed to enlarge and divide, resulting in ovule abortion and reduced seed set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acosta-Garcia and Vielle-Calzada, 2004</xref>). AGP17 might influence <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> binding, either by providing a binding site on the root surface or by reducing free salicylic acid levels through a signal transduction pathway involving the GPI anchor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gaspar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p><p>As all classical AGPs possess GPI anchors, it has been suggested that AGPs are involved in interactions with other membrane proteins, in cell&#x02013;cell recognition events and in signal transduction pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Seifert and Roberts, 2007</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lalanne <italic>et al.</italic> (2004)</xref> have shown that preventing GPI anchor addition results in pollen tube growth defects. Heterozygous GPI biosynthetic knockout mutations in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> had no effects on sporophytic development and megagametogenesis, but showed male gametophyte-specific effects that almost completely blocked transmission through pollen. Similar experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alfieiri <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>) were used to show that GPI-anchored proteins were important for sperm-egg adhesion in mammals.</p><p>On the whole, the evidence presented here indicates that <italic>AGP6</italic> and <italic>AGP11</italic> are functionally redundant genes with important roles in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> pollen grain development.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Raquel Figueiredo for helping with the amiRNA constructs.
