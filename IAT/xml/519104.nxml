A functional peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) responsive element (PPRE) and a myocite-specific (MEF2) site that binds MEF2A and MEF2C in the promoter of this gene had been previously identified. We investigated the roles of the PPRE and the MEF2 binding sites and the potential interaction between PPAR&#x003b1; and MEF2C regulating the CPT1&#x003b2; gene promoter. Mutation analysis indicated that the MEF2 site contributed to the activation of the CPT1&#x003b2; promoter by PPAR in C2C12 cells. The reporter construct containing the PPRE and the MEF2C site was synergistically activated by co-expression of PPAR, retinoid X receptor (RXR) and MEF2C in non-muscle cells. Moreover, protein-binding assays demonstrated that MEF2C and PPAR specifically bound to one another <italic>in vitro</italic>. Also for the synergistic activation of the CPT1&#x003b2; gene promoter by MEF2C and PPAR&#x003b1;-RXR&#x003b1;, a precise arrangement of its binding sites was essential.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The incorporation of activated long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria, which are then catabolized through &#x003b2;-oxidation, is carried out by the mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) system. CPT1 [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh806c1">1</xref>)], the outer membrane component of this system, is the main regulatory step in the &#x003b2;-oxidation pathway. CPT1 is thus a suitable site for the pharmacological control of fatty acid oxidation, potentially useful in situations such as diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh806c2">2</xref>) or heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh806c3">3</xref>). CPT1 is encoded by at least two genes known as L-CPT1 (or -&#x003b1;) and M-CPT1 (or -&#x003b2;) on the basis of the tissues, liver (L-) or muscle (M-), where the expression of each one was first described. However, CPT1&#x003b2; is expressed, in addition to skeletal muscle, in heart, testis and brown and white adipose tissue, whereas CPT1&#x003b1; has a more widespread distribution. CPT1&#x003b2; expression increases in the heart after birth [in terms of <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh806c4">4</xref>)] or after fasting [in terms of mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh806c5">5</xref>)] concomitant with an increase in circulating levels of fatty acids. This expression pattern may be of great significance since fatty acids are the major source of energy for heart, skeletal muscle and brown adipose tissue.</p><p>We (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh806c6">6</xref>), and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh806c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh806c7">7</xref>), had shown that CPT1&#x003b2; is a target gene for the action of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), nuclear receptor transcription factors that are regulated by fatty acids and derivative metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh806c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh806c13">13</xref>), and had localized a PPAR responsive element (PPRE) upstream of the first exon of this gene. There are three related PPAR family members, PPAR&#x003b1;, PPAR&#x003b3; and PPAR&#x003b4;. According to several lines of evidence, PPAR&#x003b1;, through the regulation of CD36&#x0002f;FAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh806c14">14</xref>), acyl-CoA synthetase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh806c15">15</xref>), CPT1&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh806c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh806c7">7</xref>), CPTII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh806c16">16</xref>) and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh806c17">17</xref>) stimulates, respectively, fatty acid transport into the cell, its activation, import into the mitochondria and &#x003b2;-oxidation.</p><p>In the human CPT1&#x003b2; gene promoter, the PPRE is flanked by one E-box motif and a myocite-specific (MEF2) binding site; this organization is highly conserved in the mouse, sheep and rat CPT1&#x003b2; gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh806c18">18</xref>). The MEF2 site of the CPT1&#x003b2; gene binds MEF2A and MEF2C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh806c19">19</xref>), which are members of the MADS family of transcription factors that have been implicated in the regulation of muscle-selective gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh806c20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh806c25">25</xref>). The PPAR&#x003b1;-mediated regulation of the CPT1&#x003b2; gene is enhanced by the PPAR&#x003b3; coactivator-1 (PGC-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh806c26">26</xref>) that also interacts with MEF2C to up-regulate GLUT4 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh806c27">27</xref>) or MEF2A to stimulate CPT1&#x003b2; expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh806c28">28</xref>). To gain more insight into the tissue-specific control of CPT1&#x003b2; gene expression, we examined the basis of the specific expression of this gene in muscle cells. We conclude that the activity of the CPT1&#x003b2; promoter is controlled by a synergistic mechanism involving MEF2C and the heterodimer PPAR&#x003b1;&#x02013;RXR&#x003b1;, through a physical interaction between PPAR and MEF2C in a distance-dependent manner with sequences closely localized upstream of exon 1A.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>pCPTluc containing a 380 bp fragment of the human CPT1&#x003b2; gene was constructed by PCR using a pair of oligonucleotide primers, CPTF2 and CPTR2 (for sequences of all oligonucleotides used in this work, see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh806tb1">1</xref>), corresponding to coordinates &#x02212;905 to &#x02212;883 and &#x02212;525 to &#x02212;541 from the translation origin, respectively, of the human CPT1&#x003b2; gene, and pCPT-CAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh806c6">6</xref>) as template.

In all cells studied, the basal expression of the construct was similar (data not shown) but, unexpectedly, induction mediated by PPAR&#x003b1;&#x0002f;RXR&#x003b1; was higher in C2C12 myotubes, in which a 38-fold induction from basal activity was observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh806f1">1</xref>B). Analysis of the 5&#x02032; flanking region of the human CPT1&#x003b2; gene by the TFSEARCH routine showed the presence of a putative myogenic binding sequence (MEF-2 site) located at coordinates &#x02212;759 to &#x02212;744 from initial ATG, and neighboring the PPRE (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh806f1">1</xref>A). The higher PPAR&#x003b1; responsiveness in C2C12 cells was correlated with the presence of proteins able to bind to MEF2 sites in the C2C12 nuclear extracts (data not shown). The positive correlation between the presence of such myogenic proteins and the increase in the response to PPAR&#x003b1; observed in C2C12 suggested a mechanism of synergy between myogenic proteins and the heterodimer PPAR&#x003b1;&#x0002f;RXR&#x003b1;.</p></sec><sec><title>The MEF-2 sequence binds MEF2C: mutation of these sequences affects PPAR&#x003b1; responsiveness</title><p>We performed gel mobility shift assays to analyze whether MEF2C binds to the putative MEF2 site of the CPT1&#x003b2; gene. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh806f2">2</xref>A shows how, when the wild-type sequence (lanes 1&#x02013;3) was used as a probe in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), <italic>in vitro</italic>-transcribed and <italic>in vitro</italic>-translated MEF2C was able to promote shifted bands, whereas the mutation of the MEF2 site (lanes 4 and 5) abolished such binding. Moreover, specific MEF2 antibodies promote a supershifted band (lane 3). To confirm the functional importance of this <italic>cis</italic> element on the transcriptional activity of the CPT1&#x003b2; promoter, we generated a construct in which one copy of the MEF-2 sequence was cloned upstream of an SV40-driven <italic>luc</italic> reporter and then transfected this plasmid in C2C12 cells. This plasmid showed an increased basal expression when compared to the empty vector (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh806f2">2</xref>B), thus identifying these sequence as a functional MEF2 binding site. To confirm the function of this site on the CPT1&#x003b2; gene promoter activity, we analyzed the effect of the overexpression of MEF2C on the activity of a luciferase reporter construct driven either by the wild type or a MEF2 site mutant version of the CPT1&#x003b2; promoter on CV-1 cells. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh806f2">2</xref>C shows how the response to MEF2C is eliminated by the mutation of the MEF2 site. To further investigate the synergy between MEF2C and PPAR&#x003b1;, a <italic>luc</italic> reporter construct was generated in which a 46 bp fragment of the CPT1&#x003b2; gene promoter flanking the PPRE was cloned directly upstream of the <italic>luc</italic> gene (p<italic>CPT-B211</italic>). Furthermore, mutation of the MEF-2 site (pCPT-<italic>B211mutMEF2</italic>) was performed as well. When assaying relative basal activities for each plasmid in C2C12 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh806f2">2</xref>D), we found that the mutation of the MEF-2 element, which did not affect the PPAR-RXR binding (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh806f2">2</xref>A; lanes 6&#x02013;9), surprisingly, did not affect basal activity in C2C12 cells but, in contrast, dramatically reduced the activity observed in the presence of PPAR&#x003b1;&#x0002f;RXR&#x003b1; when compared to the wild-type promoter construct.</p></sec><sec><title>PPAR&#x003b1;&#x0002f;RXR&#x003b1; and MEF2C cooperate at the transcriptional level in the CPT1&#x003b2; gene promoter</title><p>In order to check the synergy between MEF2C and the PPAR&#x003b1;&#x0002f;RXR&#x003b1;, we carried out transient transfections in CV-1 cells using pCPT<italic>luc</italic> as reporter and assaying the effect of cotransfection with expression vectors for PPAR&#x003b1;, RXR&#x003b1; and MEF2C. To analyze the effect of the presence of ligand, we performed these experiments using charcoal-stripped serum in combination with the presence or absence of a synthetic ligand for PPAR&#x003b1;. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh806f3">3</xref>, MEF2C induces the expression of CPT1&#x003b2; promoter (lane 5), confirming the role of these proteins in muscle-specific transcription of this gene. It also promotes a synergistic activation when coexpressed with PPAR&#x003b1;&#x0002f;RXR&#x003b1; in the presence of ligand (compare lanes 4, 5 and 7).

While assaying relative basal activities for each plasmid in C2C12 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh806f6">6</xref>A), we found that the mutation of the MEF2C responsive sequence produces a little decrease in basal activity and a clear reduction of the activity in the presence of PPAR.</p><p>Showing the functionality of the interaction between PPAR and MEF2C, only those constructs that maintained the natural spatial disposition of the binding sites for these proteins respect de DNA helix (<italic>pCPT</italic> and <italic>pCPT-M10</italic>) were able to show high PPAR&#x003b1; responsiveness, whereas those in which the spatial arrangement was disrupted (<italic>pCPT-M5</italic>) failed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh806f6">6</xref>B).

The vicinity of these DNA elements and the enhanced PPAR&#x003b1; responsiveness in muscle cells led us to assess the effect of this nuclear receptor in the presence of myogenic factors. Here, we show that MEF2C and PPAR interact to synergistically activate the CPT1&#x003b2; gene expression. Mutation of the MEF2 binding site dramatically affects PPAR&#x003b1; responsiveness in C2C12 cells, or after the coexpression of MEF2C in non-muscle (CV-1) cells; the alteration of the natural arrangement of the PPAR and MEF2 binding sites also influences the response to PPAR.</p><p>It has been suggested recently that PPAR&#x003b4; plays a pivotal role in the control of both the program for fatty acid oxidation and the CPT1&#x003b2; promoter in the skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh806c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh806c33">33</xref>). Although not shown in this paper, PPAR&#x003b4; and PPAR&#x003b3; are also able to physically interact with MEF2C <italic>in vitro</italic>, and therefore, this interaction could be physiologically relevant in different tissues with different levels of the PPAR isotypes.</p><p>The identity of the protein that binds to the MEF2 sequence of the CPT1&#x003b2; gene in muscle cannot be entirely established. Till date, four different MEF2 proteins have been identified MEF2A, MEF2B, MEF2C and MEF2D. In skeletal muscle cells in culture, MEF2D has been reported to be expressed in proliferating myoblasts prior to the onset of differentiation, MEF2A protein appears as cells enter the differentiation pathway and MEF2C is expressed late in the differentiation program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh806c34">34</xref>). In agreement with the expression patterns of MEF2 proteins in myotube culture and with previously published observations that both MEF2A and MEF2C bind to the CPT1&#x003b2; MEF2 binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh806c19">19</xref>), we believe that MEF2C is responsible for the activation of the CPT1&#x003b2; gene.</p><p>PGC-1 is a coactivator of MEF2C and can control the level of endogenous GLUT4 gene expression in muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh806c27">27</xref>). It has also been shown that PGC-1 and MEF2A synergistically activate the CPT1&#x003b2; gene promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh806c28">28</xref>). Our results point to the possibility of a simultaneous interaction between PPAR, MEF2C and PGC1 forming a ternary complex and creating a unique surface that interacts with the transcription machinery more efficiently that any of the individual factors alone. The localization of the regions involved in the interaction between PPAR and MEF2C will help us to solve this issue. Alternatively, the interaction of each of these factors could modify the chromatin structure, facilitating the action of the next. In this sense, Huang <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh806c35">35</xref>) demonstrated that promoter context affects the transcriptional activation by MyoD through E-boxes, so that neighboring proteins can recruit different associated factors to the promoter, or influence the conformation of the promoter DNA and&#x0002f;or of the protein-E-box complex.</p><p>A number of studies have examined the transactivating properties of the MEF2 proteins, which were originally studied in their role as transcriptional regulators of myogenic cells, including interactions with other transcription factors such as myogenin and MyoD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh806c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh806c37">37</xref>). In particular, several studies have reported the physical or functional interaction between myogenic proteins and members of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Thus, it has been demonstrated that MEF-2A and the TR receptor interact synergistically to activate the &#x003b1;-cardiac MHC gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh806c38">38</xref>). A functional cooperation between MyoD, MEF2 and TR&#x003b1;1 is sufficient for the induction of GLUT4 gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh806c39">39</xref>). The interaction between MyoD and RAR&#x003b1; has also been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh806c40">40</xref>) and a functional interaction between MyoD and PPAR proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh806c41">41</xref>). The transcriptional coactivator PGC-1 mediates an increase in GLUT4 expression, by binding to and coactivating MEF2C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh806c27">27</xref>). Other coactivators such as CBP&#x0002f;p300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh806c25">25</xref>) or the Glucocorticoid Receptor Interacting Protein 1 (GRIP-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh806c42">42</xref>), which functions as a cofactor for several nuclear receptors, has been shown to physically interact with both MyoD and MEF-2. The particular spatial arrangement of PPAR-, MEF2- and MyoD-binding sequences along the human CPT1&#x003b2; promoter is highly conserved in mouse, sheep and rat CPT1&#x003b2; genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh806c18">18</xref>). Besides the interaction between PPAR&#x003b1; and MEF2C shown in this paper, interactions between RXR or PPAR and MyoD are probable, but they are yet to be demonstrated.</p><p>In summary, the combination of <italic>cis</italic> elements in the promoter of the CPT1&#x003b2; gene maximally induces the expression of this gene in response to a combination of different signals. Thus, it seems likely that the concurrence of myogenic and metabolic signals generates a transcriptionaly permissive conformation of the CPT1&#x003b2; gene promoter that gives rise to a synergistic maximal transcription of the gene in those tissues containing the corresponding transcription factors (MEF2C, PPAR&#x003b1;&#x0002f;RXR&#x003b1;) and in the presence of the metabolic substrate of the enzyme, the fatty acids that activate PPAR&#x003b1;.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh806f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Increased response of the CPT1&#x003b2; promoter to PPAR&#x003b1; in C2C12 cells.
