However, mechanisms leading to the differential targeting of AID to switch (S) regions but not to constant (C<sub>H</sub>) regions remain unclear. We show that S and C<sub>H</sub> regions are dynamically modified with histone marks that are associated with active and repressed chromatin states, respectively. Chromatin accessibility is superimposable with the activating histone modifications, which extend throughout S regions irrespective of length. High density elongating RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) is detected in S regions, suggesting that the transcription machinery has paused and stalling is abolished by deletion of the S region. We propose that RNAP II enrichment facilitates recruitment of histone modifiers to generate accessibility. Thus, the histone methylation pattern produced by transcription localizes accessible chromatin to S regions, thereby focusing AID attack.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Immunoglobulin class switch recombination (CSR) occurs in mature B cells and promotes diversification of effector functions encoded in constant (C<sub>H</sub>) regions while maintaining the original antigen-binding specificity arising from V(D)J recombination. The mouse <italic>Igh</italic> locus contains eight C<sub>H</sub> genes (&#x003bc;, &#x003b4;, &#x003b3;3, &#x003b3;1, &#x003b3;2a, &#x003b3;2b, &#x003f5;, and &#x003b1;) that are located downstream of the V, D, and J<sub>H</sub> segments, and each C<sub>H</sub> region is paired with a complementary switch (S) region (with the exception of C&#x003b4;). CSR occurs through an intrachromosomal deletional rearrangement that results in the formation of composite S&#x003bc;&#x02013;Sx junctions on the chromosome, whereas the intervening genomic material is looped out and excised. Long-range interactions between transcriptional regulatory elements in the <italic>Igh</italic> locus form a unique chromosomal loop that facilitates S&#x02013;S synapsis before CSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wuerffel et al., 2007</xref>). Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is required for CSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Muramatsu et al., 2000</xref>) and initiates S region&#x02013;specific double-strand breaks (DSBs) that are processed through a cascade of events mediated by nonhomologous end joining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kenter, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chaudhuri et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism by which AID is globally targeted to Ig genes and specifically focused on S regions to the exclusion of C<sub>H</sub> regions remains unclear. The specificity of AID for single-stranded DNA templates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chaudhuri et al., 2007</xref>) requires that substrate becomes accessible in chromatin before CSR. Targeting of particular S regions for CSR is dependent on expression of germline transcripts (GLTs), which initiate at the I exon and traverse the S and C<sub>H</sub> regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Manis et al., 2002</xref>). However, it is unknown whether the distribution of histone modifications created during transcription determine zones of chromatin accessibility in S regions that are amenable to AID attack. This is an intriguing question because S regions can extend &#x0003e;10 kb from the GLT promoter and, yet, are likely to be accessible and to engage in CSR throughout their entire length, as indicated by the distribution of recombination breakpoints across S regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gritzmacher, 1989</xref>).</p><p>Chromatin alterations involving ATP-dependent remodeling of nucleosomes and posttranslational modifications on core histones can affect sequence accessibility for DNA binding proteins or create a versatile code for recruitment of factors that control transcription, replication, recombination, and DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Groth et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kouzarides, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2007</xref>). Genome-wide analyses indicate that promoter-proximal sites are enriched with histones that are hyperacetylated and trimethylated on histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3), and with initiating RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) phosphorylated at serine 5 (p-ser5), whereas levels of H3K36me3 and elongating RNAP II p-ser2 are elevated in the downstream coding regions of active genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernstein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pokholok et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guenther et al., 2007</xref>). Histone acetylation (Ac) is generally considered an excellent marker of chromatin accessibility. Accessibility may be generated by charge change, which releases the electrostatic grip of histones on DNA and/or creates new binding surfaces for bromodomains contained within many chromatin-modifying proteins (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shahbazian and Grunstein, 2007</xref>). Studies in yeast demonstrate that a protein integral to the NuA3 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex binds with H3K4me3, indicating a mechanistic link between H3K4 methylation (Me) and histone hyper-Ac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Taverna et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, H3K36me3 is recognized by a subunit of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) Rpd3S, thereby deacetylating the downstream coding regions and suppressing spurious transcription initiation in the wake of elongating RNAP II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lieb and Clarke, 2005</xref>). By these mechanisms, maximum chromatin accessibility is focused to promoter-proximal regions, whereas repressed chromatin is found in downstream coding regions.</p><p>In this paper, we show that S regions are hyperaccessible, whereas C<sub>H</sub> regions are relatively inaccessible in chromatin of activated B cells. Multiple chromatin modifications were analyzed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in three I-S-C<sub>H</sub> regions of the <italic>Igh</italic> locus during CSR in vivo. Unexpectedly, the 3&#x02032; boundary of H3K4 Me and histone Ac modifications was located at the 3&#x02032; end of S regions irrespective of length, which vary from 1 to 10 kb. We demonstrate that elongating RNAP II p-ser 5 becomes enriched across transcriptionally active S regions, whereas pausing is not detected in the absence of an S region. Similarly, the extended distribution of H3K4me3 across the S&#x003bc; region is absent in B cells harboring a targeted deletion of this S region. Thus, the unique sequence of S regions determines the pattern of RNAP II distribution and associated chromatin modifications that ensure maximum chromatin accessibility.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>S region hyperaccessibility is transcription dependent and B cell specific</title><p>To investigate whether there is a differential pattern of chromatin accessibility associated with S and C<sub>H</sub> regions, we designed restriction sensitivity endonuclease (RES) assays that were used in conjunction with the 1.B4.B6 cell line capable of inducible CSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ma et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). The RES assay is a sensitive method for monitoring nucleosome positioning and remodeling events at punctate sites within a locus. Unstimulated 1.B4.B6 cells express only &#x003bc; GLTs, whereas stimulation with LPS, CD40L, and IL-4 for 48 h leads to enhanced production of &#x003bc;, &#x003b3;1, and &#x003f5; GLTs as compared with the <italic>Gapd</italic> loading control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, left), as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ma et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). The postswitch transcript (PST) expression profile, an indicator of successful CSR, was analyzed after 5 d of stimulation and tightly recapitulated the GLT expression pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, right; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ma et al., 2002</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>S regions become hyperaccessible in LPS-activated B cells and a B cell line.</bold> (A) GLTs and PSTs were analyzed by semiquantitative RT-PCR using cDNAs derived from 1.B4.B6 cells that were either unstimulated (Un) or activated with LPS+CD40L+IL-4 (L+C+IL-4) for 48 h and 5 d, respectively. (B) Nuclei from 1.B4.B6 cells were digested with Hind III for 1, 5, and 15 min (&#x02032;), and cleavages at the S&#x003bc;-U.A and C&#x003bc;.A sites were analyzed by RES assay. PCR amplification of the <italic>Gapd</italic> gene is used as a loading control. The linearity of each assay was demonstrated by fourfold serial dilutions of genomic DNA cut to completion in vitro (Input). (C) Splenic B cells were unstimulated or activated with LPS or LPS+IL-4. Activation was performed for 48 h or 5 d, and cDNAs were derived for GLT in qRT-PCR or PST in semiquantitative RT-PCR analyses, respectively. The relative transcript levels for GLT and PST are normalized to <italic>Hprt</italic> (top) or <italic>Gapd</italic> (bottom), respectively. SEMs are shown. (D and E) Splenic B cells activated with LPS for 24 or 48 h, as indicated, were analyzed using RES assays, and digestion was performed for 1 or 15 min, as indicated. All PCR amplification products were in the linear range of detection as compared with standard curves for each primer set (Input). The concentration of PCR products was normalized with the <italic>Gapd</italic> loading control, and the relative accessibility was calculated. The results from four samples derived from two independent experiments are shown with SEMs. (E) Cleavage (15&#x02032;) at the S&#x003bc;-U.A site was arbitrarily set to 1. (F) B cells stimulated with LPS or LPS+IL-4 were analyzed using RES assays at the S&#x003bc;-D.A and S&#x003b3;3-D.A sites using a cleavage time of 1 min.

After purification of genomic DNA, the efficiency of cleavage in isolated nuclei was monitored by semiquantitative ligation-mediated PCR reactions that detect specific cleavage products. A standard curve was developed to establish the linear range of detection for the assay using genomic DNA digested to completion in vitro and referred to as &#x0201c;input&#x0201d; DNA. We first probed chromatin accessibility at two Hind III restriction sites that lie immediately upstream of S&#x003bc; and within C&#x003bc; using primer sets S&#x003bc;-U.A and C&#x003bc;.A, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). The Hind III site at the 5&#x02032; end of S&#x003bc; was efficiently cleaved, but the site within C&#x003bc; was largely resistant to cutting in both unstimulated and activated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Equivalent amounts of cleaved chromatin were used, as indicated by PCR amplification of the <italic>Gapd</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). These results cannot be attributed to poor C&#x003bc;.A primer efficiency, because the S&#x003bc;-U.A and C&#x003bc;.A primers produced similar levels of PCR products when using input DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Because the C&#x003bc; cleavage product was only evident after 15 min of digestion with Hind III, we chose the 1- and 15-min digestion periods as standards for subsequent studies.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic diagrams for each of the &#x003bc;, &#x003b3;3, and &#x003b3;1 I-S-C<sub>H</sub> loci and the <italic>c-myc</italic> gene are shown.</bold> Vertical lines indicate Hind III (H) sites.

Isotype switching is a dynamic process in B cells that is dependent on GLT and AID expression, DSB formation specific to S regions, and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kenter, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chaudhuri et al., 2007</xref>). AID is expressed 48 h after LPS activation but CSR has not yet transpired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wuerffel et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, analyses reported were performed on B cells activated for 48 h or less. B cells were successfully induced, as determined by the induction of AID and GLTs after 48 h of stimulation with LPS or LPS+IL-4 as assessed by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>, top), and essentially identical results for GLTs were found at 24 h of activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). The &#x003b3;3 GLTs were induced by LPS activation and were suppressed by LPS+IL-4 treatment, whereas the &#x003b3;1 and &#x003f5; GLT expression were LPS+IL-4 dependent. The PST expression profile was highly correlated with the expression of GLTs and AID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>, bottom).</p><p>Next, we performed RES assays for five Hind III restriction sites, flanking the S&#x003bc; and C&#x003bc; regions (S&#x003bc;-U.A and S&#x003bc;-D.A C&#x003bc;.A) and the S&#x003b3;3 and C&#x003b3;3 regions (S&#x003b3;3-D.A and C&#x003b3;3-D.A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). Our approach allows a direct comparison of accessibility at all five sites and demonstrates that in LPS-activated B cells, the S&#x003bc; and S&#x003b3;3 regions are 2&#x02013;35-fold more susceptible to cleavage than C&#x003bc; or C&#x003b3;3 after 15 min of Hind III digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). The level of accessibility for S&#x003bc;-D.A is fourfold higher than that found for S&#x003bc;-U.A, which may be caused by differences in nucleosome phasing at these sites in the transcriptionally active &#x003bc; locus. Because histone Ac at S regions accumulates with increasing periods of B cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2006</xref>), we examined the cleavage of these sites in B cells that were activated with LPS for 24 and 48 h. At both time points, there was preferential accessibility at sites flanking S&#x003bc; as compared with C&#x003bc; and accessibility progressed over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>), demonstrating a correlation between the observed kinetics of histone Ac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2006</xref>) and hyperaccessibility at S&#x003bc; and S&#x003b3;3 regions.</p><p>To determine whether S region accessibility is contingent on GLT expression, we monitored changes in chromatin cleavage at the S&#x003bc; and S&#x003b3;3 regions in B cells activated with LPS or LPS+IL-4 for 48 h in RES assays. The &#x003b3;1 locus was not amenable to this analysis because it lacks appropriately positioned Hind III sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). B cell activation with LPS+IL-4 suppresses &#x003b3;3 GLT expression four- to fivefold as compared with that found in LPS-activated B cells and shifts switching from &#x003bc;&#x02192;&#x003b3;3 to &#x003bc;&#x02192;&#x003b3;1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Consistent with the GLT expression profile, cleavage was suppressed threefold at the S&#x003b3;3-D.A site in response to LPS+IL-4 as compared with that found after LPS induction, and this difference was statistically significant (P &#x0003c; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>). In contrast, essentially no change in the level of cleavage was found at the comparable location downstream of S&#x003bc; when the cells were activated with either LPS or LPS+IL-4. The S&#x003bc; region is the universal donor in CSR and is used in both &#x003bc;&#x02192;&#x003b3;3 and &#x003bc;&#x02192;&#x003b3;1 CSR. Thus, chromatin remodeling at the S&#x003b3;3 region is tightly correlated with the expression of the &#x003b3;3 GLT.</p><p>To further confirm the relevance of the in vivo RES assay, we compared the level of S region accessibility in splenic B cells capable of inducing CSR and T cells that are incapable of this function. Expression of &#x003bc; and &#x003b3;3 GLT and the IFN-&#x003b3; genes from LPS- and concanavalin A&#x02013;activated B and T cells, respectively, demonstrates successful cellular activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 G</xref>). RES analyses indicate that Hind III sites in S&#x003bc; and S&#x003b3;3 regions were 15&#x02013;60-fold more efficiently cleaved in B cells than in T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 H</xref>). The difference in the level of S region accessibility cannot be attributed to global differences in the efficiency of Hind III digestion in B and T cells, because the levels of cutting at a Hind III site in the ubiquitously expressed <italic>c-myc</italic> gene differed by only twofold. Cumulatively, these findings demonstrate that chromatin remodeling at the boundaries of S regions is inducible, transcription dependent, and specific to B lymphocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>S regions targeted for CSR are hyperacetylated at histone H3K9,14</title><p>The RES assay has the potential to reveal punctate chromosomal alterations induced by both ATP-dependent remodeling complexes as well as histone modifiers. To test the proposition that inducible histone modifications contribute to the differential accessibility of S and C<sub>H</sub> regions to AID attack, ChIP assays were performed. ChIP assays measure the mean levels of chromatin modifications that are associated with the active or repressed chromatin states over several hundred bp. We investigated whether Ac histones are evenly distributed throughout the &#x003bc;, &#x003b3;3, and &#x003b3;1 I-S-C<sub>H</sub> loci or are locally constrained to specific subregions in activated B cells.

are three layers of regulation controlling histone Ac at S regions: B cell activation, transcription, and AID expression leading to DSB formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). At the &#x003bc; locus and in accordance with our previous findings, H3Ac modifications are detectable in unstimulated B cells and are further induced by both LPS or LPS+IL-4, whereas this activation treatment did not lead to a significant change in the steady-state level of &#x003bc; GLT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). The highest levels of H3Ac were found over the S&#x003bc; region and dropped sharply at 3&#x02032; S&#x003bc; and C&#x003bc; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). The relatively high level of H3Ac in unstimulated B cells is consistent with the constitutive transcription of the &#x003bc; H chain and I&#x003bc;-C&#x003bc; GLT in these cells. Consistent results were obtained for four to six ChIP samples from two independent experiments that were assayed in duplicate. Additional studies using B cells activated with LPS or LPS+IL-4 and newly designed primers sets, S&#x003bc;-D.1 and S&#x003bc;-D.2 that overlap with the S&#x003bc;-D.A site analyzed in RES assays, indicated that the zone of hyper-H3Ac extends to the 3&#x02032; end of the S&#x003bc; tandem repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figs. 2</xref>; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4, A and B</xref>). Although the magnitude of H3Ac increase at S&#x003bc; region boundaries is roughly equivalent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>, compare S&#x003bc;-U and S&#x003bc;-D.2), restriction enzyme accessibility is about fourfold higher at the 3&#x02032; end of S&#x003bc; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, D, E, and H</xref>), suggesting that remodeling at this downstream site may be less dependent on H3Ac and more related to nucleosome phasing. Despite these intralocus differences, the chromatin at sites surrounding S&#x003bc; is far more accessible than that found in T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 H</xref>), indicating that S&#x003bc; region hyperaccessibility occurs after activation of mature splenic B cells.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Differential segregation of histone modifications uniquely identify the S and C<sub>H</sub> regions in the &#x003bc;, &#x003b3;3, and &#x003b3;1 <italic>Igh</italic> loci.</bold> Schematic diagrams for each of the &#x003bc;, &#x003b3;3, and &#x003b3;1 I-S-C<sub>H</sub> loci are shown at the top and are aligned appropriately with the sites analyzed by ChIP.

LPS+IL-4 activation led to hypo-H3Ac across the entire &#x003b3;3 locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>), indicating that chromatin is a relatively inaccessible state when &#x003b3;3 GLTs are repressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1 C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Conversely, LPS+IL-4 treatment induced histone H3Ac across the I&#x003b3;1-S&#x003b3;1 region, a distance &#x0003e;10 kb, but levels were significantly reduced when activated by LPS alone, conditions that specifically repress the &#x003b3;1 GLT and induce &#x003bc;&#x02192;&#x003b3;3 CSR. These findings indicate that chromatin remodeling is targeted to transcriptionally active S regions and is spread throughout the S region irrespective of length. The mechanism that regulates the spread of histone Ac throughout the S regions but spares the C<sub>H</sub> regions remains unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Modulation of histone Ac in S regions leads to altered accessibility and CSR frequency</title><p>Induced H3Ac in S regions is expected to lead to chromatin hyperaccessibility and increased CSR if H3Ac is physiologically important to the recombination process. To manipulate the level of H3Ac in S regions, splenic B cells were stimulated with LPS or LPS+IL-4 for 48 h in the presence and absence of the general HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) and analyzed for H3Ac, S region accessibility, and CSR frequency. TSA treatment had little or no effect on the expression of &#x003bc;, &#x003b3;3, and &#x003b3;1 GLTs in response to B cell inducers; thus, transcription is intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). In the S&#x003bc; locus, TSA had no effect on H3Ac levels in the area spanning E&#x003bc;-S&#x003bc;, whereas there was a modest but statistically significant (P &#x0003c; 0.001) increase of H3Ac in downstream areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). In the &#x003b3;3 and &#x003b3;1 loci, TSA treatment caused a clear 1.5&#x02013;2-fold increase in H3Ac that was statistically significant (p-values ranged from P &#x0003c; 0.05 to 0.001) and that spanned the I-S-C<sub>H</sub> regions. The TSA hypersensitivity of H3Ac in S&#x003b3; regions and the relative insensitivity of S&#x003bc; to this treatment may be related to the induced transcription of S&#x003b3; loci as compared with the steady-state expression of the &#x003bc; locus, as has been noted previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shahbazian and Grunstein, 2007</xref>). In parallel RES analyses, TSA treatment also led to an increase in cleavage at the S&#x003bc;-D, C&#x003bc;, and S&#x003b3;3-D sites (P &#x0003c; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). No change in cleavage was evident at the S&#x003bc;-U site, where H3Ac levels were also unchanged by TSA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). It is possible that at the S&#x003bc;-D site TSA treatment indirectly led to the chromatin remodeling observed in the RES assay. These studies reveal that histone Ac levels at downstream S&#x003b3; regions are modulated by ongoing histone deacetylation, whereas this connection is not as evident for the S&#x003bc; region in which H3Ac levels are insensitive to HDAC inhibition.</p><p>To determine the physiological significance of altered histone Ac in S regions, we measured CSR frequency in B cells activated in the presence or absence of TSA using semiquantitative digestion circularization PCR (DC-PCR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>). TSA had no effect on AID expression in LPS+IL-4&#x02013;stimulated B cells, whereas AID expression was inhibited approximately fivefold in LPS-activated cells, where the underlying mechanism of this repression is unknown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). In the DC-PCR assay, the nonrearranging <italic>Gapd</italic> gene was used as a control for the digestion and ligation reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, D and E</xref>). TSA treatment led to a statistically significant 1.5-fold increase (P &#x0003c; 0.05) of the &#x003bc;&#x02192;&#x003b3;1 DC-PCR product from LPS+IL-4&#x02013;activated B cell cultures as compared with untreated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 E</xref>). In LPS-induced B cells, TSA treatment led to no change in &#x003bc;&#x02192;&#x003b3;3 switching as compared with untreated samples despite a reduction of AID expression, suggesting that increased levels of H3Ac provided additional accessibility and compensated for decreased AID expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, A, B, and E</xref>). Based on these collective findings, we infer the physiological relevance of H3Ac and chromatin accessibility in the S regions to CSR frequency. We conclude that the balance between HAT and HDAC activities influences both histone Ac and chromatin accessibility in S&#x003b3; regions but only modestly regulates the spread of H3Ac into C<sub>H</sub> loci.</p></sec><sec><title>S and C<sub>H</sub> regions are distinguished by differential histone Me</title><p>Analysis of histone modifications in genome-wide studies have revealed that H3K4me3 overlaps with H3Ac, is highest at the 5&#x02032; ends of coding regions, and is positively correlated with gene activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernstein et al., 2005</xref>), whereas H3K36me3 is found in the downstream coding regions of active genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernstein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pokholok et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barski et al., 2007</xref>). Previous analyses of H3K36me2 distribution come almost entirely from yeast studies. H3K36me2 modification is evenly distributed throughout the coding regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bannister et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pokholok et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rao et al., 2005</xref>) and is correlated with transcriptional competence but not with transcription rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Youdell et al., 2008</xref>). To determine whether an underlying pattern of chromatin Me modifications correlates with the areas within I-S-C<sub>H</sub> loci that are subject to histone Ac, H3K4me3 and H3K36me2,3 marks were profiled across the &#x003bc;, &#x003b3;3, and &#x003b3;1 I-S-C<sub>H</sub> loci. In activated B cells, the H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 modifications were reciprocally enriched at the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends of all three loci, whereas H3K36me2 was broadly distributed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). In unstimulated B cells, H3K36me2 is present in both the actively transcribed &#x003bc; locus and inactive &#x003b3;3 and &#x003b3;1 loci, and is not further elevated after B cell activation, indicating that the H3K36me2 deposition profile is similar in yeast and B lymphocytes.</p><p>In the I&#x003bc;-S&#x003bc;-C&#x003bc; locus, the overall levels of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 modifications were very similar in stimulated and untreated B cells, consistent with the constitutive transcription of this locus leading to expression of the &#x003bc; H chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). However, using a Student's <italic>t</italic> test, we found that there was a statistically significant increase for H3K36me3 at S&#x003bc;-D (P &#x0003c; 0.007) and a smaller increase at the C&#x003bc;-U and C&#x003bc;-D sites (P &#x0003c; 0.049 and 0.017, respectively) after activation with LPS+IL-4 but not with LPS alone. Increased H3K36me3 levels suggest induced transcription at the &#x003bc; locus in response to LPS+IL-4 activation. Our previous studies indicated that the &#x003bc; GLT is not measurably induced by LPS or LPS+IL-4 stimulation, although the methods used for that analysis may not detect small changes of expression (see next section; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, very low levels of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 are distributed across the &#x003b3;3 and &#x003b3;1 I-S-C<sub>H</sub> locus in unstimulated B cells, consistent with their relatively inactive or silent transcriptional status, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1 C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Upon B cell activation with LPS or LPS+IL-4, H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 marks are induced, correlated with robust GLT expression, and are spatially differentiated in I-S-C<sub>H</sub> loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1 C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). The H3K4me3 deposition pattern is essentially superimposable with the pattern of hyper-H3Ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figs. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4 B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8 C</xref>) and in agreement with genome-wide analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernstein et al., 2005</xref>). Surprisingly, both the H3K4me3 and H3Ac modifications extend across the I-S regions irrespective of S region length, which ranges from 2 to 10 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A&#x02013;C</xref>), suggesting that S DNA sequence may play a role in determining the spatial pattern of these chromatin modifications. In contrast, the H3K36me3 mark is preferentially deposited toward the 3&#x02032; end of the locus and may have a relatively repressive influence on chromatin accessibility. In the &#x003b3;3 locus, induction of H3K36me3 is apparent only at the C&#x003b3;3-U site, whereas this mark has a broader distribution over the C&#x003bc; and C&#x003b3;1 regions. Detection of H3K36me3 in C&#x003b3;3 is reproducible and transcription dependent, indicating the relevance of this modification. The more limited detection of H3K36me3 in C&#x003b3;3 is consistent with this mark locating to exons of 3&#x02032; coding regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kolasinska-Zwierz et al., 2009</xref>). The 3&#x02032; skew for H3K36me3 in transcriptionally active loci is contrasted by the broad distribution of the H3K36me2 mark, which is not altered by transcription.</p><p>Although H4K20me1 modifications were initially discovered to be associated with facultative heterochromatin and considered repressive, this mark is also enriched in active genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Talasz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vakoc et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barski et al., 2007</xref>). We tested whether H4K20me1 displays spatial patterns in I-S-C<sub>H</sub> loci in splenic B cells. High levels of H4K20me1 are distributed across the &#x003bc;, &#x003b3;3, and &#x003b3;1 I-S-C<sub>H</sub> locus in unstimulated B cells and skewed toward the 3&#x02032; end of each locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). This pattern occurs irrespective of transcriptional status, because &#x003bc; is constitutively expressed whereas &#x003b3;3 and &#x003b3;1 loci are silent. Unexpectedly, we observed a change in the pattern of H4K20me1 deposition from across &#x003bc;, &#x003b3;3, and &#x003b3;1 I-S-C<sub>H</sub> in unstimulated B cells to an area downstream of S regions in activated B cells, suggesting that the Me of this histone lysine residue is highly dynamic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). In summary, the induced deposition of histone modifications H3Ac, H3K4me3, H3K36me3, and H4K20me1 is transcription dependent. These chromatin marks display differential spatial patterns with superimposed H3Ac and H3K4me3 marks that extend throughout the I-S interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). In contrast, H3K36me3 and H4K20me1 are associated with the region downstream of the S regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). The transition from the activating H3Ac and H3K4me3 modifications associated with chromatin hyperaccessibility to the repressive marks, H3K36me3 and/or H4K20me1, occurs at the 3&#x02032; boundary of the three S regions studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Summary of differential histone modifications in S and C<sub>H</sub> regions of activated B cells.</bold> B cells were stimulated with LPS or LPS+IL-4 for 48 h and analyzed in ChIP assays using antisera against H3K9,14Ac, H3K4me3, H3K36me3, and H4K20me1.

Genome-wide studies in humans, mice, and yeast confirm the distribution of H3K4me3 to the promoter-proximal areas, suggesting that this mark is targeted to chromatin via a conserved mechanism involving the RNAP II p-ser5 isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernstein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pokholok et al., 2005</xref>). These observations imply that the extended distribution of H3K4me3 in S regions might derive from high occupancy RNAP II p-ser5. ChIP has been used to determine RNAP II association at specific promoters and transcribed regions and on a genome-wide scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Muse et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guenther et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zeitlinger et al., 2007</xref>). A ChIP signal exclusively at the promoter indicates that RNAP II is poised at this site, whereas if the ChIP signal is found at short distances downstream of the transcription start sites (TSSs) then RNAP II is paused in early elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saunders et al., 2006</xref>; for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wade and Struhl, 2008</xref>). When the transition from transcription initiation to elongation is rapid, RNAP II occupancy will be roughly equivalent across the gene. Alternatively, if the transition is slow then RNAP II levels will be higher at the promoter than in downstream coding regions. To examine this issue in S regions, ChIP assays focused on &#x003bc; and &#x003b3;3 I-S-C<sub>H</sub> regions were performed using an antibody against total RNAP II or RNAP II p-ser 5 (H14) detected during the early stages of elongation in B cells. The S&#x003bc; tandem repeats are located between S&#x003bc;-U and S&#x003bc;-D.2 sites, whereas S&#x003bc;-D is located &#x0223c;600 bp downstream and outside the repetitive zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). There are three documented TSSs for &#x003bc; GLT, one immediately upstream of the I&#x003bc; exon and two that are located 5&#x02032; of S&#x003bc; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alt et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nelson et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kuzin et al., 2000</xref>).

After B cell activation, RNAP II occupancy increased across the I&#x003bc;-S&#x003bc;-C&#x003bc; transcription unit, with the greatest gains at the 3&#x02032; end of the S&#x003bc; tandem repeats, whereas the sites adjacent to S&#x003bc; were relatively depleted of RNAP II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>). The high occupancy of RNAP II p-ser5 at the 3&#x02032; end of S&#x003bc; occurs at least 3.2 kb downstream of the TSSs and, therefore, may occur through a unique mechanism that is distinct from the pause associated with the transition from promoter-proximal transcription initiation to elongation.

In this study, we investigated whether transcription propagates differential chromatin accessibility across I-S-C<sub>H</sub> loci by constructing detailed maps of chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, and RNAP II occupancy in vivo using RES and ChIP assays. Our data indicate that after transcription activation of GLTs, I-S regions are a focus for increased H3K4me3, H3Ac, and chromatin accessibility, whereas C<sub>H</sub> regions accumulate the repressive countermarks H3K36me3 and H4K20me1, remain H3 hypo-Ac, and are inaccessible in chromatin. RES assays corroborate these findings and demonstrate that chromatin remodeling occurs at the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; boarders of S regions but not in C<sub>H</sub> regions. The bifurication of chromatin modifications within the I-S-C<sub>H</sub> transcription unit corresponds well with zones targeted by or protected from AID attack.</p><p>Our TSA studies indicate that H3 Ac levels in S regions influence CSR frequency, confirming the physiological importance of this modification. Histone Ac may alter the net charge of nucleosomes and change the folding properties of the chromatin fiber, thereby promote DNA accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shahbazian and Grunstein, 2007</xref>), and may also create binding surfaces for specific protein&#x02013;histone interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2007</xref>). A counterpoint to the directed hyper-Ac of S region is the relative deacetylation of the C<sub>H</sub> regions. We also found that H3Ac and H3K4me3 distributions in I-S-C<sub>H</sub> loci are superimposible. Recent evidence indicates that the H3K4me3 mark is directly bound by a protein constituent of the NuA3 HAT complex that functions to coordinate transcription activation with histone hyper-Ac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Taverna et al., 2006</xref>). In yeast, the H3K36me3 mark is targeted by the Rpd3S deactylase complex to reduce histone Ac and suppress inappropriate transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carrozza et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lieb and Clarke, 2005</xref>). Our TSA studies further demonstrate that HDAC inhibition has no impact on H3K4me3 levels or distribution, and does not lead to an unbridled spread of histone Ac from the S to C<sub>H</sub> regions, as would be expected if histone Ac is independent of H3K4 Me. Thus, the underlying H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 Me pattern provides for recruitment of HATs and HDACs, respectively, which in turn regulate chromatin accessibility.</p><p>We propose a model whereby GLT expression is mechanistically linked to introduction of histone modifications and restructuring of chromatin in <italic>Igh</italic> loci. This model is based on the linkage between the phosphorylation status of RNAP II CTD, the recruitment of HMTs for H3K4me3 and H3K36me3, and the asymmetric Me of these residues in the promoter-proximal and 3&#x02032; coding regions of active genes in yeast and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Miller et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hampsey and Reinberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krogan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ng et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carrozza et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Guenther et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2007</xref>). We conclude that chromatin modifications integrally linked to GLT expression are most likely responsible for constructing accessible and repressed chromatin environments coincident with S regions and C<sub>H</sub> genes.</p><p>Detection of activating histone modifications throughout S regions that can extend &#x0003e;10 kb downstream of the GLT promoter is both surprising and unanticipated. Genome-wide analyses of histone marks in yeast and humans demonstrate that the activating modifications H3Ac and H3K4me3 are located promoter proximal and rarely extend more than 1 kb downstream of the promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernstein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pokholok et al., 2005</xref>). What directs the generation of chromatin hyperaccessibility long distances from the GLT promoters in the <italic>Igh</italic> locus? Based on the observation that the interaction between the initiating form of RNAP II (p-ser5) and the H3K4 HMT targets H3K4me3 to the 5&#x02032; end of active genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hampsey and Reinberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernstein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pokholok et al., 2005</xref>), we examined RNAP II occupancy of S regions. We reasoned that S region secondary structure or transcription-dependent R-loops might impede RNAP II elongation, thereby creating high occupancy of RNAP II together with its ancillary partners including HMTs, which could lay down the H3K4me3 mark. Our RNAP II ChIP studies demonstrate a significant enrichment of RNAP II p-ser5 in the S&#x003bc; and S&#x003b3;3 regions. Strikingly, in B cells devoid of S&#x003bc; DNA, RNAP II occupancy was not enriched in distal regions and H3K4me3 marks remained promoter proximal, demonstrating that S region sequence facilitates retention of RNAP II p-ser5 and is correlated with an extended zone of H3K4me3 modification. Although chromosomal breaks inhibit transcription by RNAP I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kruhlak et al., 2007</xref>), our studies indicate that RNAP II p-ser5 enrichment is not related to the presence of DSBs in S DNA because occupancy is equivalent in WT and AID-deficient B cells in which DSBs are absent. Collectively, the data demonstrate that the S region sequences determine their own extended zone of chromatin remodeling and accessibility.</p><p>There are several possible mechanisms by which RNAP II is retained in S regions. Transcribed S regions contain R loops that are thought to provide single-stranded DNA stretches as substrate for AID deamination and thereby enhance the efficiency of CSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Huang et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, RNA-DNA hybrid structures in R-loops impede transcription elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huertas and Aguilera, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tous and Aguilera, 2007</xref>). S regions may also be subject to formation of G-loops that form as a consequence of combined G-quartet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Duquette et al., 2004</xref>) and R-loop structures and stall RNAP II transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tornaletti et al., 2008</xref>). G-quartet structures are linked to G-rich sequences and have been noted in S regions, telomers, centromeres, and mutational hotspots, as well as in some triplet repeat expansion diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Phan et al., 2006</xref>). Although R-loops have been observed in S regions undergoing CSR in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Huang et al., 2007</xref>), G-quartet structures have not been directly observed in similar circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roy et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, a broad and continuous distribution of H3K4me3 is found across multiple Hox-coding and intergenic regions, and is correlated with the RNAP II transcription of noncoding RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernstein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Guenther et al., 2005</xref>). Similarly, antisense RNAs have been detected immediately 5&#x02032; of transcriptionally active S regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Perlot et al., 2008</xref>). It is possible that antisense RNA expression from multiple initiating foci within the S regions create functionally alternative promoter sites across the S region that attract RNAP II and collectively recruit the H3K4 HMT. Additional studies are required to determine whether R-loop structures, G-quartets, or antisense RNA expression are causally linked to elevated RNAP II occupancy and deposition of H3K4me3 marks in S regions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Mice, cell culture, RT-PCR, and DC-PCR.</title><p>C57B6 and C57B6 &#x000d7; 129 (AID<bold><sup>+/+</sup></bold>) mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory.

For semiquantitative RT-PCR, GLTs, PSTs, and IFN-&#x003b3; PCR products were harvested after 33, 31, and 29 cycles. <italic>Gapd</italic> and <italic>Hprt</italic> PCR products were harvested after 30, 28, and 26 cycles.</p></sec><sec><title>ChIP and real-time qPCR.</title><p>ChIP histone assays were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). Immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-H3K9,14Ac (Millipore), anti-H3K36Me3 (Millipore), anti-H3K4Me3 (Abcam), anti-H4K20Me1, anti-H4K20Me2 (a gift from T. Jenuwein, Research Institute of Molecular Pathology, Vienna, Austria), anti-H4K20Me3 (Abcam), anti-RNAP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-RNAP CTD p-ser5 (H14; Covance), and control antibodies (Millipore). All ChIPs used protein A&#x02013;agarose beads, with the exception of the H14 antibody immunoprecipitation, where the protein A beads were preincubated for 30 min at room temperature with a linker IgG to the IgM antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xiao et al., 2007</xref>). The samples were analyzed by qPCR, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2006</xref>).

Nuclei were prepared from cultured cells or 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> stimulated lymphocytes, and were washed with 1&#x000d7; C1 buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 100 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.1], 11% sucrose) and then resuspended in 300 &#x003bc;l Hind III digestion buffer (Fermentas). Digestion reactions were initiated with 20 U Hind III at 37&#x000b0;C and performed for 1, 5, and 15 min, and were then stopped and treated with proteinase K, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Weinmann et al., 1999</xref>). 3 &#x003bc;g of genomic DNA from Hind III&#x02013;treated nuclei was ligated with Hind III linkers (Oligo L.1 and L.2; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>) in a 100-&#x003bc;l reaction overnight at 16&#x000b0;C. Linker-ligated DNA was purified and dissolved in 20 &#x003bc;l Tris EDTA. The first-round PCR was performed in 25-&#x003bc;l reactions with 1 &#x003bc;l DNA, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 400 mM of each dNTP, 0.4 mM of each primer, and 1.5 U Platinum Taq (Invitrogen) with a linker-specific primer (Oligo L.1) and a locus-specific primer. The second round of nested PCR was performed in the presence of 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> with 0.3 ml &#x003b1;-[<sup>32</sup>P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol) for 26 cycles. Radioactively labeled PCR products were resolved by 6% TBE PAGE and quantitated using a Storm 860 and ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). The standard curve and linear range of PCR amplification were determined by a serial-diluted genomic DNA that is cut to completion and ligated. Samples were also normalized to <italic>Gapd</italic> for DNA content. Data are presented with the SEMs, and p-values were calculated using a single-tailed Student's <italic>t</italic> test.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. T.
