In mice, susceptibility to WNV has been reported to result from a single point mutation in <italic>oas1b</italic>, which encodes 2&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; oligoadenylate synthetase 1b, a member of the type I interferon-regulated <italic>OAS</italic> gene family involved in viral RNA degradation. In man, the human ortholog of <italic>oas1b</italic> appears to be <italic>OAS1</italic>. The &#x02018;A&#x02019; allele at SNP rs10774671 of <italic>OAS1</italic> has previously been shown to alter splicing of <italic>OAS1</italic> and to be associated with reduced OAS activity in PBMCs. Here we show that the frequency of this hypofunctional allele is increased in both symptomatic and asymptomatic WNV seroconverters (Caucasians from five US centers; total n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;501; OR&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1.6 &#x0005b;95&#x00025; CI 1.2&#x02013;2.0&#x0005d;, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.0002 in a recessive genetic model). We then directly tested the effect of this SNP on viral replication in a novel <italic>ex vivo</italic> model of WNV infection in primary human lymphoid tissue. Virus accumulation varied markedly among donors, and was highest for individuals homozygous for the &#x02018;A&#x02019; allele (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001).

Both host and environmental factors are thought to influence outcome. Here we show that a specific human mutation that results in reduced function in a known antiviral gene named <italic>OAS1</italic> is associated with increased rate of infection with West Nile virus, a member of the flavivirus family. <italic>OAS1</italic> codes for a component of the type I interferon signaling system; its homologue in mice has been shown previously to be important for flavivirus susceptibility. Individuals carrying two copies of the hypofunctional variant of <italic>OAS1</italic> were found more frequently than expected among both asymptomatic and symptomatic WNV-positive individuals. To investigate further, we developed a novel model of WNV replication using human tonsil tissue in which high variability in replication was observed among donors. We found that the highest virus accumulation occurred in donors with two copies of the hypofunctional <italic>OAS1</italic> variant. Together these data suggest that OAS1 activity may influence the probability of initial infection, but not the severity or symptomatic quality of infection, after WNV exposure in man.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>West Nile virus (WNV) is a re-emerging flavivirus transmitted by mosquitoes to several species of birds. Humans and several other mammalian species may be accidental dead-end hosts. First isolated in Uganda from a febrile woman in 1937 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000321-Smithburn1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, WNV has caused sporadic outbreaks in the Middle East, Africa, Western Asia, Europe, and Australia. In the Western Hemisphere, it was first isolated from a patient during an outbreak of meningoencephalitis in New York in 1999 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000321-Asnis1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000321-Hubalek1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000321-Lanciotti1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Since then it has rapidly spread across the United States into Canada and Central and South America, and has caused annual outbreaks of disease. Through November 18, 2008, there have been 28,906 US laboratory-confirmed symptomatic WNV-seropositive cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), with 1121 (3.9&#x00025;) WNV-induced deaths (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov">www.cdc.gov</ext-link>). In addition to human infections, the virus has caused significant morbidity and mortality in birds and horses.</p><p>In the US, seroprevalence is &#x0223c;3&#x00025; in the general population and 20&#x02013;30&#x00025; of infected individuals have been estimated to become symptomatic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000321-Mostashari1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Clinical manifestations include West Nile fever (WNF) and WNV-induced neuroinvasive disease (WNND), which manifests primarily as meningitis and encephalitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000321-Hayes1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. To date, no specific antiviral agents or vaccines have been approved by the FDA for human WNV infection, and treatment is supportive. Survivors of WNND may develop long-term neurologic sequelae.</p><p>Viral infections in man are typically controlled in part by early induction of type I interferon (IFN), which initiates a cascade of innate mechanisms that impair virtually all aspects of the viral life cycle. Genetic studies in mice have identified several type I IFN-regulated anti-viral effector pathways that control WNV replication, including the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) mechanism of protein synthesis inhibition, and the 2&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) pathway of RNaseL-mediated RNA degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000321-Samuel1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. OAS enzymes catalyze the synthesis of 2&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032;-linked oligoadenylates (2&#x02013;5A) from ATP, which can then bind and activate latent RNaseL resulting in the degradation of host and viral RNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000321-Hovanessian1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Targeted gene disruption in mice has revealed a critical role for the type I IFN Receptor, PKR and RNaseL for survival following WNV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000321-Samuel1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000321-Samuel2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.

How this mutation actually works has not yet been fully delineated. It clearly is not redundant with the multiple other <italic>oas1</italic> genes found in the mouse genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000321-Mashimo2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. However, there is evidence that protection may not actually be mediated through RNase L <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000321-Scherbik1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, and it is not yet known whether the <italic>oas1b</italic> gene product is enzymatically active <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000321-Rogozin1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. The genetic data suggesting a role for <italic>oas1b</italic> in protection against WNV in mice are supported by <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments showing that WNV replication in cells expressing wild-type <italic>oas1b</italic> is less efficient than in cells expressing the truncated form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000321-KajasteRudnitski1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000321-Lucas1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, genetic knock-in of the resistant <italic>oas1b</italic> allele into a susceptible mouse strain resulted in resistance to Yellow Fever Virus, a related flavivirus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000321-Scherbik2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. WNV susceptibility has not been reported in this knock-in mouse. Taken together, the combined <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> data suggest an important role of <italic>oas1b</italic> in innate resistance to flavivirus infection in the mouse.</p><p>Thus, we hypothesized that polymorphisms in the human ortholog of <italic>oas1b</italic>, <italic>OAS1</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000321-Mashimo2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, could influence outcome in humans exposed to WNV. Established risk factors for human WNV disease include age, immunosuppression, and genetic deficiency in the chemokine receptor/HIV-1 coreceptor <italic>CCR5</italic>, due to homozygous inheritance of the defective allele <italic>CCR5&#x00394;32</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000321-Glass1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000321-Lim1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Despite the strong epidemiologic association with <italic>CCR5&#x00394;32</italic>, only &#x0223c;4&#x00025; of Caucasian symptomatic WNV-infected individuals can be accounted for by CCR5 deficiency, indicating that other genetic risk factors for WNV disease may exist. A small case-control study (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;27 cases) failed to find evidence of association of severe WNV disease with two <italic>OAS1</italic> SNPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000321-Yakub1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Instead, the investigators found a strong association with a silent variant (rs3213545) in <italic>OAS-Like</italic> (<italic>OASL</italic>), a paralogue of <italic>OAS1</italic> located approximately 8 megabases away that has not been found to encode a protein with OAS activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000321-Hovanessian1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. In this report, we attempted to validate the <italic>OASL</italic> association with WNV, but could not.

Unlike the mouse genome, where 8 copies of <italic>oas1</italic> have been identified (<italic>oas1a-h</italic>), there is only one copy of <italic>OAS1</italic> in the human genome, although alternative splicing gives rise to several isoforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000321-Mashimo2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. All <italic>OAS1</italic> splice variants include exons 1&#x02013;5, but vary with regard to downstream exons, and thus produce proteins of various sizes, including the p42, p44, p46, p48, and p52 forms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000321-Mashimo2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000321-BonnevieNielsen1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. We identified common SNPs in the <italic>OAS1</italic> gene region in the CEPH cohort using data from the International HapMap Project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hapmap.org">www.hapmap.org</ext-link>). Human <italic>OAS1</italic> is one of three genes in the <italic>OAS</italic> cluster, ordered <italic>OAS1</italic>, <italic>OAS3</italic> and <italic>OAS2</italic> on chromosome 12 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000321-Justesen1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000321-g001">Figure 1</xref>, at least eleven SNPs in the <italic>OAS1</italic> region have been found to cluster into two blocks of linkage disequilibrium (LD). The first block contains four SNPs, three of which are found within the first intron (rs7956880, rs10744785, and rs4766662) and one of which (rs2158390) is found in the 5&#x02032;UTR. The second block contains seven SNPs, with rs3741981 in exon 3; rs2057778, rs2285934 and rs2285934 in intron 3; rs10774671 located at the last nucleotide in intron 5; rs1051042 and rs2660 in exon 7; and rs7135577 in the 3&#x02032;UTR. The SNPs found in block 1 are not in coding regions. The six SNPs in block 2 excluding rs3741981 are in tight LD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000321-g001">Figure 1</xref>, the black region in block 2) and form two haplotypes that have been previously shown by Bonnevie-Nielsen and colleagues to be highly associated with the level of OAS enzymatic activity measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000321-BonnevieNielsen1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. These investigators concluded that rs10774671 is most likely to be the functional SNP in this block because it sits at the last nucleotide of intron 5 in the <italic>OAS1</italic> gene and serves as a splice acceptor site for exon 7. The G allele is predicted to allow splicing to occur resulting in the production of a p46 form with high enzymatic OAS activity. The A allele is predicted to prevent splicing at this site; instead, splicing occurs further downstream, resulting in two other forms, designated p48 and p52 associated with lower OAS enzymatic activity. Heterozygotes were reported to have intermediate OAS activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000321-BonnevieNielsen1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Although other splice variants of this gene exist, including p42 and p44, the splice variants that arise from the use of exon 7 (p46, p48, and p52) are controlled by rs10774671 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000321-BonnevieNielsen1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000321-Justesen1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.

In our analysis, we considered the dominant, recessive and additive genetic models (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000321-t002">Table 2</xref>), and all were statistically significant (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). Using the recessive model when all cases were grouped together, the AA genotype was significantly greater in WNV-positive subjects than in controls (Odds Ratio (OR)&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1.6 &#x0005b;95&#x00025; Confidence Interval (CI) 1.3&#x02013;2.1, <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.0001; <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000321-t002">Table 2</xref>). A similar trend in OR was observed in each of the 5 centers when considered separately, ranging between 1.5 and 1.7. Analysis of the data using the additive model also showed a highly significant association (OR&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1.4 per allele &#x0005b;95&#x00025; CI 1.2&#x02013;1.7&#x0005d;, <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.0003; <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000321-t002">Table 2</xref>) indicating that having more A alleles was significantly greater in WNV-positive individuals than in controls. The OR for each center when considered separately was less consistent in this model, spanning between 1.2 and 2.0. To determine which model fits the data best, we analyzed the predicted probability of WNV infection by copies of A allele under the three models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000321-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Superimposed are the observed proportions of WNV-positive individuals by copies of A (square boxes) along with the 95&#x00025; CI. By comparing the observed to predicted proportion of cases by number of alleles using chi-square goodness-of-fit tests, we determined that the recessive and additive models are approximately equally supported by the data, with the dominant model having a decidedly poorer fit. We also analyzed each genotype separately, using GG as the reference genotype, since the G allele is the ancestral allele (from published <italic>Pan troglodytes</italic> sequence data, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</ext-link>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000321-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, the strongest association with WNV infection was observed when AA was compared to the GG genotype (OR&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1.8, 95&#x00025; &#x0005b;CI&#x0005d; 1.2&#x02013;2.7, <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.002).

This is based on association of the <italic>OAS1</italic> &#x02018;A&#x02019; allele at SNP rs10774671, which has previously been associated with low OAS enzymatic activity, with seropositivity for WNV using recessive and additive genetic models on patient samples collected from five US centers. We found that the AA genotype was elevated in WNV-positive individuals regardless of whether these patients remained asymptomatic or developed symptomatic disease, including WNF and WNND. We also observed that homozygosity for the A allele correlated with increased levels of WNV replication in primary lymphoid tissue from human donors. Moreover, the results are consistent with the previously reported identification of the flavivirus resistance locus <italic>flv</italic> in mice as a truncation mutation in <italic>oas1b</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000321-Mashimo1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000321-Perelygin1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, the ortholog of human <italic>OAS1</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000321-Mashimo2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data do not confirm the previously published association of <italic>OASL</italic> and WNV infection in man. Together, these data suggest that OAS1 activity modulates early viral replication, and that decreased OAS1 activity is associated with increased risk of infection and seroconversion. These data suggest that carriers of the G allele, which is associated with high OAS1 activity, may effectively control WNV replication early after infection in humans through innate mechanisms. Furthermore, since <italic>oas1b</italic> in the mouse has been implicated in resistance not only to WNV, but to several other flaviviruses, this association may also be relevant for other medically important neurotropic flaviviruses, such as Japanese encephalitis virus, Yellow Fever virus, and Tick-borne encephalitis virus.</p><p>There are several limitations to our study. First, like most gene association studies, the analysis is retrospective. Second, due to a limitation of sample availability the association of WNV infection with <italic>OAS1</italic> SNP 10774671 was determined only in North American Caucasians. Third, the epidemiologic data, while consistent with a role for <italic>OAS1</italic> in controlling WNV infection, do not establish causality versus linkage disequilibrium with an as yet unidentified causal variant. Importantly though, the variant tested has been previously associated with OAS function, and is therefore biologically plausible <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000321-BonnevieNielsen1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Additional work will be needed to delineate the precise mechanisms by which <italic>OAS1</italic> SNP rs10774671 variation may affect WNV infection.

However, additional work will be needed to determine <italic>OAS1</italic> allele-specific activity in tonsil tissue as a function of WNV infection, and the relative contribution of each of the <italic>OAS1</italic> isoforms present in the tissue.
