We used tandem affinity purification to isolate native Vpr complexes.

Depletion of VPRBP by small interfering RNA impaired Vpr-mediated induction of G2 arrest. Importantly, VPRBP knockdown alone did not affect normal cell cycle progression or activation of ATR checkpoints, suggesting that the involvement of VPRBP in G2 arrest was specific to Vpr. Moreover, leucine/isoleucine-rich domain Vpr mutants impaired in their ability to interact with VPRBP and DDB1 also produced strongly attenuated G2 arrest. In contrast, G2 arrest&#x02013;defective C-terminal Vpr mutants were found to maintain their ability to associate with these proteins, suggesting that the interaction of Vpr with the DDB1-VPRBP complex is necessary but not sufficient to block cell cycle progression. Overall, these results point toward a model in which Vpr could act as a connector between the DDB1-CUL4A<sup>VPRBP</sup> E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and an unknown cellular factor whose proteolysis or modulation of activity through ubiquitination would activate ATR-mediated checkpoint signaling and induce G2 arrest.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the causative agent of AIDS, encodes several proteins termed accessory, which play a critical role in viral pathogenesis. Collectively, HIV-1 accessory proteins Vif, Vpr, Vpu, and Nef have been shown to manipulate host cell biology to promote viral replication, immune evasion, and AIDS progression. In this context, Vpr has been found to block normal cell growth. This interruption of cell division by Vpr is thought to increase viral replication and induce programmed cell death. However, how Vpr is able to block cell division remains unknown. To understand this mechanism, we have studied the interaction between Vpr and novel cellular proteins. We identified a novel complex comprising Vpr and cellular proteins involved in a process called ubiquitination. Ubiquitination is a mechanism by which a small protein, ubiquitin, is conjugated to cellular proteins to modulate their activity or induce their degradation. We demonstrated that association of Vpr with this ubiquitinating complex might be responsible for the defect in cell growth. Further characterization of this protein complex and the elucidation of the mechanism by which it affects cell growth might lead to the development of new anti-HIV drugs and an improved understanding of the basic cellular processes controlling cell division.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Belzile JP, Duisit G, Rougeau N, Mercier J, Finzi A, et al.

However, immunoprecipitation using endogenous, TAP-tagged, HA-tagged, or GFP-fused DDB1 as bait and wild-type or HA-tagged Vpr yielded inconsistent results (unpublished data). These discrepancies between HA-Vpr and TAP-Vpr abilities to bind to DDB1 are reminiscent of the versatile association between DDB1 and the DNA replication licensing factor CDT1.

Surprisingly, no binding could be detected between Vpr and DDB1, a result consistent with the lack of interaction observed with some co-immunoprecipitation experiments. We found that dimerization of TAP-Vpr was three times weaker than that of the wild-type protein. Hence, N-terminal addition of large peptide appears to disturb the tertiary structure of Vpr, explaining at least in part the reduction of TAP-Vpr cytostatic abilities.

As an alternative strategy, we analyzed the effect of siRNA-mediated VPRBP knockdown on Vpr cytostatic properties. Cells transfected with VPRBP siRNA displayed a major reduction of VPRBP at the mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030085-g004">Figure 4</xref>A) as well as at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030085-g004">Figure 4</xref>B) compared with scrambled siRNA-transfected cells. We thus transfected HEK293 cells with siRNA against VPRBP and, 24 h later, transduced these cells with a lentiviral vector co-expressing GFP and native Vpr. We observed that cells transfected with VPRBP siRNA displayed strongly attenuated Vpr-mediated G2 arrest as compared with cells that received scrambled control siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030085-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). This difference in the induction of G2 arrest was not due to a defect in infectivity potentially resulting from VPRBP knockdown, because the levels of transduction were equivalent in all the conditions tested (unpublished data). To verify that this defect in the induction of G2 arrest in VPRBP-depleted cells was the result of the abrogation of the Vpr&#x02013;VPRBP interaction rather than a defect in cell growth, we treated these cells with nocodazole with the rationale that properly cycling cells should accumulate in mitosis because of the effect of the drug on microtubule polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030085-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). In response to nocodazole, cells transfected with VPRBP siRNA alone or with the concomitant expression of Vpr accumulated at the G2/M phase, indicating that knockdown of VPRBP specifically impaired Vpr-mediated G2 arrest functions. Moreover, the knockdown of VPRBP did not produce any observable defects in the activation of the ATR-mediated checkpoints, since treatment with low concentrations of aphidicolin, a DNA replication inhibitor known to produce DNA double-strand breaks at fragile chromosomal sites and to activate the ATR-mediated intra-S checkpoint &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030085-b029">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030085-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;, blocked cell cycle progression at the S-phase in scrambled as well as VPRBP siRNA-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030085-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). Finally, we analyzed the role of VPRBP in the induction of G2 arrest by Vpr in the context of viral infection.

We analyzed whether the L64A and Q65R mutations in this domain of Vpr could abrogate binding to VPRBP. Using our TAP-Vpr pull-down assay, we observed a very strong reduction of binding to VPRBP and DDB1 with the Q65R mutant (under longer exposure VPRBP could be detected) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030085-g006">Figure 6</xref>B, compare lanes 3 and 4). A residual association with DDB1 was observed under these conditions, most likely reflecting difference in antibody affinities.

Indeed, the residual level of G2 arrest observed with these two mutants was comparable with the attenuated G2 arrest produced by the R80A mutation.

Knockdown of VPRBP did not produce cell cycle aberrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030085-g005">Figure 5</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030085-g005">5</xref>C) or reduce viral/vector infection efficiency, suggesting that the observed defect in G2 arrest was specific to the association of Vpr with VPRBP.</p><p>It has been extensively shown that Vpr C-terminal residues 78&#x02212;96 are important for G2 arrest &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030085-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030085-b050">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030085-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d;, but we found that TAP-tagged Vpr mutants S79A and R80A attenuated for cell cycle arrest were nevertheless competent for association with DDB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030085-g006">Figure 6</xref>). This was not surprising given that Zhao et al. showed that VPRBP binding required the leucine/isoleucine-rich domain of Vpr &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030085-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. In fact, L64A and Q65R, two mutations in the leucine/isoleucine-rich domain, reduced to different extents the binding of Vpr to VPRBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030085-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). We also observed a concomitant decrease of affinity between Vpr and DDB1 as a result of these mutations, suggesting that a single complex comprised of VPRBP and DDB1 is binding to the leucine/isoleucine-rich domain of Vpr. Importantly, these two mutations strongly attenuated Vpr-induced G2 arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030085-g006">Figure 6</xref>C). Overall, these results suggest that recruitment of DDB1-CUL4A<sup>VPRBP</sup> by Vpr is necessary but not sufficient to induce G2 cell cycle arrest.</p><p>One possible model to explain how Vpr induces G2 arrest via the DDB1-CUL4A<sup>VPRBP</sup> complex is that Vpr could cause a generalized defect in the activity of the whole DDB1 complex. In this context, other investigators have shown that abrogation of DDB1 function using siRNA resulted in the failure to degrade CDT1, thus leading to the accumulation of re-replicated DNA fragment and the induction of an ATR-dependent G2 arrest &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030085-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore, Vpr, through a potential sequestration of DDB1, might be capable of inducing the defective regulation of CDT1 or other DDB1-CUL4A E3 ligase complex substrates leading to ATR-mediated G2 arrest. However, we did not observe any obvious effect of Vpr on the S-phase degradation of CDT1 (unpublished data), which suggests that the DDB1-CUL4A-RBX1 complex was fully functional. Another possible model is that Vpr could block the proper ubiquitination of natural substrates of DDB1-CUL4A<sup>VPRBP</sup>, thereby affecting their biological activities or preventing their degradation. However, this possibility is unlikely because siRNA-mediated knockdown of VPRBP did not produce G2 arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030085-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The most probable model is that Vpr triggers the degradation of a yet-unknown modulator of cell cycle progression by targeting it to the substrate receptor VPRBP, itself linked to the DDB1-CUL4A-RBX1 E3 ligase complex. This situation would be highly similar to the mechanism by which Vpu induces the degradation of CD4 by recruiting directly CD4 to the SCF <sup>&#x003b2;-TRCP</sup> E3 ubiquitin ligase complex &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030085-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d;. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the Vpr&#x02013;VPRBP interaction might modulate the activity of substrates through ubiquitination, as was described for XPC and histones &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030085-b038">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030085-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore, the formation of a complex between Vpr and DDB1-CUL4A<sup>VPRBP</sup> through the Vpr leucine/isoleucine-rich domain could permit the hypothetical interaction of Vpr through its C-terminal domain with other cellular factors whose ubiquitination would induce the initial events leading to cell cycle arrest. This model is consistent with recent reports &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030085-b054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030085-b055">55</xref>&#x0005d; demonstrating the involvement of VPRBP and DDB1 in Vpr-induced G2 cell cycle arrest.</p><p>In conclusion, we presented biochemical and functional evidence suggesting that Vpr is likely the third protein encoded by HIV-1, besides Vif and Vpu, to interact with the ubiquitination machinery. Vpr was found to associate with DDB1 and CUL4A, which are components of the DDB1-CUL4A-RBX1 E3 ligase complex, possibly through the intermediary of the WD40 substrate receptor VPRBP. Importantly, the interaction between Vpr and the VPRBP-DDB1 complex was shown to be required for the induction of G2 arrest. Vpr could act as a connector, bridging the DDB1-CUL4A<sup>VPRBP</sup> E3 ubiquitin ligase to an unknown cellular factor whose proteolysis or modulation of activity through ubiquitination would activate ATR-mediated checkpoint signaling and cause G2 arrest.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cells and antibodies.</title><p>HEK293 and HEK293T cells were maintained as described elsewhere &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030085-b056">56</xref>&#x0005d;.
