GSK3&#x003b2; could be inactivated by phosphorylation at Ser-9 by serine/threonine kinases, such as Akt, protein kinase A (PKA), and protein kinase C (PKC), followed by decreased activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006640-Cross1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006640-Fang2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006640-g001">figure 1A</xref>, Ser-9 phosphorylation of GSK3&#x003b2; (p-GSK3&#x003b2;) was indeed decreased in MKK7-JNK2-transfected HKE293T cells, which meant that GSK3&#x003b2; activity was increased by activated JNK2. The expression pattern of p-GSK3&#x003b2; is similar to that of &#x003b2;-catenin, leading us to postulate that the &#x003b2;-catenin degradation is attributed to the increased GSK3&#x003b2; activity induced by JNK2 activation. In fact, increased GSK3&#x003b2; activity and corresponding downregulation of &#x003b2;-catenin were also seen in A549 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006640-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>To further test our hypothesis, GSK3&#x003b2; inhibitor lithium chloride (LiCl) was used to suppress GSK3&#x003b2; activity and the effect of activated JNK2 on &#x003b2;-catenin expression was analyzed.
