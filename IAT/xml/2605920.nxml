The first molecular mechanism for long-term memory storage in the brain was recently identified as the persistent action of protein kinase Mzeta (PKM&#x003b6;), an autonomously active atypical protein kinase C (PKC) isoform critical for the maintenance of long-term potentiation (LTP). PKM&#x003b6; maintains aversively conditioned associations, but what general form of information the kinase encodes in the brain is unknown. We first confirmed the specificity of the action of zeta inhibitory peptide (ZIP) by disrupting long-term memory for active place avoidance with chelerythrine, a second inhibitor of PKM&#x003b6; activity. We then examined, using ZIP, the effect of PKM&#x003b6; inhibition in dorsal hippocampus (DH) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) on retention of 1-d-old information acquired in the radial arm maze, water maze, inhibitory avoidance, and contextual and cued fear conditioning paradigms. In the DH, PKM&#x003b6; inhibition selectively disrupted retention of information for spatial reference, but not spatial working memory in the radial arm maze, and precise, but not coarse spatial information in the water maze. Thus retention of accurate spatial, but not procedural and contextual information required PKM&#x003b6; activity. Similarly, PKM&#x003b6; inhibition in the hippocampus did not affect contextual information after fear conditioning. In contrast, PKM&#x003b6; inhibition in the BLA impaired retention of classical conditioned stimulus&#x02013;unconditioned stimulus (CS-US) associations for both contextual and auditory fear, as well as instrumentally conditioned inhibitory avoidance. PKM&#x003b6; inhibition had no effect on postshock freezing, indicating fear expression mediated by the BLA remained intact. Thus, persistent PKM&#x003b6; activity is a general mechanism for both appetitively and aversively motivated retention of specific, accurate learned information, but is not required for processing contextual, imprecise, or procedural information.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>How long-term memories are stored as physical traces in the brain is a fundamental question in neuroscience.

Most PKC isoforms consist of an N-terminal regulatory domain, which contains second messenger-binding sites and an autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate sequence, and a C-terminal catalytic domain &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060318-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. Under basal conditions, the pseudosubstrate interacts with the catalytic domain and maintains the enzyme in an autoinhibited resting state. Second messengers, such as diacylglycerol or Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, can then activate full-length PKCs by binding to the regulatory domain, causing a conformational change that releases the autoinhibition. PKM&#x003b6;, in contrast, is an independent PKC&#x003b6; catalytic domain, which, lacking autoinhibition from a regulatory domain, is autonomously active. In the brain, PKM&#x003b6; is generated by an internal promoter within the <italic>PKC&#x003b6;</italic> gene, which produces a PKM&#x003b6; mRNA that encodes only the &#x003b6; catalytic domain &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060318-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;.

The persistent PKM&#x003b6; activity is critical for maintaining enhanced synaptic transmission, because inhibition by the cell-permeable zeta inhibitory peptide (ZIP), which mimics the pseudosubstrate of the missing PKC&#x003b6; regulatory domain, reverses synaptic potentiation in the hippocampus when applied up to 1 d after LTP induction &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060318-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;.

We therefore examined the effect of chelerythrine on long-term memory retention of active place avoidance. On the first trial, rats entered the shock zone within seconds, but with training, the animals learned to avoid the shock zone for several minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060318-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

Turning on the shock improved avoidance in the vehicle-injected rats even further.

This mechanism is specific for sustaining accurate learned associations because inhibition of the kinase did not affect the expression of imprecise, contextual, and procedural information that depends upon the functioning of the brain regions in which the associations were stored. PKM&#x003b6; inhibition thus contrasts with permanent or temporary lesions, which affect both types of information.

Thus, the same injections of ZIP resulted in the loss of information supporting accurate spatial reference memory in the eight-arm radial maze task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060318-g002">Figure 2</xref>C), but no effect on the ability to use working memory to do the win-shift foraging procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060318-g002">Figure 2</xref>B).

Briefly, the rat is placed on an 82-cm&#x02013;diameter metal disk that is elevated 78 cm from the floor and rotates at 1 rpm within a room with numerous visual landmarks off of the disk. Prior to training, the rat is implanted with a subcutaneous shock electrode between the shoulders, through which a constant current (0.3 mA, 60 Hz, 500 ms) electrical foot shock is delivered whenever the rat enters an unmarked shock zone. The impedance between the shock electrode and the skin is approximately 1,000 times less than the impedance between the rat's feet and the metal disk, which is grounded, so the major voltage drop is across the feet. The shock zone is an unmarked 60&#x000b0; sector that is defined by distal visual landmarks in the room. The location of the rat is determined from an overhead television camera each 33 ms by a PC-controlled tracking system (Bio-Signal Group). When the system detects the rat in the shock zone, the shock is delivered and repeated every 1,500 ms until the rat leaves the shock zone.</p><p>Place avoidance training begins with a pretraining trial. The rat is placed on the rotating disk to explore the environment with the shock turned off for 10 min. After resting in the home cage for 10 min, the rat receives eight training trials with the shock turned on. There is a 10-min rest in the home cage between trials. Twenty-two hours after training, the rat was injected in both hippocampi with either chelerythrine (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 5; 10 nmol in 50&#x00025; DMSO-saline) or the vehicle (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 4), and 2 h later, retention of the 24-h place avoidance memory was tested by returning the rat to the rotating disk with the shock off. The time to first enter 9th shock zone and the percent time in the shock zone estimated retention of memory. Immediately following the retention test for long-term memory, short-term memory was assessed. Short-term memory is established by turning on the shock for 10 min, and then retention is tested during a 10-min test period with the shock off.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Eight-arm radial maze.</title><p>Spatial reference memory is distinguished from spatial working memory in the eight-arm radial maze because in reference memory, information about which arm locations are consistently baited is valid across trials, whereas working memory requires spatial information for which arm locations were visited within a trial, information that is only useful for the specific trial.

The rats were food deprived to 85&#x00025;&#x02013;90&#x00025; of their free-feeding weight prior to training on the eight-arm radial maze. The maze was 220 cm in diameter with a 60-cm&#x02013;diameter central platform. Each arm was 16-cm wide and radiated 80 cm from the center. The maze was wiped with 70&#x00025; ethanol between trials and rotated 90&#x000b0; every day to discourage the use of internal maze cues. The day before formal training began, each rat received two 10-min shaping trials with all arms baited by placing approximately 0.05 g of a sweetened oatmeal cereal mash (Maypo; International Home Foods) in the sunken food well at the end of each arm. Two rats were on the maze for the first shaping trial; and 1 h later, each rat received a second shaping trail by itself. On training trials, four arms were baited, and the food cups at the ends of the unbaited arms had inaccessible mash to control for odor cues. The locations of baited and unbaited arms were constant for a subject and balanced across subjects. There were ten training trials on each day. The rat was confined to the center of the maze by a large, overturned transparent bowl prior to each trial. Once released, the rat was free to forage until it consumed all the accessible food, or until 3 min had elapsed. Entry to an arm was scored when the rat crossed the halfway point of an arm. A trial was scored for correct entries, reference memory errors (visits to unbaited arms), and working memory errors (return visits to an arm) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060318-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;. Training continued for 6 d (60 trials) to establish a strong memory. The next day, 24 h after training ceased, a single reinforced trial was given to test memory.

The rats were trained to find a circular, 10-cm&#x02013;diameter clear Perspex platform that was submerged 1 cm below the water surface halfway between the center of the pool and the wall along the 0&#x000b0; radius. A rat was released in pseudorandom order from one of four equally separated locations along the wall. Each release location was used once in a four-trial training block. The path of the rat was automatically tracked with an overhead television camera (iTrack; Bio-Signal Group). Software (TrackAnalysis and TrackExplorer; Bio-Signal Group) calculated the latency to escape onto the platform, the time spent in each quadrant centered at 0&#x000b0;, 90&#x000b0;, 180&#x000b0;, and 270&#x000b0;, the time in each 11.5-cm&#x02013;square region of the pool, and each 2 s, the rat's swim speed. Acquisition training lasted 5 d (two blocks/day). On day 6, 22 h after the last training, the rats were injected with saline, scr-ZIP, or ZIP, and 2 h after that, retention of the long-term place memory was tested by a probe trial with the escape platform removed. On this probe, the rat was placed in the center of the pool, and where it spent its time was measured for 1 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Fear conditioning.</title><p><italic>Contextual fear.</italic> Lesions of the DH disrupt the general, contextual component of the learned fear response in contextual conditioning paradigms.

The chambers were contextually distinct. &#x0201c;Context A&#x0201d; (used for conditioning and context retention testing), had working ventilation fans that produced background noise (65 dB).

Twenty-six hours after the infusions, long-term retention of contextual fear memory was assessed by measuring freezing behavior during a 10-min extinction session in Context A. Seventy-four hours after the infusions, long-term memory for the tone-shock association was assessed by measuring freezing during an extinction test in the novel Context B.

After 10 s, the door automatically opened, allowing access to the shock compartment, and latency to enter was taken as a measure of inhibitory avoidance acquisition. The door closed after the rat completely entered the shock compartment, and 2 s later, a brief foot shock (0.9 mA, 2 s) was delivered.
