Two different forms of USF, characterized by apparent molecular weights of 43,000 and 44,000, were originally identified in HeLa cells by biochemical analysis. Clones for the 43-kDa USF were first characterized, but only partial clones for the human 44-kDa USF (USF2, or FIP) have been reported. Here we describe a complete cDNA for the 44-kDa USF from murine cells. Analysis of this clone has revealed that the various USF family members are quite divergent in their N-terminal amino acid sequences, while a high degree of conservation characterizes their dimerization and DNA-binding domains. Interestingly, the 3' noncoding region of the 44-kDa USF cDNAs displayed an unusual degree of conservation between human and mouse. In vitro transcription/translation experiments indicated a possible role for this region in translation regulation. Alternative splicing forms of the 44-kDa USF messages exist in both mouse and human. Examination of the tissue and cell-type distribution of USF by Northern blot and gel retardation assays revealed that while expression of both the 43- and 44-kDa USF species is ubiquitous, different ratios of USF homo- and heterodimers are found in different cells.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00027-0185-a" xlink:role="429"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00027-0186-a" xlink:role="430"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00027-0186-b" xlink:role="430"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00027-0187-a" xlink:role="431"/></fig><fig id="F5"><graphic xlink:href="nar00027-0187-b" xlink:role="431"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00027-0183.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="427"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00027-0184.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="428"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00027-0185.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="429"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00027-0186.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="430"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00027-0187.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="431"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00027-0188.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="432"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00027-0189.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="433"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
