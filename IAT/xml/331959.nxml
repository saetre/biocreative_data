The kin17 amino acid sequence predicts two domains, which were shown to be functional: (i) a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) that can drive the protein to the cell nucleus, (ii) a bona fide zinc finger of the C2H2 type. The zinc finger is involved in kin17 binding to double-stranded DNA since a mutant deleted of the zinc finger, kin17 delta 1, showed reduced binding. Single-stranded DNA was bound poorly by kin17. Interestingly, we found that kin17 protein showed preferential binding to curved DNA from either pBR322 or synthetic oligonucleotides. Binding of kin17 to a non-curved DNA segment increased after we had inserted into it a short curved synthetic oligonucleotide. Kin17 delta 2, a mutant deleted of 110 amino acids at the C-terminal end, still exhibited preferential binding to curved DNA and so did kin17 delta 1, suggesting that a domain recognizing curved DNA is located in the protein core.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00044-0329-a" xlink:role="4337"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00044-0330-a" xlink:role="4338"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00044-0330-b" xlink:role="4338"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00044-0331-a" xlink:role="4339"/></fig><fig id="F5"><graphic xlink:href="nar00044-0331-b" xlink:role="4339"/></fig><fig id="F6"><graphic xlink:href="nar00044-0332-a" xlink:role="4340"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00044-0327.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4335"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00044-0328.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4336"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00044-0329.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4337"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00044-0330.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4338"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00044-0331.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4339"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00044-0332.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4340"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00044-0333.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4341"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
