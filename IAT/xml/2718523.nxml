This involves coordinated expression of hundreds to thousands of genes, whose expression is precisely modulated in timing and magnitude. Many different transcription factors function in the cell at any given time and respond to distinct upstream signals. Therefore, cells must integrate the action of numerous signals and regulatory factors to produce a coherent genomic expression program customized for each new environment.</p><p>Yeast respond to stress in part by initiating the Environmental Stress Response (ESR), which consists of approximately 600 genes whose expression is repressed and approximately 300 genes whose expression is induced by diverse stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The repressed genes include approximately 130 ribosomal protein ('RP') genes and a distinct group of approximately 450 genes more broadly related to protein synthesis ('PS genes'). Both groups are highly expressed in actively growing cells but sharply repressed, with slightly different expression profiles, in response to stress. Genes induced in the ESR ('iESR genes') are involved in varied aspects of stress defense, including redox regulation, protein folding, osmo-tolerance, cell signaling, and other functions. Initiation of the ESR is not required to survive the offending stress but rather helps to protect cells against subsequent severe doses of the same or different stress (although it cannot fully explain acquired stress resistance in all cases) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Although activated by many different stresses, the ESR is regulated differently depending on the environment. Numerous upstream signaling pathways have been implicated in condition-specific ESR regulation, including the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] (Jessica Clarke and APG, unpublished data), MEC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and protein kinase C (Scott Topper and APG, unpublished) pathways in response to osmotic shock, DNA damage, or reducing agents, respectively, and the protein kinase A and target of rapamycin (TOR) pathways upon stress relief [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]). Furthermore, different subsets of iESR genes can be induced by stress-specific transcription factors, such as the oxidative-stress factor Yap1p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], the heat shock factor Hsf1p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], Sko1p and Hot1p upon osmotic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and the 'general-stress' transcription factors Msn2p and Msn4p in response to diverse stresses (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]). However, little is known about how these signals are integrated to mediate ESR initiation, or how genes repressed in the ESR are coordinated with genes induced in the program.</p><p>One mechanism of altering gene expression is through changes in chromatin state. The histone deacetylase Rpd3p deacetylates histones in both coding and noncoding regions, where it is thought to function in at least two distinct complexes (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]). A small complex (Rpd3S) suppresses cryptic transcription initiation by deacetylating histones after elongating polymerase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Rpd3S is recruited via the combined action of the Eaf3p and Rco1p subunits to histone H3 methylated by Set2p during transcription of the open reading frame [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In contrast, a large complex (Rpd3L) is recruited to promoters by site-specific DNA binding proteins, including the Ume6p subunit of Rpd3L, where it is thought to function in transcription initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Rpd3p is known to bind different promoters under different conditions, such as cold shock and rapamycin treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In fact, many promoters to which Rpd3p relocalizes are of genes repressed in the ESR. The effects of Rpd3p at these promoters have not been shown on a global scale, but the result suggests Rpd3p is required for stress-dependent repression of ESR genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>Although traditionally linked to repression, histone deacetylases can also function during gene activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Induction of several different yeast genes requires Rpd3p following salt treatment, hypoxia, or DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The precise mechanism is not clear but requires Rpd3p for recruitment of RNA polymerase to promoters of genes (including iESR genes) induced by osmotic shock and DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Furthermore, induction of hypoxic genes requires Rpd3p-dependent histone deacetylation for nucleosome displacement and stable binding of the Upc2p transcription factor within the genes' regulatory regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. That Rpd3p has been linked to stress-dependent gene induction and repression raised the possibility that Rpd3p participates in regulating both induced and repressed genes within the ESR.</p><p>Indeed, here we show that Rpd3p is required for proper initiation of the ESR, including normal regulation of both induced and repressed genes, in yeast responding to multiple stresses. Cells lacking <italic>RPD3 </italic>or the Rpd3L subunit <italic>PHO23 </italic>had a major defect, specifically during the transient phase immediately after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>treatment, while cells lacking the Rpd3S subunit <italic>RCO1 </italic>did not. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) at candidate ESR genes revealed that Rpd3p moves to numerous promoters upon stress to mediate histone deacetylation; however, the precise pattern of chromatin change was different for different nucleosomes and genes investigated. We show that Rpd3p binds directly to genes induced by stress and is required for normal binding of Msn2p to numerous promoters. Together, this work implicates Rpd3L as an important co-factor in the ESR regulatory network.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Rpd3p is required for the full dynamic range of stress-activated gene expression changes</title><p>We followed genomic expression in wild-type and <italic>rpd3&#x00394; </italic>cells responding over time to a 25&#x000b0;C to 37&#x000b0;C heat shock, 0.4 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and 0.75 M NaCl. A large fraction (56 to 80%) of the gene expression changes seen in wild-type cells was affected by <italic>RPD3 </italic>deletion, and this included both repressed and induced genes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). In particular, Rpd3p was required for normal expression of the vast majority of ESR genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Repression of PS genes was heavily dependent on Rpd3p in response to all stresses, whereas repression of RP genes required Rpd3p for full repression in response to heat and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>stress but not salt treatment. Normal induction of iESR genes also required Rpd3p, since the <italic>rpd3&#x00394; </italic>strain displayed more than twofold decreased induction levels at the peak of the response. Interestingly, a subset of iESR genes (approximately 50% at a false discovery rate of 0.05) showed slight derepression (approximately 1.5-fold) in the <italic>rpd3&#x00394; </italic>mutant in the absence of stress (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>; Figure S1 in Additional data file 1). The defect in stress-dependent induction was not due to an already activated stress response in mutant cells, indicated by normal cytosolic localization of Msn2p before stress but substantial Msn2p nuclear accumulation after stress, similar to wild-type (Figure S2 in Additional data file 1). Furthermore, these iESR genes (as well as those with no significant difference in basal expression) still had a defect in induction beyond what could be accounted for by basal expression differences (Figure S1 in Additional data file 1). Thus, Rpd3p is required for the induction and repression of ESR genes during stress, although each ESR subgroup shows a qualitatively different dependence on the protein.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Rpd3p is required for stress-dependent activation of the environmental stress response.

We found that Rpd3p is particularly important for this transient phase of expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). PS genes showed almost no transient expression changes, while iESR genes showed reduced expression levels specifically at the peak of the transient phase. RP genes also showed diminished expression differences at the peak of the response to heat shock and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>treatment. Despite the defect in transient ESR expression, the <italic>rpd3&#x00394; </italic>mutant eventually reached near-wild-type expression changes by the end of these time courses. This indicates that Rpd3p is not necessarily required to maintain new steady-state levels of expression in cells acclimated to high temperature or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, but is critical in producing a large, rapid response to stress.</p></sec><sec><title>ESR regulation requires histone deacetylase activity through the Rpd3L complex</title><p>We found that the catalytic activity of Rpd3p, as well as modifiable histones and subunits of the Rpd3L complex, were required for proper ESR regulation. Cells harboring the catalytically inactive <italic>rpd3-H150:151A </italic>protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] or treated with the Rpd3p inhibitor trichostatin A displayed the same widespread defect as the <italic>rpd3&#x00394; </italic>strain (Figure S3 in Additional data file 1). A similar defect was observed in cells harboring a mutant histone H4 (H4KQ), in which amino-terminal lysines were changed to glutamine to mimic the acetylated histone state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] (Figure S3 in Additional data file 1). This effect was particularly clear for PS and iESR genes, although there was only a subtle defect in repression of the RP genes in the H4 mutant strain.</p><p>To distinguish between the effects of the different Rpd3p complexes, we characterized the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>response in cells lacking Pho23p or Rco1p, exclusive members of the Rpd3L and Rpd3S complexes, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The expression defect seen in the <italic>pho23&#x00394; </italic>mutant, but not the <italic>rco1&#x00394; </italic>cells, was highly similar to that in the <italic>rpd3&#x00394; </italic>mutant. Over 80% of Rpd3p-affected genes were equally dependent on Pho23p (R = 0.94, m = 0.98), whereas less than 12% of Rpd3-affected genes showed a partial expression defect in cells lacking <italic>RCO1</italic>. Furthermore, the <italic>pho23&#x00394; </italic>strain showed the same defect in transient expression as the <italic>rpd3&#x00394; </italic>cells (Figure S4 in Additional data file 1). In contrast, the <italic>rco1&#x00394; </italic>cells showed large changes in expression similar to wild type, albeit with a slightly delayed response that is difficult to interpret due to spurious internal transcripts in this mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Nonetheless, these data show that defects in the magnitude and transience of gene expression can be accounted for by the Rpd3L complex. Consistent with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], we found few of the Rpd3L-dependent expression changes were dependent on the Ume6p subunit (data not shown), which is thought to recruit the complex to specific loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. This suggests that other DNA binding proteins may be required for Rpd3L-dependent gene expression changes (see below).</p></sec><sec><title>Representative ESR genes show Rpd3p-dependent changes in chromatin following stress</title><p>Previous studies showed Rpd3p physically bound to many ESR-gene promoters during times of stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Global studies probing Rpd3p binding after cold shock (inadvertently inflicted by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]) and rapamycin treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] showed that promoters of 60% of PS genes (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 10<sup>-32</sup>) and 90% of RP genes (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 10<sup>-20</sup>) were bound by Rpd3p. Few of these regions are bound under standard conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Roughly 20% of iESR-gene upstream regions were bound by Rpd3p under stress conditions, though this may be an underestimate, since chromatin-remodeling enzymes are difficult to ChIP, particularly during dynamic responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Consistent with these studies, we found Rpd3p bound upstream of four representative ESR genes (including one PS, one RP, and two iESR genes) after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Three of the targets also showed some Rpd3p binding before stress, and all but the <italic>UBC5 </italic>promoter showed increased Rpd3p binding after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>treatment. These results were similar to those seen in cold-shock (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), suggesting that many of the previously observed binding events from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] also occur during H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> stress.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Rpd3p is bound upstream of several target genes after stress.

The results showed different trends at different genes. Nucleosomes at repressed ESR genes <italic>GAR1 </italic>and <italic>RPL16A </italic>showed Rpd3L-dependent changes in histone deacetylation following H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>treatment. Though wild-type cells showed an approximately three- to eightfold decrease (depending on the gene and nucleosome) in the fraction of acetylated nucleosomes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>), both the <italic>rpd3&#x00394; </italic>and <italic>pho23&#x00394; </italic>mutants had a major defect in histone deacetylation across both repressed ESR genes. This defect correlated with the defect in their H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-dependent repression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>).

This analysis pointed to transcription factors involved in the Rpd3p-dependent and Rpd3p-independent regulation of gene expression (Table S1 in Additional data file 2).</p><p>Multiple clusters of Rpd3p-dependent induced genes were enriched for genes with upstream Msn2p and Msn4p binding sites (CCCCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]), consistent with the known role of Msn2/4p in regulating iESR genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Another cluster of Rpd3-dependent repressed genes was heavily enriched for genes with upstream Polymerase A and C (PAC; GCGATGAG) elements and Ribosomal RNA Processing Elements (RRPEs; AAAAWTTTT), known to be enriched in PS genes and previously linked to promoters bound by Rpd3p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Another cluster was enriched for proteasome genes and genes containing binding sites of the proteasome regulator Rpn4p. These associations raise the possibility that Rpd3p may work with these factors to mediate the observed gene expression changes (see more below).</p><p>Interestingly, we identified some genes whose expression was conditionally dependent on Rpd3p. Targets of the heat shock transcription factor Hsf1p or the oxidative stress transcription factor Yap1p were only dependent on Rpd3p in response to specific conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The majority of Hsf1p targets did not require Rpd3p for induction following heat shock but showed Rpd3-dependent induction in response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>and NaCl treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>). Similarly, induction of Yap1p targets (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>) was independent of Rpd3p in response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, while a subset induced with the ESR required Rpd3p for full induction following heat shock and salt stress only. Hsf1p and Yap1p are known to be condition-specific regulators of subsets of iESR genes, functioning during heat shock and oxidative stress, respectively (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]). Under other conditions, many of these genes are regulated by Msn2/4p. Our observations are consistent with the model that Hsf1p and Yap1p function independently of Rpd3p to regulate gene induction, whereas Msn2/4p act in an Rpd3p-dependent manner.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Targets of Hsf1p and Yap1p show conditional dependence on Rpd3p.

Interestingly, genes fell into different categories depending on their expression defect (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). One class of genes was equally dependent on Rpd3p and Msn2/4p for induction, with no additional defect in the triple mutant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>). A second class required both sets of factors but was more dependent on Msn2/4p (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>), while a third class suggests redundant function of Rpd3p and Msn2/4p at these genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c</xref>). The latter group was enriched for genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 10<sup>-8</sup>) and trehalose synthesis (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 10<sup>-5</sup>), suggesting functional relevance of the categorization. A fourth class of genes was dependent only on Rpd3p (data not shown), indicating that additional Rpd3p-dependent transcription factors are required for proper initiation of the ESR (including Rpn4p and others). Importantly, a fifth group of genes was dependent only on Msn2/Msn4p (data not shown), which underscores that the Rpd3p-dependent defect in iESR-gene induction is not simply caused by failure to activate Msn2/4p, consistent with microscopy data (Figure S2 in Additional data file 1). Thus, most but not all of Msn2/4p-dependent genes require Rpd3p for full induction, and these targets show qualitative differences in their dependence.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Rpd3p is required for proper Msn2/4p action. <bold>(a-c) </bold>Gene expression measured in wild-type (WT), <italic>rpd3&#x00394;</italic>, <italic>msn2&#x00394; </italic>/<italic>msn4&#x00394;</italic>, and <italic>msn2&#x00394; </italic>/<italic>msn4&#x00394; </italic>/<italic>rpd3&#x00394; </italic>cells treated with 0.4 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>for 30 minutes.

We show that Rpd3p and the Rpd3L subunit Pho23p (but not the Rpd3S component Rco1p), as well as Rpd3p catalytic activity and modifiable histones, are required to produce these effects. Rpd3p binds directly to promoters of representative ESR genes, indicating that the Rpd3-dependent changes in chromatin structure that we see are direct at these promoters. Furthermore, the observed defects in iESR induction correlate with decreased Msn2p binding at candidate promoters in the <italic>rpd3&#x00394; </italic>strain. Together with previous global studies of Rpd3p localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], these results indicate that Rpd3L acts directly at many ESR genes to mediate transient changes in gene expression. The defect in stress-activated expression leads to a corresponding defect in acquired stress resistance (Figure S6 in Additional data file 1), similar to that we have previously shown in cells lacking Msn2p and/or Msn4p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Thus, Rpd3p is an important cofactor in initiating the ESR. Models for how Rpd3p fits into the ESR regulatory network are discussed below.</p><sec><title>Role of Rpd3p in ESR initiation under diverse stress conditions</title><p>Rpd3p likely acts with distinct transcription factors at different classes of ESR promoters. PS genes are heavily enriched for upstream PAC elements (GCGATGAG) and RRPEs (AAAAWTTTT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], which have also been linked to Rpd3p binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Recently, the binding proteins of both elements have been identified and linked to PS expression. PAC is bound by Dot6p and Pbs1p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], and deletion of the two genes leads to defective PS gene repression in response to heat shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. The RRPE binding factor was recently identified as Stb3p, which interacts with the Sin3p subunit of Rpd3p complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] and is required for PS gene induction upon starvation relief but represses PS gene transcription when overexpressed (D Liko and W Heideman, personal communication). Although we found no expression defect in an <italic>stb3&#x00394; </italic>mutant responding to stress (data not shown), the link between Stb3p, Sin3p/Rpd3p, and RRPEs suggests that the proteins function together at this regulatory motif to affect PS gene expression.</p><p>Rpd3p has a distinct role in repressing RP genes, since their expression was mildly Rpd3L-dependent under certain conditions only. Nonetheless, we found that Rpd3p moves to the promoter of <italic>RPL16A </italic>upon H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), as previously found in response to cold shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], and is required for normal histone deacetylation and nucleosome deposition/repositioning (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Rpd3p has previously been linked to RP gene repression after rapamycin treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], although we found no requirement for the proposed repressor Crf1p (data not shown) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. We have, however, found a requirement for the ATP-dependent nucleosome-remodeling complex, RSC, which is important for proper nucleosome organization upstream of many genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. RSC mutants have increased RP expression in the absence of stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>], while cells lacking Rsc1p fail to fully repress RP expression and, to some extent, PS gene expression upon H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>treatment (our unpublished data). Like Rpd3p, RSC binds RP promoters in a condition-specific manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Thus, Rpd3p and RSC may function in parallel pathways at these genes. Interestingly, stress-dependent changes in nucleosome occupancy at <italic>RPL16A </italic>were only partially dependent on Pho23p, raising the possibility that Rpd3L functions partially independently of Pho23p or that Rpd3p is acting through multiple complexes, at least one of which does not require Pho23p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>The role of Rpd3L at iESR genes is less clear; however, our ChIP experiments suggest four general models for how Rpd3p may affect gene induction. The first is that some iESR genes may be indirectly affected by Rpd3L activity, particularly those for which there is no evidence of Rpd3p binding in response to stress. The second model is that Rpd3p plays an important and direct role in repressing iESR expression in the absence of stress, since Rpd3p binds directly to the promoters of <italic>UBC5 </italic>and <italic>XKS1 </italic>before stress (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) and these genes (plus nearly half of iESR genes) show slight derepression under normal conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This model is not incompatible with separate roles for Rpd3p in regulating stress-dependent expression changes, demonstrated by <italic>UBC5 </italic>and <italic>XKS1</italic>. At the <italic>UBC5 </italic>promoter, Rpd3p directly deacetylates promoter-based histones to mediate gene induction. This is consistent with results of De Nadal <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], who showed Rpd3-dependent histone deacetylation is required for polymerase recruitment. In contrast, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-dependent chromatin changes at <italic>XKS1 </italic>were not detectibly dependent on Rpd3L, despite increased Rpd3p binding upon treatment. The <italic>rpd3&#x00394; </italic>mutant ultimately induced <italic>XKS1 </italic>to levels higher than wild type, but with a major defect in the normal transient burst of expression. Thus, the changes in histone acetylation did not lead to normal gene induction. One possibility is that gene induction triggered by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>requires proper Rpd3-dependent promoter architecture before stress; alternatively, Rpd3p may play a role late in gene induction, after active nucleosome acetylation, as previously proposed for DNA damage-responsive genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>We also show that Rpd3p activity is required for normal Msn2p binding to representative promoters. This is reminiscent of the requirement of Rpd3p for nucleosome displacement and Upc2p binding at the promoters of hypoxia-regulated genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The exact mechanism of Rpd3p involvement at Msn2/4p targets is unclear; however, Lindstrom <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>] recently showed that Msn2/4p activity is inhibited by NuA4-dependent histone acetylation. This raises the possibility that histone deacetylation by Rpd3p counteracts the inhibitory effects of NuA4-dependent acetylation to allow Msn2p binding and gene induction. That different targets of Msn2/4p and Rpd3p show distinct sensitivities to the factors' deletion again implies distinct regulatory mechanisms for the different subclasses of targets. Understanding the differences in regulation will be an interesting area of future investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Rpd3p functions as a 'general-stress' co-factor in the ESR regulatory network</title><p>The ESR regulatory network consists of condition-specific regulators - those that only regulate ESR expression under specific circumstances - as well as 'general-stress' factors (such as Msn2/4p) that function under a wide variety of conditions. Our results suggest Rpd3p acts with the 'general-stress' set of ESR regulators at iESR and PS genes. Rpd3L is required for proper expression of these genes in response to numerous stresses (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Furthermore, Msn2/4-dependent induction, but not condition-specific regulation by Hsf1p and Yap1p, requires Rpd3p (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Like Msn2/4p, the 'general stress' role of Rpd3p persists despite the involvement of different upstream regulators under different conditions. For example, De Nadal <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] showed that Rpd3p is recruited to numerous iESR promoters in a manner dependent on the Hog1p kinase following salt stress but independent of Hog1p after heat shock. Thus, the involvement of Rpd3p, and the transcription factors it interacts with at these promoters, is controlled by different upstream signaling pathways under different environments. It will be interesting to decipher the mechanisms by which Rpd3p associates with stress-activated transcription factors despite distinct, condition-specific upstream pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Rpd3p is required for the transient phase of stress-activated gene expression changes</title><p>This study also demonstrates the importance of histone modification in mediating rapid and transient responses to environmental changes. The Rpd3L complex is particularly important in producing the large, rapid expression changes during the period of stress acclimation. The transient expression changes produced by acute stress treatment are qualitatively distinct from continuous expression changes seen under different nutrients. However, Rpd3p can affect the rapid kinetics of both types of expression responses. Upon phosphate limitation, cells lacking <italic>RPD3 </italic>showed delayed induction of <italic>PHO5 </italic>but eventually altered expression similar to wild-type cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Interestingly, a similar effect was reported in cells lacking the histone acetyltransferase Gcn5p, which also showed delayed induction of metabolic genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. These results reflect that changes in chromatin states, mediated by both deacetylases and acetyltransferases, are particularly important for rapid kinetics of gene-expression changes in response to variable environments. Consistently, we found that <italic>rpd3&#x00394; </italic>cells display defects in reciprocal expression changes of the same genes upon stress exposure as well as stress relief. Dynamic and successive alterations in histone modification are crucial in producing proper transcriptional changes (for example, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]). Elucidating the dynamics of chromatin changes upon stress treatment will continue to shed light on the dynamics of stress-dependent gene expression changes.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Rpd3p is an important co-factor in the regulatory network that controls ESR gene expression in response to stress, working with different factors at different subsets of ESR genes.

Briefly, cells were grown as described above and were either untreated or exposed to 0.4 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>for 10 minutes, or washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline for the cold-shock control then exposed to 1% formaldehyde for 30 minutes (Rpd3-myc) or 45 minutes (Msn2 ChIPs) at 25&#x000b0;C. Cells were flash frozen, resuspended, and lysed; isolated chromatin was sonicated to an average size of approximately 400 bp. Protein (2.0 mg) was incubated with 5 &#x003bc;l anti-c-myc (9E11, Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA) ab-56) or 15 &#x003bc;l anti-Msn2 (y-300, Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) sc-33631) antibody overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. For chromatin ChIP, cells were exposed to 0.4 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>for 20 minutes, cross-linked as above, then digested to spheroplasts with zymolyase (Seikagaku Biosystems, Tokyo, Japan) for 60 minutes at 30&#x000b0;C and treated with micrococcal nuclease (Worthington Biochemical, Lakewood, NJ, USA) for 20 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C to isolate mononucleosomes. This sample measured total nucleosome occupancy; in addition, 1.5 mg protein was mixed with 3 &#x003bc;l anti-acetylated H4 (Upstate 06-866 (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA)) to immunoprecipitate acetylated histone H4. DNA purified from each sample was amplified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>] and converted to cDNA using SuperScript III (Invitrogen). All ChIPs were done in triplicate and quantified by real-time quantitative PCR reactions, using Sybrgreen Jumpstart Taq (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) and an Applied Biosystems 7500 detector (Foster City, CA, USA). Each ChIP PCR was normalized to a control fragment between <italic>YEL073C </italic>and <italic>YEL072W </italic>on chromosome V as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>]. Apparent histone acetylation levels were normalized to nucleosome occupancy at each locus to report the fraction of acetylated nucleosomes.

Gene expression in unstressed <italic>rpd3&#x00394; </italic>versus wild type (average of triplicate experiments) and for wild-type and <italic>rpd3&#x00394; </italic>cells responding to stress is shown as in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. The middle panel shows the differences between wild-type and <italic>rpd3&#x00394; </italic>expression where yellow represents higher transcript abundance (that is, weaker repression) and blue indicates lower transcript abundance (that is, weaker induction) in the <italic>rpd3&#x00394; </italic>mutant. The right panel shows the difference between transcript abundance in wild-type and <italic>rpd3&#x00394; </italic>cells after adjusting for the basal expression differences in unstressed cells. These data show that the observed defect in ESR initiation in the <italic>rpd3&#x00394; </italic>strain is not due to the possibility that basal expression of the ESR genes already reflects the 'ON' state of the program. First, genes repressed in the ESR show little discernable difference in basal expression in <italic>rpd3&#x00394; </italic>versus wild-type cells. Second, although a subset of the iESR genes are subtly derepressed (approximately 1.5-fold) in untreated <italic>rpd3&#x00394; </italic>cells, the mutant still displays lower absolute transcript levels relative to wild-type at the peak of the expression response (right panel). Third, the <italic>rpd3&#x00394; </italic>mutant ultimately alters expression comparable to the expression changes in wild-type cells, resulting in higher absolute transcript levels for these iESR genes in acclimated <italic>rpd3&#x00394; </italic>cells compared to acclimated wild-type cells, particularly in response to heat shock and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>treatment (right panel and data not shown). Finally, almost half the iESR genes show no significant difference in basal expression (within 1.3-fold of wild-type and <italic>P </italic>&#x0003e; 0.01) but are still induced to lower peak levels than in wild-type cells. Thus, the defect in stress-dependent expression changes seen in the <italic>rpd3&#x00394; </italic>strain is not accounted for by basal expression differences across all ESR genes, although these results suggest that Rpd3p is required to suppress some iESR genes in the absence of stress.</p><p>Figure S2: Msn2 localizes to the nucleus upon stress treatment in cells lacking Rpd3p.

Previous work from our lab showed that the gene expression response to a single dose of stress is not required to survive that condition, but rather protects cells against future stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Here, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>tolerance in wild-type and <italic>pho23&#x00394; </italic>cells was measured after a 60-minute pretreatment with 0.7 M NaCl, similarly to that previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Briefly, log-phase cells were treated with 0.7 M NaCl (or YPD for mock-treated cells) for 60 minutes, then washed once with YPD to remove salt and exposed to 23 doses of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>(ranging from 0 to 8 mM) for 2 h.

Error bars represent the standard deviation from triplicate experiments. The <italic>pho23&#x00394; </italic>strain was not sensitive to the mild dose of NaCl in this assay (<italic>P </italic>= 0.4) but had a significant defect in acquired tolerance to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>after mild NaCl treatment (<italic>P </italic>= 0.029, paired <italic>t</italic>-test).
