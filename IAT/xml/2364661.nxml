However, accumulating evidence suggests that transcriptional regulation may be in large part responsible for this observed mammalian complexity. Consequently, there has been a strong drive to locate <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions in mammalian genomes in order to understand the unifying principles governing these regions, including their genomic distribution. Although a number of systematic approaches have been developed, these all discount coding sequence.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Using the computational tool PRI (Pattern-defined Regulatory Islands), which does not mask coding sequence, we identified a regulatory region associated with the gene <italic>ADAMTS5</italic> that encompasses the entirety of the essential coding exon 2. We demonstrate through a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation and reporter gene studies that this region can not only bind the myogenic transcription factors MYOD and myogenin and the E-protein HEB but can also function as a very strong myogenic transcriptional enhancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Thus, we report the identification and detailed characterization of an exonic enhancer.

They have been found virtually everywhere in the genome: upstream of genes, in 5&#x02032;-UTRs, within introns, in 3&#x02032;-UTRs, and downstream of genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002184-Levine1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

There are also several reports of finding them within noncoding exons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002184-McLellan1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002184-Chiquet1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. However, there are very few examples of them being found within coding exons.</p><p>This does not mean that <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions cannot reside within coding exons. With rapidly expanding access to genome sequences and the development of comparative genomics tools that can locate conserved regions across genomes, researchers are increasingly relying on these methods to find regulatory regions. Unfortunately, many predictive approaches, although frequently adept at locating <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions, intentionally mask coding sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002184-Blanchette1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. This is probably due in large part to the higher level of conservation that would be expected in these regions, which could pose a false positive problem for identifying cis-regulatory elements using phylogenetic footprinting tools that simply look for large regions of sequence conservation.</p><p>We recently reported the development of a pattern-matching-based approach that searches for clusters of seven or more transcription factor binding sites that are absolutely conserved in order and in spacing across human, mouse, and rat genomes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://barcode.colorado.edu/pri/">http://barcode.colorado.edu/pri/</ext-link>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002184-Cheung1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. We refer to these regions as <underline>P</underline>attern-defined <underline>R</underline>egulatory <underline>I</underline>slands (PRIs). In developing the PRI algorithm, a conscious decision was taken to not mask these sequences. Because PRI relies solely on the conservation of order and spacing of transcription factor binding sites and is insensitive to the identity of intervening bases, it is not as encumbered by the risks of highly conserved codons. Inspection of the PRI database revealed that 3.2&#x00025; of the islands overlap to some degree with coding sequence. Curious about the relevance of these regions, we proceeded to test whether any of them could direct transcription in mouse C2C12 cells, a myoblast cell line in which skeletal myogenesis can be recapitulated <italic>in vitro</italic>. In particular, we focused on an island (termed PRI 1) associated with the gene <italic>ADAMTS5</italic>, which is strongly up-regulated during myogenesis. Not only does this island contain binding sites for myogenic transcription factors, it also completely encompasses an essential coding exon. We reveal in the following study that the exonic PRI 1 of <italic>ADAMTS5</italic> is a very potent transcriptional enhancer that depends upon the integrity of binding sites that overlap with codons.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title><italic>ADAMTS5</italic> Harbors a PRI that Encompasses a Coding Exon</title><p>Annotation of the PRI database revealed that 3.2&#x00025; of the assembled PRIs (22,823 out of a total 703,906 PRIs) overlap at least partially with coding sequence. In light of this figure and given our previous success with discovering that PRIs can display enhancer activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002184-Cheung1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, we expected that it would be possible to find enhancer activity associated with exon-derived PRIs. To approach this problem, we focused on the gene <italic>ADAMTS5</italic>. In addition to being the aggrecanase principally responsible for the heightened degradation of the extracellular matrix molecule aggrecan seen in osteoarthritis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002184-Stanton1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002184-Glasson1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, its transcript is also strongly up-regulated in C2C12 cells after six days of differentiation (4.84-, 6.7-, 8.1-fold, 3 probes) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002184-Chen1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. We also confirmed that <italic>ADAMTS5</italic> is up-regulated in our C2C12 differentiation system using real-time PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002184.s001">Figure S1</xref>). We observed that two PRIs associated with this gene contain E-boxes, to which myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) can bind, and one of these PRIs (PRI 1) encompasses the entire exon 2. Exon 2 is an essential coding exon as it contains half of the protease active site. There are seven conserved binding sites distributed throughout the exon, including two E-boxes. The other E-box-containing PRI, PRI 2, is found entirely within an intron and is approximately 3500 base pairs downstream of PRI 1. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002184-g001">Figure 1A</xref> presents the composition of the islands in greater detail.

Outside of the PRI region, conservation decreases noticeably. In addition, while there is strong conservation throughout the exon, there are clear dips in conservation in the intronic PRI sequence that corresponds to the spacing sequence between conserved transcription factor binding sites. This suggests that there is selective pressure for both codon preservation and binding site preservation.</p><fig id="pone-0002184-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002184.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>PRI 1 Drives Reporter Gene Transcription during Myogenesis and Is Dependent Upon Exon-derived Sequence.</title><p>(A) Schematic of reporter gene vector construction and deletion mutants.

Intriguingly, MYOD did bind in the region of PRI 1; in fact, the PCR signal was nearly as strong as the 0.1&#x00025; input signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002184-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). By contrast, the signal for MYOD binding in the vicinity of PRI 2 was virtually undetectable. We followed this result up with a more comprehensive survey of MRF and E-protein binding in C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes. E-proteins are a ubiquitous class of proteins that, amongst various other transcriptional roles, heterodimerize with MRFs to promote E-box binding and synergistic transcriptional activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002184-Tapscott1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. HEB is the main E-protein expressed in and responsible for regulating differentiation of C2C12 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002184-Parker1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, thus we selected an antibody that recognizes both &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-isoforms for immunoprecipitation. We also chose an antibody against myogenin to probe whether there are differences in MRF binding across this timecourse. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002184-g001">Figure 1C</xref> depicts the results of PCR of the positive control region from <italic>MYOG</italic>, <italic>ADAMTS5</italic> PRI 1, <italic>ADAMTS5</italic> PRI 2, and a promoter region of amylase, AMY2-1, which has been used previously as a negative control region for MRF and HEB binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002184-Parker1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. It is apparent here that while MYOD binding is still evident at PRI 1 in myoblasts and myotubes, myogenin and HEB binding dramatically increase in myotubes after one day of serum deprivation. By contrast, neither of the MRFs nor HEB binds PRI 2 at either timepoint. The observations that HEB binds PRI 1 in addition to the MRFs MYOD and myogenin and that myogenin binding appears to be regulated during differentiation indicates that one or more E-boxes within PRI 1 may truly be conveying myogenic transcriptional signals.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>PRI 1 Can Differentially Drive Transcription during Myogenesis</title><p>Although it is clear that multiple myogenic transcription factors can bind to PRI 1 of <italic>ADAMTS5</italic> during C2C12 differentiation, a key experiment in assessing whether this region can serve as a site of transcriptional regulation is whether it can differentially regulate reporter gene transcription. To probe this possibility, we cloned the genomic regions corresponding to PRI 1 and PRI 2 into a reporter vector upstream of a minimal TATA box-containing promoter and the luciferase gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002184-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, top schematic). We then transfected the resulting constructs into C2C12 cells along with pRL-TK for transfection normalization purposes and tracked reporter gene activity in growing myoblasts (GM) and differentiating myotubes after one day of serum withdrawal (DM D1). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002184-g002">Figure 2B</xref> demonstrates that PRI 1 robustly supports luciferase gene transcription with a 9.9-fold change, essentially equivalent to that of the <italic>MYOG</italic> positive control region and with slightly stronger basal level activity. Conversely, PRI 2 is incapable of enhancing transcriptional output above that of the background minimal promoter construct (minTATA), which is in line with its transcription factor binding properties. This strongly indicates that PRI 1 of <italic>ADAMTS5</italic> is a bona fide <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory region.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>The Exonic Portion of PRI 1 is Necessary for Enhancing Transcription</title><p>Having shown that PRI 1 can drive reporter gene expression and given that PRI 1 is comprised of sequence derived from both an exon and introns, an obvious question asks what the dependence on these regions is in driving transcription. Towards answering this question, we made two mutants of the wild-type PRI 1 reporter construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002184-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, middle and bottom schematics). In the first (termed &#x0201c;&#x00394; exon&#x0201d;), we deleted the exonic sequence from the middle of the island, and in the second (termed &#x0201c;exon only&#x0201d;), we deleted the intronic sequence flanking the exon. In comparing the ability of these constructs to promote luciferase gene expression during C2C12 differentiation to that of the wild-type construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002184-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), it is readily apparent that both can barely support transcription above the minTATA construct and that there is absolutely no induction when differentiation is triggered. It thus appears that the exonic sequence is necessary but not sufficient to enhance transcription. The PRI hypothesis predicts this outcome as both regions contain binding sites conserved in order and in spacing.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Both Intronic and Exonic Binding Sites Contribute to Enhancer Activity</title><p>We next evaluated the contribution of individual binding sites to luciferase signal by making a number of point mutations within conserved binding sites based on already reported cases in the literature. We focused on the three E-boxes, the GR site, the Myb site, and the H-APF-1 site. The specific mutations along with the literature source for each are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002184-t001">Table 1</xref>. We then introduced the mutant constructs into the C2C12 cells and analyzed the resultant reporter gene activity. As revealed by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002184-g003">Figure 3</xref>, the biggest contributors to both basal level reporter gene activity and fold change during myogenesis are E-boxes 2 and 3, which are exonic and intronic respectively (numbering according to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002184-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). E-box 1 (exonic) along with the GR site (exonic) appear to make relatively minor contributions. The effects of mutating the Myb site (exonic) and the H-APF-1 site (exonic) are rather subtle. It is worth noting that, while all three E-boxes obviously conform to the consensus site CANNTG, E-boxes 2 and 3 have the exact same sequence (CAGCTG) and contribute the most to luciferase signal while E-box 1 is different at the N positions (CATGTG). In summary, both exonic and intronic binding sites contribute to the observed PRI 1-driven reporter gene activity.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0002184-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002184.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Summary of binding site mutations.</title></caption><graphic id="pone-0002184-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0002184.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" alternate-form-of="pone-0002184-t001-1"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Binding Site</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mutation</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Reference</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">E-box (3)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CANNTG&#x02192;CANNTa</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cheung <italic>et al.</italic> 2007 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002184-Cheung1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">H-APF-1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CTGGGAA&#x02192;CTGGGgA</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Majello <italic>et al.</italic> 1990 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002184-Majello1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GR</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TGTTCT&#x02192;TGaTCT</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Dahlman-Wright <italic>et al.</italic> 1990 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002184-DahlmanWright1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Myb</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ATTGAA&#x02192;ggaGAt</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Nicolaides <italic>et al.</italic> 1991 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002184-Nicolaides1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><p>Point mutations made for each binding studied and literature sources for these mutations.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><fig id="pone-0002184-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002184.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Intronic and Exonic Binding Sites Contribute to Transcriptional Output of PRI 1.</title><p>(A) Luciferase results of reporter constructs of PRI 1 harboring point mutations in PRI 1 according to <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002184-t001">Table 1</xref>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0002184.g003"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Assessing the Dependence on PRI Orientation</title><p>The traditional definition of an enhancer is a genomic region that promotes transcription independent of position and orientation.

This suggests that PRI orientation may only slightly contribute to enhancer activity.

According to the NCBI RefSeq annotation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002184-Pruitt1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, PRI 0 is &#x02212;79&#x02192;&#x0002b;35 with respect to the transcription start site and &#x02212;937&#x02192;&#x02212;823 with respect to the start codon. It harbors a conserved TATA box (&#x02212;829 with respect to the start codon, &#x0002b;29 with respect to the RefSeq transcription start site). If PRI 1 physically interacts with PRI 0, this could provide a mechanism to explain the enhancer activity of PRI 1 in regulating transcription of <italic>ADAMTS5</italic> itself. Although it is counterintuitive to think that an enhancer could reside within an exon as this could present problems for the transcriptional machinery accessing this sequence, there are myriad examples of enhancers residing in introns, which would present the same problem, and yet this is obviously overcome. It is possible that a chromosomal loop forms only to enhance the initial events in transcription and that once the process has begun, the downstream sequence disengages and is free to be transcribed. Alternatively, this loop could be maintained throughout transcription but the DNA template is threaded through it as the transcript is synthesized.</p><p>One curious feature of this study is that, although there is strong differential reporter gene activity, MYOD binding does not appear to change between growing myoblasts and differentiating myotubes. The difference in activation but lack of change in MYOD ChIP could be explained by the strong recruitment of MYOG and the E-protein HEB upon the onset of differentiation. Perhaps MYOD positions the DNA and facilitates transcription by interacting with the canonical TFIID complex in myoblasts, but, having effected the necessary chromosomal arrangement, is swapped for a myogenin/HEB complex upon differentiation, which promotes even stronger transcriptional output.</p><p>Two separate E-boxes in the <italic>ADAMTS5</italic> exonic enhancer are required for robust transcriptional activation upon myogenic differentiation. This property is shared by the muscle-specific creatine kinase enhancer in which a pair of E-boxes has been shown to be required for cooperative binding to MYOD and subsequent transcriptional activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002184-Weintraub1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. It has been speculated that multiple site recognition is important for decoding the concentration of MYOD and stably engaging transcription machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002184-Weintraub1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Our result is consistent with this notion. Beside E-boxes, there are a number of other transcription factor binding sites in the <italic>ADAMTS5</italic> enhancer with invariant arrangement of spacing and orientation across human, mouse, and rat genomes. Perturbation of several binding sites can individually lead to a dramatic and nonlinear reduction in the <italic>ADAMTS5</italic> enhancer function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002184-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The requirement for the precise organization of this <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element to regulate myogenic transcription suggests that this exon-encoded sequence element is a <italic>bona fide</italic> transcriptional enhancer.</p><p>Apart from the novelty associated with finding an exonic enhancer, the transcriptional regulation of <italic>ADAMTS5</italic> is an interesting topic in itself. High expression of this gene is strongly associated with osteoarthritis and mice that are homozygous for a catalytically inactive ADAMTS5 are protected against osteoarthritis when challenged with physical or chemical joint injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002184-Stanton1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002184-Glasson1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. The discovery of the role of ADAMTS5 in osteoarthritis was a major step forward in understanding the pathology of this disease and presented an obvious target for drug development. Understanding how <italic>ADAMTS5</italic> expression is regulated and identifying a region suitable for screening libraries of compounds for a small molecule that can inhibit transcription of <italic>ADAMTS5</italic> could prove very useful in the pursuit of osteoarthritis therapies. This work may provide such a region in the form of PRI 1.</p><p>The exon-derived enhancer PRI 1 is not an isolated phenomenon. Enhancer activity has been reported to be associated with exon 6 of keratin 18 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002184-Neznanov1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, although the key AP-1 binding site is not evolutionarily conserved as the same region in the rat genome does not contain this site and it only leads to a three- to four-fold increase in reporter gene activity above the basal promoter. In contrast, PRI 1 elicits a 100-fold increase. We also considered another PRI that overlaps with coding sequence of the gene <italic>IGF2</italic>, which is up-regulated about 7-fold upon myogenic differentiation (illustrated schematically in Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002184.s003">Figure S3A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002184-Chen1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. MYOD can also occupy this region in myoblasts and myotubes as evidenced by ChIP assay (Supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002184-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). A luciferase reporter gene assay (Supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002184-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) indicates that this region possesses enhancer activity as it drives expression 22-fold above the minimal TATA reporter in the basal state, essentially equivalent to the positive control region from <italic>MYOG</italic> (22-fold above minimal TATA in the basal state).</p><p>In summary, we have demonstrated that <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions can overlap with coding sequence as showcased by PRI 1 of <italic>ADAMTS5</italic>. Moreover, we have convincing evidence that enhancer activity associated with this sequence depends upon both exon- and intron-derived transcription factor binding sites. It will be of great interest in the future to systematically determine how widespread exon-derived enhancers are throughout mammalian genomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Real-time PCR</title><p>Total RNA was prepared from C2C12 cells using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
