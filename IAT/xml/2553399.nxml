It is a vasoactive agent that mediates multiple vascular actions and plays an important role in hypertension and cardiovascular diseases by promoting changes in vascular reactivity and endothelial function, cardiovascular fibrosis, tissue remodeling, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Endothelin exerts its effect through two different G protein coupled receptors, the endothelin type A (ET<sub>A</sub>) receptor and the endothelin type B (ET<sub>B</sub>) receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The endothelin ET<sub>A </sub>receptors are expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells and mediate vasoconstriction. In healthy conditions, endothelin ET<sub>B </sub>receptors are mainly located on endothelial cells and mediate vasodilatation via the release of nitric oxide, prostaglandins and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, endothelin ET<sub>B </sub>receptors on vascular smooth muscle cells have been observed to be upregulated during pathological conditions such as atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], congestive heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], ischemic heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Endothelin receptors on vascular smooth muscle cells are both mitogenic, leading to atherosclerosis, and mediate strong vasoconstriction which may lead to elevated vascular tone frequently observed in cardiovascular disease.</p><p>Endothelin receptor regulation can be studied in detail, <italic>ex vivo</italic>, using organ culture of intact arteries. Endothelin ET<sub>B </sub>receptors on smooth muscle cells are up-regulated when whole blood vessels are incubated for 12 to 48 hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, endothelin ET<sub>B </sub>receptors are up-regulated in human coronary arteries after organ culture, in a similar way as in ischemic heart disease in man [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Endothelin receptor-changes also occur during organ culture in rat cerebral and peripheral arteries, mimicking that observed in peripheral artery disease, stroke and subarachnoidal haemorrhage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Detailed delineation of the regulation of vascular endothelin receptors can be performed by culture in the presence of different humoral factors or intracellular signal transduction pathway inhibitors.</p><p>We aim to identify the intracellular signal transduction pathways that regulate the expression of endothelin receptors in the vasculature. These may provide future therapeutic targets for hindering the development of vascular endothelin receptor changes in cardiovascular disease. In a previous study, culture of porcine coronary arteries shows that protein kinase C (PKC) and mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are signaling pathways that regulate endothelin receptor expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Other studies, using rat cerebral arteries, show similar results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Hitherto, the regulation of endothelin receptors have mainly been studied in animals and data from humans barely exists. When identifying new targets for pharmaceutical intervention, it is of importance that the research is performed not only in animals, but also in patients. In the present study, internal mammary arteries from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery were studied to examine the role of PKC and MAPK in the endothelin ET<sub>A </sub>and ET<sub>B </sub>receptor regulation in humans.</p><p>PKC is a family of serine/threonine kinases participating in signal transduction events in response to specific hormonal, neuronal and growth factor stimuli. MAPKs represent another group of serine/threonine kinases that are thought to act downstream from PKC in the smooth muscle cell regulatory cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. There are three major groups of distinctly regulated MAPKs leading to altered gene expression in humans. The extracellular signal related kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), the C-jun terminal kinase (JNK) and the p38 MAPK are known to play important roles in the intracellular signalling in response to extracellular stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Upon activation, MAPKs cause phosphorylation and activation of transcription factors present in the cytoplasm or nucleus, thereby leading to expression of target genes resulting in biological responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we use the organ culture model to examine the involvement of PKC and MAPK pathways in the regulation of endothelin receptors in the human internal mammary artery. Arterial segments are cultured for 24 hours in the absence or presence of PKC inhibitors (Ro-32-0432 and bisindolylmaleimide I) and inhibitors of the three major MAPK pathways in mammals (p38 MAPK, ERK1/2 and JNK). The contractile effects and the levels of endothelin ET<sub>A </sub>and ET<sub>B </sub>receptor protein and mRNA expression are evaluated using <italic>in vitro </italic>pharmacology, real time PCR and Western blot techniques.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Tissue collection</title><p>During coronary artery bypass graft surgery, one end of the left mammary artery is harvested and sutured to the coronary artery, distal to the stenosis. A segment of the artery is sometimes removed when the artery is adjusted to an appropriate length for the grafting procedure. The artery segment that is removed can be used for research without affecting the patient. For the present study, the left internal mammary artery, from 27 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery, was used for experimental analysis. The patients' median age was 70 years and ranged from 43 to 85 years. Twenty-one men and 6 women were included in the study. After dissection during surgery, the vessels were immediately immersed into cold sterile Dulbeccos' modified Eagles' medium (DMEM), transported to the laboratory on dry ice and used for the experiments. In the laboratory, the arteries were dissected free from adhering tissue, and then cut into cylindrical segments (3&#x02013;4 mm long).</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics</title><p>The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Lund University in Sweden and is in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec><title>Organ culture procedure</title><p>The artery segments were divided into two groups; one that was not cultured (control) and one that was cultured for 24 hours.

Eight to sixteen segments were studied at the same time in separate tissue baths. The segments stabilized at a resting tension of 4 mN for one hour before the experiments were started.

This study demonstrates that the PKC and MAPK intracellular signal transduction pathways may play a role in the regulation of endothelin ET<sub>B </sub>receptors in the human internal mammary artery.</p></sec><sec><title>Organ culture and endothelin receptor regulation</title><p>The organ culture method, used in the present study, stimulate up-regulation of endothelin ET<sub>B </sub>receptors in the human left internal mammary artery, as shown by <italic>in vitro </italic>pharmacology, Western blot and real time PCR experiments. This is in accordance with our previous findings that endothelin ET<sub>B </sub>receptors are up-regulated during organ culture in human coronary arteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This increase in ET<sub>B </sub>receptor density can be compared to that observed in arteries from patients with ischemic heart disease or hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Plasma levels of endothelin are elevated in ischemic heart disease and in heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Enhanced activity in the endothelin system has been associated with the progression of cardiovascular disease.</p><p>Endothelin is a strong vasoconstrictor and up-regulation of endothelin receptors on vascular smooth muscle cells causes inappropriate contraction that exacerbates atherosclerotic stenoses. Endothelin constricts human coronary arteries, especially those with atherosclerosis, and accounts for nearly all the resting tone at coronary artery stenosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Endothelin is also known to act as a mitogen on vascular smooth muscle cells, stimulate extracellular matrix synthesis and attract monocytes in the process of atherosclerosis.</p><p>We believe that it is important to gain insight into the regulation of the vascular endothelin receptor expression. Identifying the intracellular signal transduction pathways involved in the up-regulation of endothelin receptors may provide new pharmaceutical targets. Organ culture is an experimental model in which the endothelin receptor regulation can be studied in detail, <italic>ex vivo</italic>, to delineate the molecular mechanisms involved. Culture in the presence of different humoral factors or intracellular messenger inhibitors may reveal important pathways involved in the regulation of endothelin receptors. The method of organ culture combines the advantage of cell culturing techniques with the advantage of functional evaluation of intact blood vessels.</p><p>Increased endothelin ET<sub>B </sub>contraction after organ culture in the present study is presumably due to increased levels of contractile endothelin ET<sub>B </sub>receptors on the vascular smooth muscle cells. Previous results from our group show that the contractile response to sarafotoxin 6c in the human internal mammary artery is not significantly affected by removal of the endothelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This is in accordance with the current data since the arteries are obtained from patient with advanced coronary artery disease and probably generalized atherosclerosis and endothelium dysfunction.</p></sec><sec><title>Mechanisms governing the regulation of endothelin ET<sub>B </sub>receptors</title><p>We do not know the exact mechanism by which the endothelin ET<sub>B </sub>receptors are up-regulation in culture. Previous experiments suggest that the up-regulation requires physiological oxygen and glucose levels and that the choice of buffer solution (Krebs or DMEM) does not seem to play a role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The dissection procedure is similar for the non-cultured and cultured arteries and does presumably not play a role for the organ culture effects. The only difference between the non-cultured and cultured vessel segments is incubation <italic>per se</italic>. During incubation, perfusion pressure is lost and we speculate that this loss in sheer stress may be one factor that triggers the receptor regulation. Indeed, preliminary perfusion experiments <italic>in vitro </italic>revile that the regulation of endothelin ET<sub>B </sub>receptors is dependent on the perfusion pressure applied (not published data). Up-regulation of ET<sub>B </sub>receptors is known to rely on increased transcription and subsequent translation of ET<sub>B </sub>receptor mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. This is in accordance with the present results that demonstrate increased levels of ET<sub>B </sub>receptor mRNA and protein. In the human genome, the 5'-flanking region of the genes encoding the endothelin receptors contain several regulatory elements, like GATA-motifs and E-boxes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. This indicates that the genes might be activated by for example stress related and inflammatory components.</p></sec><sec><title>PKC signaling pathways</title><p>This study was aimed to elucidate the role of the PKC and MAPK signaling pathways in the endothelin ET<sub>B </sub>receptor regulation. The PKC antagonists, Ro-32-0432 and bisindolylmaleimide I, each inhibited the increase in sarafotoxin 6c contraction and the elevated levels of endothelin ET<sub>B </sub>receptor protein and mRNA expression, during organ culture. PKC signaling pathways has previously been suggested to play a role in the development of cardiovascular disease. PKC increase oxygen production in the growing atherosclerotic lesion, leading to apoptosis and plaque instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The levels of PKC in the myocardium are elevated in various models of cardiac hypertrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Furthermore, PKC isozymes contribute to different stages of cardiac fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Indeed, treatment with a PKC&#x003b4; inhibitor has been shown to ameliorate the reperfusion injury during primary percutaneous coronary intervention for myocardial infarction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>MAPK signaling pathways</title><p>The MAPK pathways are thought to act downstream from PKC in the smooth muscle cell regulatory cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. MAPKs are a family of serine/threonine kinases which are associated with vascular smooth muscle cell contraction, migration, adhesion, collagen deposition, cell growth, differentiation and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The three major subgroups of MAPK are p38, ERK1/2 and JNK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In the present study we found that the p38 MAPK pathway inhibitor, SB203580 (10 &#x003bc;M), the ERK1/2 pathway inhibitor, PD98059 (10 &#x003bc;M) and the JNK pathway inhibitor, SP600125 (10 &#x003bc;M), blocked the up-regulation of the endothelin ET<sub>B </sub>receptors in human internal mammary arteries during organ culture. This is in accordance with previous studies that have a role for MAPK pathways in cardiovascular disease. JNK is a stress-activated protein kinase while ERKs mediate cellular responses initiated by growth factors. The P38 MAPK pathway is activated by inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1 and IL-8, which are known to be increased in atherosclerosis and ischemic heart disease. Since the vessels were obtained from severely diseased patients the current data may suggest that there is activation of all three major MAPKs in advanced cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical relevance</title><p>Endothelin induces strong vasoconstriction in human blood vessels and endothelin receptors are up-regulated in cardiovascular disease such as hypertension, arteriosclerosis and myocardial infarction. Whether endothelin receptor antagonists will become part of the therapeutic armamentarium in hypertension and associated cardiovascular disease remains unclear. However, none of these agents is currently being developed for this indication. New endothelin antagonists devoid of side effects or alternative inhibitors of the endothelin converting enzymes may in the future become available to block the endothelin system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Along with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], the present study shows that the endothelin dependent vascular contraction and remodeling seem to be dependent on both PKC and MAPK. Inhibition of these intracellular signal tran sduction pathways may become a future approach for targeting the endothelin system in the prevention of the development of cardiovascular disease.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present findings demonstrate up-regulated endothelin ET<sub>B </sub>receptors in human left internal mammary arteries after organ culture, which is similar to the changes that occur in cardiovascular disease. The intracellular signal transduction pathways PKC and p38 MAPK seems to be involved in the endothelin ET<sub>B </sub>receptor regulation. Inhibiting these intracellular signal transduction pathways may provide future therapeutic targets for hindering the development of vascular endothelin receptor changes in cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>DN helped in planning the experiments, performed the in vitro pharmacology and real time PCR experiments, analyzed the data and wrote the manuscript.
