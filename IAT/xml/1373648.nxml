CF is caused by mutations of the <italic>CFTR </italic>gene whose product acts as a cAMP-activated chloride channel that is permeable to organic anions, including GSH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. A wide range of disease severities has been described, even among CF patients harbouring the same mutation. Therefore endogenous factors, that modulate or complement CFTR function, must exist. Because of the structural homology between CFTR and MRP1, a functional complementation of CFTR defect by MRP1 has been hypothesized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Induction of MRP1 expression has been suggested to be responsible for improvement in lung function in a CF patient following chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and epirubicin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Low levels of MRP1 transcripts have been associated with more severe CF phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], while increased expression of the <italic>MRP1 </italic>gene has been associated with restored chloride conductance in a group of CF patients following treatment with AZM, giving rise to clinical beneficial effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. <italic>MRP1 </italic>has been considered as a potential modifier gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and/or as a target for therapy of CF in subjects responsive to AZM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>MRP1 </italic>was originally cloned in a drug-selected lung cancer cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. MRPs are transmembrane proteins, whose mRNAs are detectable in most human tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. They share the closest homology with the CFTR protein, which belongs to the same C subfamily of the ABC transporter superfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. MRP1 confers resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs as well as to heavy metal oxyanions. It transports reduced glutathione conjugates, cysteinyl leukotriene LTC<sub>4</sub>, steroid glucoronides and bile salt derivatives in human cells, agents involved in the transcription factor NF-kB activation pathway, which has been reported to be altered in CF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Therefore a functional link exists between genes involved in GSH metabolism and MRP1. NF-kB regulates expression of GSTP1 and polymorphisms of the anti-oxidizing enzymes GSTP1 and GSTM3 are associated with severity of CF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The <italic>GSTM1 </italic>gene, encoding an enzyme that forms glutathione adducts, is deleted in most severe CF patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. CF patients carrying a wild type allele for both GSTM1 and GSTT1 may be at reduced risk of severe lung disease. The abnormal reduced glutathione transport caused by CFTR mutation seems to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of CF and this parameter might also be complemented by MRP1 in CF patients. MRP1 has been also involved in the regulation of endogenous channels as chloride channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The physiological functions of MRP1 are the subject of many current investigations: the available evidence indicates that it is involved in detoxification, drug resistance, oxidative stress and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. An impaired response to inflammatory stimuli has been described in MRP1(-/-) knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], even if <italic>MRP1 </italic>has not been demonstrated to be a disease-causing gene.</p><p>The sequence of the <italic>MRP1 </italic>gene has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The 5' flanking region is GC rich (88%) while the 5'UTR contains a GCC triplet repeat that has been hypothesized to represent a polymorphic site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The influence of the number of triplets in the 5'UTR on MRP1 mRNA transcription, stability and translational efficiency has not been determined.</p><p>We searched a genetic marker for <italic>MRP1 </italic>with potential functional relevance aiming to establish: 1) whether the GCC repeat in the <italic>MRP1 </italic>5'UTR is polymorphic, 2) if the GCC triplets length could affect the activity of the promoter in CF airways epithelial cells either in basal conditions or upon AZM treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients and controls</title><p>Genomic DNA from 100 unrelated non-CF subjects and 36 CF patients was collected. Nucleic acid was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes using the salting out method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Diagnosis of CF was based on clinical, biochemical and genetic data. The most common CF causing mutation, deltaF508, was detected in 24 patients, 7 of which were homozygous. This study was approved by the local institutional Ethic Committee.</p></sec><sec><title>Genotyping</title><p>Specific primers were designed based on the nucleotide sequence of the 5' regulatory region of <italic>MRP1 </italic>gene (GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="U07050">U07050</ext-link>) (sequences are available upon request). PCRs were performed in an Applied Biosystems 9700 Thermal Cycler, using a final volume of 50 &#x003bc;l. Due to the high GC levels of the PCR products, 7-deaza-dGTP (Roche) was utilized instead of dGTP in the dNTPs mix. PCR-1 started with 350 ng of genomic DNA; 2.5 &#x003bc;l of PCR-1 were subjected to further amplification (PCR-2) and a third round of amplification (PCR-3) was performed with 2.5 &#x003bc;l of PCR-2. Amplifications were carried out starting with 10 min template denaturation/AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems) activation step at 95&#x000b0;C, followed by 40 cycles (20 cycles for PCR-3) of denaturation at 95&#x000b0;C for 30 s, annealing at 58&#x000b0;C for 30 s and extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 30 s. As a final product the fragment from -337 nt to -43 nt, starting from the translational starting site of the <italic>MRP1 </italic>5' gene, was obtained.</p><p>PCR products were purified with the NucleoSpin Extract kit (Macherey-Nagel). Samples were then sequenced using Thermo Sequenase II Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Premix Kit (Amersham Biosciences) and the automated 373A DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems).</p><p>PCR-3 was carried out in the presence of a primer conjugated to FAM dye (5-carboxyfluorescein) (Applied Biosystems) that generated labelled amplicons suitable for electrophoresis and Genescan analysis.</p><p>Genescan analysis Software (Applied Biosystems) was used to determine the length of the PCR products. In order to validate our method we utilized a vector including the <italic>MRP1 </italic>(GCC)7 allele (kind gift from Roger Deeley, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada) as control. A proof-reading enzyme was utilized and at least duplicates of each sample and control vector were performed to exclude polymerase slippage.</p></sec><sec><title>Gene reporter studies</title><p>The <italic>MRP1 </italic>5' regulatory region containing 7 or 14 GCC triplets, obtained as PCR-3 product, was cloned in the pGL3 vector (Promega). The constructs were checked by restriction, sequence and Genescan analysis and named MRP1(GCC)7-luc or MRP1(GCC)14-luc, according to the number of triplets. The CF airway epithelial cell line 16HBE14o-AS3 (kind gift from Pamela Davis, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH, USA) was transiently co-transfected using FUGENE (Roche) with the reporter vector MRP1(GCC)7-luc or MRP1(GCC)14-luc and a beta-gactosidase expressing vector, utilized for normalization. The day after the transfection, cells were incubated for 24 hrs with or without AZM 8 &#x003bc;g/ml (Pfizer Italia). This concentration is consistent with that achieved in the lung of CF patients treated with AZM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Luciferase activity was determined using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

This region has been previously demonstrated to be transcriptionally active by gene reporter studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Since the clinical status as well as the response to AZM has been associated to the levels of <italic>MRP1 </italic>mRNA in CF patients, we tested the transcriptional activity of <italic>MRP1 </italic>in our model by gene reporter assays in the presence or absence of the drug. The levels of luciferase activity measured in the constructs containing 7 or 14 GCC triplets of the <italic>MRP1 </italic>5' regulatory region were not significantly modified (p &#x0003e; 0.05) either in basal conditions or in the presence of AZM (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Comparison of the transcriptional activity of MRP1 alleles containing 7 or 14 GCC triplets</bold>. 16HBE14o-AS3 cells were transfected with reporter vectors including the <italic>MRP1 </italic>5'UTR region with 7 [MRP1(GCC)7-luc] or 14 triplets [(GCC)14-luc] driving the luciferase gene. 16HBE14o-AS3 cells transfected with MRP1(GCC)7-luc and not treated with AZM were considered as calibrator.

We also demonstrate that the <italic>MRP1</italic>(GCC)7 and <italic>MRP1</italic>(GCC)14 alleles (chosen as representative of the shortest and longest triplet length we identified) do not show any statistically significant differences in transcriptional activity when tested in CF airway epithelial cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. We chose these two alleles since we hypothesized that the length of the GCC repeat could influence <italic>MRP1 </italic>transcriptional activity as suggested by other authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Since we have been focusing to a partial region of the 5'UTR of the <italic>MRP1 </italic>gene, our approach was not aimed to test the influence of upstream regulatory sites eventually associated with specific GCC(n) alleles, as a recently described G/C single nucleotide polymorphism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>The number of alleles described in our limited group of CF subjects does not allow for searching genotype-phenotype correlation. Efforts are in progress in order to perform this analysis. Our data are preliminary and have to be confirmed on a larger population of CF subjects.</p><p>We show that AZM treatment does not affect reporter gene activity in either of the tested alleles. Therefore, at least under the experimental conditions we utilized in our assays, the sequence responsible for variable levels of MRP1 detected in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] does not appear to be included in the DNA sequence we analyzed. Previous studies reported that multiple Sp-1 binding domains are located close to <italic>MRP1 </italic>transcriptional start sites near the GCC repeat and might participate in the modulation of transcriptional activity. Zhu and Center [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] suggested a variable length of the GCC repeat in the <italic>MRP1 </italic>5' regulatory region and proposed the influence of this sequence on the <italic>MRP1 </italic>mRNA transcription. In support of this hypothesis, it has been reported that a triple GCC repeat within the 5' flanking region contributes to the regulation of interleukin 1 alpha expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. As Slapak and colleagues demonstrated that <italic>MRP1 </italic>gene amplification is not sufficient for explaining drug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], the polymorphism we identified might be utilized for investigating whether the number of GCC triplets could be associated with this feature. However, we still cannot exclude a functional relevance of this polymorphism on <italic>MRP1 </italic>mRNA transcription, stability and/or translational efficiency in its native context.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary we established that: 1) the GCC repeat in the <italic>MRP1 </italic>5'UTR is polymorphic, 2) the GCC triplets length do not affect <italic>in vitro </italic>the activity of the promoter in CF airways epithelial cells either in basal conditions or upon AZM treatment.</p><p>We propose our experimental for testing whether other molecules potentially relevant for therapy of CF have the capability to influence <italic>MRP1 </italic>gene expression acting on this promoter region.</p><p>Finally, the polymorphic length of the GCC repeat we described can be exploited as a genetic marker, possibly linked to additional sequences involved in regulation of constitutive or induced MRP1 expression.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>AZM azithromycin</p><p>CF cystic fibrosis</p><p>CFTR cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator</p><p>GST glutathione S transferase</p><p>MRP multidrug resistance-associated protein</p><p>UTR untranslated region</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>EN designed and provided the genotyping method and contributed to the redaction of the manuscript.
