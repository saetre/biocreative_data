The rhodopsin family is the largest within the GPCR superfamily and includes the &#x003b1;-, &#x003b2;-, &#x003b3;- and &#x003b4;-subgroups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The &#x003b1; group of rhodopsin GPCRs includes melanocortin (MC) receptors. The ligands for the MC receptors are the melanocortic peptides: &#x003b1;-, &#x003b2;-, &#x003b3;-melanocyte stimulating hormones (MSH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), all derived from the precursor proopiomelanocortin (POMC). In addition the MC receptors bind the agouti signalling peptide (ASIP) and agouti related protein (AGPR) that are endogenous antagonists that regulate pigmentation and food intake through the MC1 and MC4 receptors, respectively. The MC receptors are found in five subtypes in mammals and birds, named MC1-MC5 receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The MC receptor subtypes have very different physiological roles but the MC4 receptor has received extraordinary attention, as it is the most recognized monogenic cause for obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. MC4 receptor agonists reduce food intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and MC4 receptor antagonists are very efficient in increasing food intake and body weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The MC4 receptor and the MC3 receptor, which is also involved in regulating energy homeostasis, are some of the most pursued drug targets among GPCRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>We have previously demonstrated the presence of MC receptors in teleost fishes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and that the MC4 receptor plays an important role for regulation of food intake in teleosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. We have also shown that the MC4 receptor is likely to regulate food intake in birds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The zebrafish has six MC receptors due to an additional copy of the MC5 receptor, which we suggest was created through a tetraploidization within the teleost lineage. The teleost Fugu has only four MC receptors as it is lacking the MC3 receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Moreover, there are some differences in the ligand preference between teleosts and mammals: ACTH seems to play a more prominent role for the MC receptor in Fugu and trout as compared with &#x003b1;-MSH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], which is selective to four MSH binding MC receptors in mammals. Furthermore, we recently cloned and characterised MC3, MC4 and MC5 receptors from another gnathostome, the spiny dogfish. The results showed high conservation in sequence and pharmacology compared to human orthologs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], but it is still not known if cartilaginous fishes have any other types of MC receptors. It also remains unknown if MC receptors can be found in more ancient species.</p><p>The only extant jawless vertebrates are lamprey and hagfish that form unique basal groups in the craniate lineage intermediate between Amphioxius (protochordate) and gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates). It is proposed that lineages leading to lamprey and hagfish underwent one large-scale genome duplication, whereas the second doubling may have occurred in the gnathostome ancestor lineage. The agnathans differ from other vertebrates by lacking bone tissue and a biting apparatus. They have been suggested to have diverged from the lineage leading to mammals 564 Myr ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and represent some of the key species whose genomes have not been sequenced. The MSH ligands are all derived from POMC, which has been intensively studied in lower vertebrates and it seems that the POMC gene has arisen early in chordate evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Among the POMC genes that have been cloned, the two POMC genes from the agnathan lamprey are the ones most distantly related to mammals. Degenerative sequences for melanotropins (MSH) and corticotropin (ACTH) peptides were found to be encoded by two distinct genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>In this paper we report the cloning of two MC receptors from river lamprey and a fragment of MC receptor from hagfish. These receptors are the most ancient MC receptors found to date. We expressed one of the lamprey receptors and performed thorough characterization of its pharmacological properties with respect to both human and lamprey melanocortin peptides. Moreover, we show the anatomical distribution of the two lamprey receptors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Cloning of melanocortin receptors from hagfish</title><p>The degenerate PCR using genomic DNA from Atlantic hagfish resulted in a fragment of approx 400 bp. The fragment was cloned and sequenced. The sequence was blasted against the GenBank database, which indicated high similarity to MC receptors.

The fragments were cloned and sequenced. Two different sequences were blasted against the GenBank database and showed similarity to MC receptors. The clones were used for high stringency screening of a river lamprey genomic library. Two positive cosmid clones were isolated and sequenced. Both clones were found to contain the same intronless gene of 1023 bp, corresponding to a putative MC receptor of 341 amino acids. The sequences of both clones were found to be identical to only one of the MC receptor fragments obtained from the PCR. Repeated screening with another fragment as a probe did not result in any other cosmid clone from this library.</p><p>In order to obtain the entire coding region of the second MC gene, we performed inverse PCR on lamprey genomic DNA, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. We were able to extend the sequence in both 3' and 5' directions and overlap the stop codon, but not the initiating ATG codon. The genome sequencing reads of sea lamprey, <italic>Petromyzon marinus </italic>were downloaded from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The database was formatted with Formatdb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. We searched for MC receptor like sequences in the formatted database using Blastall. The sequences with highest similarity score were used to design primers in the proposed N terminal regional of the second lamprey receptor. The full-length gene was amplified from river lamprey genomic DNA using Pfx polymerase. The fragment was purified and sequenced. The full-length intronless sequence of 1008 bp, corresponding to a putative lamprey receptor of 336 amino acids was obtained.</p><p>The amino acid sequence alignment of the new river lamprey genes and the partial sequence from hagfish together with human, chicken and zebrafish MC receptors is displayed in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.

This lamprey receptor has the lowest similarity to the MC2 subtype, 35&#x02013;43%. This river lamprey receptor was designated MCa receptor.

Considering the MC3/4/5 receptor cluster, the lamprey MCb receptor had the divergence rate most similar to the MC4 receptor subtype. This analysis indicated that the MCa and MCb receptors diverged from each other more than 400 MYR.

This finding is important as the agnathans are among the most ancient living vertebrates. The phylogenetic and molecular clock analysis indicated that lamprey MCa receptor belongs to the MC1 receptor subtype, while lamprey MCb receptor belongs to the MC4 receptor subtype (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). However, the amino acid identity analysis indicated that both receptors are most similar to the MC4 and MC5 receptors.</p><p>It is well known that different proteins evolve at different rates because of natural selection for functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Our molecular clock analysis highlights the differences in the sequence divergence rates between the MC1-2 receptor subtypes, that seem to evolve fast, and the MC3-4-5 subtypes that evolve slower (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This is confirmed by amino acid analysis of the different subtypes that for example show much higher similarity to the MC3-4-5 receptors in mammals and fish as compared with the MC1 and MC2 receptors (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). While the MCb receptor clearly seems to belong to the rather slowly evolving MC3-4-5 cluster that surely must have existed prior to the split of agnathans from the lineage of chordates, the MC1 receptor character of the MCa receptor may suggest that an ancestor to the MC1 receptor was also present at this stage in evolution. It is interesting to note that the percentage identity between the MCa and MCb receptors is much lower than for example the dogfish MC4 or MC5 receptors, which are the evolutionary most closely related MC receptors identified so far. It seems thus clear that these two lamprey receptor genes were not duplicated recently. The molecular clock analysis supports this, placing the divergence of these two genes more than 400 MYR ago. None of the ancestral MC receptors displayed any high similarity to the MC2 (ACTH) receptor subtype. This could mean that either there exists an additional subtype in lamprey with MC2 receptor characteristics or that the MC2 receptor appeared at a later stage. We could not identify any MC receptors in invertebrates or in the tunicate Ciona, despite our very comprehensive searches with HMMs, which has in our hands proven to be a very effective tool to find divergent sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Moreover, our initial searches indicate that the cephalochordate amphioxus does not have any MC receptors either (data not shown). This suggests that the MC receptor family appeared first in the agnathan lineage, after the divergence of craniates (vertebrates), but before the appearance of jawed vertebrates. Taken altogether, the genes we isolated and characterised here, could code for the most ancestral MC receptors.</p><p>It has previously been reported that orthologs to the large precursor peptide, proopiomelanocortin (POMC) are found in lamprey and that these are encoded by two genes, POM (proopiomelanotropin) and POC (proopiocortin). POM encodes &#x003b2;-endorphin and two degenerated sequences termed MSH-A, MSH-B, while POC encodes another &#x003b2;-endorphin and an ACTH like sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The position of MSH-B corresponds to that of ACTH, while the position of MSH-A corresponds to that of &#x003b2;-MSH in mammalian POMC. The mammalian and fish melanocortin peptides (&#x003b1;-, &#x003b2;- and &#x003b3;-MSH) cannot be distinguished. Similarity in exon/intron organization, the position of &#x003b2;-endorphin and ACTH/MSH-B suggests that POM and POC appeared from a duplication of an ancestral POMC gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. It seems thus clear that ancestral (prior to the split of lamprey) POMC gene contained orthologs of both ACTH and &#x003b2;-endorphin. The core binding sequence HFRW is conserved between human and sea lamprey melanocortin peptides but &#x003b1;-MSH and ACTH (not &#x003b2;-, &#x003b3;- or &#x003b4;-MSH) have much larger conserved motif SYSMEHFRWGKP in all species described so far, except the gecko <italic>Eublepharis macularius</italic>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. For lamprey MSH-A, MSH-B and ACTH, this common motif looks like xYxMxHFRWGxP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. It was therefore interesting to test if these four amino acid substitutions would affect the pharmacology. Because we had ancestor-like MC receptor clone from river lamprey, we decided to synthesize the melanocortin peptides from lamprey and test their pharmacological properties with this receptor. We showed that the lamprey MCa receptor was able to bind both lamprey and human endogenous MSH peptides as well as their synthetic analogues. This could be related to the fact that the core binding sequence of the MSH peptides (HFRW) is well conserved in the lamprey. The ability of the lamprey receptor to bind all the MC ligands that we tested shows that the lamprey MCa receptor is indeed a MSH binding receptor and that it does not have the MC2 (ACTH) receptor subtype characteristics to bind only ACTH, but not MSH peptides. The binding profile of this lamprey receptor is not in particular similar to the MC1 receptors, having much lower affinities for all MC receptor ligands. It did neither have the characteristics of the mammalian MC4 receptor, which has preference to &#x003b2;-MSH and low affinity to &#x003b3;-MSH, or the mammalian MC3 receptor, which has preference to &#x003b3;-MSH. Despite the generally low affinity of the MCa receptor it still binds all human ligands with higher affinities than the human MC5 receptor. The potency order of the lamprey MCa receptor was most similar to the dogfish MC3 receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], while affinity levels in general were most similar to the trout MC4 and MC5 receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Interestingly, the MCa receptor shows higher affinity for &#x003b3;-MSH and ACTH than the human MC4 and MC5 receptors. All this points to the direction that the ancestral MC receptors had a rather promiscuous binding profile and that the specification of the different subtypes has occurred at a later stage in the evolution. The lamprey receptor had highest affinity for the ACTH(1&#x02013;17). We have previously reported that MC receptors from non-mammalian vertebrates seem to prefer ACTH peptides before other ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. This pharmacology of the lamprey receptor further supports our previous hypothesis that ACTH peptides could have acted as the "original" ligand at the MC receptors. It is also notable that the lamprey receptor has higher affinity to the lamprey ACTH peptide and the relatively similar MSH-B peptide, as compared with MSH-A, which also support this hypothesis. The low affinity of MSH-A may indicate that there is another MC receptor in lamprey that has this peptide as ligand, and that could obviously be the MCb receptor. Moreover, we demonstrated the ability of the lamprey MCa receptor to functionally couple to the Gs pathway in response to human and lamprey endogenous ligands. This is in line with all previously characterised MC receptors further adding evidence to the notion that the coupling preferences of GPCRs are in general very well conserved through the evolution.</p><p>We found that both of the lamprey MCa and MCb receptors are expressed in the skin, while the MCb receptor was also found in liver, heart and skeletal muscle. The skin is one of the major sites of expression for the mammalian MC1 receptor and the role of ACTH peptides for skin pigmentation has been highlighted in several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Our new results on the lamprey receptors may indicate that the skin is one of the original sites of expression for the MC receptors. The fact that this receptor binds ACTH with relatively high affinity could fit with a conserved role of ACTH in pigmentation. Like the MCb receptor, MC5 is expressed in liver, heart and skeletal muscle in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. These findings lend further support to similarities of the MCa receptor with the MC1 receptor and the MCb receptor with the MC3-4 and -5 receptors. The POM and POC genes we previously found to be expressed in pars intermedia and pars distalis, respectively, of lamprey pituitary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Neither of the lamprey MC receptors was detected in the brain. This could suggest that the melanocortin system functioned primarily as endocrine hormonal system where the melanocortin peptide hormones were released centrally to reach the receptors in peripheral tissues such as the skin. This is in line with how ACTH works for the adrenal MC2 (ACTH) receptors while it is in stark contrast to how POMC products work for the other receptors where they act as local hormones in the brain (MC3 and MC4) and the skin (MC1). This could suggest the melanocortin system acted originally in an endocrine hormonal fashion while the function to act as a local hormonal system evolved later. Our previous findings in several fish species such as the spiny dogfish, Fugu and zebrafish show important central expression pattern for the MC receptors. This could suggest that the central functions for MC receptors developed after the split of agnathans but prior to the split of gnathostomes. It is also possible that the central functions were developed more early on, but that these may have been lost in the lineage leading to lamprey that could be related to parasitic living conditions of these species. Moreover, it is also possible that there exist additional lamprey MC receptors with central functions, but that we were unable to isolate them. Recent evolutionary theories suggest that duplicate genes more commonly survive by function partitioning or subfunctionalization, rather than acquiring new functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The unique location of the MCa receptor in the skin and wide distribution of the MCb receptor in skin, liver, heart could indicate subfunctionalization. It is possible that the MCa receptor took over the function in the skin from the wide range of functions of ancestral gene and that the specialisation, which is so apparent for the mammalian MC receptor subtypes, took place later for the MCb receptor subtype.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we have described MC receptors in the most ancient living vertebrate, the river lamprey. We have characterized these ancestral receptors by phylogeny, evolutionary divergence rate, pharmacology and anatomical distribution. We show that a lamprey MC receptor can bind MSH peptides and like non-mammalian vertebrates, have preference to human ACTH peptides before other ligands. The anatomical characterization indicates that the MCa receptor is a skin receptor, while the MCb receptor has a more broad distribution. The duplication of MC subtypes took place most likely before the divergence of jawed vertebrates or gnathostomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cloning and sequencing of melanocortin receptor fragments from river lamprey and Atlantic hagfish</title><p>Degenerate PCR primers were designed from sequence alignment of all known MC receptors to match highly conserved receptor regions.

The following molecular (fossil) data displaying species divergence from human were applied: human, 0 (0) Myr ago; mouse, 90 (70) Myr ago; chicken, 310 (310) Myr ago; zebrafish, 450 (420) Myr ago; dogfish, 528 (420) Myr ago and lamprey, 564 (525) Myr ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The corresponding calculated distances, except for lamprey MC receptors, were plotted against the molecular and fossil data for each receptor subtype separately. The linear regression equation was calculated for each receptor subtype. This equation was used to calculate the distances for lamprey MCa and MCb receptors for each receptor subtype. These distances were compared to the tree-puzzle distances for lamprey MCa and MCb receptors. The closest tree-puzzle distances were plotted at the corresponding subtype.</p></sec><sec><title>Cloning into pCEP expression vector</title><p>Full-length coding sequences of new receptor genes were amplified by means of PCR from genomic DNA with Pfx polymerase (Invitrogen) using primers containing <italic>Hind</italic>III and <italic>Xho</italic>I restriction sites at the N and C terminus respectively.

A series of reactions was performed according to the manufacturer's instruction as follows. ACTH(1&#x02013;31) was synthesized on a TGS-AC-Fmoc-Asn-resin (30 mg/vessel, capacity 200 &#x003bc;mol/g), MSH-A was synthesized on a TGS-AC-Fmoc-Phe-resin (31 mg/vessel, capacity 210 &#x003bc;mol/g), and MSH-B was synthesized on a TGS-RAM95%TFA-resin (33 mg/vessel, capacity 200 &#x003bc;mol/g). Fmoc-amino acid [60 &#x003bc;mol for ACTH(1&#x02013;31), 65 &#x003bc;mol for MSH-A, and 66 &#x003bc;mol for MSH-B] was activated with benzotriazol-1-yl-oxy-tris(pyrrolidino) phosphonium hexafluorophophate [60 &#x003bc;mol for ACTH(1&#x02013;31), 65 &#x003bc;mol for MSH-A, and 66 &#x003bc;mol for MSH-B] in the presence of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole [60 &#x003bc;mol for ACTH(1&#x02013;31), 65 &#x003bc;mol for MSH-A, and 66 &#x003bc;mol for MSH-B] and <italic>N</italic>-methylmorpholine [90 &#x003bc;mol for ACTH(1&#x02013;31), 98 &#x003bc;mol for MSH-A, and 99 &#x003bc;mol for MSH-B] in dimethylformamide (DMF) [210 &#x003bc;l for ACTH(1&#x02013;31), 228 &#x003bc;l for MSH-A, and 231 &#x003bc;l for MSH-B] for 30 min. The manipulations in each cycle consisted of (i) deprotection of the Fmoc group with 30% piperidine/DMF (500 &#x003bc;l, 6 min, 2 times), (ii) washing with DMF (600 &#x003bc;l, 5 times), (iii) coupling of each amino acid in DMF, and (iv) washing with DMF (600 &#x003bc;l, 5 times). After the completion of all amino acid couplings, cleavage of the peptides and deprotection of the side chain were performed in TFA/water/thioanisol/ethylmethyl sulfide/ethanditiol/thiophenol = 165/10/10/6/5/4 (v/v) supplemented with 0.5% 2-methylindole (less than 200 &#x003bc;l) for 6 hr at room temperature. The peptides were precipitated by the addition of prechilled ether (10 ml) and lyophilized from 0.1% TFA. Peptides were purified by rpHPLC on a TSKgel ODS-120T column (0.46 &#x000d7; 25 cm) with a linear gradient (10 to 70%) of acetonitrile containing 0.1% TFA. The amino acid sequences of the synthetic peptides were confirmed by sequence analysis using a protein sequencer PPSQ-21A (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), and mass spectrometry using an AXIMA-CFR plus mass spectrometer (Shimadzu).</p></sec><sec><title>Radioligand binding assay</title><p>HEK-293 EBNA cells expressing MC receptors were harvested from plate and resuspended in binding buffer composed of 25 mM HEPES, 2.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>and 0.2% bacitracin, pH adjusted to 7.4. To obtain the membranes, cells were mechanically homogenized with Ultra Turrax. Cell suspensions were centrifuged for 3 min at 190 g and membranes were collected from the supernatant by centrifugation for 15 min at 20000 g. The pellet was resuspended in binding buffer. The binding was performed in a final volume of 100 &#x003bc;l for 2 h at room temperature. Saturation experiments were carried out with serial dilutions of [<sup>125</sup>I] NDP-MSH { [Nle<sup>4</sup>, D-Phe<sup>7</sup>]&#x003b1;-MSH}, labelled by the Chloramine-T method. Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 1 &#x003bc;M unlabeled NDP-MSH. Competition experiments were performed with constant 0.6 nM concentration of [<sup>125</sup>I] NDP-MSH and serial dilutions of competing unlabelled human ligands: NDP-MSH, &#x003b1;-MSH, &#x003b2;-MSH, &#x003b3;<sub>1</sub>-MSH, ACTH (1&#x02013;17) ACTH (1&#x02013;24) ACTH (1&#x02013;39), MTII, HS024) (Neosystem, France) and lamprey ligands: MSH-A, MSH-B, ACTH(1&#x02013;31). The membranes were collected by filtration on Glass Fibre filters, Filtermat A (Perkin Elmer, USA), using a TOMTEC Mach III cell harvester (Orange, CT, USA). The filters were washed with 5 ml per well of 50 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.4) and dried at 50&#x000b0;C. MeltiLex A scintillator sheets (Perkin Elmer, USA) were melted on dried filters and radioactivity was counted with an automatic Microbeta counter 1450 (Perkin Elmer). Binding assays were performed in duplicate with at least three independent experiments. Non-transfected cells did not show any specific binding with [<sup>125</sup>I] NDP-MSH. The results were analysed with Prism 3.0 software package (GraphPad, USA). Binding affinities were compared with one-way ANOVA Tukey's post-hoc tests.</p></sec><sec><title>cAMP detection assay</title><p>Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production was determined on semi-stable HEK-293 EBNA cells expressing the target MC receptors. A confluent layer of cells was incubated for 3 hours with 2.5 &#x003bc;Ci/ml of [<sup>3</sup>H] ATP (specific activity 29 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences). Cells were collected, washed and resuspended in buffer containing 137 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 0.44 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 4.2 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.2 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>&#x000d7; 6H<sub>2</sub>O, 20 mM HEPES, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM glucose and 0.5 mM isobutylmethylxanthine (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany), pH adjusted to 7.4. Resuspended cells were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 10 min. Stimulation reaction was performed at 37&#x000b0;C for 20 min in a final volume of 150 &#x003bc;l containing approximately 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells and various concentrations of lamprey MSH-A, lamprey MSH-B, lamprey ACTH(1&#x02013;31), human &#x003b1;-MSH and human ACTH(1&#x02013;24). After incubation cells were centrifuged and 200 &#x003bc;l of 0.33 M perchloric acid was added to pellets to lyse the cells. The cells were frozen, thawed and centrifuged. 200 &#x003bc;l of lysate was added to Dowex 50W-X4 resin columns (Bio-Rad), previously washed with 2 &#x000d7; 10 ml H<sub>2</sub>O. As an internal standard, 750 &#x003bc;l 0.33 M perchloric acid containing 0.5 nCi/ml [<sup>14</sup>C] cAMP (Amersham Biosciences) was added to each column. Columns were washed with 2 ml H<sub>2</sub>O to remove ATP, which was collected in scintillation vials to estimate the amount of unconverted [<sup>3</sup>H] ATP. 4 ml of Ready Safe scintillation cocktail (Perkin Elmer) was added to the vials before counting. Dowex columns were then placed over alumina (Sigma-Aldrich) columns (pre-washed with 8 ml 0.1 M imidazole) and the cAMP was transferred onto the alumina column using 10 ml H<sub>2</sub>O. cAMP was eluted from alumina column with 4 ml 0.1 M imidazole and collected into scintillation vials to which 7 ml of scintillation fluid was added. <sup>3</sup>H and <sup>14</sup>C were counted on Tri-carb liquid scintillation beta counter. The amount of obtained [<sup>14</sup>C]cAMP was expressed as a fraction of total [<sup>14</sup>C]cAMP ([<sup>14</sup>C]cAMP/total [<sup>14</sup>C]cAMP) and was used to estimate column efficiency in order to standardize [<sup>3</sup>H]cAMP. Results were calculated as the percent of total [<sup>3</sup>H]ATP (obtained as a sum of [<sup>3</sup>H]ATP from first column and [<sup>3</sup>H]cAMP from second column) to [<sup>3</sup>H]cAMP and used to determine EC<sub>50 </sub>values by non-linear regression using Prism 3.0 software. All experiments were performed in duplicate and repeated three times. EC50 values were compared with one-way ANOVA Tukey's post-hoc tests.</p></sec><sec><title>RT-PCR (reverse transcription PCR) and Southern analysis</title><p>In order to perform RT-PCR analysis of river lamprey MC receptors total RNA was isolated from brain and a number of peripheral tissues: skin, muscle, heart, liver and intestine of river lamprey. Tissues were rapidly dissected from sacrificed animals within five minutes and immersed in RNAlater (Ambion, USA) for 24&#x02013;72 hrs at 4&#x000b0;C before RNA extraction. Tissues were homogenized on ice and total RNA was isolated using Rneasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, USA) including processing with DNA shredder and DNAse I treatment (Qiagen) as recommended in manufacturer's protocol. Since some of the samples retained genomic DNA, total RNA was exposed to another treatment with 1 u/&#x003bc;l RNase-free DNaseI (Roche, Sweden) for 10 min, followed by heat inactivation of DNase for 5 min at 70&#x000b0;C. Absence of genomic DNA in RNA preparations was confirmed by PCR with primers specific to &#x003b2;-actin gene using 10&#x02013;100 ng of total RNA as a template and genomic DNA as a positive control. Messenger RNA was reverse transcribed using the 1<sup>st </sup>Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Amersham Biosciences). The produced cDNA was used as a template for PCR with the specific primers for the receptor genes. The RT-PCR primers constructed for Lfl MCa were 5'-CTG CTT CAT CTG CAG CCT GG-3' and 5'-TCA CGA CGC ACG CCG CCC ACA-3' (expected product size 302 bp); primers for Lfl MCb were 5'-AGC ACA AGA CGA GCA TGC GT-3' and 5'-TGT GGC GCA TCT CGT GCG AG-3' (expected product size 228 bp). The PCR was performed with Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) under the following conditions: initial denaturation for 1 min, 20 s at 95&#x000b0;C, 30 s at appropriate annealing temperature, 60 s at 72&#x000b0;C for 30 or 40 cycles and final 5 min at 72&#x000b0;C. The PCR products were analysed on a 1% agarose gel. DNA from the gel was transferred onto nylon filters overnight using 0.4 M NaOH. The filters were hybridized with a random-primed <sup>32</sup>P-labelled, receptor specific probe. Probes were generated with Megaprime DNA labelling kit RPN1607 (Amersham Biosciences) using sequence verified PCR products amplified from plasmids containing river lamprey MC receptor genes. Hybridization was carried out at 65&#x000b0;C in 25% formamide, 6&#x000d7; SSC, 10% dextran sulfate, 5&#x000d7; Denhardt's solution and 0.1% SDS overnight. The filters were washed three times in 0.2&#x000d7; SSC, 0.1% SDS for 1 h at 65&#x000b0;C and exposed to autoradiography film (Amersham Biosciences). Sequence analysis of the PCR products confirmed the presence of target receptor sequences. The RT-PCR reactions and hybridization were performed at least two times each.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ACTH &#x02013; adrenocorticotropic hormone</p><p>AGPR &#x02013; agouti related protein</p><p>ASIP &#x02013; agouti signalling peptide</p><p>GPCR &#x02013; G protein-coupled receptor</p><p>HEK-293 EBNA &#x02013; human embryonic kidney cells with Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen</p><p>HMM &#x02013; Hidden Markov Model</p><p>MC &#x02013; melanocortin</p><p>MSH &#x02013; melanocyte stimulating hormone</p><p>NDP-MSH &#x02013; [Nle4, D-Phe7]&#x003b1;-MSH</p><p>POC &#x02013; proopiocortin</p><p>POM &#x02013; proopiomelanotropin</p><p>POMC &#x02013; proopiomelanocortin</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>HBS initiated the project.
