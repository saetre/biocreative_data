Thus, Nop12p is a novel nucleolar protein required for pre-25S rRNA processing and normal rates of cell growth at low temperatures.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Ribosome synthesis is a remarkable and complex process requiring hundreds of different gene products and consuming much of the cell&#x02019;s metabolic resources. Central to this process is synthesis of rRNA in the nucleolus. In rapidly growing yeast, synthesis of 35S pre-rRNA by RNA polymerase I accounts for &#x0223c;60&#x00025; of total cellular transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c1">1</xref>). In yeast, 18S, 5.8S and 25S rRNAs are synthesized from a 35S pre-rRNA by means of a series of co- and post-transcriptional processing steps. 5S rRNA is transcribed from a separate transcription unit by RNA polymerase III. 18S rRNA is incorporated into the small 40S subunit, whereas 5S, 5.8S and 25S rRNAs are incorporated into the large 60S subunit. Seventy-eight ribosomal proteins are incorporated into the two subunits in yeast. The process by which subunits are assembled in the nucleolus involves formation of RNA&#x02013;protein interactions during pre-rRNA transcription and processing and results in a final architecture that places mature rRNAs at the heart of the ribosomal subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c2">2</xref>).</p><p> Processing of pre-rRNA has been scrutinized for over two decades and our knowledge of RNA precursor&#x02013;product relationships in this pathway is highly detailed (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c4">4</xref>). Covalent changes that occur during processing fall into two categories: (i) removal of spacer sequences not found in mature rRNAs and (ii) modification of ribose sugars and nucleotide bases that are found in mature rRNAs. Removal of external and internal transcribed spacer (ETS and ITS) sequences involves a complex series of endonucleolytic and exonucleolytic reactions that are absolutely required for ribosome synthesis. As a result, a multitude of processing endonucleases and exonucleases are in generous supply within the same nuclear subregion where pre-rRNAs are rapidly transcribed. While ETS and ITS sequences are degraded, mature rRNA sequences are protected from degradative mechanisms. Thus, the nucleolus must harbor mechanisms to protect pre-rRNAs from unwanted degradation, which is crucial to production of mature rRNAs. Protection undoubtedly entails binding of ribosomal proteins to pre-rRNAs in nascent ribosomal particles in the nucleolus, much in the same way ribosomal proteins stabilize mature rRNAs in the cytoplasm. Association of rRNA sequences with ribosomal proteins may also play a direct role in precursor processing by delimiting the extent to which spacer sequences are removed at 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032;&#x000a0;endpoints of mature rRNAs. Moreover, pre-rRNAs adopt specific and complex secondary and tertiary conformations during transcription and processing, despite their considerable length and size (mature 25S is 3396 nt in length and 1.11 MDa in size) and the nucleolus harbors mechanisms that facilitate RNA folding events, such as nucleolar ATP-dependent DExH-box helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c5">5</xref>). In addition, interactions between ribosomal proteins and rRNAs are likely to assist in the formation and stabilization of particular secondary and tertiary rRNA structures.</p><p> In addition to the roles that ribosomal proteins play in protecting pre-rRNAs and stabilizing folded rRNA structures, it is possible that nucleolar RNA-binding proteins perform similar functions, perhaps on a more transient basis. Pre-RNAs may be stabilized immediately after transcription and before association with ribosomal proteins through interactions with nucleolar RNA-binding proteins that may function in either a specific or global, non-specific manner. Nucleolar RNA-binding proteins may bind and trap particular pre-rRNA folding intermediates and in so doing participate in establishment of rRNA conformation. Interactions of nucleolar RNA-binding proteins with pre-rRNAs may also assist in 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; end formation of mature rRNAs by delimiting extent of spacer sequence removal. In general, nucleolar RNA-binding proteins could be involved in various aspects of pre-rRNA processing, by broad analogy to hnRNA-binding proteins that participate in different aspects of pre-mRNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c6">6</xref>).</p><p> One of the best known and most widespread RNA-binding motifs is the canonical RNA recognition motif &#x0005b;RRM or RNA-binding domain (RBD); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c8">8</xref>&#x0005d;. Three previously identified yeast nucleolar proteins have been found to contain RRMs: Nop4p&#x0002f;Nop77p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c10">10</xref>), Nsr1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c11">11</xref>) and Sbp1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c12">12</xref>). Mutational analysis of the RRMs in Nop4p indicates that each of the four RRMs, one of which is non-canonical, is essential for function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c13">13</xref>). Detailed functional information for RRMs in Nsr1p and Sbp1p is not yet available. Other RRM-containing proteins, such as Npl3p&#x0002f;Nop3p&#x0002f;Nab1p&#x0002f;Mtr13p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c17">17</xref>) and Yra1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c19">19</xref>), have been localized to the nucleolus, but are present in the nucleoplasm as well. The majority of known RRM-containing nuclear proteins, including Npl3p and Yra1p, are involved in pre-mRNA splicing and mRNA export and not directly involved in pre-rRNA processing. It is clear from studies of RRM function in splicing factors and export factors that RRMs play a key role in RNA recognition during mRNA splicing, packaging and export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c20">20</xref>). Structural studies have begun to reveal the molecular basis for RRM function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c20">20</xref>). It is clear that RRMs typically act as RNA recognition modules that exercise their conserved function in a variety of different protein structural and functional contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c20">20</xref>). Generally speaking, RRMs can function in the formation long-lived RNA&#x02013;protein interactions within stable ribonucleoprotein complexes, or in more short-lived RNA&#x02013;protein interactions during RNA processing and transport. Although significant progress has been made in understanding RRM function during pre-mRNA processing, less is known about RRM function during pre-rRNA processing.</p><p> In this report, we describe the identification of two novel RRM-containing proteins: Nop12p and Nop13p. <italic>NOP12</italic> was identified in a genetic screen for mutations synthetically lethal with the <italic>nop2-4</italic> ts allele, which is described in Hong<italic> et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c21">21</xref>). Nop12p is nucleolar, whereas Nop13p is primarily nucleolar but is also present in the nucleoplasm to a lesser extent. Deletions of <italic>NOP12</italic> and <italic>NOP13</italic> are not lethal, but a <italic>nop12</italic> strain is cold sensitive (cs) and defective in pre-25S rRNA processing at low temperatures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Media and reagents</title><p>Yeast were grown in YPD or SD medium plus supplements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c22">22</xref>).

A temperature sensitive meiotic segregant that was white, ade<sup>&#x02013;</sup>, his<sup>&#x02013;</sup>, leu<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, lys<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, trp<sup>&#x02013;</sup>, ura<sup>&#x02013;</sup> was transformed to ade<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, his<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, ura<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> with pPW67 (<italic>NOP2</italic>, <italic>ADE3</italic>, <italic>URA3</italic>) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke419tb1">1</xref>). Following growth in the presence of histidine to permit loss of pRS313&#x0002f;<italic>nop2-9</italic>, a sect<sup>&#x02013;</sup>, temperature-resistant isolate sensitive to 5-FOA was selected and termed YJPA22. YJPA22 was transformed with pJPA83, pJPA84, pJPA85, pJPA86, pJPA89 or pJPA90 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke419tb1">1</xref>) to yield YJPA23, YJPA24, YJPA25, YJPA26, YJPA29 and YJPA30, respectively. YKW157 was created by replacing pPW67 in YJPA24 with pKW12 by plasmid shuffling on medium containing 5-FOA.

However, none of the hundreds of <italic>ura3</italic><sup>&#x02013;</sup>, 5-FOA<sup>R</sup> colonies screened exhibited temperature sensitivity. This may be indicative of a strong selection against <italic>nop2-4</italic> and <italic>nop2-5</italic> at unit copy in the genome. Certain conditional lethal alleles of <italic>SNM1</italic> are not maintained in single copy in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c25">25</xref>). Thus, we used a plasmid-based approach for sl screens.</p><p> Plasmids pJPA83, pJPA84, pJPA85, pJPA86, pJPA89 and pJPA90 were constructed by inserting <italic>Kpn</italic>I fragments from pBH55, pBH60, pBH67, pBH72, pBH74 and pBH77 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c21">21</xref>), respectively, into pRS314 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c26">26</xref>). pPW67 was generated by cloning <italic>NOP2</italic> with 715 nt of 5&#x02032; and 456 nt of 3&#x02032; flanking sequence on a <italic>Sac</italic>I fragment from pJPA40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c27">27</xref>) into the <italic>Sac</italic>I site of pTSV31.

Following amplification, the products were subcloned into the <italic>Bam</italic>HI site of pRS313, to yield pKW36 and pKW38, respectively. pKW39 contains a <italic>NOP12</italic> PCR product from primers p41U2, 5&#x02032;-AAGGATCCAAAATACTGTGAGGCATTACTATCTTG-3&#x02032; and p41L2 5&#x02032;-ATGGATCCTGCTACTACTTCCCGTTTCATCCCA-3&#x02032; cloned into the <italic>Bam</italic>HI site of pRS313 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c26">26</xref>). pKW42 consists of an HA-tagged <italic>NOP12</italic> PCR product from primers p41HA5&#x02032;, 5&#x02032;-CGCCAGGATCCGCACTTTATTAAGAAAACAGTCG-3&#x02032; and p41HA3&#x02032;, 5&#x02032;-GCGCAGGATCCCTAAGCATAATCAGGAACATCATATGGATATTTCTTGCTCTTTTCAGCTTG-3&#x02032; cloned into the <italic>Bam</italic>HI site of pRS313. The resulting C-terminal sequence is ...QAEKSKK<underline>YPYDVPDYA</underline><sub>468</sub> (introduced HA epitope tag amino acids are underlined). pKW44 carries a <italic>nop12-1</italic>-like allele that consists of the <italic>NOP12</italic> promoter and the coding region for amino acids 1&#x02013;358. pKW44 was created by cloning the PCR product obtained with primers p41HA5&#x02032; and pMu3&#x02032;, 5&#x02032;-GCGCCGGGATCCTTAAGTTGGTTTCTTTGTATTTTCG-3&#x02032;, into the <italic>Bam</italic>HI site of pRS313. pKW46 was constructed identically to pKW44 with the exception that primer pMuHA3&#x02032;, 5&#x02032;-GCGCAGGATCCCTAAGCATAATCAGGAACATCATATGGATAAGTTGGTTTCTTTGTATTTTCGT-CT-3&#x02032; was used in place of primer pMu3&#x02032;, resulting in the introduction of the HA epitope tag after T<sub>358</sub>, to yield the C-terminal sequence TKKPT<underline>YPYDVPDYA</underline><sub>367</sub>. pKW49 contains the HA-tagged <italic>NOP13</italic> PCR product from primers p75-5GE2, 5&#x02032;-CGCCAGGATCCATGACGTACTCGCCATACCTAACT-3&#x02032; and p75&#x02013;3HA2, 5&#x02032;-GCGCAGGATCCCTAAGCATAATCAGGAACATCATATGGATAGTCAAACTTCACTTTCTTA-CCTTGTG-3&#x02032; cloned into the <italic>Bam</italic>HI site of pRS313.</p><p> For all experiments requiring the use of strains bearing plasmid-based gene constructs, freshly prepared transformants were used.

We found that plasmid-bearing, colony-purified strain isolates stored as patches for 2&#x02013;3 weeks on SD minimal selective media at 4&#x000b0;C did not yield consistent results, even when grown again under selective conditions. Problems with strains stored in this manner for 2&#x02013;3 weeks were clearly apparent in immunofluorescence localization experiments, in which the number of cells expressing HA-epitope tagged nucleolar protein declined roughly in proportion to length of storage (data not shown). Such problems were invariably overcome by preparation of fresh transformants, which yielded consistent results.</p></sec><sec><title>Synthetic lethal screen and characterization</title><p>UV irradiation was used to mutagenize &#x0223c;400 000 c.f.u. of YJPA24 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f1">1</xref>A) on Petri dishes to &#x0223c;10&#x00025; survival. Of 203 sect<sup>&#x02013;</sup> colonies obtained, 76 were sensitive to 5-FOA, of which 73 were capable of spontaneously losing pJPA84. Following re-transformation with pJPA84, 52 colonies remained sect<sup>&#x02013;</sup> and 5-FOA<sup>S</sup>. One of these, YKW35, exhibited a &#x02018;tight&#x02019; sect<sup>&#x02013;</sup> phenotype. YJPA24 was selected for the sl screen because a prior screen of mutagenized YJPA25, which exhibits more robust sectoring, yielded isolates with &#x02018;leaky&#x02019; sect<sup>&#x02013;</sup> phenotypes. In general, YJPA22-based strains offered the advantage that synthetic lethality could be scored on the basis of colony sectoring as well as growth on 5-FOA-containing medium, which was used to discriminate between tight and leaky phenotypes.</p><p> To complement the sl phenotype in YKW35, plasmid shuffling was used to replace pPW67 with pKW12, to yield YKW157. A yeast genomic library in YCp50 (Rose, Bank A, from ATCC) was used to complement the sect<sup>&#x02013;</sup> phenotype and 51 sect<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> isolates were obtained.

Strain YJPA22 was constructed in order to generate a colony-sectoring phenotype under permissive conditions (25&#x000b0;C) that allow spontaneous loss of plasmid pPW67, which carries <italic>NOP2</italic> and <italic>ADE3</italic> (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke419tb1">1</xref>). Loss of pPW67 causes formation of white sectors in red colonies. In addition to colony sectoring, sensitivity to the drug 5-FOA was used to score spontaneous loss of pPW67 as loss of pPW67 confers resistance to 5-FOA. Thus, YJPA22 was designed so that plasmid-borne <italic>nop2</italic> ts alleles could be easily transformed in and tested using a combination of red&#x0002f;white colony sectoring and sensitivity to 5-FOA. In these studies, resistance to 5-FOA was a more reliable indicator of synthetic lethality, although not as convenient as the sectoring assay.</p><p> Transformation of YJPA22 with plasmids bearing different <italic>nop2</italic> ts alleles allowed us to compare the extent to which different alleles supported growth in the absence of wild-type <italic>NOP2</italic> on plasmid pPW67. <italic>nop2-4</italic> and <italic>nop2-10</italic> supported spontaneous loss of pPW67 only poorly (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f1">1</xref>B). In contrast, <italic>nop2-3</italic>, <italic>nop2-5</italic>, <italic>nop2-6</italic> and <italic>nop2-9</italic> supported higher rates of loss of pPW67 and more robust growth in the presence of 5-FOA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f1">1</xref>B). Formation of white sectors, due to loss of pPW67, gave qualitatively similar results, with <italic>nop2-4</italic> and <italic>nop2-10</italic> colonies sectoring least (data not shown). YJPA24, which carries <italic>nop2-4</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f1">1</xref>A), was used for a sl screen and was selected because we viewed the weak sectoring phenotype as an indication that this allele would afford higher sensitivity to synthetically lethal mutations. A previous screen using YJPA25, which carries <italic>nop2-5</italic> and sectors well, was not successful in identifying mutations synthetically lethal with <italic>nop2-5</italic> (data not shown).</p><p> YJPA24 was mutagenized by UV irradiation and screened for loss of red&#x0002f;white colony sectoring on minimal medium that selected for retention of pJPA84. Sect<sup>&#x02013;</sup> colonies were tested for sensitivity to 5-FOA (to exclude mutations in <italic>ADE3</italic> on pPW67). Trp<sup>&#x02013;</sup> isolates were retransformed with pJPA84 and retested (to exclude intragenic mutations within <italic>nop2-4</italic> on pJPA84). One mutant strain, YKW35, exhibited a tight sl phenotype and was transformed with pKW12 (<italic>NOP2</italic>, <italic>ADE3</italic>), which allowed loss of pPW67, resulting in the creation of strain YKW157 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke419tb1">1</xref>). YKW157 was transformed with a yeast genomic library in YCp50 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c31">31</xref>) and sect<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> transformants were isolated. Two insert-containing YCp50 plasmids, pKW28 and pKW30, yielded the most pronounced sectoring, were isolated more than once each and contained overlapping inserts consisting of a region of chromosome XV (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f1">1</xref>D). Eight ORFs were common to the region of overlap: YOL042w, YOL041c (<italic>NOP12</italic>), <italic>RPS15</italic>, <italic>RPP2A</italic>, <italic>PRE6</italic> and YOL037c (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f1">1</xref>D). YOL042w is predicted to encode a protein of unknown function that is similar to Ccr4p, an RNA Pol II transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c32">32</xref>). If YOL037c encodes a protein, it would not be similar to protein entries in current databases. <italic>PRE6</italic> encodes an essential subunit of the 20S proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c33">33</xref>). Initially, we found it interesting and somewhat confounding that the three remaining genes could be considered potential suppressors of the sl phenotype. <italic>RPP2A</italic> (&#x02260;<italic> RPP2</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>POP7</italic>, which encodes a subunit of RNases P and MRP) and <italic>RPS15</italic> (&#x0003d;&#x000a0;<italic>RPS21</italic>) encode, respectively, the non-essential 60S acidic ribosomal protein P2A (also known as L44) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c34">34</xref>) and the essential 40S ribosomal protein S15 (also known as S21) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c35">35</xref>). YOL041c was predicted to encode a protein similar to the nucleolar protein Nsr1p, which functions in pre-18S rRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c36">36</xref>). To determine which of these three ORFs complemented the synthetic lethality, each was subcloned and tested for ability to support loss of pPW67 in YKW35 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f1">1</xref>E). Only one, YOL041c, permitted loss of pPW67 similar to the positive control, <italic>NOP2</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f1">1</xref>E). <italic>RPS15</italic> and <italic>RPP2A</italic> did not permit loss of pPW67 beyond that observed with pRS313, the negative control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f1">1</xref>E). YOL041c encodes a 51.9 kDa protein with a pI of 9.4. For reasons given below this ORF was designated <italic>NOP12</italic>.</p><p> To ascertain the nature of the <italic>nop12-1</italic> mutation that is responsible for the sl interaction, the <italic>nop12-1</italic> allele was sequenced. One change at the nucleotide level was found: A<sub>1075</sub>&#x02192;T. This results in the introduction of a nonsense codon (TAA) at position 359, which normally encodes lysine (AAA) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f2">2</xref>). We conclude that the <italic>nop12-1</italic> allele is recessive to <italic>NOP12</italic>, based on the finding that <italic>NOP12</italic> complements the sl phenotype observed in strain YKW35 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f1">1</xref>E).</p></sec><sec><title>Nop12p shares sequence similarity with Nop13p (encoded by YNL175c) and Nsr1p</title><p>BLASTP searches of GenBank yielded highest scores for relatively short stretches of similarity between Nop12p and other proteins containing RRM motifs.

To analyze and extend the results from database mining using BLAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c37">37</xref>), pairwise and multiple protein sequence alignments were done using Lipman&#x02013;Pearson and CLUSTAL methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c38">38</xref>) (using default parameters).</p><p> Two proteins not from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> exhibited similarity over most or all of their lengths.

The <italic>S.pombe</italic> protein is predicted to be 49.4 kDa, with a pI of 9.4.

For reasons described below we refer to the YNL175c gene product as Nop13p. The multiple RNA-binding domain (Mrd), Mrd1p, is a 101.1 kDa protein that is 17.4&#x00025; identical to Nop12p over 50&#x00025; of the length of Mrd1p (78 identities in a Lipman&#x02013;Pearson alignment extending over 97&#x00025; of length of Nop12p from residues 12&#x02013;458). Nop13p and Nsr1p exhibit significant similarity to Nop12p and are similar to each other. Nop13p has a predicted size of 45.7 kDa and pI of 9.3. Nop13p is 20&#x00025; identical to Nop12p (73 identities in a Lipman&#x02013;Pearson alignment extending over the entire length of Nop13p from residues 1&#x02013;363). Nsr1p is 18.8&#x00025; identical to Nop12p (55 identities in a Lipman&#x02013;Pearson alignment extending over 64&#x00025; of the length of Nop12p from residues 46&#x02013;337). The sequence similarities between Nop12p, Nop13p and Nsr1p are depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f2">2</xref>. Nop12p contains a single RRM, whereas Nsr1p has two RRMs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f2">2</xref>). Nop13p contains one canonical RRM and one RRM that departs from the consensus at position 188, which is M rather than L, I, V or A (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f2">2</xref>). The RRM motifs are highly conserved in all three proteins and there is considerable similarity in regions surrounding the RRM to regions near an RRM in nucleolin, which has been previously reported to be similar to Nsr1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c39">39</xref>).

Deletion of <italic>NOP12</italic> resulted in impaired growth at 25 and 15&#x000b0;C when compared to an isogenic wild-type strain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f3">3</xref>A). No significant reduction in growth in the <italic>nop12</italic>&#x00394; strain was observed at 30 or 37&#x000b0;C. The impairment of growth due to <italic>nop12</italic>&#x00394; was similar phenotypically to the impairment of growth in an isogenic <italic>nsr1</italic>&#x00394; strain, with the <italic>nop12</italic>&#x00394; strain growing somewhat better than the <italic>nsr1</italic>&#x00394; strain at 25&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f3">3</xref>A). Deletion of <italic>NOP13</italic> did not result in an observable temperature-dependent growth phenotype.</p><p> We have extended the analysis of the cold sensitivity of the <italic>nop12</italic>&#x00394; strain by examining two double knock-out mutants. A <italic>nop12</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>nop13</italic>&#x00394; double knock-out exhibited a cs growth phenotype on plates that is indistinguishable from the phenotype of the <italic>nop12</italic>&#x00394; single knock-out alone (data not shown). This is not unexpected given that <italic>nop13</italic>&#x00394; does not confer a cs phenotype. A <italic>nop12</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>nsr1</italic>&#x00394; double knock-out exhibits a cs growth phenotype on plates that is indistinguishable from the <italic>nsr1</italic>&#x00394; single knock-out (data not shown). Our interpretation of this result is that the defect in 18S rRNA synthesis in the <italic>nsr1</italic>&#x00394; mutant is more severe than the defect in 25S rRNA synthesis in the <italic>nop12</italic>&#x00394; mutant.</p><p> In preparation to investigate the metabolic basis for cs growth in the <italic>nop12</italic>&#x00394; strain, we measured the rate of onset of growth rate reduction at 15 and 20&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f3">3</xref>B). Shift of a logarithmically-growing culture from 30 to 20&#x000b0;C resulted in a 2.9-fold reduction in growth rate in the <italic>nop12</italic>&#x00394; strain, with doubling time increasing from 1.8 to 5.3 h. The wild-type control strain showed a 1.9-fold reduction in growth rate under the same conditions, with doubling time increasing from 1.5 to 2.8 h. The reduction in growth rate in the <italic>nop12</italic>&#x00394; strain occurred within &#x0223c;4 h of shift and there was no perceptible growth lag after shift to 20&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f3">3</xref>B). Shift of a logarithmically growing culture from 30 to 15&#x000b0;C resulted in a 6.9-fold reduction in growth rate in the <italic>nop12</italic>&#x00394; strain, from a doubling time of 1.9 to 13.2 h (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f3">3</xref>B). In comparison, the wild-type strain showed a 4.5-fold reduction in growth rate, going from a doubling time of 1.7 to 7.6 h (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f3">3</xref>B). Immediately after shift to 15&#x000b0;C, growth slowed considerably for &#x0223c;2 h, as a response to cold shock (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f3">3</xref>B). By 4 h after the shift to 15&#x000b0;C, cells had recovered from cold stress and were growing exponentially, albeit slowly. We sought to avoid lower temperatures, such as 10&#x000b0;C, even though cold sensitivity studies have been done at these temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c42">42</xref>), to avoid exacerbating cold stress-related effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Synthesis of 25S rRNA is impaired in a <italic>nop12</italic>&#x00394; strain at 15&#x000b0;C</title><p>Reduction in growth rates of the <italic>nop12</italic>&#x00394; strain at 20 and 15&#x000b0;C is consistent with a requirement for Nop12p in an aspect of ribosome biogenesis. This hypothesis was tested by pulse&#x02013;chase analysis of rRNA synthesis in the <italic>nop12</italic>&#x00394; strain and the isogenic control strain. Each strain was cultured at 30&#x000b0;C, shifted to 15&#x000b0;C for 5 h and pulse-labeled and chased at 15&#x000b0;C. In order to visualize mature rRNAs, chase incubations were done for longer times than are typically done for incubations at 25 or 30&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c30">30</xref>). Pulse&#x02013;chase analysis revealed a specific decrease in 25S rRNA synthesis in the <italic>nop12</italic>&#x00394; strain at 15&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f4">4</xref>). The amount of mature 25S rRNA in the <italic>nop12</italic>&#x00394; strain was &#x0223c;40&#x00025; of the amount of the 25S rRNA present in the <italic>NOP12</italic> strain, based on quantification of band intensities using NIHImage software. In addition, 35S and 27S pre-rRNAs were more persistent in the <italic>nop12</italic>&#x00394; strain and were visible after 5, 10, 20 and 60 min of chase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f4">4</xref>). At 60 min of chase, there was little difference between the <italic>nop12</italic>&#x00394; and wild-type strains with respect to levels of 18S rRNA or 20S pre-rRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f4">4</xref>). However, at 5 and 10 min of chase, the amount of mature 18S rRNA was diminished in the <italic>nop12</italic>&#x00394; strain compared to the control. This is likely to be due to delayed processing of 35S pre-rRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f4">4</xref>). Consistent with this, early chase timepoints show a small amount of 23S intermediate, resulting from a failure to cleave at A<sub>0</sub>, A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> during synthesis of 18S. Although synthesis of 18S rRNA appears delayed, <italic>NOP12</italic> does not appear to be required for normal levels of 18S rRNA and the delay in its synthesis may be a secondary effect. Essentially the same results have been obtained in similar pulse&#x02013;chase experiments done using different pulse and chase times and temperatures. Thus, we conclude that <italic>NOP12</italic> is required for synthesis of normal levels of 25S rRNA at low temperature.</p><p> To examine steady-state levels of rRNAs and their precursors, northern blot analysis was done. Cultures of wild-type and <italic>nop12</italic>&#x00394; strains were grown to early log phase and either maintained at 25&#x000b0;C, or shifted to 20 or 15&#x000b0;C for 5 h, after which total RNAs were isolated. End-labeled oligonucleotides complementary to ITS1 and ITS2 were used to simultaneously detect 35S, 27S and 20S pre-rRNAs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f5">5</xref>A). End-labeled oligonucleotides were used to detect mature 25S and 18S rRNAs and an anti-<italic>ACT1</italic> probe was used to detect yeast actin&#x000a0;mRNA. Hybridization results were quantitated using a PhosphorImager and ratios between hybridization signals are presented graphically in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f5">5</xref>B.</p><p> The 35S pre-rRNA accumulated in the <italic>nop12</italic>&#x00394; strain at 20&#x000b0;C and to a greater extent at 15&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f5">5</xref>B). The 23S intermediate accumulated at both 20 and 15&#x000b0;C as well, consistent with a delay in processing of 35S. In the <italic>NOP12</italic> control strain, levels of 35S and 23S increased by only a small amount (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f5">5</xref>B). Levels of 27S pre-rRNA, the immediate precursor to 25S rRNA, also increased at 20 and 15&#x000b0;C in the <italic>nop12</italic>&#x00394; strain compared to the control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f5">5</xref>C). Although there was a trend toward increase in levels of 27S pre-rRNA at reduced temperatures in the control strain, the increase in 27S levels was much greater in the absence of <italic>NOP12</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f5">5</xref>C). The increase in levels of 27S pre-rRNAs appeared at the expense of 25S rRNA levels, as shown by differences between 25S&#x0002f;18S ratios (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f5">5</xref>D) and 25S&#x0002f;<italic>ACT1</italic> ratios (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f5">5</xref>E) in the <italic>nop12</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>NOP12</italic> strains. In contrast, levels of 20S pre-rRNA did not increase in the <italic>nop12</italic>&#x00394; strain at reduced temperature but, rather, decreased (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f5">5</xref>D). The net result is a significant decrease in the 25S&#x0002f;18S ratio in the <italic>nop12</italic>&#x00394; strain compared to the control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f5">5</xref>D). A similar reduction in 25S levels was observed with ethidium bromide staining. Finally, comparison of 18S rRNA and <italic>ACT1</italic> mRNA levels showed a high degree of uniformity over different temperatures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f5">5</xref>E), which validates the use of 18S rRNA levels as a basis of comparison in the computation of ratios.</p></sec><sec><title>Complementation of cold sensitive phenotype by epitope-tagged Nop12p</title><p>In order to develop a molecular handle for Nop12p, the coding sequence for the HA-1 epitope tag was introduced immediately upstream of the termination codon in <italic>NOP12</italic>. When expressed under the control of its cognate promoter from a centromeric plasmid, Nop12p&#x02013;HA complements the cs growth defect observed at 20 and 15&#x000b0;C in the <italic>nop12</italic>&#x00394; strain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f6">6</xref>A). Nop12p&#x02013;HA restores levels of 25S rRNA to normal. This is apparent in ethidium bromide stained profiles of RNA prepared from strains shifted to 15&#x000b0;C and grown for 5 h (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f6">6</xref>B). Expression of Nop12p&#x02013;HA, as well as HA-tagged Nop13p, was confirmed by western blotting (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f6">6</xref>C). HA-tagged Nop12p and Nop13p migrate at apparent molecular masses of 59 and 51 kDa, respectively, which is in reasonable agreement with the predicted sizes of 53 and 47 kDa (including epitope), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunofluorescence localization of epitope-tagged Nop12p and Nop13p</title><p>The subcellular distribution of Nop12p&#x02013;HA was determined using indirect immunofluorescence localization and was compared to the intracellular distribution of the nucleolar protein Nop1p (yeast fibrillarin). Isotype-specfic secondary antibodies were used in conjunction with primary monoclonal antibodies of different subclasses. Nop12p&#x02013;HA under control of its endogenous promoter on a centromeric plasmid was expressed in almost all cells and in virtually all cells co-localized precisely with Nop1p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f7">7</xref>). Not all cells expressed the same level of Nop12p&#x02013;HA, but the observed signal intensities extended over a relatively narrow range of only a few-fold (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f7">7</xref>a). Subtle variation in staining intensities within a given panel in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f7">7</xref> is due in large part to the fact that nuclei in different cells lie in slightly different focal planes in a given field. The Nop12p&#x02013;HA staining pattern was distinctly crescent shaped, which is typical of the nucleolus in yeast. In addition, the nucleolus is typically offset from the chromatin (stained with DAPI), which is apparent in cells in which the orientation of the nucleus allows this side-by-side arrangement to be discerned.</p><p> The intracellular distribution of Nop13p&#x02013;HA was also determined using this approach. Although Nop13p&#x02013;HA was expressed from its endogenous promoter on a centromeric plasmid, like Nop12p&#x02013;HA, there was a broader range of staining intensities, with some cells overexpressing Nop13p&#x02013;HA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f7">7</xref>e). Nevertheless, Nop13p&#x02013;HA was localized primarily to the nucleolus based on concentration of staining intensity in a region offset from chromatin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f7">7</xref>g) and significant colocalization with Nop1p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f7">7</xref>f). Clearly, however, Nop13p&#x02013;HA is not exclusively colocalized with Nop1p, in contrast to the case with Nop12p. Moreover, the Nop13p&#x02013;HA staining pattern was punctate, unlike the Nop12p pattern, which shows little punctate character (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f7">7</xref>a). Overexpression of Nop13p&#x02013;HA resulted in a bright nuclear staining pattern, reflecting the confinement of Nop13p&#x02013;HA to the nucleus but not the nucleolus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f7">7</xref>e). In most cells overexpressing Nop13p&#x02013;HA, the distribution of Nop1p was more diffuse and less restricted to a typical crescent-shaped nucleolar region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f7">7</xref>e and data not shown). Thus, Nop12p and Nop13p are novel nucleolar proteins in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>The <italic>nop12-1</italic> gene product fails to complement cold sensitive phenotype</title><p>Two key observations regarding <italic>NOP12</italic> function have been made: (i) the <italic>nop12-1</italic> allele is synthetically with <italic>nop2-4</italic> and (ii) the <italic>nop12</italic> null allele confers a cs phenotype. We were interested in determining if these two phenotypes shared a common basis and wished to test if <italic>nop12-1</italic> could complement the cs phenotype. PCR was used to create two &#x02018;<italic>nop12-1</italic>-like&#x02019; alleles under control of the <italic>NOP12</italic> cognate promoter in plasmids. Plasmid pKW44 carries a &#x02018;<italic>nop12-1</italic>&#x02019; ORF that encodes amino acids 1&#x02013;358. pKW46 carries a &#x02018;<italic>nop12-1&#x02013;HA</italic>&#x02019; allele that encodes amino acids 1&#x02013;358 immediately followed by an HA epitope tag followed by a stop codon. These two plasmids were transformed into the <italic>nop12</italic>&#x00394; strain and examined.</p><p> Interestingly, the cs phenotype observed in the <italic>nop12</italic>&#x00394; strain&#x000a0;was not complemented by either the &#x02018;<italic>nop12-1</italic>&#x02019; or the &#x02018;<italic>nop12-1&#x02013;HA</italic>&#x02019; alleles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f8">8</xref>A). At 25 and 15&#x000b0;C, &#x02018;<italic>nop12-1</italic>&#x02019; and &#x02018;<italic>nop12-1&#x02013;HA</italic>&#x02019; showed the same amount of growth as observed with the control strain transformed with vector pRS313 alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f8">8</xref>A). As was shown above, plasmid bearing <italic>NOP12</italic> plus a C-terminal epitope tag coding region, <italic>NOP12&#x02013;HA</italic>, restored normal growth at 25 and 15&#x000b0;C (compare Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f8">8</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f6">6</xref>A). To extend our analysis, we wished to investigate the basis for the inability of the &#x02018;<italic>nop12-1&#x02013;HA</italic>&#x02019; allele to complement the cs&#x000a0;phenotype. Potentially, the &#x02018;<italic>nop12-1&#x02013;HA</italic>&#x02019; allele could be non-functional because it encodes a truncated gene product that is unstable or mislocalized. The stretch of amino acids 359&#x02013;469 removed by the C-terminal truncation is highly basic (pI &#x0003e;11) and contains potential nuclear localization sequence motifs, which may play a role in nucleolar localization. Immunofluorescence localization experiments revealed that the Nop12-1p&#x02013;HA protein was not detected at levels comparable to Nop12p&#x02013;HA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f8">8</xref>B). Long CCD camera exposure times were capable of detecting low levels of HA-specific signal in the nucleolus (data not shown). Based on a comparison of exposure times, we estimate that the nucleolar signal attributable to Nop12-1p&#x02013;HA was &#x0003c;10&#x00025; of the signal intensity level generated by Nop12p&#x02013;HA (data not shown). Although signal levels were low, no relative increase in cytoplasmic or nucleoplasmic signal was observed in the &#x02018;<italic>nop12-1&#x02013;HA</italic>&#x02019; strain (data not shown). This suggests that &#x02018;<italic>nop12-1&#x02013;HA</italic>&#x02019; encodes a protein with a significantly shortened half-life and suggests that shortened protein half-life may underlie the sl phenotype conferred by the <italic>nop12-1</italic> allele in strain YKW35.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Mutagenesis by UV irradiation generated a point mutation in <italic>NOP12</italic> that resulted in a sl interaction with the ts allele <italic>nop2-4</italic>, which is described in the accompanying paper by Hong<italic> et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c21">21</xref>). Synthetic lethality was also observed between <italic>nop12-1</italic> and the ts alleles <italic>nop2-9</italic> and <italic>nop2-10</italic>, but not with the ts alleles <italic>nop2-3</italic>, <italic>nop2-5</italic> and <italic>nop2-6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c21">21</xref>). At present, we do not fully understand the allele-specific nature of the sl interaction. This may be due to the fact that <italic>nop2-4</italic>, -<italic>9</italic> and -<italic>10</italic> confer more pronounced defects in pre-rRNA processing and ribosome subunit synthesis than <italic>nop2-3</italic>, -<italic>5</italic> and -<italic>6</italic> (at both permissive and non-permissive temperatures, see 21). Another possibility is that <italic>nop2-3</italic>, -<italic>5</italic> and -<italic>6</italic> support better growth of the reporter strain than <italic>nop2-4</italic>, -<italic>9</italic> and -<italic>10</italic> (in the absence of <italic>NOP2</italic> plasmid pPW67; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke419f1">1</xref>B). The <italic>nop12-1</italic> allele may impair function below a critical threshold that lies between these two groups of <italic>nop2</italic> conditional alleles. Mutations in these two groups of <italic>nop2</italic> alleles do not map in such a way as to suggest that mutation of a specific region of <italic>NOP2</italic> is responsible for the synthetic lethality with <italic>nop12-1</italic>.</p><p> The allele specific nature of the sl interaction implies that Nop12p and Nop2p function within the same pathway, rather than in parallel pathways. Consistent with this, we find that Nop12p is a nucleolar protein that functions in synthesis of 25S rRNA, like Nop2p. <italic>NOP12</italic> is not an essential gene, but it is required for normal levels of 25S rRNA synthesis at 15&#x000b0;C and to a lesser extent at 20&#x000b0;C. <italic>NOP2</italic> is an essential gene that is also required for pre-25S rRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c27">27</xref>). Nop2p functions at the step of conversion of 27S pre-rRNA to mature 25S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c27">27</xref>). At 15&#x000b0;C in the absence of <italic>NOP12</italic>, 35S pre-rRNA accumulates to levels above those present in an isogenic wild-type strain and processing of 27S pre-rRNA is likewise retarded. Similar defects in pre-rRNA processing are observed upon depletion or inactivation of Nop2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c27">27</xref>).</p><p> Although Nop12p function appears to be essential in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> only during growth at low temperature, this function appears to have been conserved during evolution, by inference from the identification of likely Nop12p orthologs in <italic>S.pombe</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Nop12p is also similar to Nop13p, which is 20&#x00025; identical to Nop12p over its entire length. Nop13p localizes primarily to the nucleolus, with some Nop13p distributed in the nucleoplasm as well. <italic>NOP13</italic> is not essential and a <italic>nop13</italic> null allele does not bestow an observable phenotype. The highest degree of similarity between Nop12p and proteins deposited in GenBank, including Nop13p, lies within RRM sequences. Many of the proteins containing RRMs similar to the RRM in Nop12p do not function in rRNA synthesis, which is not surprising given the different functional and structural contexts in which RRMs are found in different proteins. One RRM-containing protein that ranked particularly high in sequence alignments was the <italic>RBR29</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>SGN1</italic> (YIR001c) gene product, which yields a punctate cytoplasmic staining pattern by immunofluorescence localization when expressed as a C-terminally-HA epitope-tagged construct (K. Wu and J. P. Aris, unpublished results).</p><p> The <italic>nop12-1</italic> allele contained a single nucleotide substitution resulting in a nonsense mutation at codon 359, which is followed by 100 codons in the wild-type ORF. Codon 359 lies downstream of the RRM, a key element (RNP-1) of which is found between K<sub>320</sub> and K<sub>328</sub> in Nop12p. HA epitope-tagged Nop12p rescued the cs phenotype of a <italic>nop12</italic>&#x00394; strain. However, Nop12-1p&#x02013;HA, which consists of an HA epitope tag plus stop codon inserted after T<sub>358</sub>, was unable to rescue the cs <italic>nop12</italic>&#x00394; phenotype. Moreover, although Nop12p&#x02013;HA was localized to the nucleolus by immunofluorescence, Nop12-1p&#x02013;HA was detected only at very low levels, indicating that truncation of 100 C-terminal amino acids destabilizes the resulting protein and renders it unable to complement the cs phenotype in the <italic>nop12</italic>&#x00394; strain. This effect on Nop12p function also provides a very plausible explanation for the synthetic lethality between <italic>nop12-1</italic> and <italic>nop2-4</italic>, <italic>nop2-9</italic> and <italic>nop2-10</italic>.</p><p> Like a <italic>nop12</italic> null mutant, an <italic>nsr1</italic> disruption yields a cs phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c39">39</xref>). <italic>NSR1</italic> expression is upregulated in response to cold shock in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c42">42</xref>). Cold sensitivity is a phenotype often associated with defects in ribosome biogenesis. A large number of mutant alleles of genes involved in ribosome biogenesis have been shown to be cs, including, but not limited to: <italic>DRS1</italic>, <italic>DRS2</italic>, <italic>MPP10</italic>, <italic>NSR1</italic>, <italic>SNR17a</italic> (encodes U3) and <italic>SPB4</italic>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c47">47</xref>). A compelling interpretation of the connection between cold sensitivity and ribosome biogenesis defects is that low temperature &#x02018;traps&#x02019; pre-rRNA folding intermediates. This could be due to &#x02018;troughs&#x02019; of low free energy that occur in certain conformations of pre-rRNA intermediates. Low temperature may impose an activation energy barrier, which requires the assistance of factors that act <italic>in</italic><italic>trans</italic>. This requirement should not exist at higher temperatures, which promotes &#x02018;sampling&#x02019; of alternative conformations. At low temperature, factors such as RNA helicases may enhance conformational sampling in an ATP-dependent fashion. Nucleolar RNA-binding proteins may also influence pre-rRNA conformation. Perhaps trapped intermediates are stabilized by binding to a nucleolar RNA-binding protein such as Nop12p until folding resumes. Or, single-stranded pre-rRNA segments bound to Nop12p may be precluded from participation in formation of an undesirable secondary structure. Based on this line of reasoning, we hypothesize that without Nop12p function to facilitate steps in pre-rRNA folding and assembly, pre-rRNA processing is slowed at low temperature. Future studies of Nop12p should increase our knowledge of the function of RRM-containing nucleolar proteins in pre-rRNA processing. In general, elucidation of molecular interactions of RRM-containing nucleolar proteins should shed light on the significance of interactions between rRNAs and non-ribosomal proteins during pre-rRNA processing, folding and subunit assembly. However, we can not exclude potential roles in other nucleolar processes. Recently, it has come to light that the nucleolus is involved in maturation of non-rRNA precursors, e.g. tRNA precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c48">48</xref>), regulation of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c50">50</xref>) and control of aging in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke419c51">51</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gke419f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><italic>nop12-1</italic> is synthetically lethal with <italic>nop2-4</italic>.
