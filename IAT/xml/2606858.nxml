Once hydrolyzed, the lipoprotein-derived FFAs are available for uptake and use by extrahepatic tissues for either storage or oxidation. LPL is most abundant in heart, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>). The importance of LPL in fuel partitioning and utilization is underscored by observations that tissue-specific perturbations in LPL activity result in dramatic shifts in body composition and lipid and glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>), particularly in heart and skeletal muscle.</p><p>We and others previously showed that mice with muscle-specific lipoprotein lipase overexpression are insulin resistant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>). Insulin resistance developed selectively in muscle, while insulin sensitivity in the liver was not affected. Overexpression of LPL in the skeletal muscle also led to excessive intramyocellular lipid deposition, suggestive of the relationship between lipid storage and insulin sensitivity.</p><p>To further investigate the systemic impact of skeletal muscle LPL (SMLPL) on lipoprotein-derived fatty acid partitioning between tissues and insulin sensitivity, we generated skeletal muscle&#x02013;specific LPL knockout mice, denoted SMLPL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>. We hypothesized that SMLPL is an important interface through which lipid-derived signals are integrated to regulate insulin signaling and that SMLPL deletion would perturb the balance of fuel utilization not only in skeletal muscle but also in other insulin-sensitive tissues.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Animals.</title><p>Studies were conducted in accordance to protocols approved by institutional animal care and use committees (University of Colorado Denver Anschutz Medical Campus, Pennsylvania State University). SMLPL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were generated by the <italic>cre</italic>-lox system. Transgenic mice with floxed LPL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>) were crossed with transgenic mice in which skeletal muscle&#x02013;specific expression of <italic>cre</italic> recombinase was driven by the myosin light chain 1f gene promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>). Offspring were then crossed with each other to produce mice with at least one <italic>cre</italic> allele and either two floxed LPL alleles or two wild-type LPL alleles. The presence of the <italic>cre</italic> transgene and either wild-type or floxed LPL was verified by PCR.</p><p>Male 9- to 11-week-old (young) or 8- to 10-month-old (old) SMLPL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and wild-type littermate control mice were housed at &#x0223c;20&#x000b0;C on a 12:12 h light: dark photoperiod and provided standard rodent food and water ad libitum. For high-fat (HF) diet feeding, 6-week-old SMLPL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and control mice were put on an HF diet (Research Diet, 45&#x00025; fat) and a 10&#x00025; low-fat (LF) diet matched for other nutrient content for 6 weeks. Unless specified, mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal administration of Avertin (250 mg/kg 2,2,2-tribromoethanol) after a 4-h fast.</p></sec><sec><title>Glucose and insulin tolerance tests.</title><p>Glucose and insulin tolerance tests were performed by bolus intraperitoneal injection of glucose (1 g/kg) or insulin (0.75 units/kg), respectively. Blood glucose was measured from the tail using a glucometer (OneTouch Ultra, Lifescan) at baseline (0) and 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, and 90 min after injection.</p></sec><sec><title>LPL activity assay.</title><p>Tissues were dissected and assayed immediately. Heparin-releasable LPL activity was measured in heart, white adipose tissue (WAT), red skeletal muscle (soleus and red gastrocnemius), and white skeletal muscle (white gastrocnemius) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>). LPL activity was expressed as nanomoles of FFA per minute per gram of tissue.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of body composition, plasma profiles, and tissue lipid content.</title><p>Body composition was measured on anesthetized mice by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry using a mouse densitometer (PIXImus2; Lunar, Madison, WI). Blood was collected by cardiac puncture, and plasma was stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until further analysis. Plasma glucose was measured using the Analox GM7 (Analox Instruments, Lunenburg, MA), FFAs were measured using enzymatic colorimetric assays (Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA), and insulin was measured using a radioimmunoassay kit (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO). Plasma cholesterol was measured on an Olympus AU400e chemistry analyzer (Olympus America, Center Valley, PA). Plasma leptin, adiponectin, interleukin (IL)-1&#x003b2;, and IL-6 were measured using specific enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) kits (Alpco Diagnostics, Salem, NH). Red skeletal muscle, liver, and heart tissue were excised, flash-frozen, and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until triglyceride (TG) content was measured as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>). Long-chain fatty acyl&#x02013;coenzyme A (LC acyl-CoA) was extracted and purified from skeletal muscle using methods described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>). After purification, LC acyl-CoA fractions were dissolved in methanol/H<sub>2</sub>O (1:1; vol/vol) and subjected to liquid chromatography/tandem MS analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>). Diacylglycerol (DAG) and ceramide extraction and analysis were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>). Total LC acyl-CoA, DAG, and ceramides are expressed as the sum of individual species.</p></sec><sec><title>Indirect calorimetry measurements.</title><p>An open-ended indirect calorimetry system was used to measure oxygen consumption O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> production in mice for the calculation of metabolic rate and respiratory quotient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>). Animals were placed in metabolic chambers for measurements taken over at least 2 days with free access to food and water.</p></sec><sec><title>Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps.</title><p>This study was performed at the Penn State Mouse Metabolic Phenotyping Center, and the procedures were approved by the Pennsylvania State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. At 4&#x02013;5 days before clamp experiments, mice were anesthetized, and an indwelling catheter was inserted in the right internal jugular vein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>). On the day of the clamp experiment, a three-way connector was attached to the catheter to intravenously deliver solutions. After an overnight fast (&#x0223c;15 h), a 2-h hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp was conducted in awake SMLPL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and wild-type littermates with a primed (150 mU/kg body wt) and continuous infusion of insulin (Humulin; Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN) at a rate of 2.5 mU &#x000b7; kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> &#x000b7; min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> to raise plasma insulin within a physiological range. Blood samples (20 &#x003bc;l) were collected at 20-min intervals for measurement of plasma glucose concentration, and 20&#x00025; glucose was infused at variable rates to maintain glucose at basal concentrations. Basal and insulin-stimulated whole-body glucose turnover were estimated with a continuous infusion of &#x0005b;3-<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;glucose (PerkinElmer, Boston, MA) for 2 h before the clamps (0.05 &#x003bc;Ci/min) and throughout the clamps (0.1 &#x003bc;Ci/min), respectively. To estimate insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in individual organs, 2-deoxy-<sc>d</sc>-&#x0005b;1-<sup>14</sup>C&#x0005d;glucose (2-&#x0005b;<sup>14</sup>C&#x0005d;-DG) was administered as a bolus (10 &#x003bc;Ci) at 75 min after the start of clamps. At the end of the clamps, mice were anesthetized, and tissues were taken for biochemical analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>In vitro 2-deoxyglucose uptake in muscle.</title><p>To measure 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake, paired soleus were dissected from anesthetized mice and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 min in oxygenated (95&#x00025; O<sub>2</sub>, 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub>) flasks of Krebs-Henseleit buffer (KHB) containing the following, with or without 50 &#x003bc;U/ml insulin: 0.1&#x00025; BSA, 2 mmol/l Na-pyruvate, and 6 mmol/l mannitol. After 30 min, muscles were transferred to a second flask and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 20 min in KHB plus 0.1&#x00025; BSA, 9 mmol/l &#x0005b;<sup>14</sup>C&#x0005d;-mannitol, and 1 mmol/l &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;-2-DG (0.053 and 3 mCi/mmol, respectively; Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA) with the same insulin concentration. After 20 min, muscles were blotted on ice-cold filter paper, trimmed, and freeze-clamped and then stored (&#x02212;80&#x000b0;C). Frozen muscles were weighed and homogenized as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>). The homogenate was transferred to microfuge tubes and solubilized (1&#x02013;2 h, 4&#x000b0;C) with end-over-end rotation. The homogenate was centrifuged (12,000<italic>g</italic>, 12 min, 4&#x000b0;C) and used immediately for 2-DG uptake measurement. 2-DG uptake rate was calculated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Insulin signaling.</title><p>Basal and insulin-stimulated red skeletal muscle, WAT, and insulin-stimulated liver were collected from young anesthetized mice as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>). After a 10 units/kg dose of insulin (Humulin), administered via the inferior vena cava, tissues were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until analysis. Basal liver tissues were collected from a different set of mice that did not receive insulin.</p><p>For Western blot analysis, tissues were homogenized in cell lysis buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>). A total of 50 &#x003bc;g protein was electrophoresed on 8&#x00025; or 10&#x00025; precast SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. Blots were probed with antibodies for IR and IRS-1 phospho-tyrosine (P-Tyr-100), phospho-Akt (S473), and phosphor-Akt (T308) (all from Cell Signaling) first and then stripped and probed again with antibodies for total IR (Santa Cruz), IRS-1 (Upstate), Akt, PTEN, and SHIP2 (Cell Signaling). Results were detected by chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) and visualized on X-ray films and analyzed using an HC Precision Scan Pro and Bio-Rad Quantity One Analysis Software. An internal standard (wild-type mouse homogenate) was used to normalize results and to control for blot-to-blot variation.</p><p>The level of IRS-1&#x02013;associated PI 3-kinase activity was determined in muscle extracts after immunoprecipitation with IRS-1 antibody/agarose conjugate overnight at 4&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative real-time PCR.</title><p>Red skeletal muscle, white skeletal muscle, liver, WAT, and heart were collected from young anesthetized mice, flash-frozen, and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until processing. Total RNA was extracted from homogenized tissue using both TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen) and RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). One-step RT-PCR was performed using 50 ng total RNA with iScript One-Step RT-PCR Kit for Probes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (ABI, Foster City, CA). For three internal reference genes, one-step RT-PCR was performed using an iScript One-Step RT-PCR Kit with SYBR Green (Bio-Rad). Reactions were run in duplicate on an iQ5 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad) along with no-template controls per gene. The cycling conditions comprised 10-min cDNA synthesis at 50&#x000b0;C, 5-min reverse transcriptase inactivation at 95&#x000b0;C, and 45 cycles at 95&#x000b0;C for 10 s and 60&#x000b0;C for 30 s. RNA expression data were normalized to levels of ubiquitin C (Ubc) RNA, hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase 1 (Hprt1) RNA, and actin beta (Actb) RNA using the comparative threshold cycle method. Ubc, Hprt1, and Actb primer sets, as described in the study by Vandesompele et al.

The normal physiology of lipid and lipoprotein fuel partitioning is controlled by the transport and uptake of adipose tissue&#x02013;derived FFA and lipoprotein-derived TG fatty acids. Tissue-specific changes in the regulation of LPL in obese subjects may play an important role in nutrient partitioning when energy intake exceeds energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>). Thus, the ability to selectively modify LPL in skeletal muscle and/or adipose tissue may influence body weight and composition. The SMLPL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were created to provide a model to study how reduced lipid partitioning to skeletal muscle influences insulin-sensitive tissues and the potential role in regulating body weight, body composition, and whole-body insulin sensitivity.</p><p>SMLPL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice show a transition of phenotypes between young and old animals. At a young (9&#x02013;11 weeks) age, body weight and percent fat were unchanged compared with WT controls. With aging, both body weight and percent fat were increased in SMLPL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and systemic insulin resistance developed. The transition of the phenotype was accelerated by feeding the young SMLPL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice with HF diets. Such information suggests an increased propensity that lipid storage develops and that accompanies lower lipid deposition in skeletal muscle.</p><p>The deletion of LPL in skeletal muscle results in two distinct patterns of clinical and biochemical abnormalities in young mice. The first is an increase in insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle. The second is the decrease of insulin sensitivity in liver and other tissues. The present data suggest that skeletal muscle, and LPL in particular, acts as an important buffer against excess lipid storage but cannot protect against the ultimate development of obesity or insulin resistance. Despite no change in body composition in young SMLPL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice or whole-body glucose disposal during the hyperinsulinemic clamp, closer inspection of individual tissues revealed that insulin-stimulated 2-DG uptake was significantly greater in skeletal muscle, whereas other insulin-sensitive tissues (WAT, heart) showed remarkable reductions in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake.</p><p>The increase in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle of young SMLPL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was associated with reduced TG accumulation in skeletal muscle and increased basal and insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation. Interestingly, there were no differences in the accumulation of other metabolic intermediates such as LC acyl-CoAs, ceramides, and DAG in skeletal muscle. Unexpectedly, the significant effect on increased Akt phosphorylation in SMLPL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was not associated with greater IRS-1 or PI 3-kinase activity. This suggests that LPL may play a role in regulating other lipid-derived factors that affect Akt phosphorylation in skeletal muscle.</p><p>Because the total PTEN and SHIP2 levels were not different in SMLPL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> versus control mice, it is unlikely that these two negative regulators of Akt activity contribute to the increased Akt phosphorylation we observed in SMLPL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Increased Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 has been associated with the mammalian target of rapamycin(mTOR)-rictor complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>). Because there was no change in the Ser&#x02013;IRS-1 phosphorylation (an mTOR target), it suggests that there may be other regulators of Akt in SMLPL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. For example, phosphorylation of Akt at Thr308 and Ser473 can be inhibited by direct binding of two different proteins: carboxyl-terminal modulator protein or TRB3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>). Also, a pH domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase (PHLPP) has also been shown to specifically dephosphorylate Ser-473 and inactivate Akt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>). Interestingly, insulin-stimulated Akt Thr308 phosphorylation was unaffected in SMLPL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, suggesting that there might be different combination of pathways affecting Akt activation. In subsequent studies, it will be important to identify which of these possible mediators might serve as the link between reduced LPL-mediated lipid uptake and deposition and enhanced Akt activation in our SMLPL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.</p><p>Increased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and lower TG in skeletal muscle of young SMLPL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice also suggest that the loss of LPL activity in skeletal muscle in SMLPL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice creates a preference for glucose rather than TG-rich lipoproteins for fuel. Because plasma lipoprotein TG and liver TG were not statistically different for SMLPL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and control mice, more TG-rich lipoprotein TG may be processed in liver, WAT, or heart. Noting that LPL activity in WAT tissue was only marginally increased in SMLPL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and the fat mass remained the same as control mice, WAT tissue could be compensating for the loss of LPL in skeletal muscle by enhancing lipoprotein-dependent lipid uptake and turnover. However, at 9&#x02013;11 weeks, there was no increase in TG storage in the heart, an important organ in the metabolism of TG-rich lipoproteins. It is very likely at this stage of phenotypic development that the heart increased fatty acid oxidation in response to the reduced lipid partitioning to skeletal muscle.</p><p>Despite increased skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity, SMLPL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice also displayed hepatic insulin resistance, as indicated by the reduced capacity to suppress hepatic glucose production upon insulin stimulation. However, TG content in the liver of SMLPL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was not increased. Gene expression in the liver of SMLPL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was mostly unchanged, whereas PGC-1&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2; expression was modestly increased, and PPAR-&#x003b3; and SCD-1 mRNA levels reduced in the liver of SMLPL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. The increase in IL-1&#x003b2; expression suggests a possible role of this cytokine in mediating insulin resistance in liver. However, when we measured the plasma IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-6 levels in SMLPL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, there was no indication that the circulating cytokine levels were elevated in the plasma of the mice.</p><p>The downregulation of PPAR-&#x003b3; and SCD-1 in liver of the SMLPL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice is consistent with the liver not storing excessive TG in the SMLPL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. SCD-1 catalyzes the desaturation of saturated fatty acyl-CoAs and is regulated by liver X receptor (LXR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>). LXR gene expression, however, was not different in SMLPL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. SCD-1 has also been identified along with several other genes involved in lipogenesis as a direct target of PPAR-&#x003b3; in liver. Furthermore, SCD-1 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of hepatic and plasma lipoprotein TG concentrations, and SCD-1&#x02013;deficient mice are usually protected against hypertriglyceridemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>). Interestingly, SMLPL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice had a borderline increase of plasma TG, despite the lower SCD-1 mRNA in liver. Moreover, PPAR-&#x003b3; is usually associated with greater liver TG storage, and hepatic overexpression of this transcription factor leads to steatosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>). Given that both PPAR-&#x003b3; and SCD-1 mRNAs are lower and PGC-1&#x003b1; is higher in the livers of SMLPL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, the liver might respond to the excess delivery of FFAs by maintaining a higher rate of gluconeogenesis during insulin infusion in the clamp study.</p><p>To summarize and conclude, the loss of SMLPL reduced skeletal muscle TG and increased insulin sensitivity. Despite the lack of change in whole-body insulin sensitivity at a young age, insulin resistance in WAT, liver, and heart was already evident. In the skeletal muscle of young SMLPL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, insulin signaling at the level of Akt was increased, suggesting that LPL-derived lipids influence both basal and insulin-stimulated Akt activation. Because the reduction of LPL-dependent lipid processing in skeletal muscle must result in the partitioning of TG-rich lipoproteins to other tissues, over time this promotes obesity development, a condition further enhanced by high-fat feeding.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by grant NIDDK-26356 (to R.H.E.) and was partially supported by grant NIHDK-059767 (to J.E.F.); CO CNRU Core Grant NIH-P30DK048520; American Diabetes Association Grant 1-04-RA-47 (to J.K.K.); the Pennsylvania State Department of Health (Tobacco Settlement Award to J.K.K.); NIH R01: DK-40936, U24: DK-76169, and P30: DK-45735; and a Distinguished Clinical Scientist Award from the American Diabetes Association (all awards to G.I.S.).</p><p>No potential conflicts of interest relevant to this article were reported.</p><p>The authors are grateful for the technical assistance from Jennifer Yoon in the laboratory of Dr. Eckel's group for ELISA assays of mouse plasma samples and mouse colony breeding and maintenance.
