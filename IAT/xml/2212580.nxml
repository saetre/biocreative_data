Release of the chemokine CCL18 has been widely attributed to antigen-presenting cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells. This study investigates the production of CCL18 in polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN), the predominant cell type recruited into synovial fluid (SF). Microarray analysis, semiquantitative and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction identified SF PMN from patients with RA as a novel source for CCL18 in diseased joints. Highly upregulated expression of other chemokine genes was observed for CCL3, CXCL8 and CXCL10, whereas CCL21 was downregulated. The chemokine receptor genes were differentially expressed, with upregulation of CXCR4, CCRL2 and CCR5 and downregulation of CXCR1 and CXCR2. In cell culture experiments, expression of CCL18 mRNA in blood PMN was induced by tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1;, whereas synthesis of CCL18 protein required additional stimulation with a combination of IL-10 and vitamin D<sub>3</sub>. In comparison, recruited SF PMN from patients with RA were sensitized for CCL18 production, because IL-10 alone was sufficient to induce CCL18 release. These results suggest a release of the T cell-attracting CCL18 by PMN when recruited to diseased joints. However, its production is tightly regulated at the levels of mRNA expression and protein synthesis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) are effector cells during inflammation, and their migration to sites of infection is essential in controlling microbial growth and dissemination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Neutrophilic infiltration has, however, also been implicated in the pathology of various acute and chronic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), gouty arthritis and Crohn's disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In RA, PMN are highly abundant in synovial fluid (SF) during acute flares of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In addition, PMN have been detected at the pannus&#x02013;cartilage junction at sites of erosion, suggesting that they contribute to cartilage destruction through the release of their proteolytic contents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Moreover, PMN obtained from SF from patients with RA were found to produce a number of cytokines and chemotactic factors involved in the recruitment of inflammatory cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Because PMN are among the first cells to arrive at an inflammatory site, these observations raise the possibility that SF PMN may be able to perpetuate the inflammatory process through the release of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and chemokines.</p><p>Chemokines are a superfamily of more than 50 different chemotactic proteins participating in the cellular traffic of immune and inflammatory responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. They are categorized into at least four subfamilies, namely C, CC, CXC and CX3C, distinguished by the presence or absence of a residue (X) between two conserved cysteine residues in the N terminus. Chemokines range in size from 8 to 10 kDa and are produced by a wide variety of cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Their production either occurs constitutively or may be induced by appropriate stimulation with exogenous or endogenous agents, such as the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 and TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Chemokines are known to exert their biological effects on various cell types through binding to G-protein-coupled cell surface receptors with seven transmembrane domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Chemokine receptors may be specific for one ligand or they may bind several chemokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], thus allowing redundancy of the system. During activation of PMN, expression of CC chemokine receptors is upregulated, whereas that of some CXC receptors is downregulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Regulation of chemokine activities therefore occurs at the levels of receptor expression as well as ligand production.</p><p>CCL18, also named pulmonary and activation-regulated chemokine (PARC), dendritic cell-derived CC chemokine-1 (DC-CK1), alternative macrophage activation-associated CC chemokine-1 (AMAC-1) and macrophage inflammatory protein-4 (MIP-4), has been described to attract na&#x000ef;ve T cells and mantle-zone B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Cellular sources of CCL18 are primarily monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). Its production occurs constitutively but may be increased by additional stimulation with cytokines such as IL-10 and IL-4 as well as vitamin D<sub>3 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In RA, expression of mRNA encoding CCL18 was observed in synovial tissue and it coincided with CCL18 accumulation in SF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>The present study used a broad-scale experimental approach, involving microarray and quantitative RT-PCR analyses, to determine whether PMN can serve as a site for CCL18 production in RA. The results demonstrate that SF PMN from patients with RA are a cellular source for CCL18, the production of which is differentially regulated at the levels of mRNA expression and protein synthesis. Moreover, because PMN are recruited into SF, a characteristic chemokine expression profile is induced with highly upregulated mRNAs for CCL3, CCL18, CXCL8 and CXCL10 and downregulation of CCL21 mRNA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>SF samples were taken from knees of nine patients with active RA, for treatment and diagnostic purposes.

For sedimentation of erythrocytes, 1 volume of EDTA-treated blood was incubated with 1 volume of 3% dextran T500 (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) in PBS (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) for 20 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C. The leucocyte-rich supernatant was centrifuged at 500 <italic>g </italic>for 10 minutes at 6&#x000b0;C in a Multifuge (Heraeus, Hanau, Germany).

PMN and mononuclear cells were counted in SF from patients with RA. The ratio between PMN and mononuclear cells was approximately 1:10.</p></sec><sec><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>The purity of PMN was routinely analyzed by flow cytometry with FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany). In brief, to prevent nonspecific binding, 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells were preincubated for 10 minutes with heat-inactivated (20 minutes, 56&#x000b0;C) human serum and were then incubated with a combination of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated CD66b antibody (Immunotech, Hamburg, Germany) and allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated CD14 antibody (Caltag, Hamburg, Germany). After 30 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C, cells were washed twice with PBS/1% FCS (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) and kept on ice until analysis. Data were analyzed with CellQuest software (BD Biosciences), revealing a purity of 98 to 99% CD66b-positive PMN with a contamination of less than 0.05% CD14-positive and CD66b-negative cells. Analysis of PMN preparations of three donors with anti-CD56-APC (BD Biosciences), anti-CD3-phycoerythrin (Caltag) and anti-CD19-APC (Caltag) revealed 0.01 to 0.04% natural killer cells, 0.06 to 0.33% T cells and up to 0.06% B cells. In addition, PMN preparations were subjected to histochemistry (Diff-Quick staining; Dade Behring, D&#x000fc;dingen, Switzerland) showing 1 to 3% eosinophils in each preparation of blood PMN. Selected cell culture experiments were performed with PMN preparations depleted of eosinophils with anti-CD16 antibodies by means of magnetic-activated cell sorting (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) to exclude the possibility that contaminating eosinophils accounted for CCL18 production. Notably, no eosinophils were detectable in preparations of SF PMN.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>For culturing PMN, RPMI 1640 containing L-glutamine and sodium bicarbonate (Sigma) was supplemented with 5 mM HEPES (Sigma), 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 &#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin (Sigma) and 10% FCS. For pretreatment of PMN with SF, blood PMN from healthy donors were seeded in six-well-plates (Corning Costar, Bodenheim, Germany) at a density of 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7 </sup>cells in 5 ml of culture medium or 2.5 ml of culture medium plus 2.5 ml of SF from patients with RA. After 10 hours of incubation, cells were washed twice. Pretreated blood PMN as well as freshly isolated blood PMN from healthy donors or blood and SF PMN from patients with RA were seeded in 24-well plates (Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Frickenhausen, Germany) at a density of 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells in 500 &#x003bc;l of culture medium with and without 20 ng/ml IL-10 (Endogen, Eching, Germany), 10<sup>-7 </sup>M vitamin D<sub>3 </sub>(1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol; Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany) and different concentrations (10, 1, 0.5 and 0.25 ng/ml) of recombinant TNF-&#x003b1; (Biolegend, Eching, Germany). In addition, for co-culture experiments, 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>EA-hy.926 human endothelial cells (Department of Experimental Pathology, St Bartholomew's and the Royal London School of Medicine, London) were plated in 24-well plates in DMEM with 4,500 mg/l glucose, L-glutamine, sodium bicarbonate and pyridoxine hydrochloride (Sigma) supplemented with 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 &#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin and 10% FCS. After 1 hour of incubation at 37&#x000b0;C, 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>and 95% humidity, 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>PBMC or 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>blood PMN from healthy donors were added to a final volume of 500 &#x003bc;l of DMEM/10% FCS. Additionally PMN and EA-hy.926 cells were cultured in Boyden chambers, separated by a transwell membrane with a pore size of 0.4 &#x003bc;m (Corning Costar). For control experiments, blood PMN or EA-hy.926 cells were &#x003b3;-irradiated (40 Gy), washed twice after 24 hours of incubation and co-cultured with vital EA-hy.926 cells or PMN, respectively.

The results (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>) showed no spontaneous release of CCL18 by SF PMN. However, CCL18 could be induced by stimulation of SF PMN with IL-10; indeed, IL-10 in combination with vitamin D<sub>3 </sub>even enhanced CCL18 release. In contrast, SF PMN from patients with RA did not release CCL18 in response to TNF-&#x003b1;. In addition, the effect of IL-10 in combination with TNF-&#x003b1; was not significantly different from that of IL-10 alone, suggesting that TNF-&#x003b1; may not be involved in CCL18 protein synthesis. Because IL-10 is frequently found in SF from patients with RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], PMN recruited into joints are likely to contribute to the local production of CCL18. Furthermore, because SF PMN from patients with RA were shown to express CCL18 mRNA in the absence of detectable CCL18 protein, it is evident from these data that the synthesis of CCL18 protein requires a secondary signal.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Induction of CCL18 mRNA and protein in synovial fluid and blood polymorphonuclear neutrophils. <bold>(a) </bold>Synovial fluid polymorphonuclear neutrophils (SF PMN) of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and blood PMN from healthy donors and patients with RA were incubated with 20 ng/ml IL-10, 10<sup>-7 </sup>M vitamin D<sub>3 </sub>and 10 ng/ml TNF-&#x003b1; for 48 hours.

The results shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref> confirmed TNF-&#x003b1; as a potent inducer of CCL18 mRNA expression. However, ELISA analysis of CCL18 levels in supernatants of the same cell cultures revealed no detectable CCL18 protein after 24 or 48 hours of incubation (data not shown), indicating that TNF-&#x003b1; induced CCL18 mRNA expression in the absence of protein synthesis. Interestingly, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>, neither blood PMN from healthy donors nor blood PMN from patients with RA released significant amounts of CCL18 in response to IL-10 alone or to a combination of IL-10 and TNF-&#x003b1;, suggesting that TNF-&#x003b1; alone may not be sufficient to prime PMN for CCL18 synthesis.

The results in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref> show that preincubation with SF supported induction by IL-10 alone.

Similar levels of CCL18 were released into supernatant of RA blood or SF PMN co-cultured with endothelial cells (data not shown). The data therefore indicate that cell&#x02013;cell contact is crucial for the induction of CCL18. Release of CCL18 was induced by endogenous TNF-&#x003b1;, as revealed by blocking experiments with excess anti-TNF-&#x003b1; antibodies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). In controls, stimulation of EA-hy.926 cells with TNF-&#x003b1; was found to induce neither the release of CCL18 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>) nor the expression of CCL18 mRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c</xref>), suggesting that CCL18 derives from PMN.

As judged by the immunostaining of SF PMN with anti-CD66b, nongranulocytic cells constituted less than 1% of the PMN preparations. Flow cytometry confirmed the low frequency (0.05%) of CD14-positive monoctyes/macrophages in isolated PMN populations, suggesting that contaminating cells are unlikely to have a significant role in the chemokine profile determined by microarray analysis. In addition, data are presented to show that the production of CCL18 by PMN is differentially regulated at the levels of mRNA expression and protein synthesis. CCL18 was originally described to be constitutively expressed in lung and lymphoid tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. At the cellular level CCL18 production seems to be restricted to dendritric cells and monocytes/macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. T helper cell type 2-related cytokines, including IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13, were found to induce or enhance CCL18 expression, whereas the T helper type 1-derived interferon-&#x003b3; suppressed CCL18 mRNA expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. There is also evidence for a superantigen-induced CCL18 production by PBMC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>It is shown here that CCL18 mRNA expression is induced in PMN by TNF-&#x003b1; in the absence of detectable amounts of CCL18 protein, suggesting that TNF-&#x003b1; provides an early signal for CCL18 transcription. Consistent with these cell culture observations, steady-state levels of CCL18 mRNA were readily found in SF PMN from patients with RA in the absence of detectable cell-associated CCL18. Its synthesis, however, was inducible on incubation of SF PMN with IL-10. Previous studies showed that TNF-&#x003b1; is able to prime PMN for subsequent downstream events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Hence it is reasonable to conclude that CCL18 production by PMN requires two independent signals, one for mRNA expression, provided by TNF-&#x003b1;, and the other for protein synthesis, mediated by IL-10; these two cytokines are readily available in SF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In DC cultures, differential regulation of CCL18 mRNA and protein expression has been attributed to changes in maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. It is unclear whether additional maturation also accounts for the differential regulation of CCL18 in PMN, because this cell type is considered to be terminally differentiated. However, Iking-Konert and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] suggested that SF PMN can further differentiate into a dendritic-like phenotype. Another speculative explanation for the regulation of CCL18 synthesis in PMN might involve microRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>Because TNF-&#x003b1;-dependent production of CCL18 by PMN was inducible by means of cell&#x02013;cell contact with endothelial cells, IL-10 may not be the only inducer for CCL18 synthesis. It has previously been shown that recognition of &#x003b2;2-integrin/ICAM-1 on fibroblast-like synoviocytes induced MIP-1&#x003b1; expression in SF PMN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Whether a similar ICAM-1-related mechanism accounts for the endothelial cell-mediated induction of CCL18 in PMN is unknown.</p><p>IL-10 alone was unable to induce CCL18 in blood PMN, and its release was not enhanced by stimulating PMN with IL-10 in combination with TNF-&#x003b1;. The apparent difference in IL-10 responsiveness between SF PMN and blood PMN from patients with RA may result from different expression patterns of the IL-10 receptors (IL-10R). It was shown that circulating PMN express high levels of the IL-10R2 and low levels of IL-10R1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Increasing IL-10R1 by stimulation with lipopolysaccharide coincided with an increased responsiveness of PMN to IL-10. The increased responsiveness in SF PMN may be induced by soluble factors present in SF, because preincubation of blood PMN with SF supported the induction of CCL18 by IL-10 alone. In this context, CCL18 production was synergistically enhanced when PMN were stimulated with IL-10 in combination with vitamin D<sub>3</sub>. These findings suggest that the high CCL18 levels in SF from RA patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] may be induced synergistically, as previously shown for monocytes cultured with IL-10 and SF from patients with RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The unidentified stimulating activity in SF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] may be attributed to vitamin D<sub>3</sub>, because SF macrophages were shown to be able to produce vitamin D<sub>3 </sub>in cell culture experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. As IL-10 and vitamin D<sub>3 </sub>are known to have anti-inflammatory properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], the release of CCL18 induced by these mediators might contribute to a suppression of joint inflammation.</p><p>CCL18 has already been recognized in tissues and joints of patients with RA. In particular, high levels of CCL18 were measured in SF, and immunostaining of tissue sections revealed CCL18 production in perivascular regions of the synovia in CD68-positive monocytes/macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Furthermore, CCL18 mRNA and protein were found in DCs, generated <italic>in vitro </italic>from monocytes of RA patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], implying that high levels of CCL18 in SF originate from macrophages as well as DCs. The contribution of PMN to the accumulation of CCL18 in SF is difficult to judge because the cells have a low production rate for cellular mediators. However, because PMN are the majority of cells recruited into SF, the large number of PMN may compensate for their low production rate at the cellular level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. PMN may therefore be considered a cellular source of CCL18, contributing at least partly to the levels of CCL18 found in diseased joints.</p><p>Microarray analysis was performed to compare CCL18 mRNA expression in SF PMN from patients with RA with expression levels of other chemokines. The results show a characteristic profile of highly regulated chemokine mRNAs that form a group of four upregulated chemokines, namely CCL18, CCL3, CXCL8 and CXCL10, and one downregulated chemokine, namely CCL21. It is therefore unlikely that SF PMN favor the formation of ectopic germinal centers, in which increased levels of CCL21 were detected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. In contrast with the transcriptional program of terminal granulocytic differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], chemokines in SF PMN from patients with RA were not upregulated in parallel with their receptors. With the exception of CXCR4, CCRL2 and CCR5 mRNAs, most chemokine receptors were downregulated in SF PMN, supporting the notion of a differential modulation of chemokine receptors and their ligands during chronic inflammation. These findings suggest that SF PMN from patients with RA develop into a stage of unresponsiveness through the downregulation of chemokine receptors. Possible mechanisms accounting for the suppression of chemokine responsiveness may include ligand-induced receptor internalization and TNF-&#x003b1;-mediated proteolytic degradation of chemokine receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. However, it is also possible that some of the SF PMN with low levels of CXCR1, for example, develop into the recently described long-lived PMN with the capability of migrating across the endothelium in a retrograde direction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. In contrast, large numbers of CCR5 molecules on PMN have been attributed to a sequestration of chemokines, which may help to resolve the local inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Upregulation of CCR5 mRNA in SF PMN may therefore contribute to a regulation of the local chemokine response in diseased joints. The role of CCRL2 on SF PMN remains obscure, because no ligand has yet been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].</p><p>Microarray analysis of blood PMN from patients with X-linked chronic granulomatous disease revealed increased mRNA levels for only two chemokines, namely CXCL8 and CXCL1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. When compared with the chemokine expression profile in SF PMN from patients with RA, the data indicate a disease-specific expression of chemokines in PMN. This conclusion is supported, at least in part, by the results of Sukumaran and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>], who reported the upregulated expression of chemokine genes encoding CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL8, CCL3, CCL4 and CCL20 after infection of PMN with <italic>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</italic>.
