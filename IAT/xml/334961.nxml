Aberrant splicing of cytochrome P450 mRNA has been proposed as a potential mechanism for these polymorphisms. We have isolated aberrantly, as well as normally, spliced mRNAs (cDNAs) from the human P450IIB6 gene which either contain part of intron 5 and lack exon 8 or which contain a 58-bp fragment (exon 8A) instead of exon 8. Sequence analysis of the P450IIB6 gene demonstrates the presence of cryptic splice sites in intron 8 which will account for the generation of exon 8A. The mRNAs were therefore generated by alternative splicing. These data gain significance as the mRNAs will not encode a functional P450 enzyme and appear to represent a high proportion of the P450IIB6 mRNA population. Analysis of mRNA from fifteen individual human livers and cDNA libraries constructed from a variety of human tissues using the polymerase chain reaction shows that the aberrant splicing occurs in all cells and all individuals tested. This suggests a high level of infidelity in the processing of P450IIB6 mRNAs and demonstrates that the presence of abnormal transcripts does not imply the presence of a functionally inactive gene.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00137-0221-a" xlink:role="8249"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00137-0223-a" xlink:role="8251"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00137-0213.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8241"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00137-0214.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8242"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00137-0215.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8243"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00137-0216.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8244"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00137-0217.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8245"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00137-0218.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8246"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00137-0219.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8247"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00137-0220.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8248"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00137-0221.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8249"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00137-0222.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8250"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00137-0223.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8251"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00137-0224.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8252"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00137-0225.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8253"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00137-0226.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8254"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00137-0227.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8255"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
