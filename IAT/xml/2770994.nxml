To ascertain the role of the tail region in integrase function and HIV-1 replication, a set of deletion mutants that successively lacked three amino acids was constructed and analyzed in a variety of biochemical and virus infection assays. HIV-1/2 chimers, which harbored the analogous 23-mer HIV-2 tail in place of the HIV-1 sequence, were also studied. Because integrase mutations can affect steps in the replication cycle other than integration, defective mutant viruses were tested for integrase protein content and reverse transcription in addition to integration. The F185K core domain mutation, which increases integrase protein solubility, was furthermore analyzed in a subset of mutants.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Purified proteins were assessed for in vitro levels of 3' processing and DNA strand transfer activities whereas HIV-1 infectivity was measured using luciferase reporter viruses. Deletions lacking up to 9 amino acids (1-285, 1-282, and 1-279) displayed near wild-type activities <italic>in vitro </italic>and during infection. Further deletion yielded two viruses, HIV-1<sub>1-276 </sub>and HIV-1<sub>1-273</sub>, that displayed approximately two and 5-fold infectivity defects, respectively, due to reduced integrase function. Deletion mutant HIV-1<sub>1-270 </sub>and the HIV-1/2 chimera were non-infectious and displayed approximately 3 to 4-fold reverse transcription in addition to severe integration defects. Removal of four additional residues, which encompassed the C-terminal &#x003b2; strand of the SH3 fold, further compromised integrase incorporation into virions and reverse transcription.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>HIV-1<sub>1-270</sub>, HIV-1<sub>1-266</sub>, and the HIV-1/2 chimera were typed as class II mutant viruses due to their pleiotropic replication defects. We speculate that residues 271-273 might play a role in mediating the known integrase-reverse transcriptase interaction, as their removal unveiled a reverse transcription defect. The F185K mutation reduced the <italic>in vitro </italic>activities of 1-279 and 1-276 integrases by about 25%. Mutant proteins 1-279/F185K and 1-276/F185K are therefore highlighted as potential structural biology candidates, whereas further deleted tail variants (1-273/F185K or 1-270/F185K) are less desirable due to marginal or undetectable levels of integrase function.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Retrovirus replication proceeds through a series of steps that initiate upon virus entry into a cell, followed by particle uncoating and reverse transcription. To support productive replication, the resulting double stranded cDNA must be integrated into a cell chromosome. The integrated DNA provides an efficient transcriptional template for viral gene expression and ensures for segregation of viral genetic material to daughter cells during division. Due to its essential nature, the integrase (IN) encoded by HIV-1 is an intensely studied antiviral drug target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Integration can be divided into three enzyme-based steps, the first two of which are catalyzed by IN. In the initial 3' processing reaction, IN removes the terminal pGT<sub>OH </sub>dinucleotides from the 3' ends of the blunt-ended HIV-1 reverse transcript, yielding the precursor ends for integration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In the second step, DNA strand transfer, IN uses the 3'-oxygens to cut the chromosomal target DNA in a staggered fashion and at the same time joins the viral 3' ends to the resulting 5' phosphates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The final step, repair of single stranded gaps and joining of viral DNA 5' ends, is accomplished by cellular enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. HIV-1 IN activities can be measured in vitro using oligonucleotide DNA substrates that mimic the ends of the reverse transcript and either Mg<sup>2+ </sup>or Mn<sup>2+ </sup>cofactor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>IN is a multi-domain protein consisting of the N-terminal domain (NTD, HIV-1 residues 1-49), catalytic core domain (CCD, residues 50-212), and C-terminal domain (CTD, residues 213-288). The NTD contains a conserved HHCC Zn-coordination motif, and Zn-binding contributes to IN multimerization and catalytic function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The CCD contains an invariant triad of acidic residues (Asp-64, Asp-116, Glu-152 of HIV-1) that forms the enzyme active site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The CCD also contributes to IN multimerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and engages viral [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and chromosomal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] DNAs during integration. The CTD, which is the least conserved of the domains among retroviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], also contributes to specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and non-specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] DNA interactions, as well as multimerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>Insight into the mechanism of HIV-1 integration is somewhat hampered by lack of relevant 3-dimensional information, as structures for the enzyme bound to its DNA substrates, or the free holoenzyme, have yet to be reported. NTD-CCD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and CCD-CTD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] two-domain x-ray crystal structures have nevertheless been informative. Three NTD-CCD structures, containing HIV-1, HIV-2, or maedi-visna virus domains, have revealed a dimer-of-dimers architecture for the active IN tetramer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and the high affinity binding mode of the common lentiviral integration cofactor LEDGFp75 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. An SH3 fold comprised of five &#x003b2; strands makes up the heart of the CTD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], and a comparison of HIV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], SIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], and Rous sarcoma virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] CCD-CTD structures reveals considerable flexibility in CTD positioning with respect to the different CCDs. Nevertheless, extended viral DNA binding surfaces were ascribed to each CCD-CTD structure. Although residues 271-288, herein referred to as the tail, were present in the two-domain HIV-1 construct, they were disordered and therefore unseen in the resulting crystal structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>The roles of the C-terminal tail in IN function and HIV-1 replication are largely unexplored. The IN<sub>1-270 </sub>deletion mutant that lacked the tail supported 10-50% of wild-type (WT) Mn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent 3' processing and DNA strand transfer activities, whereas the activities of IN<sub>1-279 </sub>were largely unimpaired (50-100% of WT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. HIV-1 carrying the substitution of Ala for Lys-273 grew like the WT in Jurkat T cells, dispensing an obvious role for this highly conserved tail residue in virus replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. To learn more about the role of this region in IN catalysis and HIV-1 replication, successive three amino acid deletion mutants were constructed and analyzed in various enzymatic and virus infection assays. The somewhat larger 23-residue HIV-2 tail was moreover swapped for the HIV-1 sequence to assess the activities of tail chimera enzyme and virus., C-terminal deletion mutants that lack all or part of the tail could be useful structural biology candidates due to their inability to adopt an ordered fold in previous crystal structures. Thus, one goal of this study was to evaluate the solubility-enhancing F185K CCD mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] for its potential effects on the in vitro activities of tail deletion mutant enzymes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plasmid DNA constructions</title><p>Bacterial expression vector pKBIN6Hthr [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and viral IN shuttle vector pUCWTpol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] were previously described. Because the IN tail overlaps the 5' end of <italic>vif</italic>, shuttle vector pUCWTpol3stop, which harbored three stop codons after Vif residue Asn-19, was constructed by PCR using Pfu Ultra DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and primers AE1064 (5'-ACAGGATGAGGATTAACTGATGATAAGCTTTAGTAAAACACCATATG)/AE1065 (5'-CATATGGTGTTTTACTAAAGCTTATCATCAGTTAATCCTCATCCTGTC). IN deletion mutations were subsequently constructed in pUCWTpol3stop or pKBIN6Hthr by PCR. Plasmid pUCWTpolBam-Spe, which contains unique BamHI and SpeI sites downstream of the IN coding region and a stop codon after Arg-17 in Vif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], was used to swap tail sequences as follows. AAA/CAG/ATG, which encodes for HIV-1 residues Lys-273, Gln-274, and Met-275, was changed to GGT/CGA/CTG to imbed a unique SalI site in pUCWTpolSal-Bam-Spe at the HIV-1/2 tail boundary. A linker constructed by annealing AE3697 (5'-PO<sub>4</sub>-TCGACAGGAGATGGACAGCGGAAGTCACCTGGAGGGCGCAAGAGAGGACGGTGAGATGGCATAAG) with AE3698 (5'-PO<sub>4</sub>-GATCCTTATGCCATCTCACCGTCCTCTCTTGCGCCCTCCAGGTGACTTCCGCTGTCCATCTCCTG) was then ligated to SalI/BamHI-digested pUCWTpolSal-Bam-Spe. To move the chimera tail to pKBIN6Hthr, pUCWTpolSal-Bam-Spe was amplified using XhoI-tagged AE3699 (5'-TGGTG<underline>CTCGAG</underline>TGCGGACCCACGCGGGACGAGTGCCATCTCACCGTCCTCTCTTGC) and AflII-tagged AE3700 (AACAT<underline>CTTAAG</underline>ACAGCAGTAC) and the resulting digested fragment was ligated with XhoI/AflII-cut pKBIN6Hthr. Mutated AgeI-PflMI 1.8 kb fragments from pUCWTpol3stop or pUCWTpolSal-Bam-Spe were swapped for the corresponding fragment in the single round HIV-1<sub>NL4-3</sub>-based vector pNLX.Luc(R-) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].

The bacterial pellet resuspended in ice-cold buffer A [25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 M NaCl, 7.5 mM 3-[(3-Cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS)] containing 25 mM imidazole-0.5 mM phenylmethanesulphonylfluoride was sonicated.

The His-Tag was removed using 40 U of thrombin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) per mg of protein for 3 h at room temperature, which left the heterologous LVPR sequence at each C-terminus. After removal of thrombin by incubation with Benzamidine beads (Novagen, Madison, WI), IN was concentrated using Centricon-10 Concentrators (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and dialyzed against buffer D for 4 h.

This region of the protein, which overlaps the 5' end of the <italic>vif </italic>reading frame, is fairly well conserved among different HIV-1 isolates. Some clade C sequences harbor Ala in place of Asp-278 and numerous clades as well as SIVcpz carry Gly at position 283 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>); the remaining residues by contrast show little or no sequence variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. To ascertain the role of the tail in IN function, six nested deletions mutants lacking 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, or 18 amino acids from the C-terminus were constructed in the pKBIN6Hthr bacterial expression construct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and luciferase-based pNLX.Luc(R-) viral vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The CCD F185K mutation, which dramatically increases the solubility of the HIV-1 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], was tested in some constructs to assess its potential affects on IN activities in vitro. The 1-266 deletion mutant, which lacked the C-terminal 22 residues and hence the fifth &#x003b2; strand of the CTD SH3 fold in addition to the tail (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], was used as a loss-of-function control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Finally, the 23 residue HIV-2 tail (underlined in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) was swapped for the corresponding HIV-1 sequence to test the functionality of this marginally related sequence substitution.

Under these conditions, the majority of DNA strand transfer reaction products result from the insertion of a single oligonucleotide end into one strand of a second target DNA molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. By contrast, integration in cells proceeds via the concerted insertion of viral U3 and U5 DNA ends into opposing strands of chromosomal DNA.

Experiments conducted with a subset of proteins prior to cleavage (WT, 1-279, 1-273, 1-270,1-266, and HIV-1/2) revealed similar levels of 3' processing activities relative to WT, indicating that the remnant sequence did not significantly influence mutant enzyme activities (data not shown).</p><p>To follow the course of the 3' processing reaction, oligonucleotide substrate DNA was labeled at the inter-nucleotide linkage of the 3'-terminal GT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>); IN mediated hydrolysis liberates pGT<sub>OH</sub>, which is readily distinguished from the 30 bp substrate following electrophoresis on high percentage DNA sequencing gels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, lanes 2 and 3; results quantified in panel B).

Pairwise integration of two oligonucleotides by contrast yields a linearized product whose size is slightly larger than linear plasmid (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). IN DNA strand transfer activity was barely detectable in the absence of LEDGFp75, yielding slight increases in the nicked or open circular plasmid population (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, compare lanes 3 and 27 to lanes 2 and 26, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. LEDGFp75 greatly stimulated IN activity such that the supercoiled target DNA was largely consumed, yielding a mixture of half-site and concerted integration products (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, lanes 4 and 28). IN mutant product formation was quantified to reflect overall levels (half-site plus concerted, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>) of DNA strand transfer activities or just concerted integration (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). The overall activities of the various deletion mutant proteins in large part mirrored their oligonucleotide-based DNA strand transfer activities (compare Figure 5B to 4B). Though 0.49 &#x003bc;M IN<sub>HIV1/2 </sub>supported about 40% of IN<sub>WT </sub>activity in the oligonucleotide-based assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>), 0.8 &#x003bc;M protein failed to support appreciable product formation in the concerted assay format (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, lane 31). Doubling the amount of input IN<sub>HIV1/2 </sub>to 1.6 &#x003bc;M yielded significant half-site product formation (about 66% of IN<sub>WT</sub>, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, lane 30 and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>) in the absence of detectable concerted integration activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Taken together, our data indicate that the C-terminal tail does not play a specific role in concerted DNA integration, though the introduction of a foreign sequence for the HIV-1 tail can uncouple pairwise from single end integration activity. Though others noted that the F185K substitution ablated Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent integration of preprocessed oligonucleotide donor DNA into heterologous target DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>], our reaction conditions failed to reveal an affect of the solubilizing mutation on full-length IN activity in the presence of LEDGFp75 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, lane 6; panels B and C). We furthermore conclude that the C-terminal 9 amino acids of HIV-1 IN can be removed without dramatically effecting Mg<sup>2+</sup>-based single end or concerted DNA integration activities (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>)., We highlight these derivatives as potential candidates for structural biology studies despite the approximate 20-25% reductions in IN<sub>1-279 </sub>and IN<sub>1-276 </sub>activities brought on by the F185K change.

Virus stocks were treated with DNase prior to infection to digest plasmid DNA that may persist after transfection and hence template in the LRT reaction format. To control for potential plasmid carry-over, a parallel set of infections was conducted using heat-inactivated viruses. Resulting LRT values (typically 1-5%) were subtracted from native viral infections. HIV-1<sub>1-276 </sub>and HIV-1<sub>1-273 </sub>supported the WT levels of reverse transcription and circle formation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>), whereas HIV-1<sub>1-270</sub>, HIV-1<sub>1-266</sub>, and the HIV-1/2 chimera supported about 25%, 5%, and 33% of WT LRT product formation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). Under these experimental conditions IN residues 271-273 contribute to reverse transcription. Due to the pleiotropic nature of HIV-1 IN mutations these results were not entirely unexpected.

Alternatively, a number of NTD and CCD mutations in addition to CTD changes can impair DNA synthesis (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>] for review), indicating that the C-terminal tail changes might perturb reverse transcription via global affects on IN and/or the preintegration complex.</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>Reverse transcription and integration profiles of IN mutant viruses</bold>.

As both of these viruses supported the formation of detectable 2-LTR circles (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>), we group them as class II defective IN mutants that display marginal (3 to 4-fold) reverse transcription in additional to prominent integration defects.

Additional removal of up to six amino acids impacted infectivity by up to 80%, yielding viruses that were specifically defective for integration due to the compromised activities of the associated IN<sub>1-276 </sub>and IN<sub>1-273 </sub>enzymes. Heuer and Brown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>] reported that residues 271-288 crosslink to viral and target DNA sequences within junctional disintegration substrates. We would therefore surmise that tail residues 271-279 interact with substrate DNA during integration. HIV-1<sub>1-270 </sub>was non-infectious and harbored an approximate fourfold reverse transcription defect. This suggests IN residues 271, 272, and 273 might impact its physical association with RT. HIV-1<sub>1-266</sub>, which lacked the fifth &#x003b2; strand of the fold, failed to incorporate significant levels of IN protein and was in large part defective for reverse transcription. Thus, an intact SH3 fold apparently contributes to Gag-Pol packaging and subsequent viral DNA synthesis. Our results moreover highlight partial tailed variants 1-279/F185K and 1-276/F185K as viable candidates for structural biology studies, as they retained &#x0003e;20% of IN enzymatic activities yet lacked at least half of the disordered region.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations used</title><p>CCD: catalytic core domain; CHAPS: 3-[(3-Cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonate; CTD: C-terminal domain; DMEM: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; DTT: dithiothreitol; FBS: fetal bovine serum; IN: integrase; LRT: late reverse transcription; LTR: long-terminal repeat; Ni-NTA: Ni<sup>2+</sup>-nitrilotriacetic acid; NTD: N-terminal domain; Q: quantitative; RT: reverse transcriptase; SDS: Na dodecyl sulfate; WT: wild type.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MJD constructed molecular clones, purified recombinant IN proteins, and conducted in vitro integration assays.
