We have previously shown that STAT3 is activated within APC by a novel contact-dependent mechanism, which plays a key role in mediating the immunomodulatory effects of hMSC. In order to better understand the underlying mechanisms that control APC maturation in a contact dependent manner, we extended our observation to tumor cells. Tumors were shown to secrete a variety of tumor-derived factors that activate STAT3 within infiltrating APCs. We now tested whether tumor cells can activate STAT3 within APC using the contact-dependent mechanism, in addition to soluble factors, and compared these two STAT3 activating pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Principal Findings</title><p>We demonstrate that in addition to tumor-derived secreted factors tumor cells activate STAT3 by a mechanism that is based on cell-cell interaction. We further demonstrate that these two STAT3 activating mechanisms differ in their JAK usage and their susceptibility to JSI-124 inhibition thereby representing two distinct pathways. Significantly, although both pathways activate STAT3, they modulate DCs maturation in a different manner that results in disparate phenotypic outcomes. Whereas the soluble-dependent pathway results in an immature phenotype, the contact-dependent pathway results in an apparently mature phenotype. Albeit their mature-like phenotype these latter cells express the tolerogenic markers ILT3 and ILT4 and possess T cell inhibitory activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Significance</title><p>This data suggests that, in at least certain cellular microenvironments, cell:cell interactions represent a novel way to activate STAT3 signaling, uncouple APC activation events and consequently regulate immunity and tolerance. Significantly, we have now demonstrated that this contact-dependent signaling pathway differs from that mediated by soluble factors and cytokines, inducing disparate phenotypic outcome, suggesting these two mechanisms have different and possibly complementary biological functions.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and specifically dendritic cells (DCs), are the most potent inducers of the immune response. DCs in the periphery capture and process antigens in their immature state followed by a maturation process in response to a spectrum of stimuli, allowing them to induce both innate and adaptive responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-Adler1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Only upon receiving maturation signals, DCs migrate to lymphoid organs, secrete cytokines and express co-stimulatory molecules that are required for lymphocyte activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-Adler1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. In recent years, however, there is growing evidence suggesting that DCs not only initiate T cell responses but are also involved in silencing T cell immune responses. These functions of DCs are thought to be mainly dependent on their activation and differentiation state. For example, terminally differentiated mature DCs can efficiently induce the development of effector T cells, whereas immature DCs or partially matured DCs are involved in maintenance of peripheral tolerance. Hence, APCs and specifically DCs orchestrate a range of immune responses including induction and suppression of T cell activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-Adler1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-Lutz1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Regulation of DCs maturation occurs through the function of Janus activated kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-Nefedova1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The JAK family of tyrosine kinases and STAT are important components of diverse signal transduction pathways that are actively involved in cellular survival, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Four members of the Jak family have been identified in mammalian cells, Jak1, Jak2, Jak3 and Tyk2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-Rane1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Cytokine receptor-ligand binding induces receptor oligomerization and phophorylation, followed by Jak activation. Activated Jaks phosphorylate receptors on target tyrosine residues, generating docking sites for STATs, which are subsequently recruited and phosphorylated by activated Jaks. Dimerized STATs then translocate to the nucleus, where they modulate expression of target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-Imada1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. One of these proteins STAT3, has been implicated as a negative regulator of the immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-Cheng1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Mice devoid of the STAT3 gene in macrophages and neutrophils have enhanced inflammatory activity, leading to the development of chronic colitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-Cheng1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>STAT3 has been recently proposed as an important molecule that mediates tumor induced immunosupression. STAT3 is constitutively active in many tumor cells and was found to have an important role in oncogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-Yu1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition STAT3 was found to have a profound role in regulating the immune responses in the tumor micro-environment. In tumor cells, STAT3 activation has been linked to both inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and induction of anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion, such as IL-10 and VEGF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-Wang1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. These latter anti-inflammatory cytokines can, in turn, induce STAT3 activation within neighboring DCs, thereby influencing their functional maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-Wang1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Collectively, tumor cells were shown to secrete soluble factors that activate STAT3 and suppress DCs function.</p><p>An effective anti-tumor immune response requires the participation of the host APCs, mostly DCs and macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-Yu1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Macrophages were shown to be recruited to the tumor site by cytokines, chemokines and other tumor derived factors, and once within the tumor environment they are skewed toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype and thereby promote tumor growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-Hagemann1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. DCs in the tumor microenvironment are usually found in an immature state, characterized by an insufficient level of expression of MHC class II complexes, co-stimulatory molecules such as CD80 and CD86 and IL-12. These cells are not only poor antigen-presenting cells, but could further induce immune tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-Gabrilovich1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-Zou1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Tolerogenic DCs are generated in the absence of inflammatory mediators, and recent studies have shown that DCs can be further blocked from becoming effective antigen presenting cells by tumor secreted factors that inhibit their maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-Gabrilovich1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-Zou1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We have previously described that human Mesenchymal Stem Cells (hMSC) inhibit T cells indirectly by contact-dependent induction of regulatory APCs (both monocytes and DCs) with T cell suppressive properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-Beyth1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Accordingly, when APCs came into productive contact with hMSC, the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-12 were inhibited while the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was induced. Under these circumstances, IFN-&#x003b3; secretion and T- cell proliferation were inhibited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-Beyth1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. This contact-dependent induction of regulatory APCs was dependent on the activation of STAT3 in these cells and could be blocked with specific STAT3 inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-GurWahnon1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. In the present study, we demonstrated that tumor cells modulate APCs function by using two parallel mechanisms for the activation of STAT3; the first involving secretion of soluble cytokines as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-Wang1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-Nefedova2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, and second involving a novel pathway that is based on cell-cell interaction. While these two distinct pathways activate STAT3 within APCs, they result in disparate phenotypic outcomes. A contact-dependent mechanism may provide a molecular explanation for how the surrounding microenvironment influences APCs maturation in a focused and unique way.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cancer cells inhibit TNF-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b3; secretion while inducing IL-10 production</title><p>Recent studies have suggested that tumor cells secrete tumor-derived factors that induce STAT3 activity within neighboring APCs, effecting their maturation and function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-Wang1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

We further assessed the contribution of soluble and contact-dependent factors to the increase in STAT3 activation in tumor cell-APC co-cultures. There is soluble factor-dependence of STAT3 induced activity in the tumor cells-monocyte co-cultures based on the increase in STAT3 activity in monocytes when both PC3 and MCF-7 were replaced with their conditioned media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006846-g001">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006846-g002">2A</xref>, lower panels), or when monocytes and the tumor cells were on opposite sides of a transwell membrane (not shown). However, the effect of conditioned media was lower than the combined effect achieved when the two cell types were co-cultured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006846-g001">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006846-g002">2A</xref>). Therefore, to eliminate interference from tumor cytokines in the co-cultures, tumor cell conditioned media was washed away just prior to adding the monocytes. Under these conditions, we observed significant increase in STAT3 activity after co-culturing the cells compared to its activity in each cell type cultured individually, measured 2 hours later.

Our previous data on hMSC:APC co-cultures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-GurWahnon1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> demonstrated that STAT3 activity is abrogated upon treatment with JSI-124 (cucurbitacin), a small natural molecule that inhibits JAK2 signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-Blaskovich1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that the contact dependent mechanism may involve JAK2 signaling pathways. To further test this, we have pretreated monocytes with JSI-124, for 1 hour prior to their co-culturing with the tumor cells, or incubation with either IL-10 or tumor cell's conditioned media. Pretreatment of the cells was necessary in order to avoid JAK2/STAT3 inhibition in the tumor cells while focusing on signaling events within the APC. Pretreatment of monocytes with JSI-124, resulted in a significant reduction in STAT3 activity (measured by both STAT3 transcription factor assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006846-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, upper panels) or phospho-STAT3 intracellular immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006846-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, left panel)) and in IL-10 production by the monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006846-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, lower panels) in tumor cell:monocyte co-cultures. On the other hand, JSI-124 pre-treatment had no effect on STAT3 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006846-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, lower panels), phospho-STAT3 immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006846-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, right panel) or IL-10 production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006846-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, upper panel) when monocytes were incubated with MCF-7's conditioned media. Likewise, JSI-124 had no effect on STAT3 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006846-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>) or phospho-STAT3 intracellular immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006846-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>) in IL-10-treated monocytes. This activation of STAT3 as well as its sensitivity to JSI-124 treatment was further demonstrated using anti-phosphorylated STAT3 immunoblotting using both monocytes and DC co-cultured with MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006846-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). Hence, using these specific conditions (i.e. 1 h pre-treatment prior to stimulation) we could discriminate between the soluble factor- and contact- dependent STAT3 activating pathways. These results further support that in tumor-APC interaction there is a contact-dependent activation of STAT3 in APC, that unlike the parallel cytokine-mediated pathway, is sensitive to JSI-124 inhibition (as is the case with hMSC-APC co-cultures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-GurWahnon1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0006846-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006846.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>JSI-124 inhibits IL-10 production induced by cell:cell contact but not by tumor cell's conditioned media.</title><p>Monocytes were either left untreated or treated with JSI-124 (10 &#x000b5;M) for 1 hour at 37&#x000b0;C, and then washed.

To test this, DCs were co-cultured with either MCF-7 cells or hMSC or alternatively treated with IL-10 for 24 h followed by examination of maturation markers by flow cytometry. Since MCF-7 cells induce STAT3 activation through both soluble factors and cell-cell contact, hMSC were included in this experiment given that their induction of STAT3 activity is solely dependent on cell-cell contact. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006846-g007">figure 7</xref>, hMSC co-culturing had only a slight and statistically insignificant effect on the levels of HLA-DR and CD86 expression, while the levels of CD80 and CCR7 expression were significantly elevated (P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.007 and P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.003, respectively) compared to DCs single cultures.

As expected, DC-MCF-7 co-cultures resulted in an intermediate phenotype between that observed in DC-hMSC co-cultures or in DCs treated with IL-10. This is consistent with the findings that MCF-7 cells can induce both soluble- and contact-dependent pathways in parallel.

Specifically, hMSC inhibited T-cell activation only upon addition of APCs (DC or monocytes) to the co-culture. The immunoregulatory properties acquired by these APCs upon contact included induction of IL-10 secretion together with reduction in TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-12 secretion by the APCs and inhibition of IFN-&#x003b3; secretion and proliferation of T-cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-Beyth1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. In order to determine whether the contact-dependent mechanism converts the APCs into what is effectively a &#x0201c;deletional or inhibitory APC&#x0201d; with active immunoregulatory properties, as opposed to simply being activation incompetent, we examined the ability of these cell-contact conditioned APC to actively suppress T cell activation. In these experiments T cells were activated with anti-CD3 coated beads and soluble anti-CD28 that can stimulate T cells in the absence of any APCs and placed in the upper chamber of a transwell. Monocytes alone or in contact with hMSC were placed in the bottom chamber (to avoid contact between the monocytes and T cells that can contribute to T cell activation) and their effect on bead-stimulated T cell activation was determined by IFN-&#x003b3; secretion. Here again hMSC were used and not cancer cells in-order to determine the exclusive contribution of the contact depended effect and to avoid the additional effect of soluble factor secreted by the cancer cells over the 72 h period.

One way is by influencing APCs within the tumor bed rendering them tolerogenic. Recent studies have shown that tumors secrete factors that inhibit DCs maturation through activation of STAT3 in DCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-Yu1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Here we show that in addition to releasing soluble factors, tumor cells, physically interact with APCs, consequently inducing the activation of STAT3. This induction results in APCs with a distinct phenotype, which are capable of inhibiting T-cell activation. Thus, tumor cells have at least two pathways by which they can alter APCs maturation and function. The first, described previously, is mediated by tumor-derived factors such as VEGF and IL-10, that promote the generation of immature DCs that lack the T cell stimulatory activity characteristic of mature DCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-Yu1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. The second pathway, demonstrated in this study, is a novel cell contact induced and JAK2-dependent pathway that generates tolerogenic DCs with a distinct altered-mature phenotype that actively suppress T-cell activation. Hence, although the two pathways converge on activation of STAT3 they subsequently diverge in their downstream effect on APC phenotype.</p><p>In the current study, by simply washing the cells just prior to adding the APC we eliminated the contribution of tumor-secreted factors, thereby revealing the contact-dependent activation of STAT3. Second, we found that the cell contact-dependent pathway is sensitive to treatment with the JAK2 inhibitor JSI-124, distinguishing it from the soluble factor pathway. Third, phosphorylation of JAK2 and physical interactions between JAK2 and phosphorylated-STAT3 are contact dependent. These findings suggest that these are two distinct mechanisms for STAT3 activation that differ in their signaling pathways.</p><p>Besides cytokines and their receptors, STATs can be activated by other means, for example by growth factor receptors, such as EGF, PDGF, and CSF-1, which all possess an intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-Calo1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, as well as by non-receptor tyrosine kinases such as Src and Abl, and through serpentine receptors such as those for angiotensin II, serotonin, and &#x003b1;-melatonin stimulating hormone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-Bromberg1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-Rane1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, we have previously demonstrated, the induction of STAT3 signaling in APCs upon cell contact with hMSC, suggesting a new pathway for activating STAT3 in APCs. In a different setting, contact-dependent activation of STAT3 has been also demonstrated in normal and cancer breast cells. A study by Vultur et. al. showed a dramatic increase in STAT3 phosphorylation and consequently STAT3 activity with cell density in normal cells. This confluence-dependent activation was eliminated if cell-cell interactions were interrupted through calcium chelation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-Vultur1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. The contact dependent activation of STAT3 described by Vulture et.al may be due to a mechanism similar to the one we describe here for a heterologous interaction between APCs and their cellular environment, suggesting that a contact dependent activation of STAT3 may be a more general mechanism. Taken together, one can speculate the existence of yet unknown surface molecules participating in intercellular contact that are dependent on JAK2 for their activity. The finding of such surface molecules requires further investigation.</p><p>DCs play a key role in the initiation and regulation of the immune response, and their ability to initiate immune reaction or induce tolerance is strictly dependent on their maturation state and phenotype. While immature DCs can induce T-cell anergy, mature DCs activate T cells and induce immunity. Nonetheless, it has also been reported that DCs may exist in a semi-mature state in which they are capable of actively inhibiting T cell activity, generating regulatory T-cell and promoting tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-Lutz1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. In this report, we found that contact-dependent activation of STAT3 induced the generation of functionally regulatory DCs with a seemingly semi-mature or aberrantly-mature phenotype, whereas IL-10 treatment resulted in DCs that express low levels of costimulatory molecules and HLA-DR, consistent with an immature phenotype. This data is in agreement with previous studies that described DCs with regulatory function that varied in their maturation phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-Sato1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-Sato2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-Steinman1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Among these are two reports describing the generation of regulatory DCs originating from mature cells rather than from immature cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-Yu1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-Zhang1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, it seems that the hallmark of regulatory DCs is their ability to functionally inhibit lymphocyte activation rather than their specific phenotype and maturation stage. In agreement with this notion, we further demonstrated that despite the different phenotypic outcomes, both IL-10 and cell-cell contact induced the expression of the inhibitory receptors Immunoglobulin like transcript (ILT) 3 and 4, which are characteristic of regulatory DCs, and play a role in their T cell inhibitory activity. Hence, ILT3 and ILT4 expression may account for the inhibitory activity of these cells regardless of their overall phenotype.</p><p>In response to an inflammatory stimuli, DCs up-regulate the expression of the chemokine receptor, CCR7 and migrate from peripheral tissues to secondary lymphoid organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-Yanagihara1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. While this event is usually linked to the process of DC's maturation, a previous study has demonstrated that after exposure to apoptotic cells DCs up-regulated CCR7 expression despite the absence of maturation properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-Verbovetski1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence, the authors further speculated that CCR7-expressing immature DCs that ingested apoptotic material may migrate to peripheral lymph nodes, in order to maintain tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-Verbovetski1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. In our study we show that contact-dependent induced regulatory DCs up-regulate the expression of CCR7 thereby enabling these DCs to migrate to lymphoid tissues where they may induce tolerance. Notably, CCR7 is induced only by the contact-dependent mechanism and not by soluble factors, further emphasizing the potential importance of the contact-dependent mechanism in tolerance induction, such as in the case of tumors.</p><p>In the context of cancer, modulating APCs in a contact-dependent manner may be of special significance in the pre-malignant stage. Physiologically, tumors arise sporadically and between the initiating oncogenic event and tumor progression there might be a long pre-malignant stage. However, data concerning the interaction between tumor cells and the immune system was obtained from models in which the host was exposed to a large number of cells at a single time point. A recent study by Willimsky et.al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006846-Willimsky1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, has addressed the question of immunogenicity of pre-malignant lesions, by using a transgenic mouse model for sporadic cancer. The authors of this study concluded that tolerance occurs already at the pre-malignant stage, before tumor progression. Specifically, they showed the accumulation of immature myeloid cells at the pre-malignant stage, and suggest they play a role in creating T-cell unresponsiveness. Given our results, one may speculate that at the pre-malignant stage physical interactions between resident APCs and tumor cells that activate STAT3 play a significant role in tumor escape, long before tumors are visible and large enough to secrete significant amounts of APCs-modulating factors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cells</title><p>Cells were purified from the venous blood of healthy donors.
