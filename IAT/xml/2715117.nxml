We show that autocrine production of netrin-1, a multifunctional laminin-related molecule, conveys a selective advantage in tumor growth and dissemination in aggressive NB, as it blocks the proapoptotic activity of the UNC5H netrin-1 dependence receptors. We show that such netrin-1 up-regulation is a potential marker for poor prognosis in stage 4S and, more generally, in NB stage 4 diagnosed infants. Moreover, we propose that interference with the netrin-1 autocrine loop in malignant neuroblasts could represent an alternative therapeutic strategy, as disruption of this loop triggers in vitro NB cell death and inhibits NB metastasis in avian and mouse models.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Dependence receptors now number more than a dozen, including deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>), UNC5H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>), Patched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>), some integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>), neogenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>), p75<sup>NTR</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>), RET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>), ALK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>), and TrkC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Although they have no structural homology (other than possibly in a domain referred to as the DART [dependence-associated receptor transmembrane] domain) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>), they all share the functional property of inducing cell death when disengaged from their trophic ligands, whereas the presence of their trophic ligands blocks this proapoptotic activity. Such receptors thus create cellular states of dependence on their respective ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>).</p><p>The prototype dependence receptors are the netrin-1 receptors. Netrin-1, a diffusible laminin-related protein, has been shown to play a major role in the control of neuronal navigation during the development of the nervous system by interacting with its main receptors, DCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>) and UNC5H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). However, DCC and UNC5H (i.e., UNC5H1, UNC5H2, UNC5H3, and UNC5H4) have been shown to belong to the dependence receptor family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). This dependence effect upon netrin-1 has been suggested to act as a mechanism for eliminating tumor cells that would develop in settings of ligand unavailability (for reviews see references <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). Along this line, disruption of the proapoptotic signaling of these netrin-1 receptors in the gastrointestinal tracts of mice, by netrin-1 overexpression or by inactivation of UNC5H3, is associated with intestinal tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>).</p><p>Thus, loss of the dependence receptors' proapoptotic activity represents a selective advantage for tumor cells. In this respect, DCC was proposed in the early 1990s to function as a tumor suppressor gene, whose expression is lost in the vast majority of human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). This hypothesis also fits with the observation that UNC5H genes are down-regulated in most colorectal tumors, hence suggesting that loss of UNC5H genes represents a selective advantage for tumor development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). We have analyzed expression of netrin-1 and its receptors in neuroblastoma (NB), the most frequent extracranial solid tumor of early childhood. The aggressive and metastatic stage 4 NB displays three distinct clinical patterns at presentation and dissemination sites based on patients' ages. Indeed, neonates and infants (&#x0003c;1 yr of age) with stage 4S and stage 4 without 4S features have an overall good prognosis, whereas stage 4 in children (&#x0003e;1 yr of age) shows a poor prognosis. We describe in this paper that, rather than the loss of netrin-1 receptor expression, a large fraction of aggressive NBs has evolved to select a gain of ligand expression that apparently represents a similar selective growth advantage. We therefore propose to use disruption of this selective advantage as an anticancer strategy in NB.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Netrin-1 is up-regulated in a large fraction of aggressive NB</title><p>We focused on stage 4 NB with a specific interest in comparing netrin-1 and its receptors' expression levels between the three distinct clinical patterns of stage 4, based on disease distribution and age of the patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). On the one hand, there are the neonates and infants (&#x0003c;1 yr of age) with stage 4S (2&#x02013;5% of all NB) and the similarly young stage 4 without 4S features, hereafter termed [1yr<sup>&#x02212;</sup>] stage 4, who make up 10% of the NB population. On the other hand, there are the stage 4 children (&#x0003e;1 yr of age), comprising 45% of all NBs, who will hereafter be termed [1yr <sup>+</sup>] stage 4. These three clinical aspects of stage 4 NB differ in their respective malignant behaviors and associated prognoses: good for stage 4S and [1yr <sup>&#x02212;</sup>] stage 4 (5-yr event-free survival &#x0003e;80%), and dismal for [1yr <sup>+</sup>] stage 4 (5-yr event-free survival of &#x0223c;30%) despite intensive treatment including high-dose chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>).</p><p>We first analyzed the expression of netrin-1 and its dependence receptors, DCC, UNC5H1, UNC5H2, UNC5H3, and UNC5H4, by quantitative RT-PCR (Q-RT-PCR) in a panel of 102 stage 4 NB tumors including 24 stage 4S and 12 [1yr<sup>&#x02212;</sup>] stage 4. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, netrin-1 is up-regulated in [1yr<sup>+</sup>] stage 4 as compared with both stage 4S (P &#x0003c; 0.05) and [1yr<sup>&#x02212;</sup>] stage 4 (P &#x0003c; 0.01). Similar results were obtained when comparing netrin-1 protein level by immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref> and quantification in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082299/DC1">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>). Interestingly, netrin-1 is detected mainly in tumor cells and is barely detected in stroma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref> and Fig. S1 B). Conversely, netrin-1 dependence receptor expression analysis showed that DCC was only weakly expressed in the different stage 4 NB (Fig. S1 C) as reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>), whereas UNC5H1, UNC5H2, UNC5H3, and UNC5H4 expression showed no significant differences when comparing [1yr<sup>&#x02212;</sup>] versus [1yr<sup>+</sup>] stage 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). However, we observed that the different UNC5H receptors are up-regulated specifically in stage 4S (mean increase in UNC5H expression in stage 4S vs. other stage 4 NBs: 2.98-fold, P &#x0003c; 0.007), suggesting UNC5H receptors as hallmarks of stage 4S NB. The UNC5H1 and UNC5H4, which show the highest messenger RNA (mRNA) expression, could also be seen at the protein level by immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Netrin-1 up-regulation is detected in aggressive NB.</bold> (A) Netrin-1 mRNA levels in 102 stage 4S (<italic>n</italic> = 24), [1yr <sup>&#x02212;</sup>] stage 4 (<italic>n</italic> = 12), and [1yr<sup>+</sup>] stage 4 (<italic>n</italic>= 66) NBs measured by Q-RT-PCR.

Data are presented as in E, with a panel of 30 infants bearing NB.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JEM_20082299_RGB_Fig1"/></fig><p>In an attempt to correlate netrin-1 up-regulation with the molecular signature of these tumors, we compared netrin-1 up-regulation and DCC/UNC5H1 levels to the profile of gene expression performed in a small panel of nine stage 4 NBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). We failed to detect any correlation between netrin-1 up-regulation or DCC/UNC5H1 levels with the molecular signature of apoptosis or invasion effectors (Fig. S1 D). Considering patients' outcomes, although 38% of [1yr<sup>+</sup>] stage 4 NBs have selected up-regulation of netrin-1, this event failed to be significantly associated with poor outcome in this aggressive form of the disease (unpublished data). Moreover no association between netrin-1 up-regulation and <italic>MYCN</italic> amplification (MNA) was detected (unpublished data). Thus, netrin-1 up-regulation may be considered as an additional component of the genetic complexity that these tumors display.</p><p>Despite a largely favorable prognosis among infants with stage 4 NB (i.e, stage 4S and [1yr<sup>&#x02212;</sup>] stage 4) with no MNA, many succumb to the disease. Thus, we assessed whether netrin-1 expression may serve as a prognostic marker for the infants with stage 4 NB. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>, the overall survival of infants with stage 4S differed markedly based on whether the tumor displayed high levels of netrin-1 expression (netrin-1 high) or low-level expression (netrin-1 low), with the netrin-1 expression threshold being its median expression value in the 102 cases. Indeed, although 100% of the infants survived after 10 yr (including 1 MNA out of 17), when the NB 4S was netrin-1 low, the 5-yr overall survival was only 46% when the NB 4S was netrin-1 high (P = 0.0109). Furthermore, 43% of the non-MNA patients with high-level netrin-1 expression died. More generally, when a similar overall survival analysis was performed on all infants with stage 4 NB (i.e, stage 4S and [1yr<sup>&#x02212;</sup>] stage 4), a similar dichotomy was observed. Indeed, 5-yr overall survival was found to be 90% for the netrin-1&#x02013;low infants yet only 48% for netrin-1&#x02013;high infants (P = 0.032; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>). These data suggest that netrin-1 is a potential prognostic marker for aggressiveness in stage 4 NB diagnosed in infants. Whether or not it constitutes an independent prognostic marker of stage 4 NB in neonates and infants deserves to be tested in a larger patient cohort. Nevertheless, these data indicate that a netrin-1 threshold may turn as an alternative determinant for the biological behavior of stage 4 NB in infants, potentially suggesting its involvement in a cell death process of very early childhood neuroblasts, reminiscent of that operating during nervous system development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>).</p><p>Netrin-1 high expression is not only detected in 38% of [1yr<sup>+</sup>] stage 4 and in poor outcome [1yr<sup>&#x02212;</sup>] stage 4 primary NB tumors but also in a fraction of NB cell lines mainly derived from stage 4 tumor material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082299/DC1">Fig. S2 A</ext-link>). Two human NB cell lines, IMR32 (netrin-1 high) and CLB-Ge2 (netrin-1 low), were evaluated further. In spite of a marked difference in netrin-1 and DCC expression, the UNC5H levels are similar in IMR32 and CLB-Ge2 cells; UNC5H1, UNC5H3, and UNC5H4 show the highest expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Specifically, UNC5H1, UNC5H3, and UNC5H4 proteins could be detected at the plasma membrane by confocal analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). To test the hypothesis that the high netrin-1 mRNA levels detected in IMR32 cells are associated with an autocrine netrin-1 production, we next performed netrin-1 immunohistochemistry on IMR32 and CLB-Ge2 cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>, a netrin-1&#x02013;specific membrane staining was detected in a homogeneous pattern in IMR32 cells, whereas no specific staining was detected for CLB-Ge2 cells. Confocal analysis further confirmed the presence of netrin-1 at the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref> and Fig. S2 B). To further analyze whether netrin-1 is secreted from IMR32 cells, netrin-1 ELISA assay was used to detect netrin-1 in the conditioned medium. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 F</xref>, 11.7 ng/ml netrin-1 was recovered from the conditioned medium of IMR32 cells, whereas no netrin-1 was detected from the conditioned medium of CLB-Ge2 cells. Thus, together these data suggest that the high netrin-1 content observed in aggressive NB could result from an autocrine expression of netrin-1 in NB cells.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Netrin-1 up-regulation is detected in NB cell lines.</bold> (A) Netrin-1 expression measured by Q-RT-PCR in a panel of 28 NB cell lines.

Although scramble siRNA failed to affect IMR32 cell survival, as measured by trypan blue exclusion, netrin-1 siRNA treatment was associated with IMR32 cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). In contrast, CLB-Ge2 cell survival was unaffected after netrin-1 siRNA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). To determine whether this increase in cell death was in part caused by an increase in apoptotic cell death, caspase-3 activity was measured in response to netrin-1 siRNA treatment.

We recently reported that the fifth fibronectin type III domain of DCC (DCC-5Fbn; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>), which is located in the DCC ectodomain, interacts with netrin-1 and blocks the ability of netrin-1 to trigger multimerization of DCC and UNC5H receptors. Because multimerization inhibits DCC or UNC5H-induced cell death (unpublished data), DCC-5Fbn antagonizes netrin-1 function, disrupting netrin-1&#x02013;mediated inhibition of DCC/UNC5H proapoptotic activity. Thus, DCC-5Fbn acts as a trap for netrin-1 survival function. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 (B&#x02013;D)</xref>, the addition of DCC-5Fbn, but not the unrelated protein IL3R, triggered IMR32 apoptotic cell death as measured by trypan blue exclusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>), caspase-3 activity assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>), and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase&#x02013;mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>).

IMR32 cells were transfected with either a dominant-negative mutant for DCC (DN-DCC) or UNC5H (DN-UNC5H) proapoptotic activity. These dominant-negative mutants of dependence receptors actually encode the intracellular domain of these receptors mutated in their caspase cleavage sites, and these mutants have been shown both in vitro and in vivo to specifically block the proapoptotic activity of their wild-type counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). Cell death was then analyzed after netrin-1 inhibition by siRNA. Although DN-DCC expression failed to inhibit netrin-1 siRNA-induced IMR32 cell death, expression of DN-UNC5H rendered IMR32 cells resistant to netrin-1 siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>). To more formally exclude the role in this death process of DCC or of altered forms of DCC that are known to be expressed in IMR32 cells (Fig. S2 C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>), DCC was down-regulated by a siRNA approach and cell death was induced via netrin-1 siRNA. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>, DCC siRNA had no effect on cell death per se and failed to inhibit netrin-1 siRNA-induced caspase-3 activation, strengthening the perception that in these cells DCC is not proapoptotic.

None of the single UNC5H siRNAs was sufficient to inhibit netrin-1 siRNA-mediated IMR32 cell apoptosis, suggesting some redundancy in UNC5H-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>). However, when combinations of siRNAs were used, we observed that combined silencing of the four UNC5H receptors was sufficient to fully inhibit the death triggered by netrin-1 autocrine loop disruption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>), whereas the same combination of siRNAs had no effect on CLB-Ge2 cell survival (Fig. S3 D). The respective importance of UNC5H receptors in netrin-1 siRNA-induced cell death was then assessed by the different combination of two or three siRNAs; the combination of UNC5H1, UNC5H3, and UNC5H4 siRNAs was the only one to fully block cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 E</xref>). Thus, in agreement with the level of UNC5H receptors expressed in IMR32 cells, it appears that disruption of the netrin-1 autocrine survival loop triggers UNC5H-induced cell death. Moreover, UNC5H1, UNC5H3, and UNC5H4 are the receptors involved in this proapoptotic effect.</p><p>Furthermore, in IMR32 cells, the proapoptotic serine threonine kinase DAP kinase (DAPK), which is shown to be required for UNC5H-induced cell death, exhibited a loss of its inhibitory autophosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>) upon DCC-5Fbn treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 F</xref>) or netrin-1 siRNA transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 G</xref>). Accordingly, autophosphorylation was restored by a treatment with excess netrin-1 or by a combination of UNC5H1, UNC5H3, and UNC5H4 siRNAs. Moreover, the transfection of the antiapoptotic protein BCL-2 was sufficient to inhibit netrin-1 siRNA-induced cell death but did not inhibit DAPK dephosphorylation, hence suggesting that DAPK activation is not a result of cell death but is specifically engaged by UNC5H after netrin-1 inhibition (unpublished data).</p></sec><sec><title>Interference with netrin-1 inhibits NB progression and dissemination</title><p>We next assessed whether in vivo modulation of netrin-1 could be used to limit/inhibit NB progression and dissemination. An elegant chicken model has been developed in which graft of NB cells in the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of 10-d-old chick embryos recapitulates both tumor growth at a primary site, i.e., within the CAM, and tumor invasion and dissemination at a secondary site, metastasis to the lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>). In a first approach, IMR32 or CLB-Ge2 cells were loaded in 10-d-old CAM and embryos were treated on days 11 and 14 with PBS or DCC-5Fbn. 17-d-old chicks were then analyzed for primary tumor growth and metastasis to the lung. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 (B and C)</xref>, specifically in CAMs grafted with IMR32 but not with CLB-Ge2 cells, DCC-5Fbn significantly reduced primary tumor size. This size reduction was associated with increased tumor apoptosis, as shown by an increased caspase-3 activity in the tumor lysate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>). More importantly, DCC-5Fbn also reduced lung metastasis formation, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 E</xref>.

It is of interest that although the parental IGR-N-91 and the cell line derived from the PTX show no or very low netrin-1 expression, the different cell lines derived from secondary localizations showed a marked expression of netrin-1 both at the RNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>) and at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref>). When cell death was investigated in these different cell lines upon treatment with DCC-5Fbn, a direct correlation was observed between the level of netrin-1 and cell susceptibility to DCC-5Fbn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 C</xref>). Specifically, although PTX cells failed to undergo cell death upon DCC-5Fbn treatment, this treatment triggered netrin-1&#x02013;high Myoc cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 C</xref>). This observation supports the overall view that gaining netrin-1 dependence receptor resistance, via an autocrine netrin-1 expression in the case of the IGR-N-91 model, likely promotes NB tumor cell survival outside of the primary tumor site.

This elevated netrin-1 level likely confers a selective advantage acquired by the cancer cell to escape netrin-1 dependence receptor&#x02013;induced apoptosis and, consequently, to survive in settings of environmental absence or limitation of netrin-1. It is therefore interesting to note that not only NB but also other neoplasms associated with poor prognosis, for example, metastatic breast cancer and pancreatic cancer, also express high levels of netrin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>), suggesting that netrin-1 up-regulation may be a common feature for several aggressive cancers. From a mechanistic point of view, in a large fraction of NB, this autocrine expression of netrin-1 probably inhibits UNC5H-induced cell death. However, because DCC has been shown to display reduced expression in NB and because this reduction has been associated with NB aggressiveness in human NB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that netrin-1 up-regulation can also, in some NB, inhibit DCC-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, this netrin-1 up-regulation appears to block a death signal involving the serine threonine DAPK, whose activity is regulated via its autophosphorylation. It is therefore of interest to note that DAPK was described to be a negative regulator of tumor progression and, more specifically, of metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). Thus, it can be suggested that a fraction of low netrin-1&#x02013;expressing NB may have selected a loss of function of DAPK for survival. This would be compatible with the finding that metastasis in NB is associated with a loss of caspase-8, a selective advantage which provides survival to NB cells by inhibiting the proapoptotic signaling of the dependence receptor integrin &#x003b1;3&#x003b2;1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>).</p><p>It is then interesting to wonder why such a large fraction of aggressive NBs have selected a gain of netrin-1 rather than a loss of the netrin-1 dependence receptor death pathways. A possible explanation is that netrin-1 expression not only confers a gain in survival, but may also lead to enhancement of nonapoptotic signaling mediated by netrin-1 receptors. Netrin-1 was indeed shown to bind a complex that includes some integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). These integrins regulate cell migration and invasiveness and, thus, may play a role in cancer progression. Netrin-1 was also proposed to play a role in angiogenesis, although whether netrin-1 is proangiogenic or antiangiogenic is controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>) and this effect on angiogenesis may increase NB metastases development. It is also of interest to note that NB is a complex disease that originates from migrating neural crest cells. Netrin-1 up-regulation may then be implicated in the main function played by netrin-1 during nervous system development that is neuronal navigation. Along this line, netrin-1 and DCC have been shown to play an important role during neural crest cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>), and it is then tempting to suggest that the gain in netrin-1 expression also promotes NB cell migration.</p><p>As different types of stage 4 NBs are distinguished, not only by the age of the children but also by the tissues in which metastases are found, one may wonder about the implication of netrin-1 produced in the normal tissues in which the tumor cells spread, and this would be interesting to explore. In particular, it would be interesting to evaluate whether, according to the classical &#x0201c;seed and soil&#x0201d; theory for metastasis (for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>), netrin-1 expression in specific tissues may favor metastasis development more specifically in these tissues. It is also intriguing to note that others have shown that in some particular cell lines, netrin-1 is able to promote apoptosis rather than inhibit apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>), so that the view of netrin-1 up-regulation being only a survival-selective advantage to block apoptosis via dependence receptors is probably only part of the overall regulatory mechanisms that links NB, netrin-1, and its receptors.</p><p>The observation that low levels of netrin-1 in NB correlate with good outcome is of clinical interest, in particular in NB diagnosed in neonates and infants. Indeed, low netrin-1 expression predicts long-term survival in infants (100% in 4S stage and 90% in infants in general) in a type of pathology in which therapeutic management is highly dependent on presentation and MNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>). This is particularly true with stage 4S infants who receive no (or minimal) treatment based on the lack of MNA, even though current statistics show that 1 in 10 of these infants will eventually die of NB. In this paper, we propose that determination of low netrin-1 level confirms a good prognosis for these infants without therapy, whereas the infants with high netrin-1 expression should be considered for more intensive treatment. Regarding infants or children with high netrin-1&#x02013;expressing NB tumors, an alternative or supplementary targeted treatment based on disruption of the netrin-1 autocrine survival loop may improve standard high-dose chemotherapy regimen efficiency. We propose that a treatment based on inhibition of the interaction between netrin-1 and its dependence receptors, or inhibition of the ability of netrin-1 to multimerize its receptors, could potentially improve the survival of a large fraction of the patients suffering from aggressive NB. Moreover, it is interesting to note that no correlation between netrin-1 up-regulation and molecular signature of apoptosis and invasion was observed in NB tumors (Fig. S1 D), strengthening the case for netrin-1 as an original target for NB. Future preclinical and clinical studies should assess whether such therapeutic strategies, which could include small molecules (drugs), monoclonal antibodies, or the DCC-5Fbn recombinant protein presented in this paper, used alone or in combination with standard chemotherapy, could be of therapeutic benefit for infants and children with NB.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Cell lines, transfection procedure, and reagents.</title><p>Human NB cell lines were obtained from the tumor banks at Centre L&#x000e9;on B&#x000e9;rard and at Institut Gustave Roussy.

Tessier-Lavigne (Genentech, San Francisco, CA), K.L. Guan (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI), and N. Yamamoto (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). Human netrin-1&#x02013;encoding plasmid (peak8-hNTN1-His) was obtained from D.E. Bredesen (The Buck Institute for Age Research, Novato, CA). Ps974-DCC-5Fbn allowing bacterial expression of the fifth fibronectin type III domain of DCC was obtained by inserting a Pst1&#x02013;BamH1 DNA fragment generated by PCR using pDCC-CMV-S as a template. DCC-5Fbn production was performed using a standard procedure. In brief, BL21 cells were forced to express DCC-5Fbn in response to imidazole, and the BL21 lysate was subjected to affinity chromatography using FLAG-Sepharose (Sigma-Aldrich). A peptide corresponding to the ectodomain of IL3R was produced in the same conditions and used as a control. For cell culture use, netrin-1, DCC, and neogenin siRNAs (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were designed as a pool of three target-specific 20&#x02013;25-nt siRNAs.
