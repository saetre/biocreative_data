Depending on the parasite species, and on the genetic and immunological composition of the host, the clinical form can range from self-healing cutaneous lesions to severe visceralizing disease. The parasites enter mammalian hosts through the bite of sandflies, and replicate intracellularly as amastigotes. Although macrophages are considered the major host cell type for <italic>Leishmania</italic>, fibroblasts also harbor parasites and are thought to play an important role during latent infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000179-Bogdan1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>). In both macrophages and fibroblasts, intracellular amastigotes replicate within parasitophorous vacuoles (PV) that share several properties with late endosomes/lysosomes, including low luminal pH and the presence of lysosome-specific membrane proteins and acidic hydrolases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000179-Antoine1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000179-Morehead1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>An important question in the study of <italic>Leishmania</italic> pathogenesis is how parasites persist indefinitely in the host, even after the development of immunity to reinfection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000179-Sacks1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Their exclusively intracellular life style suggests that amastigotes possess mechanisms to avoid killing by the abundant microbicidal products produced by activated host cells. The mechanisms of <italic>in vivo</italic> persistence are of particular interest in relation to <italic>L. amazonensis</italic>, a species that causes cutaneous leishmaniasis in the new world. Several lines of evidence indicate that <italic>L. amazonensis</italic> is particularly adept at surviving intracellular killing mechanisms, when compared to other <italic>Leishmania</italic> species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000179-Gomes1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000179-McMahonPratt1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, the morphology of the PVs harboring <italic>L. amazonensis</italic> amastigotes (and other species from the <italic>L. mexicana</italic> complex) also differs dramatically from PVs containing other <italic>Leishmania</italic> species, such as <italic>L. major</italic> and <italic>L. donovani</italic>. Amastigotes of <italic>L. mexicana</italic> and <italic>L. amazonensis</italic> replicate within very large, communal PVs that continuously undergo fusion with lysosomes and phagolysosomes. In contrast, PVs containing <italic>L. major</italic> and <italic>L. donovani</italic> amastigotes partition as the parasites replicate, resulting in small compartments containing only one parasite per vacuole <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000179-Antoine1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000179-Veras1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.
