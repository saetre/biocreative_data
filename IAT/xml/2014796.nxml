However, its mechanism of action remains poorly defined. In this study, we demonstrate that HMBA activates transiently the PI3K/Akt pathway, which leads to the phosphorylation of HEXIM1 and the subsequent release of active positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) from its transcriptionally inactive complex with HEXIM1 and 7SK small nuclear RNA (snRNA). As a result, P-TEFb is recruited to the HIV promoter to stimulate transcription elongation and viral production. Despite the continuous presence of HMBA, the released P-TEFb reassembles rapidly with 7SK snRNA and HEXIM1. In contrast, a mutant HEXIM1 protein that cannot be phosphorylated and released from P-TEFb and 7SK snRNA via the PI3K/Akt pathway antagonizes this HMBA-mediated induction of viral production. Thus, our studies reveal how HIV transcription is induced by HMBA and suggest how modifications in the equilibrium between active and inactive P-TEFb could contribute to cell differentiation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>The reservoir of HIV in infected people remains an insurmountable problem in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy. Thus, the virus persists despite the best possible treatment. HIV hides in many cells and tissues, where its genome is not expressed. Thus, neither drugs nor the immune system can eradicate it from the body. One hope is to activate the production of HIV in these reservoirs in the presence of optimal treatment. Strategies aimed at activating hematopoetic cells and thus viral replication have been tried and failed. In this report, we targeted a specific host transcriptional complex that is essential for the transcription of HIV genome. Its activation should not lead to generalized stimulation of the immune system. Indeed, paradoxically, hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) and related compounds lead to cellular differentiation and apoptosis. By studying properties of these differentiation agents, we discovered that they activate transiently transcription of HIV, be it in stable cell lines or in primary infected cells. Thus, compounds related to HMBA, some of which have now been approved for clinical use, could be tried to diminish or eliminate the reservoir of HIV in optimally treated infected individuals.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Contreras X, Barboric M, Lenasi T, Peterlin BM (2007) HMBA releases P-TEFb from HEXIM1 and 7SK snRNA via PI3K/Akt and activates HIV transcription.

Indeed, the viral loads can be lowered to undetectable levels in peripheral blood of HIV-infected individuals with this treatment.

Indeed, these cells harbor integrated proviral genomes, which are insensitive to HAART and can be reactivated upon treatment interruption.

Reactivating viral replication should render HIV susceptible to HAART and immune elimination.

This activation occurs at the level of transcription and is independent of NF-&#x003ba;B but requires Sp1-binding sites in the HIV promoter &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030146-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. However, the mechanism by which HMBA induces HIV transcription remains unknown. One possible mechanism could involve increased DNA accessibility and induction of nucleosome remodeling &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030146-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. However, HMBA neither inhibits HDACs nor increases histone acetylation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030146-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. Alternatively, HMBA could mediate its effects on viral transcription via the activation of cellular kinases. Indeed, PKC and calcium pathways are activated by HMBA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030146-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), a bipolar compound that is structurally similar to HMBA, activates Akt &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030146-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030146-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;.

Besides the LC, P-TEFb, which is composed of cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (Cdk9) and cyclin T1 (CycT1), predominantly binds Brd4 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030146-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030146-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d; or is in a free heterodimeric form (small complex &#x0005b;SC&#x0005d;). As such, P-TEFb is transcriptionally active and can be recruited to the HIV promoter to stimulate viral transcription elongation by phosphorylating the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and negative transcription elongation factors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030146-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030146-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, the exposure of cells to HMBA leads to two seemingly opposite phenotypes, the induction of HIV transcription and increased levels of HEXIM1 and HEXIM2. However, it is possible that these events do not occur simultaneously. Indeed, the partitioning of P-TEFb into inactive and active complexes is dynamic, and several stress-inducing agents disrupt the LC and result in the release of P-TEFb &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030146-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030146-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030146-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. Of note, in the course of our studies, it was demonstrated that HMBA also disrupts the LC, which resulted in cellular differentiation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030146-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. However, the nature of this disruption remains unknown.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which HMBA induces viral production. We found that HMBA activates Akt transiently via the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), leading to the concomitant disruption of the LC and the recruitment of P-TEFb to the HIV promoter. Importantly, the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway in chronically infected cell lines or the expression of a mutant HEXIM1 protein that could not be phosphorylated by Akt, and was resistant to HMBA-mediated disruption of the LC, antagonized the induction of HIV transcription by HMBA. Thus, our studies reveal how HMBA releases P-TEFb to reactivate viral production from latency.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>HMBA Induces Viral Production in Chronically Infected Cell Lines and Resting CD4&#x0002b; T Cells</title><p>Since chronically infected U1 (monocytic lineage), ACH-2, and J&#x00394;K (lymphocytic lineages) cells represent model systems for proviral latency in the host, we first examined effects of HMBA on the production of HIV particles in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030146-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Cells were stimulated with increasing concentrations of HMBA and the release of viral particles was measured by p24 ELISA after 24 h in their supernatants. As expected, HMBA induced viral production in a dose-dependent manner in all cells examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030146-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). At the optimal concentration of HMBA, viral production in U1, ACH-2, and J&#x00394;K cells increased by 135-, 25-, and 220-fold, respectively. Since viral production increased the most in J&#x00394;K cells that bear an integrated HIV genome lacking two NF-&#x003ba;B binding sites, this stimulatory effect of HMBA did not depend on NF-&#x003ba;B. At higher concentrations, HMBA was less efficient at inducing viral production, most likely due to its pronounced cytotoxic effects as determined by trypan blue staining and FACS analyses (not shown). In addition, HMBA induced an increase of the luciferase activity from HeLa cells that contained an integrated luciferase gene under the control of the HIV promoter (not shown). We conclude that HMBA induces viral production in chronically infected cell lines, most likely through an NF-kB-independent activation of HIV transcription.</p><fig id="ppat-0030146-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>HMBA Transiently Disrupts the LC</title><p>(A) U1, Ach-2, and J&#x00394;K cells were stimulated with increasing concentrations of HMBA (1, 5, 10, and 20 mM) and viral production was assessed at 48 h in the supernatant using p24 ELISA.</p><p>(B) Resting CD4&#x0002b; T cells, which were isolated from PBMCs that were infected with HIV-1<sub>LAI</sub> and rested for 11 d were treated or not with HMBA (1 mM) for 3 d.

Next, resting CD4&#x0002b; T cells were isolated using anti-CD4 magnetic beads and washed extensively. By FACS, these cells expressed neither CD25 nor HLA-DR (not shown). Before the addition of HMBA, we observed few if any viral particles in the supernatants of these selected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030146-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, control). In contrast, in the presence of HMBA, levels of p24 increased 7-fold in their supernatants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030146-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, HMBA). Thus, HMBA also activates viral production in resting CD4&#x0002b; T cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>HMBA Disrupts Transiently the LC</title><p>Previous studies established that HMBA activates HIV transcription &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030146-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030146-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030146-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. Moreover, HIV gene expression depends critically on the kinase activity of P-TEFb &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030146-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. Finally, HMBA induces the expression of HEXIM1 and HEXIM2, which together with 7SK snRNA inhibit P-TEFb in the LC &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030146-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, HMBA could disrupt the LC, albeit transiently, to activate P-TEFb for the stimulation of HIV transcription. Therefore, we analyzed the LC and SC by glycerol gradient sedimentation analyses with anti-HEXIM1, HEXIM2, and P-TEFb antibodies at various times in Jurkat cells that were treated with HMBA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030146-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). As described previously, the presence of HEXIM1/2, CycT1, and Cdk9 in high molecular weight fractions is characteristic of their presence in the LC with 7SK snRNA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030146-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. As presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030146-g001">Figure 1</xref>C, HMBA induced the disruption of the LC (fractions 5, 6, and 7), starting as soon as 30 min and reaching a maximum at 1 h after the addition of HMBA. Since HEXIM1, HEXIM2, and Cdk9 reassociated into the LC as soon as 6 h after the addition of HMBA, this disruption was transient. Notably, the reassociation of P-TEFb with HEXIM1 was more efficient than the reassociation with HEXIM2. Also, whereas overall amounts of HEXIM1 and HEXIM2 increased after 6 h of stimulation, levels of Cdk9 did not change significantly. Quantitative data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030146-g001">Figure 1</xref>D demonstrate that ratios between LC and SC (LC/SC) were minimal at 1 h and came back to pre-treatment values at 6 h post-stimulation. Thus, whereas HMBA disrupts the LC transiently in Jurkat cells, a prolonged exposure to this compound leads to the establishment of a new equilibrium between LC and SC.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>HMBA Induces Viral Production via the Activation of PI3K and Akt</title><p>To determine the mechanism by which HMBA induced such a rapid, transient disruption of the LC, we reasoned that HMBA could act by activating cellular signaling pathways. Since SAHA is similar in structure to HMBA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030146-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030146-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d; and it activates the PI3K/Akt pathway &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030146-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;, we hypothesized that HMBA could do the same. Indeed, HMBA activated Akt transiently in Jurkat cells as determined with an antibody that recognizes the active, phosphorylated form of Akt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030146-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). This activation which was detected after 30 min of stimulation, decreased significantly at 6 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030146-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, lanes 2&#x02013;4). Moreover, 24 h later, levels of activated Akt were even lower than those in untreated cells (compare lanes 1 and 5). Importantly, HMBA-mediated activation of Akt was inhibited when cells were pre-incubated with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030146-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, lane 6) or the Akt inhibitor 8 (AI8, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030146-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, lane 7). Thus, similar to SAHA, HMBA induces a transient activation of Akt via PI3K and results in a long-term inhibition of this signaling pathway. Importantly, the kinetics of Akt activation correlated nicely with the kinetics of disruption of the LC.</p><fig id="ppat-0030146-g002" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>HMBA Induces HIV Production from Latently Infected Cell Lines via the PI3K/Akt Pathway</title><p>(A) Total cell lysates of Jurkat cells preincubated or not with inhibitors of Akt or PI3K (AI8 or LY294002) and stimulated or not by HMBA (5 mM) for 30 min, 1 h, 6 h, and 24 h were analyzed by western blotting using anti-phospho-Akt antibodies, or Anti-Akt antibodies for loading controls.</p><p>(B) U1 cells were cultured in the presence or absence of LY294002 (10 &#x003bc;M) or AI8 (1 &#x003bc;M) prior to stimulation with HMBA (5 mM).

In contrast, these inhibitors had only minor effects on basal levels of viral production (lanes 5 and 6). Consistent with these results, the expression of a mutant dominant negative form of Akt (DN-Akt) also prevented the stimulation of viral production by HMBA in U1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030146-g002">Figure 2</xref>C, compare lanes 3 and 4). In addition, similar effects were observed in ACH-2 and J&#x00394;K cells (not shown). Taken together, these results demonstrate that a transient activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is required for the HMBA-induced viral production in chronically infected cell lines.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>HMBA Disrupts the LC via the Activation of the PI3K/Akt Pathway</title><p>Thus far, our results indicated that HMBA disrupts the LC transiently and that it induces viral production via PI3K and Akt. To investigate whether the disruption of the LC by HMBA was also dependent on the PI3K/Akt pathway, we pre-incubated Jurkat cells with AI8 or LY294002 prior to the stimulation with HMBA and followed the partitioning of endogenous HEXIM1, HEXIM2, and P-TEFb in the LC and SC by glycerol gradient sedimentation analyses as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030146-g001">Figure 1</xref>C.

Similarly, when we expressed a mutant constitutively active form of Akt (M-Akt), the LC was also disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030146-g003">Figure 3</xref>B).

To test this hypothesis, we followed occupancies of P-TEFb and RNAPII on the HIV promoter and the downstream coding sequences by performing chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIPs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030146-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Positions of primers used in our ChIPs are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030146-g004">Figure 4</xref>A. First, we stimulated J&#x00394;K cells with or without HMBA for 1 h in the presence or absence of AI8 prior to ChIPs. To detect P-TEFb and RNAPII, we used antibodies directed against CycT1 and the large subunit of RNAPII. Consistent with our findings that HMBA disrupts the LC, P-TEFb was recruited efficiently to the HIV promoter and coding region only upon the stimulation with HMBA, whereas this event was inhibited in the presence of AI8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030146-g004">Figure 4</xref>B, top panels). Moreover, whereas levels of RNAPII increased markedly on the coding region in the presence of HMBA, AI8 prevented this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030146-g004">Figure 4</xref>B, bottom panel). Notably, HMBA stimulation resulted in a slightly decreased occupancy of RNAPII on the HIV promoter, possibly reflecting increased rates of transcription elongation. In contrast, the presence of AI8 abolished this decrease. We conclude that HMBA disrupts the LC in a PI3K/Akt-dependent manner to release P-TEFb that is then recruited to the HIV promoter and coding sequences. Consequently, RNAPII elongates successfully on the viral genome. Moreover, as these findings were obtained in J&#x00394;K cells that contained an integrated HIV provirus lacking NF-&#x003ba;B binding sites, these results suggest further that the stimulation of HIV transcription by HMBA can occur independently of NF-&#x003ba;B.</p><fig id="ppat-0030146-g004" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>HMBA Induces the Recruitment of P-TEFb to the HIV Promoter</title><p>(A) Schematic representation of the HIV promoter (LTR) and coding region (Gag).

Next, mutant Flag epitope-tagged HEXIM1 proteins were generated, in which these four residues were replaced by alanines (f:Hex1(4A)) or aspartic acid (f:Hex1(4D)), individually or in combination. Since alanines cannot be phosphorylated, we reasoned that some of these mutant HEXIM1 proteins should resist HMBA-mediated disruption of the LC and should antagonize its effects in cells.

These events depended on the transient activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway that led to the phosphorylation of T270 and S278 in HEXIM1. In turn, the released P-TEFb was recruited to the HIV promoter to stimulate transcription elongation. Importantly, the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway and the transient expression of mutant HEXIM1 proteins that could not be phosphorylated and released from the LC via Akt antagonized the HMBA-mediated induction of viral production. Therefore, we provide a mechanism by which HMBA targets the pivotal cellular co-factor P-TEFb for the reactivation of HIV.</p><p>Thus far, a regulatory mechanism that releases P-TEFb from HEXIM1 and 7SK snRNA has not been determined. Here, we provide evidence that HMBA accomplishes this task by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway. Since inhibitors of both kinases and the expression of the mutant DN-Akt protein resulted in an identical phenotype, PI3K and Akt are involved in this release. Moreover, the mutant constitutively active M-Akt protein also released P-TEFb. It is attractive to hypothesize that HMBA, which is a bipolar compound, binds and activates PI3K directly or via aggregation. In such a scenario, the brief nature of this signal could reflect a rapid modification of HMBA and/or the sequestration and degradation of the signaling complex. The signaling pathway between PI3K and Akt and the subsequent nuclear translocation of Akt has been described in great detail elsewhere &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030146-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. Since the mutant constitutively active M-Akt protein led to the phosphorylation of T270 and S278, it is tempting to speculate that Akt could phosphorylate these residues in the TBD of HEXIM1 directly. This phosphorylation also abrogated the binding between HEXIM1 and P-TEFb in cells. Indeed, this finding was supported by the analysis of mutant HEXIM1 proteins containing aspartic acids that mimic phosphorylated residues, which neither bound CycT1 nor inhibited P-TEFb. Notably, these residues are positioned in close proximity to the first coiled coil segment in the TBD, which is critical for CycT1 binding &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030146-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030146-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, it is conceivable that the introduction of two negative charges by phosphorylation changed the structure of the adjacent first coiled coil segment, leading to the loss of binding between P-TEFb and HEXIM1 in cells. Finally, although the PI3K/Akt pathway also activates NF-&#x003ba;B &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030146-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;, it is unlikely that it was responsible for the recruitment of P-TEFb to the HIV promoter in J&#x00394;K cells that lacked NF-&#x003ba;B-binding sites.

These include changes in chromatin structure, transcription interference, insufficient levels of activators, P-TEFb, and/or the absence of the functional viral transcriptional transactivator Tat on the HIV promoter. Interfering with many of these mechanisms can reactivate latent HIV. Our study and those of others also suggest that this induction can be achieved by exposing latently infected cells to HMBA. Although HMBA is not an HDAC inhibitor, we found that it increases levels of P-TEFb on the HIV promoter, which led to the elongation of RNAPII that is accompanied by remodeling of the local chromatin structure. The disruption of the equilibrium between active and inactive P-TEFb by HMBA was transient, yet the resulting induction of HIV transcription persisted. This finding can be explained by the order of events that follow HMBA stimulation. During the first hours of HMBA treatment, the abundance of active P-TEFb leads to viral transcription in the absence of Tat. Since Tat releases P-TEFb from the LC by virtue of competing effectively with HEXIM1 and 7SK snRNA for binding to P-TEFb &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030146-b042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030146-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;, its synthesis blunts effects of the reassembly of the LC. Thus, in the presence of Tat, HIV transcription continues despite modifications in the distribution of P-TEFb between the SC and LC.</p><p>How does our work contribute to a possible therapeutic use of HMBA and related bipolar compounds to purge the latent viral reservoir? Despite the fact that HMBA induced HIV transcription and production, we could not detect viral production in primary CD4&#x0002b; T lymphocytes isolated from optimally treated individuals, most likely because this compound also interferes with the de novo infection (&#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030146-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d; and our results). Thus, HIV could not spread from a small number of infected cells (one in 10<sup>6</sup> latently infected cells, &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030146-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;). However, we were able to demonstrate that HMBA could activate viral production in resting primary CD4&#x0002b; T cells. Although these findings precluded the amplification of detectable viral particles, they represent yet another advantage for the potential therapeutic use of these agents. Thus, HMBA not only reactivates viral production but also inhibits new infection. Unfortunately, HMBA can not be used therapeutically as it is too toxic for human use. Alternatively, other bipolar compounds structurally related to HMBA might be tried, such as SAHA, which also activates the PI3K/Akt pathway &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030146-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. Importantly, SAHA has been approved recently for the treatment of human cutaneous T cell lymphoma &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030146-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d; and could thus be used alone or in combination with other therapies.</p><p>Finally, our findings might also shed a new light onto how modifications in the equilibrium between active and inactive P-TEFb complexes could affect cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. HMBA induces the differentiation of many cells, including murine erythroleukemic and vascular smooth muscle cells, monocytes, lymphocytes, and neurons &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030146-b046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030146-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;. Importantly, HMBA also increases greatly the expression of HEXIM1 in vascular smooth muscle cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030146-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d; and more recently, the transient disassembly and reassembly of the LC by HMBA was found to be associated with the differentiation of murine erythroleukemic cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030146-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. Indeed, whereas the sustained activation of PI3K and Akt is associated with cell growth and proliferation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030146-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;, a transient activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway leads rather to cell differentiation and growth arrest. This seeming paradox can now be explained by the feedback mechanism involved in the regulation of P-TEFb. We propose that HMBA first disrupts the LC to release the active P-TEFb, which is followed by increased global transcription. In very short order, the LC reassembles with abundant new synthesis of HEXIM1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030146-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030146-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. As the pool of active P-TEFb decreases, cellular reprogramming follows, leading to cell differentiation. As SAHA also activates transiently this pathway &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030146-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;, the role of other bipolar compounds that are related to HMBA should also be investigated for their effects on PI3K and Akt.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell lines.</title><p>U1, ACH-2, and J1.1 cells were obtained through the NIH AIDS reagents program.
