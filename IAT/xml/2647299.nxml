Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are respiratory byproducts that damage mtDNA and other cellular components. In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the oxidized base excision-repair enzyme Ntg1 introduces a double-stranded break (DSB) at the mtDNA replication origin <italic>ori5</italic>; this DSB initiates the rolling-circle mtDNA replication mediated by the homologous DNA pairing protein Mhr1. Thus, ROS may play a role in the regulation of mtDNA copy number. Here, we show that the treatment of isolated mitochondria with low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide increased mtDNA copy number in an Ntg1- and Mhr1-dependent manner. This treatment elevated the DSB levels at <italic>ori5</italic> of hypersuppressive [rho<sup>&#x02013;</sup>] mtDNA only if Ntg1 was active. <italic>In vitro</italic> Ntg1-treatment of hypersuppressive [rho<sup>&#x02013;</sup>] mtDNA extracted from hydrogen peroxide-treated mitochondria revealed increased oxidative modifications at <italic>ori5</italic> loci. We also observed that purified Ntg1 created breaks in single-stranded DNA harboring oxidized bases, and that <italic>ori5</italic> loci have single-stranded character. Furthermore, chronic low levels of hydrogen peroxide increased <italic>in vivo</italic> mtDNA copy number. We therefore propose that ROS act as a regulator of mtDNA copy number, acting through the Mhr1-dependent initiation of rolling-circle replication promoted by Ntg1-induced DSB in the single-stranded regions at <italic>ori5</italic>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Mitochondria in eukaryotic cells play a primary role in the production of ATP&#x02014;the cellular source of energy&#x02014;through the oxidative phosphorylation system. Mitochondria have their own genome (mtDNA), whose copy number varies in response to the physiological environment surrounding the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Genes in mtDNA, as well as in nuclear genomes, encode essential protein subunits that participate in oxidative phosphorylation. mtDNA is constantly subjected to oxidative damage due to reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are byproducts of oxidative phosphorylation. This damage results in mutations in the mtDNA, which are associated with aging and various mitochondrial disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). On the other hand, recent evidence suggests that ROS regulate mtDNA replication: e.g. the treatment of human cells with hydrogen peroxide results in a transient increase in mtDNA copy number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), and the amount of mtDNA correlates with the ROS levels in cell lines carrying different mouse mtDNA haplotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Because decreased cellular levels of mtDNA clinically correlate with mitochondrial disorders, such as mtDNA depletion syndrome, investigators are seeking to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate mtDNA copy number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Studies on yeast and human cells have shown that mtDNA-related nuclear gene expression and the cellular levels of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) play critical roles in the regulation of mtDNA copy number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Whether mitochondria contain mechanisms that regulate mtDNA copy number in response to ROS, however, is currently unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>In the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> the replication and segregation of mtDNA depend on the homologous DNA pairing protein Mhr1, which is required for mtDNA recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Generally, DNA recombination is initiated at a double-stranded break (DSB); after the break occurs, a homologous DNA pairing protein directs the formation of a heteroduplex joint (&#x02018;the DSB repair model&#x02019; of recombination) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Our studies revealed that the excision-repair enzyme Ntg1 creates a DSB at <italic>ori5</italic>, one of the active replication origins in yeast mtDNA; the DSB level increased when yeast cells were exposed to oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). These studies suggested that by recognizing a specific oxidative modification at <italic>ori5</italic>, Ntg1 induces DSB to initiate rolling-circle mtDNA replication, as well as recombination, through the homologous DNA pairing activity of Mhr1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Ntg1 initiates base-excision repair of oxidative DNA damage by excising damaged bases via its DNA-N-glycosylase activity; subsequently, via its DNA lyase activity, it introduces single-stranded breaks (nicks) in the double-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Based on our previous studies showing a role for Ntg1 in the initiation of mtDNA replication, as well as a correlation between the ROS levels in mitochondria and the mtDNA copy number, we sought to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying ROS-controlled changes in mtDNA copy number.</p><p>The Mec1/Rad53 nuclear checkpoint pathway, which is activated by nuclear DNA damage, increases mtDNA copy number by affecting the activity of ribonucleotide reductase and thereby the cellular pool of dNTPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). ROS are generated from either the electron transport chain or the metabolic enzyme &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase in the tricarboxylic acid cycle; both of these ROS sources are found in normally functioning mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). In this study, to eliminate the effects of both the Mec1/Rad53 nuclear checkpoint pathway and possible regulatory control by nuclear genes on the amounts of ROS and mtDNA, we employed isolated mitochondria harboring hypersuppressive (HS) [<italic>ori5</italic>] [rho<sup>&#x02013;</sup>] mtDNA, treated with various concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, as a model system to investigate the direct effects of ROS on mtDNA copy number. Hydrogen peroxide has been used as a ROS-generating agent in a variety of studies about the effects of ROS on cellular functions.</p><p>In this study, we show that exposing isolated yeast mitochondria to hydrogen peroxide results in simultaneous increases in Ntg1-dependent DSB levels at <italic>ori5</italic> and in mtDNA copy number, an effect that is dependent on Ntg1 and Mhr1. It is likely that ROS trigger Ntg1- and Mhr1-dependent mtDNA replication, which leads to an increase in mtDNA copy number.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast strains</title><p>The <italic>ntg1</italic>-null mutant (YKN1423C-1/&#x025b5;ntg1), the <italic>mhr1</italic>-null mutant (YKN1423C-1/&#x025b5;mhr1), the <italic>ogg1</italic>-null mutant (YKN1423C-1/&#x025b5;ogg1) cells and <italic>cce1</italic>-null mutant (YKN1423C-1/&#x025b5;cce1) cells were derived from the YKN1423C-1 wild-type strain (nuclear genotype: &#x003b1; <italic>leu2, ura3, met3</italic>; mitochondrial genotype: HS [<italic>ori</italic>5] [rho<sup>&#x02013;</sup>] mtDNA) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).

The rate of this increase slowed after 1 h of incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). Since the addition of fresh hydrogen peroxide (10 &#x003bc;M) after 1 h induced a further increase in mtDNA copy number (up to 4.5-fold in another 1 h; data not shown), it is likely that hydrogen peroxide underwent decomposition during incubation. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Changes in mtDNA copy number in isolated mitochondria treated with 10 &#x003bc;M hydrogen peroxide.

Thus, it is likely that the increase in mtDNA copy number was induced even in isolated mitochondria not treated with hydrogen peroxide due to ROS generated during the incubation. Isolated mitochondrial &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes generate ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). It is likely that ROS generated from these complexes eventually activate mtDNA replication in isolated mitochondria. These observations showed that the increases in mtDNA copy number observed in isolated mitochondria with or without hydrogen peroxide treatment were caused by increased levels of ROS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). In the following experiments, we examined the first 1 h of the incubation, in which the effects of the added hydrogen peroxide is prominent.</p><p>Next, we investigated whether the hydrogen-peroxide-induced increase in mtDNA copy number was a result of a net increase in newly synthesized mtDNA. We proceeded by examining digoxigenin (DIG)-11-dUTP-labeled mtDNA in isolated mitochondria, whose levels reflect incorporation of the labeled nucleotide throughout the mtDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, left panel).

It has been shown that isolated yeast mitochondria incorporate dNTPs into mtDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). The incorporation of DIG-dUTP into mtDNA of isolated mitochondria was observed for 1&#x02013;1.5 h after the addition of the labeled dNTP, an effect that was enhanced by 10 &#x003bc;M hydrogen peroxide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, left panel).

In addition, the <italic>ori5</italic> region in HS [<italic>ori5</italic>] [rho<sup>&#x02013;</sup>] mtDNA extracted from isolated mitochondria was more resistant to single-cut restriction enzymes when compared with DNA fragments amplified in PCRs, suggesting that the <italic>ori5</italic>-region contains single-stranded regions, such as bubble structures formed during transcription or replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>E). Obviously, the Ntg1 activity that introduces single-stranded DNA cleavage is required for DSB formation at <italic>ori5</italic>.</p><p>Since the fidelity of DNA repair synthesis would be compromised if template strands were absent, excision repair enzymes are thought to remove oxidize bases only in double-stranded substrates. However, a number of base-excision repair enzymes have been shown to have activity against damaged bases in single-stranded DNA, e.g. in the context of a transcription or replication bubble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Therefore, we asked whether Ntg1 caused a strand-break by recognizes oxidative bases in single-stranded DNA. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>F, Ntg1 acted on an oxidized base, 5-OHU, but not on thymine, when these nucleotides were artificially introduced in the middle of 30-mer oligonucleotides labeled with DIG at their 3&#x02032; termini. Increased levels of DIG-labeled 16-mer oligos, generated from the sites of strand breakages formed by Ntg1 recognition of oxidized bases in single-stranded DNA, were observed only when the amounts of Ntg1, but not C&#x025b5;ntg1, were increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>F, left panel versus right panel). C&#x025b5;ntg1 lacks the activity to excise oxidized bases in dsDNA; deletion of the C-terminal 158 amino acid residues removes a part of the active domain (residues 97&#x02013;318) responsible for the DNA glycosylase activity of Ntg1. Thus, Ntg1 is indeed capable of recognizing oxidized bases and making incisions at these sites in single-stranded DNA.</p><p>Taken together, these results suggest that Ntg1 creates DSBs in the <italic>ori5</italic> region by two strand breakage events in both complementary strands, by recognizing oxidized base lesions that were preferentially introduced in this site because of the single-strand character of the locus. The <italic>ori5</italic>-region is rich in A:T base pairs and is therefore likely to be easily melted by both transcription and replication factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Increases in mtDNA copy number are sensitive to chronic low levels of hydrogen peroxide in vivo</title><p>In order to investigate whether <italic>in vivo</italic> low constant ROS can also increase mtDNA copy number, we expressed the <italic>A. niger GOX</italic> gene, which encodes glucose oxidase. This enzyme catalyzes the chemical reaction (<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-<sc>d</sc>-glucose + O<sub>2</sub> &#x02192; glucono-<italic>&#x003b4;</italic>-lactone + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). Thus, the expression of <italic>GOX</italic> in yeast cells results in production of a low constant level of ROS, as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Western blot analysis using monoclonal antibody against glucose oxidase (Sigma) in WT cells harboring pVT100UGOX indicated that <italic>GOX</italic> gene was detectably expressed <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). Southern blot analysis revealed that there was more [rho<sup>+</sup>] mtDNA in WT cells harboring pVT100UGOX than in WT cells harboring empty vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C). When hydrogen peroxide levels were elevated in the cells with expression of <italic>GOX</italic>, the relative signals of [rho<sup>+</sup>] mtDNA versus nuclear <italic>NUC1</italic> gene increased 1.3-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B and D). Since no [rho<sup>+</sup>] mtDNA was detected from [rho<sup>0</sup>] cells, which completely lack mtDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C and D), we conclude that the signals we detected are derived from mtDNA. Although the hydrogen peroxide levels were only slightly elevated, an increase in mtDNA copy number was observed, indicating that the increase in mtDNA copy number is sensitive to even a slight increase of intracellular ROS. The observation was confirmed when we cultivated WT cells at 30&#x000b0;C in YPGlycerol medium supplemented with various concentrations of iron (FeCl<sub>2</sub>), which also induces ROS generation, likely through the Fenton reaction (Fe<sup>2+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> &#x02192; Fe<sup>3+</sup> + &#x02022;OH + OH<sup>&#x02013;</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). We found that increased concentrations of FeCl<sub>2</sub> slightly but significantly enhanced the content of [rho<sup>+</sup>] mtDNA, e.g. mtDNA copy number increased 1.5-fold at 1.0 mM FeCl<sub>2</sub> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn993/DC1">Supplementary Figure 2A and B</ext-link>). These results suggest that either chronic low levels of hydrogen peroxide <italic>in vivo</italic>, or a small, but detectable increase in basal ROS inside cells (whether due to by <italic>GOX</italic> expression or the presence of iron), cause an increase in mtDNA copy number. These observations support the model wherein ROS act as a regulator of mtDNA copy number to initiate rolling-circle mtDNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Effects of <italic>GOX</italic> expression on mtDNA copy number.

This treatment resulted in accumulation of oxidative modifications preferentially in the <italic>ori5</italic>-region of mtDNA, and an Ntg1-dependent increase in the DSB level specifically at <italic>ori5</italic> in isolated mitochondria and <italic>in vitro</italic> by use of purified DNA and purified Ntg1. These results led us to propose a model in which elevated levels of ROS (the result of hydrogen peroxide treatment in this study) enhance Ntg1- and Mhr1-dependent rolling-circle-type mtDNA replication to increase mtDNA copy number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Our previous <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> results demonstrated that the excision-repair enzyme Ntg1, which repairs oxidatively damaged DNA bases, can introduce DSB only at the <italic>ori5</italic> locus, and that both Ntg1 and Mhr1 are required for the replication of HS [<italic>ori5</italic>] [rho<sup>&#x02013;</sup>] mtDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). In this study, we further revealed that the <italic>ori5</italic> region contains more exposed single-stranded DNA when compared with the rest part of HS [<italic>ori5</italic>] [rho<sup>&#x02013;</sup>] mtDNA, since it is more resistant to the restriction enzyme with a single recognition site in this region, and more sensitive to S1 nuclease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C, D and E). This explains the local sensitization of the <italic>ori5</italic> region towards oxidative modification by ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). In fact, the <italic>ori5</italic>-region accumulates a larger number of oxidized bases than other regions of the same DNA, as revealed from its sensitivity toward nicking by Ntg1 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). In addition, Ntg1 recognizes oxidative bases in single-stranded DNA and cuts single strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>F). These observations explain how Ntg1 introduces DSB specifically at <italic>ori5</italic>-region. By preferentially recognizing oxidative modifications induced by ROS at the <italic>ori5</italic>-region, Ntg1 induces strand breakage in both complementary strands, resulting in DSB specific to <italic>ori5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that the observed increase in mtDNA copy number is a result of DSB formation at <italic>ori5</italic> mediated by Ntg1.</p><p>Supporting this model, the DSB levels at <italic>ori5</italic> increased by 3.0-fold during a 1-h incubation with hydrogen peroxide (10 &#x003bc;M) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). MtDNA copy number increased 2.5-fold during this period, and thus was positively correlated with the increase in <italic>ori5</italic>-specific DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). The DSB levels depended on the functions of Ntg1 as well as the hydrogen peroxide treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C and D). Moreover, oxidative modifications at <italic>ori5</italic> increased following a 0.5-h incubation in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, as evidenced by the <italic>in vitro</italic> generation of DSBs by Ntg1 at <italic>ori5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). These results can be explained with our proposed model.</p><p>In order to propose that ROS act as regulators to control mtDNA copy number, we investigated whether mtDNA copy number increases when intracellular ROS levels were elevated, either by expressing <italic>A. niger GOX</italic> gene, or by adding iron to the medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn993/DC1">Supplementary Figure 2</ext-link>). As expected, even a slight increase of the ROS level significantly increases mtDNA copy number. Since the optimal amount of ROS required for maximum increase in mtDNA copy number <italic>in vivo</italic> is still unknown, a greater increase in mtDNA copy number may be observed when we further investigate whether redox/oxidative stress regulates mtDNA replication initiation as another study.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn993/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>This work was supported in part by a grant from the RIKEN Bioarchitect Research Program to F.L. and M.Y.; by a grant from the Life Science Foundation of Japan to F.L.; by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) No.18570168 from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan to F.L.; by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) No. 20570171 from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan to F.L., and by a grant from the RIKEN Strategic Research Program to F.L.
