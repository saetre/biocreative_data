We hypothesized that the oncogenic pathway in rhabdoid tumors involved epigenetic silencing of key cell cycle regulators as a consequence of altered chromatin-remodelling, attributable to loss of <italic>SMARCB1</italic>, and that this hypothesis if proven could provide a biological rationale for testing epigenetic therapies in this disease. We used an inducible expression system to show that the imprinted cell cycle inhibitor <italic>CDKN1C</italic> is a downstream target for SMARCB1 and is transcriptionally activated by increased histone H3 and H4 acetylation at the promoter. We also show that CDKN1C expression induces cell cycle arrest, CDKN1C knockdown with siRNA is associated with increased proliferation, and is able to compete against the anti-proliferative effect of restored SMARCB1 expression. The histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), Romidepsin, specifically restored <italic>CDKN1C</italic> expression in rhabdoid tumor cells through promoter histone H3 and H4 acetylation, recapitulating the effect of SMARCB1 on <italic>CDKNIC</italic> allelic expression, and induced cell cycle arrest in G401 and STM91-01 rhabdoid tumor cell lines. <italic>CDKN1C</italic> expression was also shown to be generally absent in clinical specimens of rhabdoid tumor, however CDKN1A and CDKN1B expression persisted. Our observations suggest that maintenance of CDKN1C expression plays a critical role in preventing rhabdoid tumor growth. Significantly, we report for the first time, parallels between the molecular pathways of SMARCB1 restoration and Romidepsin treatment, and demonstrate a biological basis for the further exploration of histone deacetylase inhibitors as relevant therapeutic reagents in the treatment of rhabdoid tumor.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rhabdoid tumor (RT) is an aggressive although rare tumor of infancy and early childhood resistant to conventional chemotherapies and radiotherapy.

Further, constituitively active pRB1 can induce arrest in RT cell lines lacking SMARCB1.</p><p>SMARCB1 is part of an ATP dependent multiprotein SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004482-Doan1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. It associates with ATPase subunits Brg1 (for Brahma-related gene 1, or SNF2&#x003b2; and Brm (for Brahma or SNF2&#x003b1;). In contrast to SMARCB1, Brg1 and Brm are required for cell cycle arrest mediated by pRB. Versteege et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004482-Versteege2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> hypothesize that Brg1 and Brm are necessary for the chromatin remodelling associated with pRB repression of E2F and that SMARCB1 has a promoting but not a primary role in this remodelling. Deletion of <italic>Brg1</italic> and <italic>Brm</italic> occurs in many cancer cell lines and is associated with gene specific changes in promoter methylation at <italic>CD44</italic> and <italic>E-Cadherin</italic> leading to hyper-methylation and gene silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004482-Banine1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Brg1 and Brm associate directly with the promoters of these genes and a more widespread role in epigenetic regulation of gene expression during tumor progression has been proposed. The direct role of SMARCB1 in chromatin remodelling has not been extensively explored.

This premise, if established, may reveal opportunities for treatment of RT with epigenetic therapies that restore the expression of key growth-regulating genes. In this work we demonstrate that the imprinted cell cycle inhibitor <italic>CDKN1C</italic> (OMIM 600856) is a downstream target for <italic>SMARCB1</italic> epigenetic regulation. SMARCB1 consistently activated CDKN1C expression via histone H3 and H4 acetylation at the <italic>CDKN1C</italic> promoter and the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), romidepsin, restored imprinted CDKN1C expression in RT cells through promoter histone H3 and H4 acetylation. Significantly, CDKN1C expression was absent or negligible in clinical specimens, enforced expression of CDKN1C in G401 RT cells induced cell cycle arrest and knockdown of endogenous CDKN1C increased proliferation in G401 RT cells as well as attenuating the effects of SMARCB1 re-expression on cell proliferation. Our findings show that <italic>CDKN1C</italic> silencing is common in RT, suggest that CDKN1C is an important regulator of RT cell growth, and that RT cell proliferation is mediated in part via suppression of CDKN1C expression attributable to deletion of SMARCB1.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>CDKN1C is up-regulated in RT cells with reconstituted expression of SMARCB1</title><p>CDKN1C (p57<sup>Kip2</sup>) is commonly epigenetically silenced in cancer and is the only imprinted member of the CIP KIP family of cell cycle inhibitors.

To examine this we expressed <italic>SMARCB1</italic> under the control of an inducible promoter in two renal RT cell lines, G401 and STM91-01.

Two G401 clones, F13 and F22, showing inducible SMARCB1 expression, were selected for further investigation. A pool of STM91-01 cells (STMpc), transduced with a lentiviral vector system (pF 5&#x000d7;UAS Sv40 puro/ini1 and pF GEV16) was also examined. SMARCB1 protein was readily detectable 24 hours after exposure to 1 uM 4HT in all cultures, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004482-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Cell cycle analysis was performed on cultures of F22 cells 72 hours after induction of SMARCB1 protein expression.

In contrast, STMpc cells induced to express SMARCB1 showed little change in the cell cycle (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004482.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). One explanation for this is that the parental line, STM91-01, is derived from a RT lung metastasis and may have acquired additional oncogenic mutations and hence greater resistance to growth inhibitory signals. Reincke et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004482-Reincke1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> also found this cell line difficult to transduce with recombinant adenovirus containing SMARCB1 and reportedly found inconsistent cell cycle changes following infection. CDKN1C mRNA was elevated in all lines (F22, F13, STMpc) following induction of SMARCB1 expression with 1 uM 4HT whereas other CDK family members including CDKN1A (p21/WAF1) and CDKN1B (p27) did not show uniform responses following 4HT treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004482-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Quantitative analysis of CDKN1C expression by real-time PCR in F22 cells showed four-fold increases in CDKN1C expression 24 hours following SMARCB1 induction, and STMpc showed six-fold increases in CDKN1C expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004482-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). 1 uM 4HT alone had a negligible effect on CDKN1C expression in parental G401 and STM91-01 cultures demonstrating that the observed effect on CDKN1C expression was directly attributable to the induction of SMARCB1 protein (results not shown). Endogenous levels of CDKN1C protein were low in un-induced F22 cells however following SMARCB1 induction, were increased to levels consistent with the proportional increase in CDKN1C transcript levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004482-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0004482-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004482.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>SMARCB1 induces CDKN1C expression in rhabdoid tumor cell lines.</title><p>(A).

Induction of CDKN1C protein in G401 cells induced cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004482-g002">Figure 2A</xref> and Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004482.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). Endogenous CDKN1C protein was not detectable by Western blotting at the short exposure time-setting used to detect over-expression of CDKN1C.

To further ascertain the functional significance of CDKN1C induction in RT cells, a CDKN1C siRNA pool was used to knock-down the low level of endogenous CDKN1C in F22 cells, and to knock-down CDKN1C mRNA induced following SMARCB1 re-expression. CDKN1C siRNA transfection in F22 cells eliminated CDKN1C expression and led to increased proliferation, as measured by a greater positive change in MTS absorbance over the first 48 hours following transfection, as compared with F22 cells treated with a non-targeting control siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004482-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). CDKN1C siRNA also attenuated the effect of SMARCB1 induction on restricting cell proliferation. Cells in which SMARCB1 expression was induced with 1 uM 4HT by 24 hours and transfected with CDKN1C siRNA, exhibited a significant and reproducible positive increase in MTS absorbance between 24 and 48 hours, reflecting an increase in the number of proliferating cells in the culture when compared with cells transfected with non-targeting siRNA &#x0002b;4HT. This correlated with reduced levels of CDKN1C mRNA after 48 hours in the &#x0002b;4HT CDKN1C siRNA-treated cultures. Between 48 and 72 hours, cells in the 4HT and non-targeting siRNA, CDKN1C siRNA, and CDKN1C siRNA and 4HT cultures, showed a reduction in the number of viable cells present. In the CDKN1C siRNA culture this likely reflects a reduction in the rate of cell proliferation as the cells approach senescence. In the cultures treated with non-targeting siRNA and 4HT, and CDKN1CsiRNA and 4HT, the decrease in cell viability probably reflects the long-term effect of sustained SMARCB1 expression on cell viability. This may suggest that SMARCB1 modifies the expression of other genes in addition to CDKN1C that affect cell proliferation and viability. Nevertheless these results clearly show that CDKN1C is an important modulator of G401 growth as small changes in CDKN1C expression affect proliferation, and furthermore provide evidence for parallels between the actions of SMARCB1 and CDKN1C in regulating RT proliferation.</p><fig id="pone-0004482-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004482.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>CDKN1C levels modulate growth in rhabdoid tumor cells.</title><p>(A) Western blot showing induction of CDKN1C protein in G401 clones C1 and C2.

In contrast, CDKN1C expression was markedly increased and this coincided with a specific increase in histone H3 acetylation and less marked increase in histone H4 acetylation.
