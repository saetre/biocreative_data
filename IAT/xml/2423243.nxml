In the present study, we found that although shear markedly increased eNOS mRNA, the increase in nuclear translocation of p50 and p65 caused by shear was only 2-fold, suggesting that shear has additional effects on NF&#x003ba;B cofactor activity beyond nuclear translocation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that virtually no p50 or p65 was bound to the eNOS promoter at base line but that shear increased the binding of these subunits to the human eNOS SSRE by 10- to 20-fold. Co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated during the first 30 min of shear p300 bound to p65. Shear also increased p300 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity by 2.5-fold and increased acetylation of p65. The increase in eNOS mRNA caused by shear was completely blocked by pharmacological inhibition of p300/HAT activity with curcumin or by p300 small interfering RNA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays also showed that shear stimulated acetylation of histones 3 and 4 at the region of the eNOS promoter SSRE and extended 3&#x02032; toward the eNOS coding region. This was associated with opening of chromatin at the SSRE. In conclusion, these studies reveal a previously unknown role of p300/HAT activation as a very early response to shear that is essential for increasing eNOS mRNA levels.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p><italic>Author's Choice</italic>&#x02014;Final version full access.</p></fn><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported, in whole or in part, by <grant-sponsor>National Institutes of Health</grant-sponsor> Grants <grant-num>HL39006</grant-num>, <grant-num>HL38206</grant-num>, <grant-num>HL59248</grant-num>, and <grant-num>DK51257</grant-num> and by <grant-sponsor>National Institutes of Health Program Project</grant-sponsor> Grants <grant-num>HL58000</grant-num> and <grant-num>HL075209</grant-num>.

Exposure of endothelial cells in culture to laminar shear stress causes both acute and long term effects on their function and morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>). Acute effects include changes in intracellular calcium and activation of several protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>). Over the long term, laminar shear alters endothelial cell shape and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). One of the most physiologically important adaptations to shear is an increase in production of nitric oxide. Acutely, shear activates the endothelial cell nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2">2</xref> enzyme to produce nitric oxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>), and over several hours shear increases expression of this enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). We have shown previously that this is mediated by a transient activation of NF&#x003ba;B and binding of the NF&#x003ba;B subunits to a shear stress response element (SSRE) located 984 base pairs 5&#x02032; to the transcription start site in the human eNOS promoter and that mutation of this site completely abrogates the increase in eNOS promoter activity caused by shear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>).</p><p>NF&#x003ba;B encompasses a family of transcription factors including RelA/p65, RelB, c-Rel, p50, and p52 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>). In most unstimulated cells, NF&#x003ba;B is sequestered in the cytoplasm by its physical association with I&#x003ba;B. Upon activation by a variety of stimuli, the I&#x003ba;B subunit is phosphorylated and degraded, allowing the p50/p65 dimer to translocate to the nucleus to transactivate a variety of genes. These events are regulated by upstream signals, including I&#x003ba; kinase and alternate pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). Generally, NF&#x003ba;B-dependent gene transcription occurs in response to diverse pro-inflammatory stimuli such as the cytokine tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1;, double-stranded RNA, lipopolysaccharide, reactive oxygen species, and high glucose. A departure from this pro-inflammatory role of NF&#x003ba;B seems to be its activation in the endothelium by shear stress, which in turn promotes induction of cytoprotective proteins. In addition to eNOS, protective genes activated by NF&#x003ba;B in response to shear include manganese superoxide dismutase, Bcl2, and GADD45&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>). It is unclear how shear modulates a beneficial effect of NF&#x003ba;B activation that contrasts to deleterious effects caused by its activation in response to inflammatory cytokines.</p><p>Another level of complexity in understanding how shear affects eNOS expression relates to epigenetic phenomenon. Eukaryotic genes are assembled into units referred to as nucleosomes containing eight histone proteins clustered on 146 bp of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>). Histones must be unraveled from DNA to permit access of transcription factors. This process is promoted by histone acetylation, a process that is mediated by the transcription coactivator histone acetyltransferases such as p300 and its homolog, the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) and is antagonized by histone deacetylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>). In addition to histone acetylation, p300/CBP also acetylates transcription factors, a process that enhances their DNA binding. In the case of NF&#x003ba;B, acetylation of p65 reduces its association with I&#x003ba;B and therefore promotes its activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). Moreover, p65 enhances histone acetylation and chromatin remodeling via an interaction with specific histone deacetylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). There is also an interplay between p300/CBP, NF&#x003ba;B subunits, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 that promotes histone acetylation, also via histone deacetylase association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>). An important step for NF&#x003ba;B activation is phosphorylation of p65 by upstream kinases such as casein kinase-2 and protein kinase A. This enhances p65 DNA binding and promotes its association with p300/CBP, which in turn acetylates p65 and further increases its DNA binding efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>).</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>FIGURE 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of unidirectional laminar shear on nuclear levels of the NFkB subunits p50 and p65 and binding of these to the eNOS promoter.</bold> Western blots are shown of nuclear extracts for p50 (<italic>A</italic>) and p65 (<italic>B</italic>). <italic>C</italic> shows mean densitometry analysis of three to four separate experiments for each.

In the present studies, we sought to determine how these upstream events might be modulated by shear and if they could affect eNOS mRNA levels in human endothelial cells. In preliminary studies we found that both p50 and p65 were present in nuclear extracts of human endothelial cells not exposed to shear and that the levels of these were only modestly increased by shear. These findings suggested that shear likely has additional effects, beyond simply promoting p50 and p65 nuclear translocation, to promote binding of these subunits to the eNOS promoter and transcriptional initiation. We hypothesized that acetylation of NF&#x003ba;B subunits and acetylation of histones might play a critical role in modulating chromatin remodeling, activation of p65 and p50, and initiation of eNOS transcription in response to shear.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Cell Culture and Shear Apparatus</italic>&#x02014;Primary cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were purchased from the Emory Skin Diseases Research Center.

To determine whether shear promotes nuclear translocation of either p50 or p65 in human endothelial cells, we exposed HUVECs to either static conditions or shear for 30 min. At base line, the nuclei of HUVECs contained both p50 and p65, and 30 min of laminar shear increased nuclear levels of both of these by &#x0223c;2-fold (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, <italic>A&#x02013;C</italic></xref>). Given that the increase in eNOS mRNA caused by shear is &#x0003e;5-fold, this suggested that the DNA binding and transcriptional activity of these NF&#x003ba;B subunits is regulated by shear in a manner that is independent of nuclear translocation. To determine whether DNA binding of either p50 or p65 to the endogenous human eNOS gene is affected by shear, we performed ChIP assays using overlapping primers allowing amplification of eNOS promoter regions from &#x02013;1600 to +50 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The shear stress response element in the human eNOS promoter is &#x02013;976 bp upstream from the transcription start site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). In cells exposed to static conditions, there was minimal specific association of either p50 or p65 with any aspect of the eNOS promoter (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, <italic>E</italic> and <italic>F</italic></xref>), but 30 min of shear increased binding of p50 and p65 to the SSRE. The apparent increase in DNA binding of p50 and p65 to this region was striking, averaging &#x0003e;20-fold for p65 and &#x0003e;10-fold for p50 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, <italic>D</italic> and <italic>F</italic></xref>). Binding of these factors to other portions of the eNOS promoter was not affected by shear.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>FIGURE 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Acetylation of p50 and p65 at base line and in response to laminar shear and association of p65 with p300.</bold> The NF&#x003ba;B subunits p50 and p65 were immunoprecipitated and Western blots using anti-lysine antibody performed.

To determine whether p50 and p65 were acetylated in response to shear, these proteins were immunoprecipitated from HUVEC nuclear extracts and Western blots performed with anti-acetylated lysine antibodies. These studies indicated that both p65 and p50 were acetylated at base line but that 30 min of shear consistently increased p65 acetylation while having no effect on p50 acetylation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, <italic>A&#x02013;C</italic></xref>). In additional experiments, we demonstrated that shear increased p300 acetyltransferase activity, as evidenced by the ability of immunoprecipitated p300 to acetylate histone substrate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>D</italic></xref>). This increase in acetyltransferase activity was blocked by curcumin (80 m<sc>m</sc>), a known inhibitor of HAT activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>D</italic></xref>). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that within 20 min shear also markedly increased association of p300 with p65 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>E</italic></xref>). This binding of p65 and p300 persisted for 30 min but was no longer evident following 45 min of shear. Taken together, these data indicate that shear stress activates p300 acetyltransferase activity and that p300 associates with and acetylates p65.</p><p><italic>Chromatin Acetylation and Remodeling in Response to Shear</italic>&#x02014;To determine whether shear could promote acetylation of histones associated with the eNOS promoter, antibodies against acetylated histones 3 and 4 and primers 5, 7, and 10 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) were used in ChIP assays. These experiments demonstrated that 15 min of shear stress stimulates acetylation of histones H3 and H4 at the site of SSRE within the eNOS promoter (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, <italic>A&#x02013;C</italic></xref>) and this acetylation extended 3&#x02032; toward the eNOS coding region. This was associated with chromatin opening, as demonstrated by accessibility of native chromatin at the SSRE site. Native DNA was digested with the restriction enzyme Bsa1, the recognition site of which corresponds to the SSRE. Therefore, BsaI would cut the SSRE not protected by nucleosomes in the chromatin. The digested SSRE could be quantified by a reduction in a PCR product spanning the SSRE. In absence of BsaI digestion, quantitative PCR yielded high levels of product that were not different between shear and static samples (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>D</italic></xref>), indicating a good efficiency of PCR amplification in sheared and unsheared samples. This product was reduced by about half in DNA from unsheared cells treated with Bsa1 but was completely absent in DNA from sheared cells treated with Bsa1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>C</italic></xref>). Phenol denaturation of nuclear DNA, to remove chromatin, also eliminated the ability to amplify the SSRE following Bsa1 exposure. These data indicate that shear stimulates chromatin opening in the eNOS gene at the SSRE site and that this was associated with histone acetylation at this site.</p><p><italic>Role of p300 Acetylation Activity in Modulating eNOS Transcription in Response to Shear Stress</italic>&#x02014;The above experiments demonstrated that shear stimulates not only p65 and histone acetylation but also chromatin opening at the site of the eNOS SSRE and that these events were mediated by p300. We performed additional experiments to determine the role of p300 in modulating the increase in eNOS mRNA that occurs in response to shear. Pretreatment of HUVECs with curcumin (80 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) completely blocked the increase in eNOS mRNA caused by 6 h of shear, whereas the vehicle DMSO had no effect on this response (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>). To specifically examine the role of p300, HUVECs were transfected with either a non-silencing mRNA or an siRNA against p300 and subjected to shear. Although non-silencing siRNA had no effect on levels of p300 in HUVECs, siRNA against p300 markedly reduced levels of this protein (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>). Following 30 min of shear, nuclear fractions were extracted and acetylation of p65 was examined using immunoprecipitation with an antibody against p65 and Western blotting with an anti-acetylated lysine antibody. These experiments showed that the increase in acetylation of p65 caused by shear was prevented in cells transfected with siRNA against p300 but was unaffected by transfection with non-silencing siRNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic></xref>). Importantly, the increase in eNOS mRNA caused by shear stress was totally eliminated by transfection with p300 siRNA but was not altered by non-silencing siRNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>E</italic></xref>).</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>FIGURE 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of shear on histones associated with the eNOS promoter.</bold><italic>A&#x02013;C</italic> show mean data of ChIP assays examining acetylation of histones 3 and 4 surrounding the eNOS promoter at base line and following 30 min of shear (15 dynes/cm<sup>2</sup>).

Our findings demonstrated that this is dependent on activation of p300, which in turn acetylates p65 and histones in proximity to the human eNOS SSRE. This is associated with opening of chromatin structure surrounding the SSRE. Activation of p300 is critical for the increase in eNOS mRNA in response to shear, as its pharmacological inhibition using curcumin or down-regulation by siRNA completely abrogated the increase in eNOS caused by this mechanical force. These findings provide new insight into how shear stress modulates eNOS expression via both transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms.</p><p>Given that NF&#x003ba;B-mediated transcriptional events are suppressed in resting cells, the finding that human endothelial cell nuclei contain substantial amounts of p50 and p65 under basal conditions suggested that events other than nuclear translocation were responsible for shear induction of eNOS transcription. Indeed, the absence of p50 and p65 binding to the endogenous eNOS promoter at base line and the striking increase in binding of these with shear strongly support this conclusion. Our data indicate that activation of p300 histone acetyltransferase activity is an early event in shear modulation of gene expression. Of note, Wang <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>) have recently shown that resting HUVEC contain both p50 and p65 and that the eosinophil-derived oxidant hypothiocyanate (HOSCN) causes further translocation of these. In contrast to the modest changes (2- to 3-fold) in nuclear levels of p50 and p65, HOSCN markedly stimulated binding of these subunits to a consensus NF&#x003ba;B sequence in a fashion almost entirely analogous to our current findings.</p><p>Of note, oxidative stress has been shown to stimulate p300 association with p65 and histone acetylation in a fashion similar to the effect of shear observed in the present study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>). Laminar shear can transiently stimulate production of reactive oxygen species in endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>), and hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxides stimulate eNOS expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>). It is interesting to speculate that our current findings could be accounted for by an acute burst of reactive oxygen species production in response to shear. Although this scenario is possible, in previous studies we have been unable to block the increase in eNOS expression caused by shear using antioxidants, suggesting that redox-independent pathways are likely responsible for p300 activation in response to this mechanical stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>).</p><p>There is substantial interest in how extracellular forces such as shear signal intracellular events. The platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM) has recently been implicated in this process. Inclusion of PECAM in a heterologous expression system yields a mechanosensory complex sufficient to confer responsiveness to flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>). Relevant to our present studies, shear activation of Akt is absent in cells lacking PECAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>). Huang and Chen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>) have recently shown that Akt phosphorylation of p300 on serine 1834 is essential for its histone acetyltransferase activity. It is therefore possible that PECAM modulation of p300 phosphorylation underlies the early activation of this enzyme in response to shear. These extracellular events ultimately lead to activation of the small G protein rac1, rearrangement of the endothelial cell actin cytoskeleton, and NF&#x003ba;B activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>).</p><p>In summary, these studies identify a previously unidentified role for p300 in modulation of eNOS transcription in human endothelial cells. Laminar shear increases p300 acetyltransferase activity, which in turn coordinates opening of chromatin near the shear stress response element in the eNOS promoter and activation of p65 and thus promotes p65 binding to the eNOS promoter. Inhibition of p300 either pharmacologically or by small interfering RNA completely prevents the increase in eNOS caused by shear. p300 also modulates activity of other transcription factors, including KLF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>), and it is probable that its influence extends beyond regulation of NF&#x003ba;B activity.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal">Davies, P.
