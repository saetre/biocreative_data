the development and function of different neuronal populations is still largely unknown. We report that miRNAs are required for terminal differentiation of olfactory precursors in both mouse and zebrafish but are dispensable for proper function of mature olfactory neurons. The repertoire of miRNAs expressed in olfactory tissues contains over 100 distinct miRNAs. A subset, including the miR-200 family, shows high olfactory enrichment and expression patterns consistent with a role during olfactory neurogenesis. Loss of function of the miR-200 family phenocopies the terminal differentiation defect observed in absence of all miRNA activity in olfactory progenitors. Our data support the notion that vertebrate tissue differentiation is controlled by conserved subsets of organ-specific miRNAs in both mouse and zebrafish and provide insights into control mechanisms underlying olfactory differentiation in vertebrates.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>DEVBIO</kwd><kwd>MOLNEURO</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute a large class of small noncoding RNAs that provide multicellular organisms with elaborate yet poorly understood strategies for posttranscriptional gene regulation (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bartel, 2004</xref>). Hybridization to fully or partially complementary sequences enables miRNAs to specifically direct degradation or translational inhibition of target transcripts (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Plasterk, 2006</xref>). Genetic analyses in invertebrate systems have identified essential roles for miRNAs in the regulation of various developmental processes, including specific steps of neuronal differentiation. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>lsy-6</italic> and <italic>miR-273</italic> have been reported to participate in negative-feedback loops that ensure asymmetric expression of taste receptors in chemosensory neurons (<xref rid="bib12 bib30" ref-type="bibr">Chang et&#x000a0;al., 2004; Johnston and Hobert, 2003</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, miR-7 has been implicated in photoreceptor cell differentiation through regulation of local EGF receptor signaling (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Li and Carthew, 2005</xref>). The essential roles played by some miRNAs in controlling invertebrate neurogenesis and the dynamic patterns of miRNA expression during vertebrate development have raised the issue as to whether miRNAs might similarly regulate aspects of vertebrate neural development (<xref rid="bib41 bib33 bib9 bib39" ref-type="bibr">Miska et&#x000a0;al., 2004; Kosik and Krichevsky, 2006; Cao et&#x000a0;al., 2006; Makeyev et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). This question has remained unanswered because loss-of-function studies of specific neural microRNAs in vertebrates have not yet been performed.</p><p>Thanks to its molecular and genetic tractability, the process of olfactory neurogenesis offers a unique opportunity to uncover regulatory networks underlying neuronal specification and differentiation. The main olfactory epithelium (MOE) of mammals is a pseudostratified epithelium, which extends from an underlying basal lamina to the lumen of the nasal cavity. Olfactory neurogenesis in rodents is initiated at midgestation with the thickening and invagination of the bilaterally symmetric olfactory placodes. The posterodorsal recess of the placodal epithelium differentiates into a mature, self-regenerating sensory epithelium that contains a highly heterogeneous and constantly renewing population of neurons and neuronal precursors (reviewed in <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Dulac and Zakhary, 2004</xref>). Adult MOE contains three major cell groups: basal cells, olfactory sensory neurons (OSN), and supporting cells. The basal cells are a population of dividing cells located adjacent to the basal lamina that continuously generate olfactory progenitors, which in turn differentiate into olfactory neurons. In the mouse, each mature olfactory sensory neuron expresses a unique olfactory receptor gene from a large family of approximately 1000 genes such that all neurons expressing the same receptor transcript are randomly dispersed within one of four broad zones of the olfactory epithelium (<xref rid="bib8 bib13 bib40 bib47 bib58" ref-type="bibr">Buck and Axel, 1991; Chess et&#x000a0;al., 1994; Malnic et&#x000a0;al., 1999; Ressler et&#x000a0;al., 1993; Vassar et&#x000a0;al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>What are the transcriptional regulators underlying such sensory diversity? Genetic analysis of the olfactory epithelium has pointed to the essential role played by basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-containing transcription factors related to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> proteins achaete-scute and atonal in controlling MOE development (reviewed in <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bertrand et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>). Mature olfactory sensory neurons do not develop in mice with a targeted deletion of the achaete-scute homolog, Mash1 (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Guillemot et&#x000a0;al., 1993</xref>). Expression of Mash1 in early olfactory progenitor cells (OPCs) controls expression of the bHLH-containing transcription factors Ngn1 and NeuroD, which in turn regulate olfactory differentiation (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Cau et&#x000a0;al., 1997</xref>). The larger process of morphogenesis, patterning, and differentiation of the nasal cavity into its various sensory and nonsensory components is controlled by the spatially restricted release of various signaling molecules, such as sonic hedgehog (Shh), retinoic acid (RA), bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), and the fibroblast growth factor FGF8 (<xref rid="bib35 bib31" ref-type="bibr">LaMantia et&#x000a0;al., 2000; Kawauchi et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>What roles, if any, are played by miRNAs during this process? We describe here the characterization of the repertoire of miRNAs expressed in the adult and the developing olfactory system, which includes several miRNA families that appear highly enriched in olfactory tissues. The specific expression of miRNA subsets by distinct olfactory cell populations in the embryo and the adult is consistent with the idea that miRNAs may play specific and significant roles in the mature and developing olfactory system. Analyses of genetically modified mice in which mature olfactory sensory neurons have been depleted of Dicer function, an enzyme required for the production of functional miRNAs (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bernstein et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>), demonstrate that miRNAs are dispensable in terminally differentiated olfactory neurons. By contrast, conditional knockout of Dicer in olfactory progenitor cells causes developmental arrest and degeneration of the olfactory neuroepithelium, while the adjacent, nonneural respiratory epithelium persists. Antisense morpholino experiments in zebrafish reveal that the inhibition of expression of a single miRNA family, miR-200, largely phenocopies the defect in terminal olfactory differentiation resulting from lack of Dicer function in mouse olfactory progenitor cells. Preliminary data suggest that lunatic fringe (<italic>lfng</italic>) and zinc-finger homeobox 1 (<italic>zfhx1</italic>), two key factors associated with Notch and BMP pathways, respectively, as well as <italic>foxg1</italic>, a transcription factor required for normal olfactory development, may be relevant miR-200 targets. Our data support the notion that vertebrate tissue differentiation is controlled by subsets of organ-specific miRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>The Repertoire of miRNAs in the Mature and Developing Olfactory System</title><p>In order to understand the roles played by miRNAs during olfactory development, we aimed to identify the repertoire of miRNAs expressed in peripheral olfactory tissues. Reverse-transcribed and amplified cDNA generated from the 18&#x02013;26 nucleotide small RNA fraction of olfactory as well as from various neural and nonneural tissues dissected from newborn and adult rats were hybridized to microarrays capable of detecting the expression of 138 known mammalian miRNAs (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Miska et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>). Ninety-four (68%) of these known miRNAs were present at detectable levels in the adult and newborn MOE, vomeronasal organ (VNO), or olfactory bulb (OB) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A and see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref> available online). Forty-one miRNAs (30%), including many of the let-7 variants, show expression in all tissues examined, whether olfactory derived or not (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref>). By contrast, we identified 12 miRNAs corresponding to 9 families (miR-199, miR-140, miR-152, miR-214, miR-205, miR-200, miR-183, miR-182, miR-96) that displayed highly enriched expression in the olfactory system (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A). Hierarchical clustering confirmed that the miRNA repertoire from each primary olfactory tissue (i.e., newborn and adult MOE and VNO) is more similar to each other than to any other neural or nonneural tissue tested. Data obtained by the microarray assay were subsequently validated by northern blot analyses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>B), which confirmed the enrichment of subsets of miRNA families in the olfactory system.</p><p>In order to comprehensively characterize the repertoire of olfactory miRNAs, including species that may not be included in the microarray described above, we systematically cloned small RNAs between 18 and 26 nucleotides in length from adult VNO and adult and newborn MOE and sequenced 3600 clones. We obtained 643, 1036, and 883 small RNAs from rat postnatal day 1 (P1) MOE tissue, P60 MOE, and P60 VNO, respectively, of which 317 (49%), 595 (57%), and 267 (30%) corresponded to known miRNAs (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S2</xref>). Not surprisingly, miR-124 and let-7 variants, known to be highly expressed in the brain (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Lagos-Quintana et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>), were among the most abundant miRNAs identified by direct cloning. In addition, we cloned members of eight of the nine miRNA families predicted by the microarray assay to be highly enriched in the olfactory system. One of these families, miR-200 family comprising miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-429, and miR-141, also highly detected by microarray, was among the most frequently cloned species in all olfactory tissues examined (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S2</xref>).</p><p>Excluding sequences corresponding to known miRNAs, ribosomal genes, and mRNAs, 100 small RNA sequences not present in the microarray were identified. Among them, we used the following criteria to identify genuine miRNAs: 18&#x02013;24 nucleotides in length, prediction of a stem loop structure for the miRNA precursor (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Zuker, 2003</xref>), and detection of an 18&#x02013;24 nucleotide band by northern hybridization analyses. To distinguish miRNAs from other small RNAs or degradation products, we evaluated the probability of the &#x0223c;60 base pair genomic sequence immediately upstream and downstream of a candidate miRNA to form a hairpin structure using Mfold, a program designed for analysis of RNA secondary structure (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Zuker, 2003</xref>). Thirty of the 100 clones passed the filters and were further tested for expression in olfactory tissues by northern hybridization analyses. Of these, 18 clones displayed the expected 18&#x02013;24 nucleotide bands and were subsequently listed in miRBase database, among which nine appeared highly enriched in the olfactory and vomeronasal epithelia (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>C).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>Cellular Distribution of microRNAs in the Mature and Developing Olfactory System</title><p>In order to gain cellular resolution of miRNA expression, we performed in situ hybridization experiments in mouse tissues using locked-nucleic-acid (LNA)-modified DNA oligonucleotide probes (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Wienholds et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>A). Experiments in zebrafish have previously established that LNA probes specifically recognize mature miRNA species and do not hybridize with precursor miRNAs. Moreover, LNA probes are highly specific and can discriminate among members of the same miRNA family (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Wienholds et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). We focused our efforts on 24 miRNAs that displayed strong and preferential expression in the developing and mature olfactory system by northern blot analyses (list, sequence, and summary of expression patterns of the 24 miRNAs are found in <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S3</xref>). Although a subset of the LNA probes (6 of 24) did not yield any signal, most probes generated detectable expression patterns. Five of 24 probes, including miR-449 and miR-205, displayed expression limited to the nonneural respiratory epithelium (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>A, left column, and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S3</xref>). Five of 24 miRNAs, including miR-199a<sup>&#x02217;</sup> and miR-140<sup>&#x02217;</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>A, center column, and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S3</xref>), showed expression in the mesenchyme underlying or cartilage surrounding the MOE and VNO. Finally, 8 of 24 miRNA probes, including miR-200a and miR-200b, as well as miR-96, miR-141, miR-182, miR-183, miR-191, and miR-429, revealed robust expression in the MOE and VNO neuroepithelium, with weaker expression in the adjacent respiratory epithelium (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>A, right column, and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S3</xref>). Expression was excluded from the supporting cell layer located adjacent to the nasal lumen and was detectable in both immature and mature MOE and VNO neuroepithelia (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A, right column, and 2B, lower panel). Across our study, we did not identify any miRNA species that were differentially expressed between the VNO and the MOE neuroepithelium.</p><p>The intriguing specificity and intensity of expression of the miR-200 family members in the MOE prompted us to pursue an in-depth investigation of their distribution during embryonic development and in the adult. Expression of the miR-200 family can be detected in olfactory placodes as early as E9.5, which is the first identifiable stage of olfactory development, with continued expression within the MOE anlage in the posterodorsal aspect of the olfactory pit at E11.5 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>B). From E13.5 onward, miR-200b expression becomes evenly expressed throughout the MOE at the exclusion of the supporting cell layer (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>B). In the adult, the expression pattern of all miR-200 family members is restricted to the immature and mature neuronal cell layers of the MOE and is excluded from the basal and sustentacular cell layers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>B). In mouse, the miR-200 family is composed of five family members (miR-141, -200a, -200b, -200c, -429) clustered into two loci of chromosomes 4 and 6 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>C). All individual members of the miR-200 family display similar expression patterns. However, miR-141 and -200a express different 5&#x02032; seed heptamers from miR- 200b, -200c, and -429 and are thus likely to form two functional subgroups within the miR-200 family (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>C; <xref rid="bib14 bib37" ref-type="bibr">Doench and Sharp, 2004; Lewis et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). The strong, specific, and coordinated expression of miR-200 members in the MOE anlage and in the mature and immature MOE is consistent with a potential role of this miRNA family during MOE neurogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>Conditional Dicer Inactivation in Olfactory Progenitors and Mature Neurons</title><p>In order to evaluate the potential roles played by miRNAs during olfactory development and in mature olfactory neurons, we used a previously established conditional null allele of Dicer to inactivate Dicer function within specific olfactory cell types (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>A; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Harfe et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In order to abolish Dicer function in mature olfactory neurons, we took advantage of the specific expression of the olfactory marker protein (OMP) in fully differentiated MOE and VNO neurons. Mice harboring the conditional Dicer allele were crossed with a mouse line in which Cre recombinase is expressed under the control of the endogenous OMP promoter (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Eggan et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>). To verify the efficiency of our genetic strategy, we monitored the expression of miRNAs in OMP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells of control and mutant animals. In wild-type animals, the expression of OMP and miR-200b is partially overlapping, with OMP exclusively expressed by differentiated neurons located in the apical half of the neuroepithelium, while miR-200b is expressed throughout the neuroepithelium in both mature and immature neurons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>B). In contrast, upon Cre-mediated deletion of Dicer in OMP-positive cells, miR-200b expression is abolished from the apical portion of the neuroepithelium, while it is maintained within basal immature neurons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>B). Northern blot analysis confirmed that the level of miR-200b expression throughout the entire olfactory epithelium is reduced by &#x0223c;50%, due to the absence of miRNA processing in OMP-expressing neurons, while it remains in immature precursor cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>B).</p><p>In order to abolish miRNA processing in olfactory progenitors, we took advantage of the early expression of Foxg1 in the developing olfactory placodes (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Kawauchi et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). Mice harboring the conditional Dicer allele were crossed with a mouse line expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the endogenous Foxg1 promoter (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Hebert and McConnell, 2000</xref>). Cre activity has been detected in the olfactory placodes of Foxg1-Cre mouse embryos as early as E9.5 (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Kawauchi et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>), ensuring that Dicer function is abolished at a stage prior to, or concurrent with, the initiation of olfactory neurogenesis. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>C, miR-200a is widely expressed throughout the developing MOE neuroepithelium in embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) wild-type mice. In marked contrast, miR-200a expression is undetectable in the MOE of E13.5 Foxg1-Cre<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup>; Dicer<sup>loxP/loxP</sup> mutants, despite the fact that the main olfactory epithelium is still present at this stage, as revealed by Foxg1 staining in adjacent sections (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>C). Similarly, expression of miRNAs from the respiratory epithelium, such as miR-449, is abolished in E16.5 Foxg1-Cre<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup>; Dicer<sup>loxP/loxP</sup> mutants, confirming that Dicer function can be effectively knocked out in all structures originating from the olfactory placodes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>C). These experiments confirm that a dual genetic strategy can specifically prevent generation of mature miRNAs in olfactory neurons or in their progenitors.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>miRNAs Are Required for Maintenance but Not Initiation of Olfactory Neurogenesis</title><p>Foxg1-Cre; Dicer<sup>loxP/loxP</sup> animals die in utero, have small eyes and forebrains, and develop small snouts. At E10.5, no gross morphological defect is detectable in the olfactory pits of Foxg1-Cre<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup>; Dicer<sup>loxP/loxP</sup> mutant animals relative to wild-type controls. However, the number of cells positive for neuroD, a marker of committed progenitor cells of the neuronal lineage (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Cau et&#x000a0;al., 1997</xref>), is reduced by 18% compared to mutant olfactory pits (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>A, mean &#x000b1; SEM, WT 41.71 &#x000b1; 2.10, n &#x0003d; 5; mutant 34.33 &#x000b1; 1.60, n &#x0003d; 4, p &#x0003c; 0.01, Student's t test). Quantification of postmitotic neurons, as assayed by Hu-C/D expression, showed a 28% reduction in olfactory pits of mutant embryos compared to wild-type controls (mean &#x000b1; SEM, WT 45.82 &#x000b1; 2.57, n &#x0003d; 3; mutant 31.32 &#x000b1; 2.09, n &#x0003d; 3, &#x0003c; 0.01, Student's t test) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>A).</p><p>By E13.5, the reduced expression of olfactory progenitor markers, such as Mash1 and Ngn1, and the marked thinning of the neuroepithelium indicate a severe defect in neurogenesis in the mutant MOE (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>). Moreover, expression of mature olfactory neuronal markers, such as OMP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>B) and olfactory receptors (data not shown) is not detectable in Foxg1-Cre<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup>; Dicer<sup>loxP/loxP</sup> mutant MOE, suggesting that mutant olfactory progenitor cells do not terminally differentiate. At subsequent stages, we observe a specific loss of neuroepithelial cells that culminates in the total disappearance of markers of neuronal lineages, such as Mash1, Ngn1, Lhx2, and Foxg1 by E16.5 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>B). By contrast, development of the nonneural respiratory epithelial cells, as detected by the marker stratifin (Sfn) (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Visel et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>), is maintained. Thus, miRNA function appears to be required for both the terminal differentiation of olfactory neuronal precursor cells as well as for the maintenance of olfactory progenitor cells.</p><p>From early embryonic stages onward, the nasal pit is spatially segregated into several neuronal and nonneuronal components. The vomeronasal organ is located in an antero-ventral portion of the nasal septum, and the respiratory nonneuronal epithelium is located immediately ventral to the main olfactory neuroepithelium. Moreover, the MOE neuroepithelium displays a dorsoventral patterning according to which olfactory receptor gene expression is spatially restricted to one of four circumscribed zones (<xref rid="bib47 bib58" ref-type="bibr">Ressler et&#x000a0;al., 1993; Vassar et&#x000a0;al., 1993</xref>). In order to evaluate whether the defect in neurogenesis described above coincides with changes in olfactory patterning, we performed in situ hybridization using markers that distinguish between the various compartments of the embryonic olfactory cavity. At E11.5, the earliest known markers of olfactory progenitor cells, Mash1 (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Guillemot et&#x000a0;al., 1993</xref>), Ngn1 (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Cau et&#x000a0;al., 1997</xref>), and Foxg1 (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Kawauchi et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>), as well as markers of immature neurons, such as Lhx2 (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Hirota and Mombaerts, 2004</xref>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>A and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>B), show similar expression in both control and mutant animals. However, the olfactory neuroepithelium appears thinner relative to that of controls. At this stage, the expression pattern of OMACS-like, a marker of the two most dorsal MOE zones (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Oka et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>), is indistinguishable between wild-type and mutant MOE (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>A).

To test vomeronasal function, we performed a standard resident-intruder assay using 6- to 10-week-old male mice of either mutant or wild-type genetic background that had been housed in isolation for several days prior to the assay. Resident males are expected to attack a male intruder if the vomeronasal system is intact (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Stowers et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>).

In a subsequent step, we aimed at evaluating the contribution of specific miRNA species. Determination of specific miRNA families during olfactory development in mice is difficult because genetic loss-of-function analyses are hampered by redundancy within microRNA families. We reasoned that the zebrafish could provide a useful model system due to the remarkable conservation in peripheral olfactory organization between fish and mouse at the genetic, molecular, and morphological levels (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>A). For example, zonal olfactory receptor expression, signal transduction mechanisms, and olfactory bulb targeting are all conserved (reviewed in <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Hansen and Zielinski, 2005</xref>).</p><p>We first investigated the requirement of Dicer for zebrafish olfactory development. Removal of Dicer in maternal-zygotic <italic>dicer</italic> mutants eliminates all mature microRNAs during zebrafish embryogenesis and results in morphogenesis defects (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Giraldez et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). Injection of miR-430 into MZ<italic>dicer</italic> mutants rescues early abnormalities, but does not restore the function of microRNAs that are expressed at later stages of development. We therefore analyzed olfactory development in MZ<italic>dicer</italic> mutants injected with miR-430 microRNAs. Early patterning of the nervous system is unperturbed in MZ<italic>dicer</italic><sup>&#x0002b;miR430</sup> mutants, e.g., markers for specified optic stalk, forebrain, midbrain-hindbrain boundary, otic vesicles, hindbrain rhombomeres, dorsal neural tube, and ventral neural tube are present (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Giraldez et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). However, in contrast to control animals, the expression of markers of terminally differentiated olfactory sensory neurons, such as OMP and olfactory receptors, is largely abolished in MZ<italic>dicer</italic><sup>&#x0002b;miR-430</sup> mutants at 48 hpf (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>B).

These results indicate that miRNAs are critical for normal olfactory neurogenesis in both zebrafish and mouse.</p><p>To evaluate the contribution of specific miRNAs, we focused on the miR-200 family, which is highly and specifically expressed in the developing olfactory system. The function of miR-200 during olfactory development is likely to be conserved throughout evolution, as judged from the absolute conservation of miR-200 orthologs between mouse and zebrafish with respect to the relative genomic clustering position, the conserved seed region sequences, the conserved size of the family, and the conserved arm of the hairpin that generates the mature miRNA (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S3</xref>). Moreover, as shown in the mouse, miR-200 family members display early expression in zebrafish (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Wienholds et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>) and appear highly enriched in olfactory tissues by the time olfactory placodes arise at 26 hpf (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>A). Antisense morpholino oligonucleotides complementary to microRNAs hairpin sequences have been shown to specifically abolish mature miRNA activity (<xref rid="bib19 bib32" ref-type="bibr">Flynt et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Kloosterman et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). We designed three morpholino antisense oligonucleotides predicted to each target the mature sequence of one or a few members of the miR-200 family (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>A). The morpholino sequences lacked any homology to other known zebrafish transcripts. To identify the minimal concentration at which the morpholinos used in our experiments can inhibit the generation of cognate miRNAs, we injected one-cell zebrafish embryos with a range of concentrations (1 ng to 6 ng per embryo) and incubated the morphants from 18 hpf to 48 hpf before analysis. In situ hybridization analyses using LNA antisense probes to detect mature miRNAs indicated that 4 ng per embryo per miR-200 family member was the minimal dose required to knock down miRNA expression to threshold levels of detection (data not shown). Consequently, we used 4 ng dosages in all proceeding experiments. In order to test the specificity of each morpholino (MO) sequence, we systematically injected one-cell zebrafish embryos with either miR-141 MO, miR-200b MO, or miR-429 MO and performed in situ hybridization against all five miRNAs of the miR-200 family. As predicted from sequence analyses and thermal stability calculations, miR-141 MO specifically inhibited miR-200a and miR-141, miR-200b MO specifically inhibited miR-200b and miR-200c, and miR-429 MO specifically inhibited miR-429 (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>B). In addition, in situ hybridization analyses (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>C) show that a mixture of all three morpholinos (Triple MO mix: miR-141 MO, miR-200b MO, and miR-429 MO) was sufficient to simultaneously inhibit the expression of all five mature zebrafish miR-200 family members to threshold levels of detection.</p><p>Antisense experiments can be plagued by nonspecific phenotypes, such as cell death in the head, general neural degeneration, CNS necrosis, and general lethality, which are likely to result from nonspecific interactions of MOs with inappropriate targets (reviewed in <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Sumanas and Larson, 2002</xref>). In order to test for such effects in our experiments, we performed in situ hybridization with a number of genes widely expressed in the nervous system. Our data show that expression patterns of genes expressed throughout the brain and in areas devoid of miR-200 family expression were comparable between wild-type and triple MO morphants, indicating that widespread neural defects were absent in the morphant fish (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>D). Furthermore, analyses of wild-type fish and fish injected with individual or mixtures of MOs did not display any morphological signs of widespread cell death, necrosis, or lethality (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>C).

Embryos injected with either miR-141/miR-200a or miR-200b/miR-429 pairs of antisense morpholinos showed lack of expression of the corresponding miR-200 members with a given 5&#x02032; seed but did not display any change in OMP expression relative to wild-type controls (data not shown). Finally, we eliminated the function of all miR-200 family members by injecting embryos simultaneously with the Triple MO mix. Forty-eight hours after injection, triple MO morphants showed a reduction of OMP and olfactory receptor expression in the developing olfactory epithelium relative to wild-type controls (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>E). We also observed a concomitant increase in <italic>foxg1</italic> expression in the presumptive area of the olfactory epithelium (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>E).

Taken together, these results indicate that in the absence of miR-200 family expression during olfactory placodal development, zebrafish olfactory progenitors are unable to undergo normal terminal differentiation and, instead, undergo apoptosis. This phenotype closely resembles the olfactory defect resulting from the lack of Dicer expression by mouse olfactory progenitors.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.8"><title>Notch and TGF&#x003b2; Signaling Pathways and Foxg1 Are Candidate Targets of the miR-200 Family</title><p>To gain further insights into the role of the miR-200 family in mediating olfactory differentiation, we used a bioinformatic approach to predict and validate potential miR-200 targets.

Our data show that loss of miRNA function from olfactory progenitor cells produced no detectable alterations in patterning, such as main olfactory epithelial zonal patterning, initial cell fate specification, or induction of nonneural respiratory epithelium. Similarly, loss of Dicer function in several other developing tissues has been shown to leave early patterning events relatively unperturbed. For example, conditional Dicer ablation in skin epithelial progenitors does not preclude initial perinatal epidermal cell differentiation, and loss of Dicer function in developing limb mesoderm does not affect digit number or cartilage patterning (<xref rid="bib1 bib26 bib61" ref-type="bibr">Andl et&#x000a0;al., 2006; Harfe et&#x000a0;al., 2005; Yi et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, we find that terminal differentiation of the olfactory progenitor pool into mature olfactory neurons does not occur and that the olfactory precursor cell population is not maintained. In addition, the MOE epithelial cells selectively degenerate due to increased apoptosis, while the nonneural respiratory epithelium appears to develop relatively unperturbed despite the loss of miRNA function in these cells. This supports the idea that phenotypes resulting from conditional Dicer ablation are mostly manifested during the terminal differentiation phase of progenitor development. Accordingly, in the absence of miRNA activity, skin epidermal cells have been shown to develop into deformed cysts rather than invaginating, and limb buds undergo growth arrest due to global apoptosis (<xref rid="bib1 bib26 bib61" ref-type="bibr">Andl et&#x000a0;al., 2006; Harfe et&#x000a0;al., 2005; Yi et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). It is also unlikely that the observed phenotypes are due to non-cell-autonomous effects (e.g., defects in olfactory bulb-derived signals) because respiratory epithelial identity is maintained and OSNs are able to terminally differentiate despite the complete absence of an olfactory bulb (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Sullivan et&#x000a0;al., 1995</xref>). Although recent reports suggest the possibility that Cre recombinase toxicity may at least in part be responsible for the observed increase in cell death (<xref rid="bib36 bib51" ref-type="bibr">Lee et&#x000a0;al. 2006; Schmidt-Supprian and Rajewsky, 2007</xref>), this reason is unlikely to be the cause of the observed apoptosis phenotype, given that no perturbations were observed in either Foxg1-Cre<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup>; Dicer<sup>&#x0002b;/loxP</sup> control animals, which are viable, or OMP-Cre; Dicer animals in which OMP represents 0.5% of the total RNA per olfactory neuron (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Rogers et&#x000a0;al., 1985</xref>).</p><p>A unique aspect of our study was the phenotypic comparison of conditional Dicer ablation at two different stages of olfactory development&#x02014;olfactory progenitor cells and terminally differentiated olfactory sensory neurons. In marked contrast to the severe phenotype observed in Foxg1-Cre; Dicer<sup>loxP/loxP</sup> olfactory placodes, specific ablation of Dicer function in mature olfactory neurons produced no observable abnormal phenotype, as assessed by molecular, behavioral, and axon guidance assays. Although miRNA-mediated regulation has been proposed to be physiologically relevant to mature neuron function (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Schratt et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>), our results suggest that miRNA activity in mature olfactory neurons is dispensable in vivo.</p><p>We next addressed the issue of the specific contribution of discrete miRNA species in mediating olfactory development. It is widely assumed that miRNA redundancy may greatly challenge the analysis of specific miRNA function (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Plasterk, 2006</xref>). Indeed, very few miRNA mutants have been identified in traditional forward screens using such genetically tractable systems as the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila</italic> or the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Successful identification of individual miRNA functions has been accomplished in experimental systems in which the miRNA species of interest constituted a substantial fraction of the total miRNA population (<xref rid="bib20 bib62" ref-type="bibr">Giraldez et&#x000a0;al., 2005; Zhao et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). Accordingly, we decided to focus our efforts on potential functions mediated by the miR-200 family, which is among the most highly and most specifically miRNA subset expressed in the developing olfactory system. The similarity in the cellular and molecular process of olfactory development in zebrafish and mouse and the parallel olfactory defects observed in MZ<italic>dicer</italic><sup>&#x0002b;miR-430</sup> zebrafish embryos and in Foxg1-Cre; Dicer<sup>loxP/loxP</sup> mouse embryos allowed us to use an antisense morpholino-mediated strategy (<xref rid="bib19 bib32" ref-type="bibr">Flynt et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Kloosterman et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). Knocking down the expression of mature miR-200 family members led to impairment of mature olfactory marker expression and expansion of the early marker, foxg1, in the olfactory primordium. These results suggest that the loss of miR-200 family function disrupts terminal differentiation of olfactory progenitor cells, thus phenocopying an important aspect of the defects observed in mouse Foxg1-Cre; Dicer<sup>loxP/loxP</sup> mutant MOE. The miR-200 family is therefore among the first neuronal miRNA families in vertebrates with a loss-of-function phenotype.</p><p>How does the miR-200 family mediate its control of olfactory neurogenesis? Intriguingly, miR-200 family members are coordinately expressed from different loci, yet members express different 5&#x02032; seed heptamers, changes in which are thought to alter the binding specificity to target mRNA (<xref rid="bib14 bib37" ref-type="bibr">Doench and Sharp, 2004; Lewis et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). The morpholino knockdown experiments show that miR-200 family members are likely to act redundantly, even though they display different 5&#x02032; seed regions. In addition, our preliminary microarray and GFP-sensor experiments suggest that <italic>foxg1</italic> itself, as well as lunatic fringe (lfng) and zinc-finger homeobox 1 (zfhx1), two key factors associated with Notch and BMP pathways, respectively, may be genuine miR-200 targets. Further experiments must be conducted to determine the physiological relevance of these targets. In addition, other predicted miR-200 family targets may also contribute to the olfactory phenotypes observed in morphant fish and the Foxg1-Cre;Dicer<sup>loxP/loxP</sup> mutant mice.</p><p>Recently, independent reports have demonstrated that the miR-200 family is highly expressed in skin epidermal cells (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Yi et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). The progenitors of this epidermal cell population are thought to share many common mechanisms of progenitor cell development with olfactory progenitors. For example, cytokeratin 14, a marker of skin epithelial progenitor cells, is also expressed in olfactory basal progenitors (<xref rid="bib29 bib57" ref-type="bibr">Holbrook et&#x000a0;al., 1995; Vaioukhin et&#x000a0;al., 1999</xref>), and both cell types regenerate throughout life. Moreover, lfng is expressed in the basal layer of the epidermis containing the progenitor cells (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Th&#x000e9;lu et&#x000a0;al., 1998</xref>), and both Notch and BMP signaling are important regulators of epidermal progenitor differentiation (<xref rid="bib7 bib43" ref-type="bibr">Botchkarev and Sharov, 2004; Nicolas et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). Thus, the regulatory step involving the miR-200 family, and shown here to be essential for olfactory neurogenesis, may be employed by other systems of epithelial origin to ensure the proper mediation of critical signaling cascades during development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials-methods" id="sec4"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="sec4.1"><title>miRNA Isolation, miRNA Microarray, and Small RNA Cloning</title><p>Total RNA was isolated as described in <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Data</xref>. 300 &#x003bc;g of total RNAs for each tissue were size fractionated on denaturing PAGE gels.
