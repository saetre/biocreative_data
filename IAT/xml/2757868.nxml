We combined 5-bromo-2&#x02032;-deoxyuridine pulse labeling with sensitive en face immunoconfocal microscopy analysis, and quantified intimal cell proliferation and Ly-6C<sup>high</sup> monocyte recruitment in low density lipoprotein receptor&#x02013;null mice. Cell proliferation begins in nascent lesions preferentially at their periphery, and proliferating cells accumulate in lesions over time. Although intimal cell proliferation increases in parallel to monocyte recruitment as lesions grow, proliferation continues when monocyte recruitment is inhibited. The majority of proliferating intimal cells are dendritic cells expressing CD11c and major histocompatibility complex class II and 33D1, but not CD11b. Systemic injection of granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) markedly increased cell proliferation in early lesions, whereas function-blocking anti&#x02013;GM-CSF antibody inhibited proliferation. These findings establish GM-CSF as a key regulator of intimal cell proliferation in lesions, and demonstrate that both proliferation and monocyte recruitment contribute to the inception of atherosclerosis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>In atherosclerosis, serum lipoproteins, particularly low density lipoprotein (LDL), accumulate in the arterial intima through binding to matrix proteoglycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sk&#x000e5;l&#x000e9;n et al., 2002</xref>) and undergo oxidative modification. Blood monocytes are recruited into these regions of the intima, differentiate into macrophages or DCs, and internalize oxidatively modified lipoproteins via scavenger receptors or by macropinocytosis (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Moore and Freeman, 2006</xref>). BM-derived cells accumulate in early mouse atherosclerotic lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mullick et al., 2008</xref>), and monocyte recruitment persists in advanced lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Swirski et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tacke et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Circulating monocytes consist of at least two subpopulations, with distinct expression of cell-surface markers, chemokine receptors, and functions during inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Grage-Griebenow et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Geissmann et al., 2003</xref>). In mice, the Ly-6C<sup>high</sup> subset is elevated during hypercholesterolemia and is preferentially recruited to atherosclerotic lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Swirski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tacke et al., 2007</xref>). Ly-6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes express abundant L-selectin and multiple chemokine receptors, including CCR2, but relatively low levels of CX3CR1. Ly-6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes express higher levels of CX3CR1, and low to nondetectable levels of most chemokine receptors, L-selectin and Ly-6C. Thus, it is intriguing that recruitment of Ly-6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes to lesions is dependent on CCR2, CCR5, and CX3CR1, whereas recruitment of Ly-6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes is independent of CX3CR1 and dependent on CCR5, which is up-regulated in hypercholesterolemic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tacke et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Fatty streaks are composed almost entirely of myeloid foam cells, and their formation and lateral expansion are critically dependent on monocytes/macrophages. This was demonstrated using osteopetrotic mice that have a point mutation that disrupts M-CSF and are deficient in circulating monocytes, tissue macrophages, and osteoclasts. Osteopetrotic mice are highly protected from atherosclerosis in the setting of hypercholesterolemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Smith et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Qiao et al., 1997</xref>), and these studies implicate monocytes and their progeny as key cells in lesion development. In contrast to M-CSF, deficiency of GM-CSF has no significant effects on circulating monocytes or tissue macrophages, and variable effects on mouse atherosclerotic lesion formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ditiatkovski et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Shaposhnik et al., 2007</xref>). An interesting feature in the setting of GM-CSF deficiency is a decrease of CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells in lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Shaposhnik et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The biology of macrophages and DCs in atherosclerotic lesions is complex. These cells can proliferate or undergo apoptosis, and both processes have been observed primarily in advanced human and experimental lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rosenfeld and Ross, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Orekhov et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Merched et al., 2003</xref>) and in a vascular occlusion model in hypercholesterolemic apolipoprotein E&#x02013;deficient (<italic>Apoe<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lessner et al., 2002</xref>). The prevailing opinion is that monocyte recruitment accounts for the formation of early lesions, and the relationship of proliferation to monocyte recruitment is not understood. A key impediment has been the lack of a sensitive approach to study cell proliferation and monocyte recruitment in early lesions. We used BrdU pulse labeling combined with en face confocal microscopy of the mouse aorta to detect cell proliferation and Ly-6C<sup>high</sup> monocyte recruitment, and localize them with respect to lipid accumulation in the intima. We found that intimal cell proliferation begins in nascent lesions preferentially at the periphery, increases as lesions progress in parallel to monocyte recruitment, primarily involves DCs, and is dependent on GM-CSF but not monocyte recruitment.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>BrdU pulse labeling preferentially labels Ly-6C<sup>high</sup> blood monocytes</title><p>BrdU is stably incorporated into the DNA of cells during the S phase of the cell cycle. Pulse labeling is achieved because injected BrdU is cleared from the plasma within hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kriss and Revesz, 1962</xref>). BrdU labels proliferating monocyte precursors in the BM, and labeled monocytes appear in the circulation after 4&#x02013;6 h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Goto et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jongstra-Bilen et al., 2006</xref>). We used flow cytometry to investigate BrdU labeling of BM and blood monocyte subsets in wild-type C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 a</xref>). BrdU<sup>+</sup> Ly-6C<sup>high</sup>CD115<sup>high</sup> cells were detected in the BM at 2 h, increased, and reached a plateau at 12 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 b</xref>). In the blood, BrdU<sup>+</sup> Ly-6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes were not detected within 6 h but increased rapidly thereafter and reached a plateau at 12&#x02013;24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 b</xref>), at which time 35&#x02013;45% of circulating blood Ly-6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes were BrdU<sup>+</sup>. Ly-6C<sup>neg</sup>CD115<sup>high</sup> BM cells and blood monocytes did not stain for BrdU. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of BM BrdU-labeled Ly-6C<sup>high</sup>CD115<sup>high</sup> cells declined over time, consistent with ongoing rapid proliferation of monocyte precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 c</xref>). In contrast, the MFI of BrdU<sup>+</sup> Ly-6C<sup>high</sup> blood monocytes remained relatively stable over 24 h.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Analysis of BrdU pulse-labeled monocyte subpopulations in the BM and blood using flow cytometry.</bold> (a, left) A dot plot of a blood sample from a C57BL/6 mouse obtained 18 h after BrdU injection illustrates identification of monocyte subsets.

BrdU<sup>+</sup> nuclei were also quantified 24 h after BrdU injection when proliferating intimal cells as well as BM-derived BrdU-labeled Ly-6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes recruited from the blood are detected. As we reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jongstra-Bilen et al., 2006</xref>), in the ascending aorta of normal C57BL/6 mice (<italic>Ldlr</italic><sup>+/+</sup>), we found very low proliferation at 2 h only in the LC (0.5 BrdU<sup>+</sup> nuclei; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 b</xref>). At 24 h, BrdU<sup>+</sup> nuclei increased by 20-fold to 10.3 &#x000b1; 2.3 nuclei, which represents mostly recruited BrdU-labeled Ly-6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes and is consistent with our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jongstra-Bilen et al., 2006</xref>).

Another possibility is that labeled intimal cells complete mitosis within 3 h. Consistent with this, BrdU<sup>+</sup> nuclear doublets that likely represent daughter cells also increased within 3 h (Fig. S1, e and f).</p><p>Proliferating intimal cells may divide to produce two daughter cells or, alternatively, may undergo apoptosis. The fate of proliferating intimal cells was investigated by inhibiting blood monocyte recruitment with pertussis toxin (PTx). PTx inactivates G&#x003b1;i chemokine receptors and has been used in vivo to study the contribution of chemokine receptors versus E-selectin&#x02013;triggered integrin activation in neutrophil recruitment to the inflamed peritoneal cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Smith et al., 2004</xref>).

These data illustrate an important difference in monocytes versus neutrophil signaling. As was shown previously, neutrophil binding to E-selectin induces a compensatory signaling pathway that bypasses G&#x003b1;<sub>i</sub> signaling irreversibly blocked by PTx, whereas our data suggest that this compensatory pathway is not operative in monocytes.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>PTx blockade of monocyte recruitment reveals that proliferating intimal cells accumulate in 2-wk lesions, and intimal cell proliferation is independent of monocyte recruitment.</bold> (a) Flow cytometry plots of peritoneal exudate cells harvested 24 h after i.p. thioglycollate injection of control and PTx-treated mice (percentages are indicated).

The LC intima of the ascending aortic arch, which contains lesions, was compared with the nondiseased greater curvature (GC), a region that is protected from atherosclerotic lesion development. Expression of GMR&#x003b1; was markedly elevated in lesions relative to the uninvolved GC intima (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 a</xref>). There was also enrichment of DCs and myeloid cell markers (CD11c and CD68) in lesions, but expressions of T cell (CD3), smooth muscle cell (SM22&#x003b1;), and endothelial cell (CD31 and intercellular adhesion molecule 2) markers were comparable. Having established that GMR&#x003b1; is expressed in 2-wk lesions, two complementary experiments directly evaluated the role of GM-CSF in intimal cell proliferation. Injection of mouse GM-CSF increased the abundance of BrdU<sup>+</sup> nuclei by 2.7-fold in 2-wk intimal lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 b</xref>), indicating that many cells in lesions are capable of proliferating after exposure to GM-CSF. In this experiment, BrdU<sup>+</sup> leukocytes were not detected in the circulation. Injection of a function-blocking antibody to GM-CSF reduced the number of proliferating cells in lesions by 4.8-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 c</xref>).

Leukocyte recruitment and intimal cell proliferation or death can independently result in differences in lesion burden. This study illustrates a practical, sensitive, and reproducible approach for quantifying cellular events in atherosclerosis. BrdU pulse labeling combined with en face confocal microscopy provides quantitative information on intimal cell proliferation, as well as recruitment of Ly-6C<sup>high</sup> blood monocytes within a 24-h window. Using this approach, we showed that proliferation of intimal cells and recruitment of BM-derived Ly-6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes increase progressively from the inception of atherosclerosis. Experiments with PTx suggested that the two processes occur independently of each other and raise the possibility that blockade of recruitment or proliferation individually may result in a compensatory response. Thus, for effective therapy it may be necessary to target both processes. Previously, GM-CSF was reported to function in the differentiation of monocytes to DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Chapuis et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Daro et al., 2000</xref>) and in the proliferation of mouse DC precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Inaba et al., 1992</xref>). Our current data support an important role for GM-CSF in mediating intimal DC proliferation in early atherosclerotic lesions and suggest that it may be prudent to block functions of this cytokine when administering a therapy for early atherosclerosis that targets monocyte recruitment.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Mice, BrdU labeling, and treatment with PTx, GM-CSF, or antibody to GM-CSF.</title><p>Wild-type C57BL/6 and <italic>Ldlr<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice backcrossed &#x0003e;10 generations into the C57BL/6 background obtained from the Jackson Laboratory were bred.
