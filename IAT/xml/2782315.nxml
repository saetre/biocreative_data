The lipid messenger PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> is generated by several of these enzymes when targeted to distinct cellular compartments. Several splice variants of the type&#x000a0;I&#x003b3; isoform of PIPK (PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> 5-kinase), which generate PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub>, have been identified, and each splice variant is thought to serve a unique functional role within cells. Here, we have identified two novel C-terminal splice variants of PIPKI&#x003b3; in human cells consisting of 700 and 707 amino acids. These two splice variants are expressed in multiple tissue types&#x000a0;and display PIPK activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. Interestingly, both of these novel splice variants display distinct subcellular targeting. With the addition of these two new splice isoforms, there are minimally five PIPKI&#x003b3; splice variants that have been identified in mammals. Therefore, we propose the use of the HUGO (Human Genome Organization) nomenclature in the naming of the splice isoforms. PIPKI&#x003b3;_i4 (700 amino acids) is present in the nucleus, a targeting pattern that has not been previously observed in any PIPKI&#x003b3; splice variant. PIPKI&#x003b3;_i5 (707 amino acids) is targeted to intracellular vesicle-like structures, where it co-localizes with markers of several types of endosomal compartments. As occurs with other PIPKI&#x003b3; splice variants, the distinctive C-terminal sequences of PIPKI&#x003b3;_i4 and PIPKI&#x003b3;_i5 may facilitate association with unique protein targeting factors, thereby localizing the kinases to their appropriate cellular subdomains for the site-specific generation of PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub>.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="kwd"><kwd>cadherin</kwd><kwd>endosomal trafficking</kwd><kwd>phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>]</kwd><kwd>phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase type&#x000a0;I&#x003b3; (PIPKI&#x003b3;)</kwd><kwd>splice variant</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="abbr"><kwd>AP, adaptor protein</kwd><kwd>DTT, dithiothreitol</kwd><kwd>EEA1, early endosome antigen 1</kwd><kwd>EGF, epidermal growth factor</kwd><kwd>HA, haemagglutinin</kwd><kwd>HGVS, Human Genome Variation Society</kwd><kwd>His<sub>6</sub>, hexahistidine</kwd><kwd>HUGO, Human Genome Organization</kwd><kwd>LAMP1, lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1</kwd><kwd>PIPKI&#x003b3;, type&#x000a0;I&#x003b3; isoform of PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> 5-kinase</kwd><kwd>RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends</kwd><kwd>SC-35, splicing factor, arginine/serine-rich 2</kwd><kwd>siRNA, small interfering RNA</kwd><kwd>TfnR, transferrin receptor</kwd><kwd>UTR, untranslated region</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="1"/><ref-count count="46"/><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The signalling pathways that utilize members of the PtdIns<italic>P</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> family of lipids to transduce messages from one functional complex to another are as distinct as they are complex. PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> is positioned at the crossroads of many of these signalling cascades, as it may be metabolized by phospholipase C to generate Ins(1,4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>3</sub> and 1,2-diacylglycerol, further phosphorylated at the 3-position of the inositol ring by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to generate PtdIns(3,4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>3</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] or used directly as a messenger molecule by binding to proteins containing PH (pleckstrin homology), PX (phox homology), FERM (band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesin) or comparable domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However, the method of PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> generation utilized in these pathways results in its availability being far from ubiquitous. Rather, PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> seems to be synthesized in a highly site-specific manner at distinct subcellular locales where it is directly utilized as a signalling molecule, thereby modulating the activity, conformation, assembly or disassembly of proteins at these sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The spatial and temporal metabolism of PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> has emerged as a crucial regulator of multiple cellular processes, including actin reorganization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], focal-adhesion dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], endocytosis and exocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], nuclear signalling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Most cellular PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> generation is fulfilled by the &#x003b1;, &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; isoforms of the type&#x000a0;I PIPKs (PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> 5-kinases). Although retaining high homology within the lipid kinase domain, each isoform exhibits a distinct subcellular localization pattern and functional specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. It is believed that the N- and C-terminal sequence divergence of each PIPKI isoform contributes to this diversity in targeting and function. PIPKI&#x003b1; participates in both nuclear and cytoplasmic PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> generation, where it has been implicated in the regulation of RNA polyadenlyation machinery and growth-factor-induced reorganization of the cytoskeletal superstructure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The cellular roles of PIPKI&#x003b2; are less defined, but a function for PIPKI&#x003b2; in actin assembly and endocytosis has been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>The newest member of the type&#x000a0;I family, PIPKI&#x003b3; (type I&#x003b3; PIPK), is a workhorse for site-specific PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> generation in a plethora of cytoplasmic processes. PIPKI&#x003b3; is a fundamental regulator of the assembly and disassembly of sites of cell-matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and cell&#x02013;cell interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] termed focal adhesions and adherens junctions respectively. Importantly, the human PIPKI&#x003b3; is known to encode at least two alternative splice variants, PIPKI&#x003b3;640 and PIPKI&#x003b3;668 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. These splice variants differ by the inclusion of exon 17, which encodes a 28-amino-acid C-terminal extension specific to PIPKI&#x003b3;668 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. This 28-amino-acid extension has been demonstrated to confer specific subcellular targeting and function on PIPKI&#x003b3;668, where it consequently regulates focal adhesion dynamics, EGF (epidermal growth factor)-stimulated directional migration, basolateral targeting of E-cadherin, and endocytosis of the TfnR (transferrin receptor) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Aside from mediating specific protein&#x02013;protein interactions, this extension also affords several methods of regulating PIPKI&#x003b3;668 activity, as it is tyrosine- and serine-phosphorylated by Src [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and cyclin-dependent kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] respectively. In addition, PIPKI&#x003b3; can be directly phosphorylated by EGFR (EGF receptor) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. These phosphorylation events are in turn antagonized by specific phosphatases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In the absence of a specific C-terminal extension, PIPKI&#x003b3;640 also plays a specific cellular role, as it is the major contributor of the PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> utilized in G-protein-coupled-receptor-mediated Ins(1,4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>3</sub> generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>A third PIPKI&#x003b3; splice variant consisting of 688 amino acids was described in mouse and rat neuronal tissue by Giudici et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In addition to containing the 28-amino-acid C-terminal extension of PIPKI&#x003b3;668, this novel splice variant also contained a unique 26-amino-acid sequence inserted prior to the extension first defined in PIPKI&#x003b3;668 and appears to be neuronal-specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Although Giudici et al. uncovered the presence of a sequence homologous with this insertion in the human genome, they did not confirm its existence in human tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Here, we provide evidence that two unique PIPKI&#x003b3; C-terminal splice variants do indeed exist in human cells. The two novel splice variants consist of 700 and 707 amino acids, possess PIPK activity, and are expressed in a multitude of cell types&#x000a0;and tissues. Importantly, these splice variants display subcellular localization patterns that are unique from PIPKI&#x003b3;640 or PIPKI&#x003b3;668, suggesting that each splice variant likely fills a distinct functional role within cells. Since the discovery of these two new splice variants further complicates the PIPKI&#x003b3; nomenclature, all further instances of PIP5K1C gene products mentioned in the present paper have been assigned nomenclature based on the guidelines established by the Genetic Nomenclature Committee of HUGO (Human Genome Organization) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Following this convention, the unique PIPKI&#x003b3; mRNAs described herein are referred to as PIPKI&#x003b3;_v4 and PIPKI&#x003b3;_v5, whereas their protein products are termed PIPKI&#x003b3;_i4 and PIPKI&#x003b3;_i5.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Summary of proposed revisions to PIP5K1C splice variant nomenclature</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Human nomenclature</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mouse nomenclature</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Corresponding exons (human)</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">HUGO mRNA nomenclature</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">HGVS<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="TF1-003">&#x02021;</xref> protein nomenclature</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">PIPKI&#x003b3;640, PIPKI&#x003b3;87, PIPkinI&#x003b3;b</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">PIPKI&#x003b3;635, PIPKI&#x003b3;87, PIPkinI&#x003b3;b</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1&#x02013;16a, 18</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">PIPKI&#x003b3;_v1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">PIPKI&#x003b3;_i1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">PIPKI&#x003b3;668, PIPKI&#x003b3;90, PIPkinI&#x003b3;a</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">PIPKI&#x003b3;661/662, PIPKI&#x003b3;90, PIPkinI&#x003b3;a</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1&#x02013;16a, 17, 18</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">PIPKI&#x003b3;_v2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">PIPKI&#x003b3;_i2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">*</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">PIPKI&#x003b3;93, PIPkinI&#x003b3;c</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1&#x02013;16a, 16c<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="TF1-002">&#x02020;</xref>, 17, 18</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">PIPKI&#x003b3;_v3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">PIPKI&#x003b3;_i3</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">PIPKI&#x003b3;700</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">*</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1&#x02013;16a, 16b, 16c</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">PIPKI&#x003b3;_v4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">PIPKI&#x003b3;_i4</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">PIPKI&#x003b3;707</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="TF1-001">*</xref></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1&#x02013;16a, 16c</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">PIPKI&#x003b3;_v5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">PIPKI&#x003b3;_i5</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="TF1-001"><p>* Splice variant not defined.</p></fn><fn id="TF1-002"><p>&#x02020; Partial exon.</p></fn><fn id="TF1-003"><p>&#x02021;HGVS, Human Genome Variation Society.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL</title><sec><title>Cloning of PIPKI&#x003b3; splice variants</title><p>mRNA from mammary epithelial cell line MCF10A was isolated using the Micro-FastTrack&#x02122; 2.0 mRNA Isolation Kit (Invitrogen). 3&#x02032;-RACE (3&#x02032; rapid amplification of cDNA ends) was performed with the GeneRacer system (Invitrogen) using primers specific to a portion of PIPKI&#x003b3; exon 16 (5&#x02032;-GCCTCTGCTGCTGTTGAAGTAGAAA-3&#x02032;) and the supplied 3&#x02032; adaptor primer according to the manufacturer's instructions.

When Western-blotting cell lysates from MCF10A cells were incubated with a pan-PIPKI&#x003b3; antibody, an immunoreactive band was observed at a slightly greater molecular size than that attributable to PIPKI&#x003b3;_i2. This provided evidence that there may be other PIPKI&#x003b3; splice variants that have yet to be identified. In order to identify the putative novel PIPKI&#x003b3; species in MCF10A epithelial cells, mRNA was extracted from cells and subjected to reverse transcription&#x02013;PCR. Initially, any unidentified splice variant was expected to share exon 18 as a 3&#x02032;-UTR. In subsequent PCRs, primers were used that targeted internal exons, along with a primer targeting the 3&#x02032;-UTR, to amplify PIPKI&#x003b3; mRNAs. These amplicons were subcloned into a T/A cloning vector and &#x0223c;50 clones per region were screened via restriction-enzyme digest and DNA sequencing for variations in exon structure. Although some variation of exon structure was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B and results not shown), each alternative splicing event that was detected by this method resulted in a transcript that was shorter than PIPKI&#x003b3;_v2. Because the immunoreactive band we had observed in MCF10A lysates was of greater molecular size, these smaller splice variants were not characterized further.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>The human PIPKI&#x003b3; gene encodes at least four C-terminal splice variants</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The full-length PIPKI&#x003b3;_v4 and PIPKI&#x003b3;_v5 transcripts were amplified from MCF10A-epithelial-cell cDNA using a primer targeted to the conserved 5&#x02032;-end of the PIPKI&#x003b3; transcript and a second primer matching the putative 3&#x02032; alternatively spliced exon identified via 3&#x02032;-RACE.

The overall lengths of PIPKI&#x003b3; transcripts listed are approximate estimates based on the defined open reading frames plus the 3&#x02032; untranslated region. Two novel exons, which have been termed exon 16b and 16c, make up the alternatively spliced C-termini of the PIPKI&#x003b3;_v4 and PIPKI&#x003b3;_v5 transcripts. Interestingly, the PIPKI&#x003b3;_v4 transcript is longer than that of PIPKI&#x003b3;_v5, but PIPKI&#x003b3;_v4 mRNA encodes a shorter protein, owing to a stop codon in exon 16b. PIPKI&#x003b3; transcripts were identified in our initial experiments that lacked portions of exons 3 or 5, or all of exon 14, but these splice variants were not further characterized.

The presence of a full stop (period) indicates the lack of a corresponding amino acid residue at the indicated position.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bic788i001"/></fig><p>Since the previously described splice variants of PIPKI&#x003b3; display alternative splicing of the 3&#x02032; end of their mRNA to encode a unique C-terminal tail region, we hypothesized that the unknown splice variant may contain a longer unique C-terminus distinct from that of PIPKI&#x003b3;_i2. The PIPKI&#x003b3; gene is quite long, being over 70&#x000a0;kb in length (chromosome 19; 3 581 182&#x02013;3 651 445); however, the mRNA which encodes PIPKI&#x003b3;_v2 is only &#x0223c;5&#x000a0;kb. Although this is not uncommon, it leaves the possibility that other splicing events can incorporate sequences that are assumed to be intronic. Interestingly, introns 16&#x02013;17 of the human PIPKI&#x003b3; sequence, which in PIPKI&#x003b3; pre-mRNA lies between the majority of the PIPKI&#x003b3; coding sequence and the 84&#x000a0;bp which encode the unique C-terminus of PIPKI&#x003b3;_i2, is also quite large (&#x0223c;5.3&#x000a0;kb). If another PIPKI&#x003b3; C-terminal splice variant were encoded by the PIPKI&#x003b3; gene, it is likely that this intron would contain the source sequence for the unique extension. With this in mind, we performed 3&#x02032;-RACE on MCF10A cDNA using a forward primer directed towards exon 16. The amplicons were then analysed by agarose-gel electrophoresis, individual bands were extracted for ligation into a T/A vector, and the ligated inserts were sequenced. The sequence information obtained from 3&#x02032;-RACE indicated the presence of a previously unidentified exon mapping to intron 16&#x02013;17 (3 589 519&#x02013;3 589 881) of the PIPKI&#x003b3; gene. PCR was then performed to amplify the full-length splice variant using a primer directed towards the known start codon of PIPKI&#x003b3; and the predicted stop codon and its 5&#x02032; flanking sequence. This resulted in the identification of two splice variants containing the novel exon, which we have named according to HUGO guidelines as PIPKI&#x003b3;_v4 and PIPKI&#x003b3;_v5 (Table 1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). PIPKI&#x003b3;_v4 was predicted to contain a reading frame of 2103 nucleotides, whereas the reading frame of PIPKI&#x003b3;_v5 was expected to contain 2124 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Interestingly, both splice variants utilize the novel exon 16c. In the case of PIPKI&#x003b3;_v5, this exon encodes a unique 67-amino-acid C-terminus. By contrast, the unique C-terminus of PIPKI&#x003b3;_v4 is encoded by a second novel exon, 16b, whereas exon 16c makes up a portion of its 3&#x02032;-UTR. Upon identification of the splice variant mRNAs in MCF10A cells, we then sought to determine whether these messages were evolutionarily conserved.</p></sec><sec><title>The coding regions of PIPKI&#x003b3;_v4 and PIPKI&#x003b3;_v5 are evolutionarily conserved</title><p>The PIPKI&#x003b3;_v2 splice variant has been conserved through evolution, as the DNA sequence encoding its distinctive 28-amino-acid C-terminal extension is present in most vertebrates, with a high level of conservation within mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].

Since these splice variants are detectable in human, canine, mouse and rat cell lines, this confirms that the expression of PIPKI&#x003b3;_i4 and PIPKI&#x003b3;_i5 is evolutionarily conserved within mammals. Interestingly, PIPKI&#x003b3;_i4 appears as a tight doublet in some cell lines. PIPKI&#x003b3;_i2 also appears as several discrete bands via Western blotting, and this may be due to the phosphorylation events that occur on its C-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].

PIPKI&#x003b3;_i5 is present in large amounts in the heart and large intestine, but is also present in the lung, pancreas and thyroid, and, to a lesser extent, brain, stomach and kidney. Interestingly, the apparent molecular mass of the PIPKI&#x003b3;_i5 mouse orthologue is approx. 5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;kDa lower than that of the human form. This size shift could be the result of a second alternative splicing event that has removed a portion of the mouse PIPKI&#x003b3;_i5 mRNA.

Interestingly, our anti-PIPKI&#x003b3;_i4 polyclonal antibody indicated a localization of this variant to subnuclear structures, and, to a lesser extent, the cytoplasm, in MCF10A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A), HeLa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B), and NRK (normal rat kidney) cells (results not shown). Another type-I PIPK, namely PIPKI&#x003b1;, targets to subnuclear sites known as &#x02018;nuclear speckles&#x02019;. where it associates with splicing factors to regulate mRNA processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. PIPKI&#x003b3;_i4 staining co-localized with SC-35, a marker of nuclear speckles, but not nucleolin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B). This result is striking, as PIPKI&#x003b3; has not been previously identified as a nuclear PIPKI. To further assess the targeting of PIPKI&#x003b3;_i4, HeLa cells were fractionated into their nuclear and cytosolic components, and these lysates were subjected to Western blotting with anti-PIPKI&#x003b3; polyclonal antibodies. Blotting with the anti-pan-PIPKI&#x003b3; antibody indicated that PIPKI&#x003b3; is mainly located in the cytosolic fraction, but a discernable amount of PIPKI&#x003b3; was present in the nuclear fraction as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). In agreement with the results from blotting with anti-pan-PIPKI&#x003b3; antibody, PIPKI&#x003b3;_i4 was identified in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). Interestingly, PIPKI&#x003b3;_i4 appeared as a doublet in the nuclear, but not cytoplasmic, fraction. This probably indicates post-translational modification of PIPKI&#x003b3;_i4, which is consistent with our observations of this splice variant in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>(C). Taken together, these results support the presence of PIPKI&#x003b3;_i4 in the nucleus and suggest that PIPKI&#x003b3;_i4 could be functionally active in cytoplasmic as well as nuclear processes.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>PIPKI&#x003b3;_i4 is a nuclear-targeted phosphoinositide kinase</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) MCF10A or (<bold>B</bold>) HeLa cells were grown on coverslips, fixed in methanol, and probed with antibodies for pan-PIPKI&#x003b3; (green), PIPKI&#x003b3;_i4 (I&#x003b3;_i4; green), E-cadherin (ECD) (red), and SC-35 (red).

In particular, the W<sup>647</sup>VYSPLH<sup>653</sup> (one-letter amino acid code) motif present in PIPKI&#x003b3;_i2 shows a high level of similarity to the sequence W<sup>647</sup>IYSPRH<sup>653</sup> in the C-terminus of PIPKI&#x003b3;_i5.

Splice variants derived from different species may contain similar exons and serve identical biological functions, but often differ in amino acid number and consequently their molecular mass. In addition, PIPKI&#x003b3; splice variants are post-translationally modified, which alters their apparent molecular mass on gel electrophoresis. In the present paper we have proposed and implemented a standardization of nomenclature which conforms to the HUGO Genetic Nomenclature Committee (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genenames.org">http://www.genenames.org</ext-link>) and HGVS (Human Genome Variation Society) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hgvs.org">http://www.hgvs.org</ext-link>) guidelines for transcripts and protein products respectively of the PIP5K1C gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Continued use of this standardized nomenclature will greatly simplify communication between investigators who study PIPKI&#x003b3; biology.</p><p>Alternative splicing of RNA transcripts is an efficient cellular mechanism that increases the diversity of its protein products, thereby enhancing the overall functional specificity of a particular protein family. Much recent work has been devoted to delineating the mechanisms by which the unique C-terminal domain of PIPKI&#x003b3;_i2 is able to confer functional specificity on this splice variant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. PIPKI&#x003b3;_i2 functions by its C-terminus associating with protein-targeting factors (i.e., talin, AP complexes), which then target the kinase to focal adhesions or cell&#x02013;cell contacts respectively. Once targeted to its site of function, PIPKI&#x003b3;_i2 then generates PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub>, which regulates the activities of proteins in the vicinity. Importantly, several proteins that directly associate with PIPKI&#x003b3;_i2 are also PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> effectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. In the present paper we have described two previously undefined splice variants of the PIP5KIC gene, PIPKI_i4 and PIPKI&#x003b3;_i5, each of which contains a unique C-terminal domain. It is very probable that these unique C-termini direct the specific functions of PIPKI&#x003b3;_i4 and PIPKI&#x003b3;_i5 via the association of each kinase with distinct protein-targeting factors in a manner that parallels PIPKI&#x003b3;_i2. By this mechanism, the results presented here suggest that PIPKI&#x003b3;_i4 and PIPKI&#x003b3;_i5 may fill specific functional roles within the nucleus and endosomal transport system respectively.</p><p>The existence of a nuclear phosphoinositide signalling pathway that is independent of the cytoplasmic phosphoinositide cycle has been established, albeit that it remains relatively poorly defined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Several nuclear phosphoinositide kinases have been identified, including another type-I PtdIns4<italic>P</italic> 5-kinase, PIPKI&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Recently, the PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> generated by PIPKI&#x003b1; at sites of concentrated pre-mRNA processing factors known as nuclear speckles was shown to regulate the activity of the nuclear poly(A) polymerase Star-PAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Interestingly, our data indicates several striking parallels between PIPKI&#x003b1; and our newly discovered PIPKI&#x003b3;_i4 splice variant. First, endogenous PIPKI&#x003b3;_i4 was found in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of HeLa cells and also co-localizes with nuclear-speckle markers, both in a manner similar to PIPKI&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. However, endogenous PIPKI&#x003b1;, but not PIPKI&#x003b3;, was detectable in Star-PAP immunoprecipitates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Moreover, another PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub>-generating enzyme, PIPKII&#x003b2;, targets to nuclear speckles and also does not associate with Star-PAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], which supports the hypothesis that there are several discrete pools of nuclear PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> that are generated by PIPKI&#x003b3;_i4, PIPKI&#x003b1; or PIPKII&#x003b2;. In other words, the specific targeting of these kinases and their association with a unique subset of proteins allows each to fill a distinct functional niche in nuclear phosphoinositide signalling pathways.</p><p>Secondly, it is important to note that PIPKI&#x003b3;_i4 is not visible in the nucleus upon overexpression, a localization phenotype that is identical with that of overexpressed PIPKI&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. However, endogenous PIPKI&#x003b1; and PIPKI&#x003b3;_i4 have been observed in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, which leads us to speculate that the nuclear targeting of these kinases must be regulated in some manner. It is possible that post-translational modification of the unique C-terminus of PIPKI&#x003b3;_i4, or interaction of a nucleartargeted protein with this sequence, could modulate its nuclear entry. As observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>(C), PIPKI&#x003b3;_i4 appears as a doublet in the nuclear, but not in the cytosolic, fraction of HeLa cells. Therefore, nuclear PIPKI&#x003b3;_i4 could be modified as a signal for nuclear retention or functional specificity within a nuclear subdomain. However, evidence supporting these speculations is lacking, and further investigation is required to determine the method of import as well as the potential nuclear functions of PIPKI&#x003b3;_i4.</p><p>Interestingly, the PIPKI&#x003b3;_i3 splice variant identified by Giudici et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] shares 75% sequence identity with the first 20 amino acids of the PIPKI&#x003b3;_i5 C-terminus. In agreement with our data, Guidici et al. reported that PIPKI&#x003b3;_i3 localized to vesicle-like and punctuate cytoplasmic structures when expressed in non-neuronal cells, where they also observed modest co-localization with vesicular markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. However, as the splice variant identified by Giudici et al. seems to be limited to mouse neurons, we propose that the much more ubiquitous human PIPKI&#x003b3;_i5 could serve to perform similar biological functions in non-neuronal cells.</p><p>The role of phosphoinositides in the regulation of the endosomal network has been well defined for 3&#x02032;-phosphorylated polyphosphoinositides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], but less is known about the role of PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> in these signalling pathways. However, it is probable that PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> may also be a potent regulator of endosomal transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], and the targeting of PIPKI&#x003b3;_i5 to endosomal compartments suggests that the generation of PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> could regulate endosomal system function or even transport between endosomal subdomains. As the type-I PIPKs have been shown to phosphorylate 3-phosphoinositides <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], an alternative explanation is that, given a certain subcellular condition or protein interaction partner, the substrate preference of PIPKI&#x003b3;_i5 could be changed to utilize 3-phosphoinositides, thereby generating lipid messengers in addition to PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub>. However, this shift in PIPK substrate preference has not yet been shown to occur <italic>in vivo</italic> in organisms other than <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The significance of the sequence similarity between the talin and AP complex binding/regulatory site that is present in the C-terminus of PIPKI&#x003b3;_i2, and its &#x02018;sister&#x02019; sequence that is present in the C-terminus of PIPKI&#x003b3;_i5 cannot be overlooked. Our data indicate that, in the light of this similarity, PIPKI&#x003b3;_i5 does not associate with talin or APs and is not targeted in a manner similar to PIPKI&#x003b3;_i2. Although both PIPKI&#x003b3;_i2 and PIPKI&#x003b3;_i5 colocalize with cadherins, the mechanism by which PIPKI&#x003b3;_i5 is involved in N-cadherin function likely differs from that of PIPKI&#x003b3;_i2. When kinase inactive PIPKI&#x003b3;_i2 or PIPKI&#x003b3;_i1 (which lacks a C-terminal tail) was expressed in polarized epithelial cells, trafficking of E-cadherin to the plasma membrane was hindered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], indicating that both kinase activity as well as the unique C-terminus of PIPKI&#x003b3;_i2 is required for efficient basolateral targeting of E-cadherin. HeLa cells expressing PIPKI&#x003b3;_i5 D316A showed no apparent inhibition of N-cadherin trafficking to cell&#x02013;cell contacts, but co-localization of PIPKI&#x003b3;_i5 and N-cadherin was lost. These data suggest that PIPKI&#x003b3;_i5 potentially regulates the post-endocytic trafficking of N-cadherin rather than its exocytosis. Since PIPKI&#x003b3;_i5 is partially localized at several types of endosomal compartments, this splice variant is positioned to regulate the endosomal trafficking of N-cadherin, E-cadherin or other proteins at multiple steps within the endosomal system. However, further study is required to resolve the nature of the endosomal compartment at which PIPKI&#x003b3;_i5 and N-cadherin co-localize, and to determine the extent of regulation by PIPKI&#x003b3;_i5.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTION</title><p>Nicholas J.
