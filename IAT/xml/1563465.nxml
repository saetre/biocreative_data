Furthermore, epidemiological data suggest that RSV infection during infancy is a potent trigger of subsequent wheeze and asthma development. However, the mechanism by which RSV contributes to asthma is complex and remains largely unknown. A recent study indicates that the age of initial RSV infection is a key factor in determining airway response to RSV rechallenge. We hypothesized that severe RSV infection during neonatal development significantly alters lung structure and the pulmonary immune micro-environment; and thus, neonatal RSV infection is crucial in the development of or predisposition to allergic inflammatory diseases such as asthma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>To investigate this hypothesis the present study was conducted in a neonatal mouse model of RSV-induced pulmonary inflammation and airway dysfunction. Seven-day-old mice were infected with RSV (2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>TCID<sub>50</sub>/g body weight) and allowed to mature to adulthood. To determine if neonatal RSV infection predisposed adult animals to enhanced pathophysiological responses to allergens, these mice were then sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin. Various endpoints including lung function, histopathology, cytokine production, and cellularity in bronchoalveolar lavage were examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>RSV infection in neonates alone led to inflammatory airway disease characterized by airway hyperreactivity, peribronchial and perivascular inflammation, and subepithelial fibrosis in adults. If early RSV infection was followed by allergen exposure, this pulmonary phenotype was exacerbated. The initial response to neonatal RSV infection resulted in increased TNF-&#x003b1; levels in bronchoalveolar lavage. Interestingly, increased levels of IL-13 and mucus hyperproduction were observed almost three months after the initial infection with RSV.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Neonatal RSV exposure results in long term pulmonary inflammation and exacerbates allergic airways disease. The early increase in TNF-&#x003b1; in the bronchoalveolar lavage implicates this inflammatory cytokine in orchestrating these events. Finally, the data presented emphasize IL-13 and TNF-&#x003b1; as potential therapeutic targets for treating RSV induced-asthma.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of upper and subsequent lower respiratory tract infection in children and the elderly and is most severe in children between the ages of 8 and 30 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Severe RSV infection occurs in 1&#x02013;2% of the cases and may result in acute bronchiolitis that requires mechanical ventilation. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Several studies have suggested that severe RSV lower respiratory tract infection in infancy may induce later development of asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In 2000, Sigur and colleagues reported that RSV infection in infancy, severe enough to require hospitalization, was associated with asthma and allergy in children up to age 7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. More recently, they reported that the relationship between severe RSV bronchiolitis in infancy and later development of asthma and allergy sensitization are still observed in children up to age 13. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In murine models, numerous studies have been carried out and controversial results have been reported. While some studies propose that previous RSV infection enhances allergen sensitization and exacerbates asthma, others believe that RSV infection in infancy protects against later allergic sensitization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This controversy is now thought to arise from the age of initial RSV infection and the different protocols used for RSV infection and allergen sensitization and challenge. In two independent experiments, researchers suggested that the timing of primary RSV infection is significant for predicting disease outcome. Culley and colleagues reported that if neonatal mice (1 d or 7 d of age) were infected with RSV and rechallenged at 12 wks of age, inflammatory cell recruitment was enhanced (including Th2 cells and eosinophils) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Their data suggested that neonatal exposure to RSV exacerbated subsequent disease upon rechallenge in the adult. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. More recently, Dakhama and colleagues infected 1-wk old or 3-wk old mice with RSV, and they found that both primary infections led to increased lung resistance, mucus hyperproduction and inflammation along with increased lymphocytes in the lung. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, they demonstrated that the BAL fluid from mice infected with RSV at 1 wk of age had reduced levels of IFN-&#x003b3; and elevated levels of IL-13 compared to mice initially infected at 3 wks of age. This data indicated that a Th2 polarized response occurred in mice infected with RSV at 1 wk of age, while a Th1-biased response occurred in the mice infected with RSV at 3 wks of age. When rechallenged with RSV 5 weeks later (i.e., infection at 1 wk and reinfection at 6 wks of age), these mice displayed exacerbated disease as indicated by enhanced pulmonary resistance, mucus hyperproduction, eosinophilia, and elevated levels of Th2 cytokines. In contrast, initial infection of mice at 3 wks of age resulted in protection upon RSV rechallenge as indicated by the abolished lung resistance and enhanced viral clearance at rechallenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. These experiments indicate that age at initial RSV infection influences the subsequent immune and physiologic response upon re-exposure to RSV.</p><p>We hypothesized that neonatal exposure to RSV plays a critical role in the pathophysiological response to subsequent allergen exposure and the development of allergic asthma. To investigate whether neonatal exposure to RSV influences airway hyperreactivity (AHR), mice were infected with RSV at 1 wk of age. At 6 wks of age, these mice were then sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (Ova). Pulmonary function, histopathology, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cellularity and cytokine production were examined 24 hours after the last Ova challenge. The results were compared to sham infected and/or saline exposed mice and demonstrated that neonatal exposure to RSV resulted in elevated and prolonged AHR, chronic pulmonary inflammation, and subepithelial fibrosis in adult mice. These pathophysiological endpoints were most severe when neonatal RSV infection was followed by allergen sensitization and challenge. These studies demonstrate the ability of neonatal exposures to chronically alter lung function and the importance of preventing RSV exposure during infancy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The study protocol is outlined in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.

For AHR, lung resistance and BAL cellularity, differences between groups were evaluated by means of two-way ANOVA using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc, San Diago, CA). Bonferroni post-tests were performed to compare between pairs of groups. A one-way ANOVA was used to compare the mean cytokine levels among the various groups followed by the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons tests for significance between the groups.

Four days post-infection, we assessed pulmonary viral titers for Sham and RSV infected mice. As expected, mice from the Sham infected groups displayed no evidence of viral replication. The mean viral titer in the lungs of neonatal mice exposed to RSV alone (RSS and ROO) was 2.67 &#x000b1; 1.29 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>TCID<sub>50</sub>/g lung tissue.</p><p>After maturation, subsets of mice were then sensitized (protocol days 41 and 55) and challenged (protocol days 65, 66, and 67) with ovalbumin &#x02013; OVA and ROO groups. All other mice received saline &#x02013; RSS and SAL groups. AHR was assessed on protocol day 69 and 96 (2.5 and 3.5 months after infection). We observed no significant difference in baseline airway resistance between the RSV infected (mean &#x000b1; SEM; 0.52 &#x000b1; 0.01 cm H<sub>2</sub>O.s/mL) or sham infected mice (0.64 &#x000b1; 0.06). For ease of comparison among all groups, lung resistance data was normalized by plotting the percentage difference from baseline (percent difference = 100 * ((value-baseline)/baseline). Lung resistance in response to increasing concentrations of inhaled MeCh was significantly greater in RSV infected neonates (RSS; 121.79 &#x000b1; 10.20) than control mice (SAL; 89.05 &#x000b1; 6.51) at 25 mg/ml MeCh (1.4 times, p &#x0003c; 0.01) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Neonatal RSV infection followed by exposure to Ova (ROO) resulted in the highest lung resistance among the four groups (392.50 &#x000b1; 32.84). This increased airway resistance was greater than could be accounted for by Ova exposure alone (OVA; 264.63 &#x000b1; 23.01).

Mice infected with RSV as neonates displayed chronic (69d post infection) inflammation, mucus production and collagen deposition compared to control mice (SAL group), which also correlated to enhanced lung resistance and airway hypersensitivity in the RSS group (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Increased peribronchial and perivascular collagen deposition and peribronchial smooth muscle deposition indicated that airway remodeling occurred in mice exposed to RSV and/or Ova (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>), and that neonatal RSV infection alone was sufficient to induce airway remodeling.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Lung histopathology of mice exposed to RSV and/or Ova</bold>.

This result was correlated with peribronchial inflammation, increased BALF cellularity, increased mucus production, and airway remodeling. Elevations in TNF-&#x003b1; and Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-5) were observed in BALF immediately following neonatal RSV infection. Once these mice had matured (protocol day 69), only IL-13 remained elevated in the BALF. Neonatal RSV infection followed by adult exposure to allergen resulted in significantly higher lung resistance, along with increased total cellularity, eosinophilia, and increased TNF-&#x003b1; and Th2 cytokines (IL-5 and IL-13) in BALF. In addition, TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-13 were significantly higher compared to mice exposed to Ova alone. The most severe lung histopathology was observed in mice exposed to both RSV and Ova, as indicated by severe peribronchial and perivascular inflammation, mucus production, and collagen deposition. Collectively, these data suggest that neonatal RSV infection influences adult immune response to allergen (Ova) and exacerbates allergic pathophysiology in mice long after viral titers are no longer detectable.</p><p>In contrast to previously published studies analyzing the effect of RSV infection on allergen exposure in adult mice. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], the present study investigated the influence of neonatal RSV infection on adult allergen sensitization. Neonatal infection with RSV alone was sufficient to induce long-term pulmonary dysfunction and inflammation. Similarly, neonatal infection of brown Norway rats with parainfluenza type 1 (Sendai) virus also led to increases in pulmonary resistance and hyperresponsiveness to methacholine up to 65d after infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. As in our model, persistent airway dysfunction following neonatal infection with Sendai virus correlated with increased peribronchial fibrosis and pulmonary inflammation. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Furthermore, both models (i.e., neonatal RSV infection and neonatal Sendai virus infection) resulted in significantly increased mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and protein levels for TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>. Although numerous cytokines may contribute to airway remodeling, the elevation of TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>, a fibrogenic cytokine, in both neonatal viral infection models prior to the development of fibrosis suggests a role this cytokine in the regulation of viral-induced airway remodeling observed in neonates.</p><p>More importantly, neonatal infection with RSV predisposed mice to the development of enhanced AHR and inflammation after allergen exposure. In contrast, adult RSV infection prior to allergen exposure seemed to assert a "protective" response as evidenced by significantly decreased allergen induced pulmonary resistance, tissue eosinophilia, and IL-13 levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Our data presented here and elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] extend these findings and, more importantly, demonstrate that the age at initial RSV infection also determines whether RSV infection will exacerbate or prevent subsequent allergic inflammation.</p><p>A more recent study using neonatal RSV infection followed by subsequent reinfection of adults with RSV demonstrated that early RSV infection also exacerbates RSV induced diseases in the adult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Interestingly, if the primary RSV infection occurred at 3 wks of age, a protective effect upon secondary infection was observed similar to that reported by Peebles and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Dakhama and colleagues further established that enhancement of AHR, pulmonary eosinophilia, and mucus hyperproduction during reinfection were dependent on IL-13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. We demonstrated that neonatal RSV infection alone leads to elevated levels of IL-13 in the lung and that exposure to allergen significantly increases IL-13 levels over RSV exposure alone. IL-13 has emerged as a major regulatory molecule involved in mucus hyperproduction and allergen induced AHR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. It is entirely possible that the long-term AHR, pulmonary inflammation, and mucus production observed in our neonatal RSV model is due to high levels of IL-13. In fact, elevated levels of IL-13 were observed in whole lung homogenates as early as 5 hours post-infection (data not shown) and were again observed in adult lungs on protocol day 69 suggesting that IL-13 is being chronically produced. Although the exact cellular source of IL-13 in this neonatal model of RSV infection is currently unknown, previous studies have demonstrated that epithelial cells and/or macrophages infected by RSV are a significant source of IL-13 and are capable of producing this cytokine for months after the initial infection. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. We are currently investigating this possibility.</p><p>In our study, TNF-&#x003b1; was significantly elevated in the BALF shortly after infection with RSV. TNF-&#x003b1; is an important cytokine for innate immune responses and a central regulator of inflammatory processes, through binding to distinct membrane receptors, referred to as p55 or TNFR1 and p75 or TNFR2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. TNF-&#x003b1; is likely a central mediator of airway inflammation and AHR in asthma, regulating inflammatory cell infiltration, locally enhancing vascular permeability, and inducing the release of the chemokines. Ultimately, this will lead to chronic inflammation and irreversible airway remodeling. Recently, depletion studies using monoclonal antibody therapy for TNF-&#x003b1; have shown promising effects in viral-specific lung immunopathology. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], rheumatoid arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and inflammatory bowel disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Moreover, a soluble TNF receptor fusion protein, etanercept, has proven efficacious in treating juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in patients as young as 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In viral models, TNF-&#x003b1; depletion reduced recruitment of inflammatory cells, reduced type 1 and type 2 cytokines in BALF, and decreased pulmonary pathology without inhibiting viral clearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Although the precise mechanism by which TNF-&#x003b1; leads to the pathology in lungs after RSV infection remains unknown, our data and these previous studies suggest a key role for TNF-&#x003b1; in chronic inflammation in the lung and subsequent airway remodeling associated with asthma.</p><p>Several studies along with our present data have established the correlation of severe RSV infection followed by allergen exposure and the development of allergic inflammatory disease (i.e., asthma) in mice. Although the mechanism by which the exposure causes asthma and the importance of such exposures in humans need to be further elucidated, our current and previously published data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] demonstrate that the initial age of the RSV infection is capable of altering adult pulmonary function and exacerbating pulmonary immunopathology when followed by subsequent allergen exposure. Furthermore, enhanced AHR correlated with chronic pulmonary inflammation, upregulation of the Th2 cytokine, IL-13, and subepithelial fibrosis of the bronchial airways. Increases in TNF-&#x003b1; within 5 hours of RSV infection in our mouse model also suggest a role for this cytokine in the immunopathology of RSV-induced wheeze and asthma development in humans.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have demonstrated that neonatal infection with RSV in mice leads to reduced lung function, which is associated with chronic inflammation, increased mucus production, and airway remodeling in the lung. In addition, RSV infection in neonates predisposes the adult to develop enhanced airway responses upon allergen exposure. The upregulation of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-13 suggests that these cytokines may play a key role in mediating this process and highlights the importance of these cytokines as therapeutic targets for RSV induced asthma.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>RSV, respiratory syncytial virus; AHR, airway hyperreactivity; Ova, ovalbumin; Sal, saline; BAL, bronchoalveolar lavage; BALF, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; MeCh, methacholine; Penh, enhanced pause, TNF-&#x003b1;: Tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>DY performed pulmonary function tests, cytokine assays, and assisted in the preparation of the manuscript.
