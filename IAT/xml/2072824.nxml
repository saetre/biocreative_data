It has been used as an industrial degreasing agent, solvent, and extraction agent for approximately a century. Alternatively, the general population may be exposed to TCE through contaminated drinking water or air. The target organs of TCE include the nervous system, 1iver, kidney, heart, and skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ehp0115-001553">Bruckner et al. 1989</xref>). Among the immunotoxicity end points, evidence for an effect of TCE was strongest for auto-immune disease. Studies in susceptible rodents have shown that TCE exacerbates underlying autoimmune disease, and supporting information comes from multiple human studies of scleroderma and exposure to organic solvents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-ehp0115-001553">National Research Council 2006</xref>).</p><p>Hypersensitivity dermatitis occurring in workers exposed to TCE is completely different from nonspecific skin irritation as a result of defatting action, and the serious consequences of TCE exposure have recently become one of the critical occupational health issues in Asia. The clinical manifestations of TCE exposure include generalized severe dermatitis, fever, abnormal liver function, jaundice, and lymphadenopathy. Skin lesions range from mild multiform erythema to lesions with increasing severity, exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ehp0115-001553">Huang et al. 2006</xref>). The literature published in English and ad hoc publications in local languages were reviewed in detail recently by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ehp0115-001553">Kamijima et al. (2007)</xref>. Occurrences of the disease have been reported from the United States, Japan, Spain, Singapore, China, Korea, Thailand, and the Philippines. Most case reports from industrialized countries were published up to 1990, whereas cases from Asian industrializing countries were published later. In the past 10 years, an increasing number of cases of hypersensitivity dermatitis have been reported among TCE-exposed workers from electronic-element plants in Guangdong Province in southern China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ehp0115-001553">Huang et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ehp0115-001553">Kamijima et al. 2007</xref>).</p><p>According to epidemiologic surveys in Guangdong Province, &#x0003e; 200 cases of hypersensitivity dermatitis have been diagnosed, with a prevalence rate of &#x0003c; 1% among TCE-exposed workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ehp0115-001553">Huang and Li 2006</xref>). Epidemiologic studies on patients with TCE-induced hypersensitivity dermatitis reveal that the latency ranges from 6 to 89 days, and a no dose&#x02013;response relationship was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ehp0115-001553">Li et al. 2006</xref>). Furthermore, the patch test using TCE and/or its oxidative metabolites among victims was positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ehp0115-001553">Huang et al. 2002</xref>).</p><p>The incidence of hypersensitivity and autoimmune diseases in industrialized countries has steadily increased over the past three decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ehp0115-001553">Bach 2002</xref>), and these diseases are not evenly distributed among countries, regions, or ethnic groups. However, the degree to which genetic and environmental factors influence susceptibility to hypersensitivity and autoimmune diseases is not well defined. One main feature of occupational diseases is relatively defined causative factors, so studies on these diseases are helpful in identifying the role of genetic factors.</p><p>One of the best ways to prevent occupational hypersensitivity disease is to identify susceptible biomarkers to use in screening employees before exposure. To date, however, there are no available biomarkers for predicting who among TCE-exposed workers is at high risk of developing hypersensitivity dermatitis. Other factors associated with the disease remain unknown except for human herpes virus 6 reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ehp0115-001553">Huang et al. 2006</xref>). The genomic region of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) at chromosomal position 6p21 encodes the six classical HLA genes and many other genes that have important roles in the regulation of the immune system as well as in some fundamental cellular processes. The classical class I (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C) and class II molecules (HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DP) are involved in the control of immune-response mediation of antigen presentation to the T lymphocytes, and play a central role in the immune system by presenting peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ehp0115-001553">Shiina et al. 2004</xref>). The HLAs are characterized by an extensive degree of allelic polymorphism; strong associations between hypersensitivity or autoimmune disease and certain <italic>HLA</italic> alleles have been reported, for instance, <italic>HLA-B*27</italic> and ankylosing spondylitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ehp0115-001553">Brewerton et al. 1973</xref>), and <italic>HLA-B*1502</italic> and carbamazepine-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ehp0115-001553">Chung et al. 2004</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that the polymorphisms of <italic>HLA</italic> loci might influence the susceptibility of TCE-induced hypersensitivity dermatitis. We conducted a population-based case&#x02013;control study to investigate this hypothesis.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study population</title><p>From June 1998 to March 2006, 121 cases with TCE-induced hypersensitivity dermatitis and 142 TCE-tolerant controls were recruited into the case&#x02013;control study. Both cases and controls were recruited from 80 factories engaged in electronic-element and metal-plating production in Guangdong Province, China. At least one patient was identified in each factory. Controls were defined as the co-workers of the patients with same job title and longer occupational exposure time (&#x0003e; 90 days) but no skin abnormalities detected by the occupational physicians upon examination. According to data of routine environmental monitoring in the years the cases occurred, the TCE levels in these workplaces ranged from 69 to 790 ppm (median concentration, 90 ppm), which is much higher than the permissible concentration time-weighted average of 5.6 ppm defined by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-ehp0115-001553">Ministry of Health, China (2002b)</xref>. Compared with the exposure data reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ehp0115-001553">Kamijima et al. (2007)</xref>, the environmental exposure concentrations in the present study were relatively high. All participants were from the southern region of China and were genetically unrelated. Both cases and controls were exposed to TCE in the workplace where they cleaned and degreased metals. The cases were diagnosed with occupational hypersensitivity dermatitis by a panel of occupational physicians according to Chinese National Diagnostic Criteria of Occupational Disease (GBZ38&#x02013;2002) (2002a). Briefly, on the basis of both TCE exposure history and clinical manifestations (in terms of dermatitis accompanied by fever, lymphadenopathy, and hepatitis), patients were judged to be cases if the onset of symptoms occurred within the first 3 months of TCE exposure. Other potential risk factors, such as medications used and the history of previous skin disease, were excluded during diagnosis.</p><p>Four clinical categories were defined among the cases. First, exfoliative dermatitis is characterized by cutaneous fine pink macules and multiorgan involvement (e.g., hepatitis, nephritis) accompanied by systemic manifestations (e.g., fever, eosinophilia, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly) in addition to skin rashes. Second, multiform erythema is characterized by different forms of cutaneous lesions, such as exanthema, blisters, and erythema exsudativum, without mucosal involvement. Third, Stevens-Johnson syndrome is characterized by a rapidly developing blistering exanthema of purpuric macules and target-like lesions accompanied by mucosal involvement. Fourth, toxic epidermal necrolysis is characterized by skin detachment of &#x0003e; 30% of body surface area. The diagnosis of each case was confirmed by occupational panels.

The side-chains of the peptide anchor residues interact with the polymorphic complementary pockets in HLA peptide-binding grooves and provide the molecular basis for allele-specific recognition of antigenic peptides. HLA polymorphic side-chains delineate the geometry and chemical properties of six structural pockets (A&#x02013;F) in the groove that can accommodate some of the peptide side-chains. Specifically, the C-terminal side-chain of the peptide, which is lodged in pocket F close to one end of the groove, is important to the stability of the HLA/peptide complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-ehp0115-001553">Rammensee et al. 1995</xref>). Comparison of amino acid residues between HLA-B*1301 and HLA-B*1302 showed that only three residues (I<sup>94</sup>I<sup>95</sup>R<sup>97</sup> compared with T<sup>94</sup>W<sup>95</sup>T<sup>97</sup>) were different, and residue 95 is a major component of pocket F. By generating recombinant HLA-B molecules and studying the eluted peptides by mass spectrometry and pool sequencing, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ehp0115-001553">Bade-Doeding et al. (2007)</xref> found that residue 95 causes strong alteration of peptide motifs. According to structure&#x02013;function analysis, residue I<sup>95</sup> might play a key role in susceptibility to TCE-induced hypersensitivity dermatitis.</p><p>In addition, <italic>HLA-B*44</italic> was present in 6.2% of cases but was not observed in any of the 142 TCE-tolerant workers. Noticeably, HLA-B*1301 and HLA-B*44 shared I<sup>94</sup>I<sup>95</sup>R<sup>97</sup>, which might play a key role in susceptibility to TCE-induced hypersensitivity dermatitis described above. In a previous study that included 15 white patients, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-ehp0115-001553">Mondino et al. (1982)</xref> found that <italic>HLA-B*44</italic> was associated with the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome with ocular involvement; therefore, it is possible that the weak association of <italic>HLA-B*44</italic> with hypersensitivity dermatitis in TCE-exposed workers is not a chance finding. Certainly, this association should be cautiously considered because of the small number of patients with the <italic>HLA-B*44</italic> allele.</p><p>Recently, strong associations have been reported between a particular <italic>HLA</italic> allele and hypersensitivity dermatitis in patients under treatment with several drugs. Hypersensitivity to abacavir, a nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor commonly used for anti-AIDS treatment, has been reported to be associated with an <italic>HLA-B</italic> allele (<italic>HLA-B*5701</italic>) and a haplo-typic <italic>Hsp70-Hom</italic> variant in the HLA region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ehp0115-001553">Mallal et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ehp0115-001553">Martin et al. 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ehp0115-001553">Chung et al. (2004)</xref> reported a strong association of a specific <italic>HLA-B</italic> allele (<italic>HLA-B*1502</italic>) in Chinese patients with carbamazepine-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome. In addition, a significant association was reported between another <italic>HLA-B</italic> allele (<italic>HLA-B*5801</italic>) and allopurinol-induced cutaneous adverse reactions both in Chinese patients and in European patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ehp0115-001553">Hung et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ehp0115-001553">Lonjou et al. 2006</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>HLA-B*1301</italic>, <italic>HLA-B*1502,</italic> and <italic>HLA-B*5801</italic>, three common alleles in southern Chinese, shared the residues I<sup>94</sup>I<sup>95</sup>R<sup>97</sup>, which differed from almost all other residues present in all participants. In contrast, <italic>HLA-B*1302</italic> and <italic>HLA-B*1501</italic> did not share these residues. Therefore, data from these studies and from the present study suggest that there is a common molecular basis for using <italic>HLA-B*1301</italic>, <italic>HLA-B*1502,</italic> and <italic>HLA-B*5801</italic> as genetic markers for chemical hypersensitivity dermatitis in the Chinese population.</p><p>Taken together, these studies suggest that <italic>HLA-B</italic> alleles&#x02014;alone or together with other genetic polymorphisms in the HLA region&#x02014;might play a pivotal role in determining individual susceptibility to hypersensitivity dermatitis induced by certain chemicals. Therefore, the mechanism of <italic>HLA-B</italic> involved in severe hypersensitivity dermatitis requires further investigation along these lines.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first report of the association of the <italic>HLA-B*1301</italic> allele with human disease, and it is the strongest association between an <italic>HLA</italic> marker and a chemical-related occupational disease described thus far. Potentially, this association could be used to develop a highly reliable screening test to predict high-risk subpopulations to TCE exposure and could be applied for occupational practice to prevent about 70% of the cases of this life-threatening disease. In summary, <italic>HLA-B*1301</italic> and <italic>HLA-B*44</italic> might play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of TCE-induced hypersensitivity dermatitis.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>This project was proposed and initiated by F.
