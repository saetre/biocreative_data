We used microarrays to learn more about these issues in wild-type and checkpoint-mutant cells of the fission yeast, <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found that over-expressing a non-phosphorylatable form of the replication-initiation protein, Cdc18 (known as Cdc6 in other eukaryotes), drove re-replication of DNA sequences genome-wide, rather than forcing high level amplification of just a few sequences. Moderate variations in extents of re-replication generated regions spanning hundreds of kilobases that were amplified (or not) ~2-fold more (or less) than average. However, these regions showed little correlation with replication origins used during S phase. The extents and locations of amplified regions in cells deleted for the checkpoint genes encoding Rad3 (ortholog of human ATR and budding yeast Mec1) and Cds1 (ortholog of human Chk2 and budding yeast Rad53) were similar to those in wild-type cells. Relatively minor but distinct effects, including increased re-replication of heterochromatic regions, were found specifically in cells lacking Rad3. These might be due to Cds1-independent roles for Rad3 in regulating re-replication and/or due to the fact that cells lacking Rad3 continued to divide during re-replication, unlike wild-type cells or cells lacking Cds1. In both wild-type and checkpoint-mutant cells, regions near telomeres were particularly susceptible to re-replication. Highly re-replicated telomere-proximal regions (50&#x02013;100 kb) were, in each case, followed by some of the least re-replicated DNA in the genome.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The origins used, and the extent of replication fork progression, during re-replication are largely independent of the replication and DNA-damage checkpoint pathways mediated by Cds1 and Rad3. The fission yeast pattern of telomere-proximal amplification adjacent to a region of under-replication has also been seen in the distantly-related budding yeast, which suggests that subtelomeric sequences may be a promising place to look for DNA re-replication in other organisms.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Two key functions of the cell cycle machinery are to ensure (i) that DNA replication is completed before cells enter mitosis and (ii) that DNA replication is limited to once per cell cycle such that re-initiation of DNA replication does not occur on newly replicated DNA until after cells have passed through mitosis. Thus DNA replication is tightly controlled to ensure that the genome is copied once and only once within a cell cycle.</p><p>DNA replication is regulated at three successive steps: (i) binding of proteins necessary for initiation onto DNA during the M and G1 phases of the cell cycle, (ii) initiation at origins during S phase, and (iii) imposition of re-replication restraints during the S and G2 phases.</p><p>In the fission yeast, <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, overall control of replication is provided by the cyclin-dependent kinase, Cdc2 (Cdk1), whose activity drives the cell cycle. Low Cdk1 activity during late M phase and G1 phase permits the first step of replication, formation of pre-replication complexes (pre-RCs) at replication origins. Pre-RCs include ORC proteins (Orc1&#x02013;Orc6) together with Cdc18, Cdt1, and MCM proteins (Mcm2&#x02013;Mcm7). At the end of G1, Cdk1 activity begins to increase, triggering the second step: initiation of replication at subsets of pre-RCs throughout S phase (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]).</p><p>Once S phase has begun, the relatively high level of Cdk1 activity inhibits formation of new pre-RCs and thus inhibits re-initiation on already-replicated segments of DNA. As S phase continues, Cdk1 activity increases further, strengthening the inhibition of re-replication. In fission yeast, active Cdk1 inhibits new pre-RC formation by multiple pathways, including direct phosphorylation of Cdc18 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and Orc2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and destruction of Cdc18 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and Cdt1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Similarly, in budding yeast multiple Cdk1-dependent pathways inhibit re-replication by preventing the formation of new pre-RCs. These pathways include Cdk1-dependent phosphorylation of Orc2, Orc6, and Cdc6 (Cdc18 homologue), destruction of Cdc6, and nuclear export of Cdt1 and Mcm2-7 (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]). Related pathways similarly limit DNA replication to once per cell cycle in metazoans (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]). Even though cell cycle progression and Cdk1 activate multiple pathways that restrict DNA replication to once per cell cycle, these controls can be disrupted in <italic>S. pombe </italic>by high level expression of a single protein, Cdc18 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Two-dimensional (2-D) gel analysis has shown that some re-replication events begin at sequences previously identified as S-phase origins in fission yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and both 2-D gel analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and genome-wide microarray studies of copy number changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] have shown that, as expected, re-replication also begins at sequences previously identified as S-phase origins in budding yeast. Even though re-replication appears to be initiated from sites that also function as S-phase replication origins, two genome-wide studies in budding yeast have both concluded that origin use during re-replication is distinctly different from origin timing or efficiency during normal S phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Regions that are re-replicated in fission yeast have yet to be determined, as the only origin so far tested during re-replication in fission yeast is that of ribosomal DNA, <italic>ars3001 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>In budding yeast, when Cdk1 phosphorylation sites in Orc2, Orc6, Cdc6, and MCMs are mutated or circumvented and Cdc6 is over-expressed, DNA re-replication is limited to a maximum DNA accumulation of ~3&#x02013;4C in haploid cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Even after all known mechanisms to prevent re-replication in budding yeast have been eliminated, multiple restraints remain. First, pre-RCs re-assemble at only a subset of the sites used for a normal S phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Second, of these only a subset are selected for replication re-initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Finally, there is some evidence that fork processivity may be reduced during re-replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The mechanisms for these remaining restraints are unknown. They may be responsible for the budding yeast differences between S-phase replication and re-replication. It has also been suggested by Tanny <italic>et al</italic>. that differences in chromatin organization and/or gene expression between S phase and G2 may change origin selection and/or efficiency between S-phase replication and re-replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>In <italic>S. pombe</italic>, over-expression of Cdc18 is sufficient to drive re-replication and this re-replication can be further increased by mutating phosphorylation sites in Cdc18, by also mutating phosphorylation sites in Orc2, or by simultaneously over-expressing Cdt1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Reasons for the different sensitivities of fission yeast and budding yeast to re-replication are unclear.</p><p>In budding yeast, re-replication leads to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) breaks and activation of checkpoint protein Rad53 that is dependent on DNA damage response proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In <italic>X. laevis </italic>egg extracts, re-replication induced by addition of recombinant Cdt1 leads to activation of Chk1 (the effector kinase used during DNA damage and replication blocks) and the presence of small dsDNA fragments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In human cells, re-replication induced by (i) inactivation or depletion of the Cdt1 inhibitor, Geminin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], (ii) depletion of proteins integral for the degradation of Cdt1, DDB1 or Cdt2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], (iii) depletion of Emi1 (an inhibitor of APC/C activity during S and G2 phases) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], or (iv) over-expression of Cdt1 and Cdc6 with cyclinA-Cdk2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] activates the ATM/ATR/Chk2 DNA damage pathways. Accumulation of single-stranded and double-stranded DNA has also been observed during re-replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>It is possible that this re-replication-induced checkpoint activation in turn influences the patterns of re-replication. The relation between checkpoints and origin selection during re-replication is unknown. DNA-replication and DNA-damage checkpoint pathways are highly conserved among eukaryotes. The fission yeast Rad3 checkpoint kinase (product of the <italic>rad3 </italic>gene) is a homologue of vertebrate ATR and of budding yeast Mec1. Rad3 is activated in response to blocked replication forks or DNA damage. The Cds1 checkpoint kinase (product of the <italic>cds1 </italic>gene) is activated after phosphorylation by Rad3 in response to stalled replication forks or DNA damage during S phase. Cds1 is a homologue of vertebrate Chk2/Cds1 and of budding yeast Rad53. A different kinase, Chk1 (product of the <italic>chk1 </italic>gene) is activated by Rad3 in response to DNA damage in late S and G2 phases. Chk1 homologues, with the same name, are also present in vertebrates and in budding yeast (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]).</p><p>In this study, we drove re-replication in <italic>S. pombe </italic>by over-expression of a mutant Cdc18 protein and then used microarrays to find out if specific regions in the genome are preferentially amplified during re-replication. We then repeated these experiments in <italic>cds1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; cells to find out if checkpoint responses determine regional susceptibility to re-replication.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Over-expression of cdc18* increases DNA content ~four-fold</title><p>Re-replication in our experiments was driven by inducing the <italic>cdc18</italic>* gene, encoding the Cdc18* protein, from an integrated allele regulated by the <italic>nmt1 </italic>promoter. Cdc18* lacks Cdk1 phosphorylation sites at positions 26, 98, 104 and 134 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Phosphorylation of these sites is important for Cdk1 downregulation of Cdc18 function, for targeting Cdc18 for proteolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and probably also for Cdc18 inhibition of Cdk1 ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and A. Vas and J. L., unpublished results). A major goal of this study was to compare re-replication in wild-type cells with re-replication in checkpoint mutant cells. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> describes the effects of Cdc18* overexpression on cell morphology, cell cycle arrest, and DNA re-replication in wild-type as well as <italic>cds1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; mutants.

Cdc18* protein was detectable by 13 hours (not shown), and re-replication was detectable by 17 hours ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of inducing <italic>cdc18* </italic>on DNA content and cell cycle division arrest</bold>. <italic>cdc18* </italic>was induced in the wild-type (green), <italic>cds1</italic>&#x00394; (blue), and <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; (red) strains by removal of thiamine at 0 hours.

Though highly variable from cell to cell, the DNA content of wild-type and <italic>cds1</italic>&#x00394; cells approximately doubled again between 17 and 21 hours. The average DNA content of <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; cells increased only slightly if at all during this time interval. From 21 to 25 hours, there was increased variability but little change in average DNA content per cell in all three strains. The flow cytometry profiles are consistent with DNA re-replication models ranging from DNA accumulation by repeated re-replication of a few regions of the genome to continuous, albeit slow, whole genome re-replication. If the re-replicating cells are in a continuous "re-replication" phase, then DNA re-replication is inefficient compared with normal S-phase replication, which doubles DNA content in 20&#x02013;40 minutes under growth conditions similar to those used here.</p></sec><sec><title>Use of microarrays to determine which regions are re-replicated</title><p>We used microarray analyses of DNA copy number &#x02013; a procedure which has come to be called comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) &#x02013; to distinguish between the possibility that re-replication affects sequences genome-wide and the possibility that re-replication is limited to a small subset of sequences and drives DNA accumulation by high amplification, onion-skin-like replication bubbles similar to those generated during chorion gene amplification in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster </italic>(reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]). If re-replication only affected a few regions in the genome &#x02013; for instance, if only half of genomic sequences were susceptible to re-replication &#x02013; then, by 21 hours when the total amount of DNA is increased four-fold, we would expect an eight-fold difference in copy number between re-replicated DNA regions and the regions that are not re-replicated. On the other hand, if re-replication occurred uniformly genome-wide, we would expect little or no variation in copy number from region to region no matter how long re-replication continued.</p><p>To determine relative copy number, DNAs harvested from re-replicating cells at 17, 21, and 25 hours after <italic>cdc18* </italic>induction (re-replicated) and DNA from the same strain at 0 hours, when <italic>cdc18* </italic>was repressed (control), were labeled and hybridized competitively to microarrays. Overall ratios of re-replicated DNA to control DNA were normalized to 1.0. Thus if a probe sequence was re-replicated an average amount, its ratio would be 1.0 even if the genome was four-fold over-replicated (~8C). Relatively amplified sequences would have ratios greater than 1.0, and regions that failed to re-replicate or re-replicated less than average would have ratios less than 1.0. Individual probe values from replicate hybridizations were averaged and graphed for the 17-, 21-, and 25-hour time points, without smoothing or averaging of neighboring probe values (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Probe values are provided in Additional Files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> (chromosome 1), <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> (chromosome 2), and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref> (chromosome 3).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Genome-wide microarray analysis of DNA re-replication over time in wild-type cells</bold>.

No smoothing of data has been applied. Vertical lines indicate the relative level of DNA amplification across the genome. A value of 1.0 is the average amount of re-replicated DNA for the genome.

Some of the probes appeared to re-replicate significantly more or less than the other probes in their regions, giving rise to the sharp spikes and valleys evident in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. We are not yet certain of the significance of these spikes and valleys. They may represent noise, or they may represent "hot spots" of over- or under-replication. They are the subject of continuing investigation. For this reason, in the remainder of this manuscript we shall focus on the regional variations and ignore the spikes and valleys.</p><p>Regional amplification increased somewhat between 17 and 21 hours and changed little between 21 and 25 hours. The degree of relative amplification was generally modest (~1.5 fold), and the regions of amplification remained stable over time. The highest level of amplification represented by multiple adjacent probes was ~2-fold. Therefore no individual regions consistently re-replicated to very high ploidies, and most of the genome was re-replicated somewhat. A few regions represented by multiple probes were under-represented by ~1.7-fold and therefore failed to re-replicate in many cells. Microarray analysis of amplification during re-replication was highly reproducible for all three time points.</p><p>Since some regions were re-replicated more than two-fold over others, the re-replicating cells must contain replication forks and/or double-strand breaks. It is expected that such structures will activate DNA-replication and/or DNA-damage checkpoint pathways. Given the importance of DNA-replication and DNA-damage checkpoint responses for genome stability and the roles of these pathways in controlling replication initiation and fork processivity, we next sought to determine to what extent these pathways regulate, modify, or restrain DNA re-replication in <italic>S. pombe</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Roles of Rad3 and Cds1 in cell cycle arrest during DNA re-replication</title><p>To find out how replication-checkpoint and DNA-damage-response signals affect DNA re-replication in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, inducible <italic>cdc18</italic>* was combined with deletions of the <italic>cds1 </italic>and <italic>rad3 </italic>genes. Like the <italic>cdc18</italic>* strain (hereafter referred to as "wild-type"), the <italic>cdc18* cds1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>cdc18* rad3</italic>&#x00394; double-mutant strains (hereafter referred to as "<italic>cds1</italic>&#x00394;" and "<italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394;") are viable when <italic>cdc18* </italic>is repressed, and all three strains show 90&#x02013;95% loss in viability 17 hours after <italic>cdc18* </italic>induction (data not shown). Deletion of <italic>cds1 </italic>abrogates the replication checkpoint, and Cds1 is important for maintaining functional replication forks during replication stress (for example when dNTPs are limited, as happens when cells are treated with HU). Cds1 is able to arrest the cell cycle in HU-treated cells, but Cds1 is not required for this cell cycle arrest, because the DNA-damage responsive Chk1 kinase has overlapping functions with Cds1 and is also able to arrest the cell cycle. The Rad3 kinase (related to ATR and Mec1) is required for both the Cds1 and Chk1 pathways. Thus cells lacking Rad3 cannot arrest the cell cycle in response to either replication stress or DNA damage.</p><p>Over-expression of Cdc18* was sufficient for initial cell-cycle arrest in all three strains studied here, including the <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; strain; however, maintenance of the Cdc18* cell-cycle arrest was strongly dependent on Rad3 and partially dependent on Cds1. Fission yeast in a cell-cycle arrest become highly elongated, remain uni-nucleate, and lack septa. At 17 hours, the wild-type cells remained fully cell-cycle arrested. Fewer than 1% of these cells had septa or were bi-nucleate (based on fluorescence microscopy of DAPI- and Calcafluor-stained cells; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), and &#x0003e;90% of these cells were highly elongated. At 17 hours, most of the <italic>cds1</italic>&#x00394; cells also maintained the cell cycle arrest (2% bi-nucleate). In contrast, by 17 hours, the <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; cells had resumed division (15% bi-nucleate cells), and due to the failure to maintain cell cycle arrest, only 53% of the <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; cells were highly elongated, unseptated, and uni-nucleate. By 21 hours, 5% of wild-type, 11% of <italic>cds1</italic>&#x00394;, and 16% of <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; cells were bi-nucleate. Thus, by 21 hours even wild-type cells were imperfect in maintaining the cell cycle arrest, and the <italic>cds1</italic>&#x00394; strain had a clear arrest defect in a small subset of cells (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>).</p><p>Our flow cytometric results also suggested that cell-cycle arrest requires Rad3. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> shows forward scatter (which reflects cell length) versus florescence per cell (which is proportional to DNA content). Most wild-type and <italic>cds1</italic>&#x00394; cells were elongated and contained large amounts of DNA (~6&#x02013;10C). However, <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; cells were much shorter and had less DNA per cell than wild-type, as expected for cells that fail to maintain cell-cycle arrest (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Because a large fraction of <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; cells were dividing, flow cytometry cannot be used to quantitate the extent of re-replication driven by Cdc18* in this strain. However, we are confident that re-replication took place, because (i) DNA content was greater than 2C for the majority of cells at 17&#x02013;25 hours (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), (ii) the pattern of over-replication measured by microarray analysis was similar to that of wild-type and <italic>cds1</italic>&#x00394; cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), and (iii) cells lost viability similarly to wild-type. Based on microscopy of DAPI-stained cells, most divisions in <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; cells at 17 hours and later were aberrant, with unequal divisions of nuclei as well as strings of DNA between divided nuclei (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Such aberrant divisions could be generated by attempting to segregate chromosomes with partially re-replicated DNA.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Comparison of re-replication between the wild-type and checkpoint-mutant strains</bold>.

The wild-type and <italic>cds1</italic>&#x00394; results are nearly identical. Distinct differences can be seen between the wild-type or <italic>cds1</italic>&#x00394; strains and the <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; strain, but the overall locations of amplified regions are generally the same. Exceptions are discussed below.</p><p>The similarity between the <italic>cds1</italic>&#x00394; and wild-type strains (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) indicates that control of replication origin function by Cds1 has little effect on origin activity during re-replication. This was initially surprising to us. However, during the course of these studies, we found that Cds1 and Rad3 significantly restrain only about 3% of origins and significantly stimulate only about 5% of origins during S-phase replication in HU-treated fission yeast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. But even within that small subset of origins (3&#x02013;5%), none was similarly affected by checkpoint mutations during re-replication (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The striking similarity between re-replication in the <italic>cds1</italic>&#x00394; and wild-type strains also suggests that replication fork movement is similar in these strains while they are undergoing re-replication. In contrast, when these strains are treated with HU during normal S phase, replication fork movement is much slower in <italic>cds1</italic>&#x00394; (and in <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394;) cells than in wild-type cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>We detected three distinct, but minor, differences between the patterns of re-replication in <italic>cds1</italic>&#x00394; or wild-type cells and those in <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; cells. First, if one carefully examines Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, many small peaks of amplification are visible in the <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; strain that are undetectable in the other two strains. These <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394;-specific peaks are correlated with locations of relatively strong origins in HU-treated cells. Second, the amplified regions in <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; cells have more distinct boundaries than do the peaks in wild-type or <italic>cds1</italic>&#x00394; cells. This might result from reduced fork rate or lower fork processivity in the <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; strain.</p><p>Third, the telomeres of chromosomes 1 and 2, centromeres on all chromosomes, and the mating-type region on chromosome 2 are preferentially amplified in <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In this respect these three types of heterochromatin behave similarly to each other &#x02013; in contrast to normal S phase, where telomeric heterochromatin is late-replicating and checkpoint-regulated, while centromeric and mating-type heterochromatin are early-replicating and not affected by the replication checkpoint ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]).

Therefore, we cannot distinguish whether <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394;-specific effects are due to Rad3-specific functions or to interruption of re-replication by mitosis, possibly followed by an S phase.</p></sec><sec><title>Amplification of telomeric regions during re-replication</title><p>Microarray copy number analyses indicate that <italic>S. pombe </italic>telomeric regions are amplified during re-replication.

As in the wild-type and <italic>cds1</italic>&#x00394; strains, the sub-telomeric amplified regions in <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; cells are followed by under-re-replicated regions.</p><p>The pattern of re-replication near telomeres in <italic>S. pombe </italic>appears to be the same as re-replication near telomeres in the distantly related budding yeast, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, when re-replication is induced in G2/M phase (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). Analysis of re-replication in budding yeast showed re-replication of telomeric regions in which the terminal ~50 kb is amplified greater than average for the genome and the following &#x0003e;300 kb is under-re-replicated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. That this distinct pattern of re-replication adjacent to telomeres is conserved between the highly diverged fission and budding yeasts suggests that this may be a basic feature of re-replication near telomeres and therefore may also occur in metazoans.</p></sec><sec><title>Origin use during re-replication is distinct from S-phase replication</title><p>In all three strains studied, DNA re-replication varied regionally such that stretches of hundreds of kilobases were amplified during re-replication or were relatively under-replicated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Given that most of the genome is subject to re-replication, one possibility is that re-replication is primarily a repeat of S-phase. If so, then normal S-phase origins, unusually active individual S-phase origins, or clusters of S-phase origins might be determinants of which sequences are amplified during re-replication. To investigate this idea, we compared the re-replication profiles for all three chromosomes with various measures of S-phase origins (data not shown) including predicted origin distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], distribution of 0.5-kb stretches of unusually high AT content, origin activity in HU-treated S-phase cells ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]), early S-phase replication (KLM and JL, unpublished results), and localization of ORC and MCM proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. These comparisons led us to conclude that determinants of re-replication efficiency are distinct from normal S-phase replication. By way of example, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> shows comparisons of chromosome 1 re-replication with measures of S-phase replication and origin distribution. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> shows data for all of chromosome 1, while Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref> shows a magnified view of the 1-Mbp region highlighted in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>. The large zones of re-replication common to wild-type, <italic>cds1</italic>&#x00394; (not shown) and <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; cells failed to show a clear one-to-one correspondence with S-phase replication in synchronous or HU-treated cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Comparison of regions amplified during DNA re-replication with active S phase origins</bold>. (A) From top to bottom, the panels show (for chromosome 1) the DNA re-replication profiles at 25 hours after thiamine removal of wild-type cells (green) and <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; cells (red); the replication profile of wild-type cells replicating under normal conditions in the absence of HU; and the replication profile of wild-type cells replicating in the presence of HU. No smoothing of data was performed. The overall efficiencies of origin firing during HU treatment, from the studies by Mickle <italic>et al</italic>. [31], are plotted as black sticks below the HU-arrested replication profile. The lengths of the sticks represent the levels of efficiency of the origins during the HU treatment. The longer the stick, the more efficiently the origin fired. Note that the measure of overall efficiency employed by Mickle <italic>et al</italic>. combined efficiency in wild-type cells with efficiencies in checkpoint-mutant cells [31]. For this reason, telomeric origins in chromosomes 1 and 2 show relatively high efficiencies, even though the extents of replication at telomeres were small in wild-type cells. The bottom panel shows the cumulative sum of origin scores in a sliding 100-kb window. Centromeres are indicated by yellow squares. The region spanning 0.8 kb to 1.8 kb along chromosome 1 is highlighted by a light purple box.

The re-replication peak is aligned closely with the region AT1041+, which appears to have medium function as an S-phase origin. AT1041+ is flanked for long distances on both sides by regions that, according to microarray analyses, did not replicate significantly in cells entering S phase in the presence of HU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>If re-replication amplification peaks result from use of multiple origins in a region, then the center of amplification in the population need not be located at an origin but could lie between origins. It has been calculated that 80% of re-replication peaks lie within 10 kb of a pro-ARS in budding yeast, and re-replication peaks can in some cases be assigned to a single origin in this organism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Correlation between re-replication peaks and S-phase origins is less clear in fission yeast, though likely origins can be identified in some cases such as AT1041+ described above. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> shows origin strength and distribution determined for S-phase replication in HU. To look at the effects of groups or clusters of origins, the numbers and activities of origins were evaluated in a sliding window of 100 kb. Even with this approach, there were differences between S-phase origins and re-replication, suggesting that the determinants of re-replication differ in some respects from the determinants of origin function during normal S-phase replication.</p><p>Finally, the sequences replicated during HU-arrested S phase and the sequences amplified during re-replication in wild-type and <italic>cds1</italic>&#x00394; cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>) are poorly correlated (R<sup>2 </sup>= 0.0128 and 0.023, respectively). As noted above, there are many smaller peaks of amplification in <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; cells which aligned with clusters of active origins in the replication profile (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A, B</xref>). Consistent with this, there is a small degree of correlation between the sequences replicated during HU-arrested S phase and the sequences amplified after re-replication was induced in <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>; R<sup>2 </sup>= 0.104). This correlation could be due to characteristics of re-replication in the absence of Rad3 or it could be an indirect result of ongoing division, possibly followed by "normal" S phases, in the <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; mutant. Regardless of the explanation, our ability to detect such correlation in the <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; mutant emphasizes the absence of similar correlation in wild-type and <italic>cds1</italic>&#x00394; cells.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>By using microarrays to measure copy number, we have found that over-expression in fission yeast of the Cdc18* replication initiation protein that has mutations in Cdk1 phosphorylation sites drove re-replication of broad regions throughout the genome, rather than driving abundant re-replication of just a few sequences. Re-replication was independent of the replication checkpoint mediated by Cds1. Re-replication also seems to be largely independent of the Rad3 checkpoint. However, our results obtained with <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; cells are preliminary, due to the fact that these cells continue to divide even after re-replication is induced. In all three cell types (wild-type, <italic>cds1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394;), we found amplified (relatively highly re-replicated) regions spanning hundreds of kilobases. These were distinct from the broad regions containing strong origins observed in normal S phase. Greatest amplification occurred near the fission yeast telomeres and closely matched the pattern of telomere-associated amplification observed during budding yeast re-replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><sec><title>Re-replication and the cell cycle</title><p>In principle, re-replication can take place either within S phase (on segments of DNA that have already been replicated) or in G2 phase. In recently published genome-wide studies of re-replication in budding yeast, Green <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and Tanny <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] employed cells arrested in G2/M with nocodazole to ensure absence of contributions from cells still in S phase. Both groups found that origin selection during re-replication induced in G2/M is markedly different from origin selection during S phase. Tanny <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] showed that part of this difference could be attributed to the fact that, during re-replication, pre-RCs were re-loaded onto G2 chromatin at only a subset of the origins where they would normally be loaded during G1 in preparation for a normal S phase. In addition, Tanny <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] concluded that many origins that did re-load pre-RCs were not subsequently selected to fire during re-replication. The nature of this additional restraint is not known. Both groups found that there was little or no correlation between S-phase origin efficiency or the time in S phase when an origin is normally functional and the likelihood of that origin being active for re-replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>How can one explain the profound difference between re-replication induced during G2/M phase and normal replication during S phase replication? It is possible that G2- or M-phase-specific chromatin modifications or condensation might contribute to the re-replication program observed in nocodazole-arrested cells. To explore this possibility, Green <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] also studied re-replication initiated during an S phase. They found that the S-phase re-replication patterns were partially similar to those generated by re-replication in G2/M. However, the peaks of S-phase re-replication corresponded somewhat better than those of G2/M re-replication to the positions and timings of origins used during normal S phase. A difference between re-replication during G2/M and re-replication initiated in S phase was that, during G2/M, telomeres were extensively re-replicated. In contrast, telomeres were under-amplified when re-replication was initiated during S phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>For our study, we induced Cdc18* over-expression in logarithmically growing, unsynchronized cells. In this case, differences between re-replication and replication cannot be attributed to a mitotic-arrested state of the cells. Nevertheless, <italic>S. pombe </italic>showed major differences between re-replication and S-phase replication similar to those seen in nocodazole-arrested budding yeast. Furthermore, the amplification of telomeric regions during <italic>S. pombe </italic>re-replication resembles telomere-region amplification during re-replication in nocodazole-arrested budding yeast. The normally late replication of these regions might account for failure to detect their amplification when re-replication was induced during S phase in budding yeast. It is truly remarkable that parameters of re-replication should be so similar across the huge evolutionary distance between fission and budding yeasts and across the considerably different experimental designs.</p><p>Re-replication under the experimental conditions in this study appeared to require ~4 hours for a doubling of DNA content (compare the 17-hour and 21-hour time points in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), compared with a typical S-phase duration of ~40 minutes. Thus, within individual cells, there must either be large periods of time that are not permissive for re-replication, or re-replication must be inefficient relative to S-phase replication. The fact that <italic>cds1</italic>&#x00394; and wild-type cells re-replicated with essentially identical kinetics (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) suggests that the explanation (whatever it may be) for the difference in DNA doubling times between normal S phase and our re-replication conditions is probably independent of the replication checkpoint.</p><p>We had not anticipated that <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; cells would be able to divide during re-replication driven by overexpression of Cdc18*, because overexpression of wild-type Cdc18 can cause a Rad3-independent block to mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Our results are consistent with the model that the Cdc18* used in this study resembles a Cdc18 N-terminal deletion mutant, which cannot block mitosis independently of Rad3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Cdc18* lacks four of the five N-terminal Cdk1 phosphorylation sites, and analogous sites in budding yeast Cdc6 are required for Cdk1 inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. It seems likely that Cdc18* is defective as a direct inhibitor of Cdk1 and so would depend on the Rad3 pathway to inhibit Cdk1 and prevent cells from entering mitosis. Because the <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; cells were able to divide when overexpressing Cdc18*, while wild-type and <italic>cds1</italic>&#x00394; cells were not, we conclude that Rad3 is important for detecting ongoing re-replication and for generating a checkpoint response capable of inhibiting cell division. Our data further indicate that Cds1 plays a small, but detectable, role in the checkpoint response to re-replication, because Cds1 was required to maintain the cell-cycle arrest in some cells. That most <italic>cds1</italic>&#x00394; cells maintain the arrest is likely due to activation of the Chk1-dependent damage checkpoint pathway. Consistent with this idea, re-replicating cells lacking Chk1 also have partial defects maintaining cell cycle arrest (data not shown).

In contrast with the yeast results, a strong correlation was apparent between re-replication in a mammalian cell line and euchromatic sequences normally replicated during early S phase, based on using re-replicated DNA for FISH hybridization to metaphase chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Thus the regional determinants of re-replication in eukaryotes still hold many mysteries.</p><p>Intriguingly, in fission yeast, budding yeast, and mammalian cells, re-replication was seen to affect large regions rather than applying evenly to the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In fission yeast, we found that large regions of hundreds of kilobases were amplified, interspersed with large regions that re-replicated less than average. Broad regions are most simply explained as being the result of one or a few initiations near the region centers. Each amplified region would be replicated by forks moving outward from its center. If forks travel at 1 to 3 kb/minute, as calculated by Rivin and Fangman for budding yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], or at 2.8 kb/minute as proposed by Heichinger <italic>et al</italic>. for <italic>S. pombe </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], then bi-directional forks starting at one origin could replicate 0.5&#x02013;1.5 Mbp in four hours, the approximate time frame in which total DNA content doubles during re-replication in our study. This is consistent with the observed sizes of the amplified regions. The lack of correspondence between fission yeast re-replication peak centers and origins known to be very active in S phase could result from use of origins that are normally inefficient during S phase, or from stochastic use of several sites of initiation during re-replication &#x02013; with the <italic>caveat </italic>that, for some of these origins, relative efficiency would be different between S phase and re-replication. The overall similarity between fission yeast and budding yeast re-replication suggests that re-replication-specific origin preference might be a general phenomenon rather than a special property of the model organism or the details of the experimental design.</p></sec><sec><title>Minimal effect of the Cds1-dependent replication checkpoint during re-replication</title><p>Considering that re-replication is a form of replication, we initially expected that the replication checkpoint might be activated. We were therefore surprised to see that, for every characteristic that we measured, wild-type and <italic>cds1</italic>&#x00394; cells proved to be similar or identical. Indeed, the only difference we could detect between the two cell types was a somewhat faster loss of mitotic arrest in <italic>cds1</italic>&#x00394; cells compared to wild-type. The <italic>cds1</italic>&#x00394; mutation had no detectable effect either on the degree of re-replication or on which regions were preferentially amplified (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><p>Cds1 is important for replication fork stability and processivity when replication forks are hindered by DNA damage or starvation for dNTPs during normal S phase. Since re-replication presumably takes place under conditions that are not optimal for replication, we initially suspected that Cds1 might prove important for fork processivity or stability during re-replication. However, this expectation appears to have been incorrect (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The fact that both the patterns and extents of re-replication were indistinguishable between <italic>cds1</italic>&#x00394; and wild-type cells suggests that Cds1 played no unique role in replication fork stability or processivity during re-replication and suggests that the Cds1-dependent replication checkpoint may not be induced, or may be induced only slightly, during re-replication in fission yeast cells.</p><p>If re-replication is initiated during a 'G2-like' state of the cells, then absence of the replication checkpoint should be expected, since the Mrc1 protein &#x02013; an essential mediator of the replication checkpoint &#x02013; is cell-cycle regulated and is abundant only during S phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The idea that Cdc18*-driven re-replication is initiated during a G2-like state is also consistent with the finding that Cdc18*-driven re-replication in fission yeast more closely resembles re-replication in G2/M arrested budding yeast than re-replication initiated in S-phase in budding yeast.</p></sec><sec><title>Damage at replication forks during re-replication</title><p>The absence of a robust replication checkpoint response to stabilize replication forks during re-replication may be partially or completely responsible for the re-replication-induced DNA damage that activates the damage checkpoint. Operation of the replication checkpoint during normal, unperturbed S phase is essential to prevent the accumulation of damaged DNA (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]). It seems likely, therefore, that &#x02013; in the absence of fork stabilization by the replication checkpoint &#x02013; damage would also accumulate during re-replication. An additional phenomenon that may contribute to DNA damage during re-replication is the likely collisions of faster forks with slower forks traveling in the same direction (forks chasing forks; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]).</p></sec><sec><title>Consequences of absence of the DNA damage checkpoint (in <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; cells) during re-replication</title><p>The patterns of re-replication in <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; cells were largely similar to those in wild-type and <italic>cds1</italic>&#x00394; cells (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). However, some differences were evident (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), including greater amplifications of sequences at centromeres, the mating-type locus, and the telomeres of chromosomes 1 and 2. These regions have in common the fact that they are heterochromatic. The common response of all the major heterochromatic regions (telomeres, centromeres and the mating-type locus) to the <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; mutation after inducing DNA re-replication is somewhat surprising, since during normal S phase the telomeres, which replicate late and are checkpoint-regulated, behave very differently from the centromeres and mating type locus, which replicate early and are not checkpoint-regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In future studies, it will be interesting to elucidate the mechanisms by which the Rad3 protein suppresses over-replication of these heterochromatic regions during Cdc18*-induced re-replication. Futures studies should also shed light on the mechanisms leading to different timing and checkpoint-response behaviors for telomeres (on the one hand) and centromeres and the mating-type locus (on the other hand) during normal replication.</p><p>The <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; mutation increased not only the amount of amplification but also the sizes of the amplified regions at telomeres, from 50&#x02013;75 kb in wild-type and <italic>cds1</italic>&#x00394; cells to more than 100 kb in <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). It is known that Rad3 but not Cds1 is important for heterochromatin formation in sub-telomeric regions as measured by gene silencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Therefore it is tempting to speculate that telomere-associated effects are due to a Rad3-specific function directly affecting the chromosomes rather than being an indirect effect of the loss of cell cycle control in <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; cells. One caveat is that telomeric heterochromatin normally extends no further than about 20 kb into the sequenced regions at the ends of chromosomes 1 and 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. This is smaller than the region amplified in any of the three strains. It is possible that re-replication forks initiated within telomeric heterochromatin may extend into centromere-proximal non-heterochromatic regions.</p></sec><sec><title>Telomeric amplification as a possible marker for re-replication</title><p>Telomeric regional amplification is the clearest similarity between re-replication in fission and budding yeasts. There are extensive similarities between the sub-telomeric regions of these two evolutionarily distant yeast species. The telomeres are localized near the nuclear envelope, they are transcriptionally silenced, they are late-replicating, replication is checkpoint responsive, and these regions are preferentially amplified during re-replication (this study, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]). In both yeasts, the size of the specifically-amplified region is ~50 kb. In both yeasts, this amplification zone is followed by a region of under-replication, suggesting the possible presence of some type of barrier or transition zone, with possible biological significance. That the distinct pattern of re-replication adjacent to telomeres is conserved between the highly diverged fission and budding yeasts suggests that preferential amplification may be a basic feature of re-replication near telomeres and therefore may also occur in metazoans.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Here we have presented the results of the first microarray analysis in fission yeast of re-replication induced by over-expression of the initiation protein, Cdc18*, a mutant Cdc18 lacking N-terminal Cdk phosphorylation sites. This is also the first microarray analysis in any organism to compare re-replication in wild-type cells with re-replication in checkpoint-mutant cells.</p><p>Wild-type and checkpoint-mutant cells re-replicated DNA throughout their genomes, but the extents of re-replication varied somewhat, with the result that broad regions of hundreds of kilobases were relatively over-re-replicated or under-re-replicated by approximately two-fold or less. The locations of these broad regions did not correspond to the locations of origins that fired efficiently during normal S phase.</p><p>There were no significant differences in the patterns or extents of re-replication between wild-type cells and cells deleted for Cds1, a downstream checkpoint kinase that is essential for the replication checkpoint. This observation suggested that the replication checkpoint might not function during re-replication under our experimental conditions (induction of re-replication in exponentially growing cells) &#x02013; consistent with the possibility that re-replication under our experimental conditions took place primarily during G2 phase, when the replication checkpoint is known to be inoperative.</p><p>Similar to re-replicating cells lacking Cds1, re-replicating cells lacking Rad3 (which functions in all phases of the cell cycle and is essential for both the replication and damage checkpoints) accumulated broad regions that were relatively over-re-replicated or under-re-replicated and strongly resembled the patterns observed in wild-type and <italic>cds1</italic>&#x00394; cells. In contrast to wild-type and <italic>cds1</italic>&#x00394; cells, <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; cells attempted mitotic division after induction of re-replication. As a result, the small differences that we noted between the <italic>rad3</italic>&#x00394; strain and our other strains may reflect Rad3-specific functions directly affecting re-replication or may be the result of mitotic divisions and cell cycle progression.</p><p>In wild-type and <italic>cds1</italic>&#x00394; cells, the telomeres of chromosomes 1 and 2 were highly amplified, and the amplification spread away from the telomere for ~50&#x02013;75 kb. The DNA from ~100 to ~300 kb from the telomere tended to be under-amplified, suggesting the possible presence of a re-replication barrier in this region. This pattern (over-re-replication near telomeres followed by under-re-replication ~100 kb later) is very similar to the pattern seen in the distantly related budding yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], suggesting that the same pattern may be conserved in other eukaryotic organisms.</p><p>Since several different genetic alterations, each of which leads to excess activity of the initiation proteins Cdt1 and/or Cdc6, can induce re-replication in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], it is likely that induction of re-replication is one of the genome-destabilizing processes that can lead to cancer.

N/A designates a lack of an average re-replicated-to-control DNA ratio for a probe due to fewer than two good hybridizations or an average deviation &#x0003e;0.2 for that particular probe.
