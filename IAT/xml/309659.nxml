Immunoaffinity purified spliceosomal snRNPs (U1, U2, U5, and U4/U6) were tested for their ability to phosphorylate in vitro the U1-specific 70K protein. An snRNP-associated kinase activity which phosphorylates all U1-70K isoelectric variants was identified. Like its in vivo counterpart, this snRNP-associated enzyme phosphorylates solely serine residues of the 70K protein, preferentially utilizing ATP as a phosphodonor. Tryptic phosphopeptide analysis revealed an overlapping set of at least four radiolabeled peptides in the in vivo and in vitro phosphorylated protein, suggesting that the snRNP-associated serine kinase is responsible, at least in part, for the 70K protein phosphorylation observed in vivo. Chymotryptic digestion of in vitro, 32P-labeled 70K protein and in vitro phosphorylation studies with a synthetic peptide, indicated that the multiple 70K phosphorylation sites are limited to a highly charged, C-terminal domain of the protein. In vitro phosphorylation studies with the splicing factor ASF/SF2 and several deletion mutants demonstrated that, similar to the U1-70K protein, the snRNP-associated serine kinase phosphorylates the carboxy terminal RS-rich domain of ASF/SF2. A potential general role for this enzyme in the phosphorylation of splicing factors and its consequences for pre-mRNA splicing regulation are discussed.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00061-0042-a" xlink:role="2817"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00061-0042-b" xlink:role="2817"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00061-0043-a" xlink:role="2818"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00061-0043-b" xlink:role="2818"/></fig><fig id="F5"><graphic xlink:href="nar00061-0045-a" xlink:role="2820"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00061-0040.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2815"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00061-0041.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2816"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00061-0042.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2817"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00061-0043.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2818"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00061-0044.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2819"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00061-0045.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2820"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00061-0046.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2821"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00061-0047.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2822"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
