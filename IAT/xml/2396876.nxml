The bacterium uses an autotransporter protein UspA1 to target an important human cellular receptor carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1). Using X-ray crystallography, we show that the CEACAM1 receptor-binding region of UspA1 unusually consists of an extended, rod-like left-handed trimeric coiled-coil. Mutagenesis and binding studies of UspA1 and the N-domain of CEACAM1 have been used to delineate the interacting surfaces between ligand and receptor and guide assembly of the complex. However, solution scattering, molecular modelling and electron microscopy analyses all indicate that significant bending of the UspA1 coiled-coil stalk also occurs. This explains how UspA1 can engage CEACAM1 at a site far distant from its head group, permitting closer proximity of the respective cell surfaces during infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>adhesion molecules</kwd><kwd>bacterial adhesin</kwd><kwd>coiled-coil</kwd><kwd>SAXS</kwd><kwd>X-ray crystallography</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p><italic>Moraxella catarrhalis</italic> (<italic>Mx</italic>) is a human-specific bacterium present in the nasopharynx of up to 75&#x00025; of healthy individuals, but frequently causes childhood otitis media, sinusitis and exacerbation of lung conditions in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Karalus and Campagnari, 2000</xref>). As such, it is associated with widespread morbidity. However, there are no protective vaccines and antibiotic resistance is an increasing problem. Understanding the molecular events that facilitate the complex virulence mechanisms during <italic>Mx</italic> infection is key to the development of novel therapeutics and vaccines.</p><p>Infection by pathogenic bacteria such as <italic>Moraxella</italic> is initiated by multifunctional bacterial surface adhesin proteins that may additionally act in defensive roles to evade immune recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Karalus and Campagnari, 2000</xref>). A number of <italic>Mx</italic> adhesins have been identified and characterised from non-fimbriate (non-piliated) bacteria. These include the oligomeric coiled-coil adhesins (Oca, also recently classified as trimeric autotransporters; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Linke <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) such as YadA from enteropathogenic <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica</italic>, Hia from <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> (<italic>Hi</italic>) and the ubiquitous surface proteins UspA1 and UspA2 from <italic>Mx</italic>. A range of studies have confirmed the importance of these molecules in pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Aebi <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Lafontaine <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Yeo <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Attia <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Heise and Dersch, 2006</xref>). The human carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1), which is widely distributed on epithelial cells including those of the oropharynx and lower respiratory tracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Hammarstrom, 1999</xref>), has been identified as a receptor for UspA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Hill and Virji, 2003</xref>). Other members of the CEACAM receptor family expressed on epithelia (CEA and CEACAM6) also bind to UspA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Hill <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>), although these are less well studied. Over the past decade CEACAM1 has emerged as a common human receptor targeted by several respiratory pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Virji <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Hill <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). These include the opportunistic pathogens <italic>Mx</italic>, <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> (<italic>Nm</italic>) and <italic>Hi</italic>, all of which interact with an overlapping site in the N-terminal domain of the receptor (N-CEACAM1) often leading to cellular invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Virji <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Hill and Virji, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Griffiths <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Villullas <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). In addition, CEACAM1 is bound by strains of enterobacteria such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Leusch <italic>et al</italic>, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Guignot <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>) and several murine CEACAM1a isoforms serve as receptors for mouse hepatitis virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Dveksler <italic>et al</italic>, 1993</xref>). A recombinant protein rD-7 (here referred to as UspA1<sup>(527&#x02013;665)</sup>) based on this region of UspA1 has been shown to block binding of multiple respiratory pathogens, virtually eliminating binding of <italic>Nm</italic> and <italic>Hi</italic> isolates to human lung epithelial cells and substantially reducing <italic>Mx</italic> interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Hill <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). An antiadhesion strategy targeting N-CEACAM1 may therefore provide a unified approach to control infections caused by these pathogens and an alternative to antibiotic treatment.</p><p>Electron microscopy studies have shown that YadA, UspA1 and UspA2 form dense forests of lollipop-like structures at the bacterial surface projecting from 200 &#x000c5; (YadA) to 600&#x02013;700 &#x000c5; (UspA1) from the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Hoiczyk <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). The UspAs have been shown by SDS&#x02013;PAGE to form oligomeric structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Cope <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>). Amino-acid sequence comparisons have identified similar domains in YadA, Hia, UspA1 and UspA2 despite the considerable variations in their respective sizes (monomer masses are YadA 41&#x02013;43 kDa, Hia 100&#x02013;125 kDa, UspA1 88&#x02013;100 kDa and UspA2 60&#x02013;71 kDa). Each adhesin has a tripartite structure consisting of a head group, extended stalk region and membrane anchor domain. Although, up to now, no detailed structural information has been available for the UspAs, crystal structures have been reported for the head groups from YadA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Nummelin <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>) and Hia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Yeo <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>), the Hia membrane domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Meng <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) and a theoretical model has been proposed for the overall structure of YadA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Koretke <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Wollmann <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). In this model, the stalk has been proposed to adopt a trimeric coiled-coil structure with the C-terminal membrane anchor domain based on the crystal structure of a bacterial autotransporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Oomen <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). This model has been supported by the crystal structure of the Hia membrane domain, which is constructed from four &#x003b2;-strands contributed from each of three monomers; the resulting 12-stranded &#x003b2;-barrel ensures trimerisation of the structure. Amino-acid sequence comparisons indicate that the UspAs differ most significantly from YadA in the length of both their head groups and stalk regions, and in the periodicity and handedness of the proposed coiled-coil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Hoiczyk <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>).</p><p>UspA adhesins are multi-functional proteins for which a range of binding functions have been reported (see schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). These include binding sites for fibronectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Tan <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>) and laminin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Tan <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), both in the N-terminal end of the UspAs where they are likely to be furthermost from the bacterial membrane and therefore most readily available for attachment. Serum resistance is also associated with UspA proteins as UspA2 contains a complement C3-binding region (regions 200&#x02013;458) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Aebi <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>) and both UspA1 and UspA2 bind to the complement binding protein C4bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Nordstrom <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Importantly, UspA1 has been shown to include a critical binding site for CEACAM1 away from the head group within residues 527&#x02013;667 of the MX2 strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Hill <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). In the extended 600- to 700-&#x000c5;-long structure expected for UspA1 based on the YadA model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Koretke <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) this is expected to be at least 400 &#x000c5; from the head group (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). In contrast, the predicted four immunoglobulin superfamily extracellular domains of CEACAM1 could project only just over 100 &#x000c5; from the epithelial cell surface. Matching of these regions and sufficiently close approach of the bacterial and host cell membranes to allow adhesion and infection to proceed would therefore appear difficult. In view of this apparent disparity and to explore the crucial importance of the UspA1&#x02013;CEACAM1 interaction to <italic>Mx</italic> pathogenicity, in this study we have initially determined the structure of the CEACAM1 receptor-binding site in UspA1. This has then been combined with the crystal structure of N-CEACAM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Fedarovich <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) to reveal the structure of the CEACAM1:UspA1 complex, assembled using a complementary approach combining data from crystallographic, mutagenesis and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) techniques.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>The UspA1 CEACAM1-binding site is part of an extended trimeric coiled-coil</title><p>Initially, to probe the structural basis of the bacterial ligand&#x02013;host receptor interaction, we determined the crystallographic structure of the UspA1<sup>(527&#x02013;665)</sup> fragment. Although this region incorporates several regions with predicted low propensity for coiled-coil formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Hoiczyk <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>), UspA1<sup>(527&#x02013;665)</sup> was found to form a contiguous, extended coiled-coil structure within the crystal lattice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). Whereas earlier estimates of UspA1 oligomer composition were ambiguous, the crystal structure confirms that three polypeptide strands coalesce to form a left-handed trimeric coiled-coil. In each chain, there is clear electron density for 135 of the 139 amino acids with four residues (527&#x02013;530) being disordered at the N terminus of each chain (this and all subsequent sequence numbering refers to UspA1 from the <italic>M. catarrhalis</italic> MX2 strain). As the trimer lies along the crystallographic three-fold axis, the conformation of each monomer within the trimer is identical. There are two monomers within the asymmetric unit and both are highly similar (root mean square deviation of all equivalent C&#x003b1;'s=1.3 &#x000c5;). The resulting rod-like structure is approximately 200 &#x000c5; long and 20 &#x000c5; in diameter.</p><p>To our knowledge, UspA1<sup>(527&#x02013;665)</sup> forms the longest segment of triple coiled-coil for which a high-resolution structure has been determined. Overall, the average periodicity of the coil is 3.5 residues per turn with a pitch of about 150 &#x000c5;, close to the expected hypothetical geometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Lupas, 1996</xref>). Analysis of the structure with the coiled-coil software <italic>SOCKET</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Walshaw and Woolfson, 2001</xref>) identified 84 &#x02018;knobs into holes' interactions; all are of type 4 with packing angles of between 45 and 60&#x000b0; as commonly observed in trimers. Although UspA1<sup>(527&#x02013;665)</sup> appears to adopt a classic trimeric coiled-coil structure, there are a number of surprises. Whereas most of the internal hydrophobic residues (positions <italic>a</italic> and <italic>d</italic> by the standard convention; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Lupas, 1996</xref>) are a mixture of alanines, isoleucines, valines and asparagines&#x02014;as expected for trimeric coiled-coils&#x02014;this pattern is disrupted at residue 573 when, unusually, a histidine is incorporated at a <italic>d</italic> position within the core. This is seen again three turns later at histidine 584 (position <italic>a</italic>) and then further after another 12 turns at histidine 629 (position <italic>d</italic>). For both histidines 584 and 629, the potential charge these residues incorporate within the core appears to be ameliorated through the incorporation of a bound phosphate ion. These ions are located equidistant (3.0 &#x000c5;) from the histidine of each monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). The histidine rings are partially orientated through formation of a bifurcated hydrogen bond between each phosphate oxygen, a bound water, the main chain carbonyl group of Leu 580 (at His 584) and interactions with the neighbouring side chain of Ser 630 (at His 629). It is not clear whether binding of these phosphate ions, presumably from the crystallisation buffer, is biologically relevant.</p><p>We also observe density consistent with eight chloride ions bound within the central core of the coiled-coil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref>). These are present when an asparagine residue is encountered in the central cavity of the coiled-coil (position <italic>d</italic>), and in each instance the ions interact via the amide nitrogen of the asparagine side chain with distances ranging from 3.1 to 3.2 &#x000c5;. Chloride ions have been observed previously in the central core of a number of similar structures including those of fibritin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Tao <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>) and the spike glycoprotein from the SARS coronavirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Duquerroy <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>) and are proposed to add specificity in aligning the individual monomers of the coiled-coil.</p><p>Finally, the degree of helical supercoiling relaxes towards the C terminus where there is a stutter in the sequence starting from Ser 657 (three residues of the heptad appear to be missing) and a decrease in supercoiling is evident. Because of the breakdown in the pattern of core hydrophobic residues, this distortion is likely to be inherent within the sequence rather than a response to the artificial truncation of the coiled-coil within this recombinant construct.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Stability of the coiled-coil stalk</title><p>The unexpected incorporation of potentially charged histidine side chains within the hydrophobic core of the trimeric assembly led us to speculate that protonation of these groups might provide a mechanism for destabilisation of the assembly, hence potentially initiating or assisting flexibility within the rod-like structure. Circular dichroism (CD) was used to assay the helical content of UspA1<sup>(527&#x02013;665)</sup> in response to changes in pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). These data indicated a sharp transition from a helical folded structure (assumed to be coiled-coil) to random coil once the pH dropped below 4.8. Protonation of the histidine side chains (normally expected to occur at pH 6, but often reduced in hydrophobic core regions), introducing repulsive positive charges within the core of the trimer, would be expected to be incompatible with trimer assembly. However, these data also confirm that the coiled-coil form must prevail at physiological pH.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>UspA1<sup>(527&#x02013;665)</sup> forms a stable complex with N-CEACAM1</title><p>Next, we used gel permeation chromatography (GPC), analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) equilibrium sedimentation studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>) and isothermal calorimetry (ITC) to confirm that N-CEACAM1 forms a stable complex in solution with UspA1<sup>(527&#x02013;665)</sup>. In all cases, self-aggregation and the extended shape of UspA1<sup>(527&#x02013;665)</sup> lead to non-ideal behaviour, complicating the data interpretation. On GPC, UspA1<sup>(527&#x02013;665)</sup> runs anomalously, eluting with an apparent molecular mass of 110 kDa (expected mass of trimer 45 494), whereas N-CEACAM1 (expected mass 11 747) appeared to be 19.5 kDa, perhaps reflecting its known propensity for homo-dimerisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Watt <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>). The complex of UspA1<sup>(527&#x02013;665)</sup> with N-CEACAM1 eluted with an apparent molecular mass of 150 kDa; this peak broadening on the addition of excess N-CEACAM1. Similarly, global fit analysis of sedimentation equilibrium AUC data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>) indicated a mass of 27 237 for N-CEACAM1 suggesting a dimer, and a mass of 43 896 for UspA1<sup>(527&#x02013;665)</sup> indicative of a trimer. Determination of the mass of their complex was complicated by pronounced pressure effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Kegeles <italic>et al</italic>, 1967</xref>) that lead to a reduction in observed apparent mass at higher speeds. Global fit analysis of the lower speed data for the complex gave a mass of 74 162, which appears consistent with one UspA1<sup>(527&#x02013;665)</sup> trimer binding either one N-CEACAM1 dimer or two monomers, although lower masses were obtained from the higher speed data. Aggregation of UspA1<sup>(527&#x02013;665)</sup> and competing homo-dimerisation of N-CEACAM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Watt <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>) also affected the quality of the ITC data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>). However, these data confirm each trimer of UspA1<sup>(527&#x02013;665)</sup> can readily bind up to two molecules of N-CEACAM1 (<italic>N</italic>=2.0&#x000b1;0.2) with high affinity (estimated <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> 24&#x000b1;22 nM), after which only weak, possibly nonspecific, further association is observed. Taking into account the limitations of each of these techniques in analysing this complex association event, in summary we concluded that each trimer of UspA1<sup>(527&#x02013;665)</sup> provides a high-affinity binding site for a maximum of two molecules of N-CEACAM1.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Location of the receptor-binding site on UspA1</title><p>An electrostatic potential surface calculated from the UspA1<sup>(527&#x02013;665)</sup> crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2E</xref>) displayed a predominance of anionic and cationic regions on the solvent-accessible coiled-coil surface. However, one section of the coiled-coil was striking for its deviation from this pattern. The segment 578&#x02013;597 contains only one charged residue&#x02014;histidine 584&#x02014;which is buried within the hydrophobic core (see above). The exterior surface of this segment is notably hydrophobic (white in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2E</xref>). This region is located just over one-third of the way along the rod-like structure, approximately 80 &#x000c5; from the N terminus.</p><p>As this distinctive patch also overlapped with a normally highly conserved region, which is unusually absent in the UspA1 of <italic>Mx</italic> O35E strain that does not bind to N-CEACAM1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary data</xref>), site-directed mutants of surface residues both within and adjacent to this region were prepared. Each of the mutants was selected and designed to have minimal impact on the coiled-coil formation. The mutants made are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref> and include changes to amino acids expected to be exposed at the binding interface (L583A, M586A, A588Q and A590Q), a double mutation (M586A/A588Q) and a control substitution (A568Q) from outside the predicted region of the N-CEACAM1 interaction. Western blotting was used to confirm that in each case the purified mutant protein retained the ability to form trimers indicative of retention of the coiled-coil structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary data</xref>). This was further confirmed for the double mutant (M586A/A588Q) where the CD spectra of both the native and mutant proteins were found to be essentially identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>) and only a minor thermodynamic difference was observed in their melting temperatures (41 and 39&#x000b0;C, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>). These observations confirm that the amino-acid substitutions introduced do not affect the structure or assembly of the coiled-coil, indicating that altered binding effects are likely to arise from direct contacts of these amino acids with N-CEACAM1 rather than by disruption of the UspA1 gross structure.</p><p>The ability of these mutant UspA1<sup>(527&#x02013;665)</sup> proteins to bind CEACAM1-Fc was measured in an ELISA and is summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>. No significant difference in binding was observed between the wild-type UspA1<sup>(527&#x02013;665)</sup> and the control construct (A568Q) at any of the concentrations tested. At limiting CEACAM1 concentration, decreased CEACAM1 binding was observed at one or more UspA1 concentrations for all of the other constructs. The most striking effect on CEACAM binding was observed for the mutants L583A, M586A, A590Q and the double substitution (M586A/A588Q) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>). Comparable binding of anti-polyhistidine antibody was observed to all constructs confirming equivalent coating of all constructs to the ELISA plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C</xref>, ii). These studies indicated that the order of importance of single UspA1 residues involved in CEACAM1 engagement appears to be L583&#x0003e;A590&#x0003e;M586&#x0003e;A588.</p><p>These binding data were also supported by western blotting analysis in which UspA1<sup>(527&#x02013;665)</sup> constructs were overlaid with CEACAM1-Fc and detected by an anti-Fc antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C</xref>). In these assays, no decrease in binding was evident between native UspA1<sup>(527&#x02013;665)</sup>, the A568Q control or the A588Q substitution. A decrease in CEACAM1 binding was observed to M586A (14.8&#x00025;), A590Q (15.0&#x00025;), L583A (92.0&#x00025;) and the double substitution (90.4&#x00025;). These data parallel the ELISA data and affirm the relative importance of UspA1 residues involved in CEACAM1 engagement as L583&#x0003e;A590&#x0003e;M586&#x0003e;A588. It is interesting to note that in both ELISA studies and western blot analysis the double substitution M586A/A588Q abrogates binding and this appears to be a synergistic effect in both techniques. Such data highlight the importance of multiple amino-acid engagement in the interaction of UspA1 and CEACAM1.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The UspA1-binding site on its CEACAM1 receptor</title><p>Identification of the surface on CEACAM1 that interacts with UspA1 was facilitated by a number of prior observations: (1) other pathogens&#x02014;<italic>Nm</italic> and <italic>Hi</italic>&#x02014;that recognise N-CEACAM1 have been found to use a site centred on the critical CEACAM1 residue I91 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Virji <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Villullas <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>); (2) this site also forms an epitope for an anti-CEACAM1 antibody shown to block binding of <italic>Nm</italic> and <italic>Hi</italic> as well as <italic>Mx</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Hill and Virji, 2003</xref>); (3) recombinant UspA1<sup>(527&#x02013;665)</sup> inhibits binding of all three pathogens to CEACAM1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Hill <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Combining these earlier results, we surmised that the UspA1-binding site must at least partially overlap with the site also used by <italic>Nm</italic> and <italic>Hi</italic>. We therefore mutated I91 and surrounding residues on CEACAM1 to define the extent of the UspA1-binding site. In ELISA studies, binding of N-CEACAM1 to UspA1<sup>(527&#x02013;665)</sup> was significantly impaired when I91 was mutated to Ala, and moderate reductions in binding accompanied mutation of surrounding residues Y34, Q44 and G47, whereas little or no effect was noted for the mutations of S32, T56, V39, V96 and Q89 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary data</xref>). No reduction in binding was also noted for V39A, confirming UspA1 binds to the monomeric form of CEACAM1 as this mutation has previously been shown to abolish dimerisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Watt <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>). Interestingly, the introduction of a leucine side chain to CEACAM1 position 56 partially restored binding to the UspA1 L583A mutant. From our model of the complex (see below) it was anticipated that these mutations should be compensatory.</p><p>In summary, the mutagenesis data for both UspA1<sup>(527&#x02013;665)</sup> and N-CEACAM1 when combined with their respective crystal structures enabled us to locate their interacting surfaces.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The N-CEACAM1:UspA1<sup>(527&#x02013;665)</sup> complex</title><p>A tentative model for the complex of N-CEACAM1 with UspA1<sup>(527&#x02013;665)</sup> was then prepared by assembling the two individual crystal structures. This preliminary model was built by comparing the respective sites identified by site-directed mutagenesis, manually assembling the two surfaces in the most complementary orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>) followed by energy minimisation of the complex. This generated an interface in which the UspA1 residues M586 and A590 are in close proximity to I91 of the receptor, UspA1 A588 is adjacent to Y34, V39 and Q89 of CEACAM1 and UspA1 L583 lies next to Q44, G47 and T56 of CEACAM1. These residues form the region identified by the mutagenesis studies to affect binding. The complementary nature of these surfaces was only marred by a small protrusion of the F/G loop of N-CEACAM1, a region that is involved in a homo-dimerisation interaction around a two-fold axis in the crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Fedarovich <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). It is likely that this conformation is not maintained within the monomeric form of N-CEACAM1 which, as confirmed by the binding of the monomeric V39A mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Watt <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>), is the active form for binding to UspA1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary data</xref>). Although the actual conformation of the F/G loop in this form is uncertain, we noted that on energy minimisation of the complex this region protrudes into a distinctive cavity formed at the interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>), possibly assisting partial unwinding of the coiled-coil assembly. The surface area occupied by the N-CEACAM1 molecule is approximately one-third of the circumferential surface area in the proposed binding site region of the UspA1 trimeric structure, implying that three N-CEACAM1 molecules could bind simultaneously. This is in contrast to the AUC and ITC data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>) which show that, in practice, only two N-CEACAM1 molecules bind with high affinity to UspA1<sup>(527&#x02013;665)</sup>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Binding of receptor correlates with bending of the stalk region of UspA1</title><p>To validate the proposed model for the N-CEACAM1/UspA1<sup>(527&#x02013;665)</sup> complex, we obtained SAXS data. The scattering patterns of solutions of the complex and of uncomplexed UspA1<sup>(527&#x02013;665)</sup> are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>. There is further indication of the self-aggregation behaviour also noted at high concentrations of uncomplexed UspA1<sup>(527&#x02013;665)</sup> in the AUC studies, and this prevented reliable interpretation of the SAXS data from the unliganded form. However, the scattering curve changes upon complex formation of UspA1<sup>(527&#x02013;665)</sup> with N-CEACAM1, and is consistent with a mono-disperse solution with an estimated molecular mass that agrees well with the value predicted from the primary sequence of the expected complex. The distance distribution function <italic>p</italic>(<italic>r</italic>) of the complex suggests an elongated shape with a maximum diameter of &#x0223c;14 nm and a cross section of &#x0223c;2 nm (the latter parameter corresponds to a maximal <italic>p</italic>(<italic>r</italic>)). The experimental radius of gyration was 4.58&#x000b1;0.09 nm.</p><p>A low-resolution model of the complex was reconstructed <italic>ab initio</italic> from the experimental scattering patterns. Reconstructions using DAMMIN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Svergun, 1999</xref>) yielded similar envelopes with consistently reasonable fits to the experimental data (&#x003c7; values of &#x0223c;1.5) and which could be readily superimposed (mean NSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Volkov and Svergun, 2003</xref>) of 0.88) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>). Although the data indicate a diversity of potential fits, all of the shapes share the same essential features: the complex is seen to be elongated and is of comparable dimensions (approximately 200 &#x000c5; in total length, 20&#x02013;30 &#x000c5; in diameter) to the UspA1 crystal structure. Distinctively, however, there is a significant bend in the molecule (30&#x02013;60&#x000b0; deflection from the linear form in the various models), resulting in a &#x02018;boomerang' shape. Adjacent to the apex of this bend there is a thickening of the envelope, approximately sufficient to accommodate two N-CEACAM1 domains. Bending of the UspA1 rod was approximated by splitting the modelled complex into four equal lengths. These were fitted to the scattering data as separate rigid bodies using the software SASREF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Petoukhov and Svergun, 2005</xref>). A complete model of the complex was generated by rejoining of the UspA1 polypeptide chains followed by energy minimisation. This model was then fitted to the scattering data using the software CRYSOL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Svergun <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>), which resulted in a &#x003c7; value of 1.45. By contrast, attempts to fit the predicted scattering from a complex in which UspA1<sup>(527&#x02013;665)</sup> retained a straight rod-like shape produced significantly poorer correlation with the experimental data (&#x003c7; value of 3.11; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><p>To explore the feasibility of this model of the complex, molecular dynamics simulations were undertaken (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary data</xref>). Simulations of the unliganded form of UspA1<sup>(527&#x02013;665)</sup> indicated this form, although showing some flexibility, remained fully extended across the period of the simulation. In contrast, the same simulations conducted in the presence of one or two bound N-CEACAM1s and commencing with the straight form of UspA1<sup>(527&#x02013;665)</sup> reproducibly showed distinctive bending was induced. This distortion rapidly led to distortions of 30&#x02013;70&#x000b0;, similar to those observed in the SAXS envelopes.</p><p>By inference, this distorted model for the complex is also supported by the observation from both the AUC and ITC studies that only two molecules of N-CEACAM1 can bind each initially symmetrical trimer of UspA1. The absence of strong binding to the third site implies distortion of this remaining site, and hence of the UspA1 molecule. Finally, using transmission electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary data</xref>), we have also observed that UspA1 appears to adopt not only extended structures in the surface array of <italic>Mx</italic> but significant perturbations also appear to be more prevalent in the presence of CEACAM1 receptor. Through gene deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Hoiczyk <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>) it has previously been established that the most extended molecules at the <italic>Mx</italic> surface predominantly comprise UspA1. This demonstrates that both linear and distorted conformations of UspA1 are possible on the bacterial surface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary data</xref>). Although the resolution in these studies is insufficient to correlate the shapes observed directly with the structural model of the complex presented herein, these changes are consistent with the SAXS observations, and molecular dynamics simulations.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Coiled-coil motifs have been increasingly identified within a wide range of proteins and are believed to perform a variety of roles delivered by extended, relatively rigid structures (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Lupas, 1996</xref>). Although many coiled-coil proteins are dimeric, parallel trimeric coiled-coil structures have been reported for a number of viral and bacterial proteins, including the influenza hemagglutinin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Wilson <italic>et al</italic>, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bullough <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>), murine leukaemia virus spike protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Fass <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>), mannose-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Sheriff <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>) and in the stalk of the head group of the UspA1-related protein YadA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Nummelin <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). In all of these cases, the trimeric structure acts as a stalk to project other bio-active domains away from the pathogen membrane. In none of these cases, however, does the coiled-coil region itself act as ligand, instead playing a supporting structural role. The partial structure of UspA1 reported in this study is different. First, at about 200 &#x000c5; in length (double the extended hemagglutinin structure), UspA1<sup>(527&#x02013;665)</sup> represents the longest stretch of trimeric coiled-coil for which a detailed structure is available. Second, UspA1 is unusual in utilising an extended stretch of regular coiled-coil as a receptor-binding domain. This is the first definitive example of this function for a trimeric coiled-coil, but it is likely there are others. For example, the M-like fibrinogen (Fg)-binding protein from the equine-specific bacterium <italic>Streptococcus equi</italic> has also previously been reported to contain an Fc-receptor-binding region within a multimeric coiled-coil stalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Meehan <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>), although no structural details are available.</p><p>The UspA1 protein is present at high density on the bacterial cell surface, and electron microscopy studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Hoiczyk <italic>et al</italic> (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary data</xref>) indicate this leads to forest-like densities in which the head groups may limit access to the closely packed stalk (trunk) regions. This arrangement is consistent with the linear structure observed for the uncomplexed form of UspA1<sup>(527&#x02013;665)</sup> within the crystal lattice; maximisation of crystal contacts would be expected to favour this form. At the bacterial surface, close packing of adhesins might be encouraged by the hydrophobic nature of the ligand-binding site and may, through restricting access of large antibodies, confer some protection of this region from immune recognition. This arrangement, however, presents a problem in that the resulting physical locations of the respective ligand/receptor pair seem incongruous to permit sufficiently close approach of bacterial and human cell membranes to allow effective adherence via the CEACAM1-binding site. Electron microscopy studies indicate UspA1 extends approximately 600&#x02013;700 &#x000c5; from the bacterial cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Hoiczyk <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). This is consistent with the expected length of an extended coiled-coil segment (residues 333&#x02013;742) of which UspA1<sup>(527&#x02013;665)</sup> represents approximately one-third (200 &#x000c5;). In the fully extended intact ligand, the receptor-binding site would therefore be located at least 450 &#x000c5; from the membrane-distal end of UspA1. In contrast, its receptor site on human CEACAM1&#x02014;by analogy with its similar construction to CD4 for which an overall structure is known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Wu <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>)&#x02014;can reach no further than about 120 &#x000c5; from the epithelial cell surface. Even if the receptor is primarily located within the highly invaginated microvilli of epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Hammarstrom, 1999</xref>) the sheer bulk created by the length of the extended head group would seem to present a steric difficulty for placing the ligand and receptor in close proximity. Two explanations seem possible. The head group of UspA1 may insert into the epithelial cell membrane prior to attachment of CEACAM1, allowing the base of the stalk region to come into closer proximity to epithelial cell surface. Alternatively, as suggested by this study, the stalk of UspA1 is capable of changing conformation to allow closer approach of the two respective membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>Deformability of the UspA1 stalk region is demonstrated by the solution scattering studies, where in the presence of its CEACAM1 receptor UspA1<sup>(527&#x02013;665)</sup> displays a distinctive curvature (bending angle of approximately 30&#x02013;60&#x000b0;). This implies that in its receptor complex the UspA1 stalk has increased flexibility. Although self-aggregation prevents us from accurately interpreting similar solution scattering data collected in the absence of CEACAM1, the change in the scattering curve that accompanies addition of the receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>) is consistent with an alteration in the molecular structure. Further, as the crystal structure shows UspA1<sup>(527&#x02013;665)</sup> to be symmetrical there appears to be no inherent mechanism for it to adopt a discrete bend (an asymmetric structure) in the absence of other effectors. This is supported by the molecular dynamics simulations, which indicate that the extended structure exhibits a degree of flexibility, but remains rod-like overall. In contrast, the same simulations conducted in the presence of bound N-CEACAM1 reveal a &#x02018;weak spot' within the trimeric coiled-coil in the vicinity of residue 610, equidistant between the CEACAM1-binding site and the stutter and coincident with the incorporation of internally bound ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">6</xref>). Binding of N-CEACAM1, therefore, seems to provide a mechanism to &#x02018;break' the three-fold symmetry and hence encourage formation of the bowed structure. The asymmetry produced by the bending is likely to distort remaining binding sites generated by the inherent three-fold symmetry, accounting for the observation that a maximum of two N-CEACAM1 molecules readily associate with each UspA1 trimer. Binding of receptor may also disrupt interactions of this hydrophobic region with neighbouring copies of UspA1 (akin to disruption of aggregation in the SAXS studies). The observation of curvature of UspA1 when in complex with its receptor noted in the solution scattering studies is supported by (i) the molecular dynamics simulations; (ii) the electron microscopy studies of the <italic>Mx</italic> cell surface where significant perturbations of the adhesin &#x02018;forest' are observed and (iii) is a logical inference from the AUC and ITC measurements of a maximal stoichiometry of two molecules of N-CEACAM1 can bind with high affinity to each trimer of UspA1. In combination, these data support the concept of increased flexibility and the ability to adopt a distinctly bowed structure when UspA1<sup>(527&#x02013;665)</sup> binds to its N-CEACAM1 receptor.</p><p>It is possible that this potential for the stalk region of UspA1 to bend within this discrete region may arise from the internal histidines and/or the stutter within the UspA1<sup>(527&#x02013;665)</sup> coiled-coil, which appear unique to this part of UspA1. The CD unfolding data highlight the marked instability of the coiled-coil structure to decreases in pH. Considering also the adjacent stutter, this whole region may be readily susceptible to the types of deformation seen in the SAXS analysis, molecular dynamics simulations and EM studies. By corollary, the extended triple coiled-coil in influenza hemagglutinin incorporates both buried histidines and several stutters along its length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bullough <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>) and is believed to be metastable&#x02014;allowing a dramatic re-modelling to take place as the pH is changed. The stimulus that instigates the conformational change in UspA1&#x02014;whether chemical or mechanical&#x02014;is unknown. It is possible that the composition of this region simply makes it more susceptible to deformation in response to mechanical force. Electron microscopy studies of UspA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Hoiczyk <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary data</xref>) and the related protein EmaA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Ruiz <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) at their respective cell surfaces indicate that a variety of conformations are observed but distinctive kinks are evident in both cases. Bending may be initially required to allow access for the receptor, which then stabilises this conformation by breaking the three-fold symmetry of the UspA1 stalk.</p><p>A recent structural determination of the <italic>E. coli</italic> Dr adhesin bound to its human CEA receptor indicates that Dr also binds across the homo-dimer-forming surface of the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Korotkova <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). This is very similar to the surface of CEACAM1 eclipsed by UspA1 in the current study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Korotkova <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Note that the bacterium may achieve an advantage in targeting this largely invariant surface of the receptor. In both cases, it would be expected that adhesin binding would be accompanied by disruption of the homo- and heterophilic interactions known to occur between members of the CEACAM family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Watt <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Korotkova <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p>UspA1 is also known to interact with laminin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Tan <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), a component of the basement membrane, and with fibronectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Tan <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>), which is prevalent in the extracellular matrix. Both these activities have been localised to the head group or nearby region. It is not known whether UspA1 can bind these ligands simultaneously in addition to CEACAM1. Further studies are required to provide a composite model for the multi-functional behaviour of UspA1, including its dynamic responses to the mechanical forces encountered as the bacterium encounters its host cell.
