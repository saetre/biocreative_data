We therefore hypothesized that circulating epithelial progenitor cells would also be present in normal human subjects and could be important for repair of the airway after lung injury. As lung transplantation is associated with lung injury, which is severe early on and exacerbated during episodes of infection and rejection, we hypothesized that circulating epithelial progenitor cell levels could predict clinical outcome following lung transplantation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Quantitative Real Time PCR was performed to determine peripheral blood mRNA levels of cytokeratin 5, a previously characterized marker of circulating epithelial progenitor cells. Cytokeratin 5 levels were evaluated in healthy human subjects, in lung transplant recipients immediately post-transplant and serially thereafter, and in heart transplant recipients. All normal human subjects examined expressed cytokeratin 5 in their buffy coat in amounts that were not significantly influenced by age or gender. There was a profound, statistically significant decrease in cytokeratin 5 mRNA expression levels in lung transplant patients compared to healthy human subjects (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3.1&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;13</sup>) and to heart transplant recipients. There was a moderate negative correlation between improved circulating cytokeratin 5 mRNA levels in lung transplant recipients with recovering lung function, as measured by improved FEV1 values (rho&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;&#x02212;0.39).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Levels of cytokeratin 5 mRNA, a proxy marker for circulating epithelial progenitor cells, inversely correlated with disease status in lung transplant recipients.

An efficient mechanism for airway repair is therefore essential to protect the host. Our current understanding of proximal airway repair is that a progenitor cell pool is located in the submucosal glands and submucosal gland ducts that are capable of self renewal and of differentiating in to the proximal airway subtypes e.g. mucus and ciliated cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005925-Engelhardt1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005925-Borthwick1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005925-Hong1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005925-Hong2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005925-Schoch1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. These progenitor cells express the immature cytokeratins (CK) CK5 and CK14 and move up the submucosal gland ducts to form the basal layer of the pseudostratified columnar epithelium of the proximal airway. From there the basal cells lose CK5/14 and gain more mature cytokeratins e.g. CK8/18 as they differentiate and move apically.</p><p>We have shown the presence of circulating CK5 expressing cells that contributed to airway repair in a mouse model of ischemic injury and proximal airway repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005925-Gomperts1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. We used FACS analysis to show the presence of CK5 expressing cells in the bone marrow and circulation of mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005925-Gomperts1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The identification of circulating epithelial cells that contribute to airway repair represents a controversial paradigm shift in the current concept of airway repair and regeneration after injury. The overall aims of this study were to determine whether CK5 mRNA expression could be quantified in the circulation of normal human subjects and to determine whether CK5 mRNA levels would be altered with severe airway disease, such as in lung transplant patients with end stage lung disease. We also hypothesized that CK5 mRNA expression levels would increase as patients recovered post lung transplant and could function as a clinical biomarker of airway disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Detection of CK5 in the Circulation of Normal Human Subjects and Patients by Conventional PCR</title><p>We performed conventional PCR on cDNA obtained from the blood of normal human subjects and detected message for CK5 in all normal human subjects examined.

CK5 mRNA expression was not found in PCR Lanes 5, 8 and 9 and neither was CK5 mRNA expression detectible by quantitative real-time PCR in these samples. Lane 10 represents the positive control, which consists of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) containing 170 kb of genomic sequence surrounding the CK5 locus as template, which is why the band is a larger size. Lane 11 is the negative control without cDNA template. The bottom panel shows PCR amplification of GAPDH from the same templates. B. Standard curve of real-time PCR amplification of CK5 and GAPDH.

Then a standard curve consisting of serial dilutions of cDNA was performed with the determined CK5 primer and probe concentrations to determine the linear range of the assay. The triplicate reproducibility was noted to start to fall off the curve at threshold cycle (Ct) values greater than 36 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005925-g001">Figure 1Bi</xref>). The linear range of the GAPDH assay is more extensive than the CK5 assay because of the abundance of GAPDH expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005925-g001">Figure 1Bii</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="pone-0005925-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005925.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Optimization of the Assay for Primers and Probes.</title></caption><graphic id="pone-0005925-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0005925.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" alternate-form-of="pone-0005925-t001-1"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0005b;Primers (ea)&#x0005d; (nM)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0005b;Probe&#x0005d; (nM)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean CK5 Ct</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CK5 Ct SE</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean GAPDH Ct</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">50</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">250</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">37.414</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.073</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.894</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">100</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">250</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31.479</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.282</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.851</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">200</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">250</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">27.62</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.151</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.846</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">400</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">250</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26.294</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.098</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.754</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">600</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">250</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26.224</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.175</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.62</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">900</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">250</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25.955</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.139</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.623</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0005b;Primers (ea)&#x0005d; (nM)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0005b;Probe&#x0005d; (nM)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean CK5 Ct</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CK5 Ct SE</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean GAPDH Ct</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">600</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">50</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30.085</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.139</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.651</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">600</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">100</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">29.278</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.078</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.752</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">600</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">150</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">28.815</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.083</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.825</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">600</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">200</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">28.59</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.71</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">600</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">250</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">28.405</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.023</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.97</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><label/><p>The Quantitative Real Time PCR assay was first performed with varying concentrations of primer and then probe to determine the optimal concentration of primers and probe for the assay.

However, there was a trend for heart transplant patients to express less CK5 in circulation than normal human subjects (p-value&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.05).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Building on our previous studies on CK5 expressing circulating epithelial progenitor cells in the circulation, our present findings demonstrate the presence of CK5-positive cells in circulation in normal human subjects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005925-Gomperts1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, they correlate the levels of CK5 in circulation with lung status post transplant. The significant reduction in CK5 expressing cells in the circulation of lung transplant patients argues that there may be a role for circulating epithelial progenitor cells in normal airway repair. This is further emphasized by the correlation that was found between an increase in circulating epithelial progenitor cells and an improvement in lung function after transplantation. Together, these results are consistent with the view that circulating epithelial progenitor cells may be critical for normal airway repair and that a lack of circulating epithelial progenitor cells may be associated with airway disease.</p><p>One limitation of the patient studies is the inability to determine the origin of the circulating epithelial progenitor cells. Our results suggest that the origin of CK5 expressing cells in circulation may be from the bone marrow, the thymus, or may be derived from the lung tissue itself, or may be derived from all of these compartments. If the origin of the circulating epithelial progenitor cells is the bone marrow then it is possible that the immunosuppression that the lung transplant patients are on could be responsible for the decrease in the expression of CK5. We therefore analyzed the expression of CK5 in the circulation of heart transplant patients who are also on immunosuppression but do not have any major airway epithelial injury. We found a significant difference between the amount of circulating epithelial progenitor cells in heart transplant patients and lung transplant patients, which suggests that circulating epithelial progenitor cells are specific for airway repair. We also found a trend towards heart transplant patients having less circulating epithelial progenitor cells than normal human subjects. The heart transplant group were on lower doses of immunosuppression than the lung transplant patients, which suggests that immunosuppression may be playing a role in the reduction of circulating epithelial progenitor cells found in transplant patients. It is also possible that the differences in CK5 expression in circulation may result from changes in vascular permeability or altered blood supply to the lung allografts.</p><p>We did not find a difference in CK5 mRNA expression in normal human subjects with increasing age and this might be expected as normal repair and regeneration decreases with age. However, there are likely many variables in addition to age that contribute to overall repair of the airway. CK5 expressing cells are also found as basal cells in other complicated epithelia, most notably skin and prostate. We would therefore have predicted that gender differences might be seen, although this was not the case in our control samples. However, as benign prostatic hypertrophy is associated with advancing age, it will be important in the future to examine CK5 levels in older normal human subjects to determine if there is a gender difference in this group.</p><p>Previous studies on the engraftment of bone marrow-derived epithelial cells in the distal airway after lung injury have shown conflicting results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005925-Kotton1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005925-Kotton2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005925-Krause1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005925-Mattsson1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005925-Suratt1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005925-Kleeberger1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results demonstrated that circulating epithelial cells are present in the circulation of all normal human subjects examined. However, flow cytometry analysis of CK5 expressing cells in circulation are required to confirm this. Our experiments were performed retrospectively on frozen RNA samples and therefore flow cytometry for CK5 could not be performed. Our studies were not designed to assess the magnitude of engraftment of the circulating epithelial cells in the airway. However, the statistically significant difference between lung transplant patients and normal human subjects with regard to their CK5 mRNA levels suggested that circulating epithelial cells may be important in normal airway repair. In addition, the correlation of the increase in CK5 levels with the improvement in pulmonary function testing post-transplantation suggests that CK5 mRNA levels in circulation could be used as a biomarker of airway repair. By implication, it would appear that circulating epithelial progenitor cells most likely do play an important role in airway repair, although whether this is a direct of indirect effect still needs to be established. Ultimately, determining whether CK5 mRNA levels can be linked to the development of either acute or chronic rejection and/or infection is critical and is an area of active investigation in the lab.</p><p>In summary, CK5 expressing circulating epithelial progenitor cells are present in circulation in normal human subjects and can be quantified with the real time PCR assay that we have established. Furthermore, the circulating epithelial progenitor cells are significantly reduced immediately after lung transplantation, and then increase with time as lung function improves. We suggest that circulating epithelial progenitor cells may play an important role in airway repair after lung transplantation. In addition, circulating epithelial progenitor cells may be used as a biomarker of airway repair.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Selection and description of participants</title><sec id="s4a1"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The research was approved by the UCLA Institutional Review Board (IRB).

In addition, both peripheral blood and bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy were performed at 1week, 4 weeks, 3 months and 6 months post-transplantation and also when clinically indicated to evaluate for infection and/or rejection. We reported FEV1 as a percentage of the patient's best FEV1 post-transplant. Therefore, 100&#x00025; FEV1 is the best FEV1 measurement obtained for a particular patient.
