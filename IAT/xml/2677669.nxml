Although six somatostatin G protein-coupled receptors have been discovered, little is known about their distribution and function in the developing mammalian brain. In this study, we have first characterized the developmental expression of the somatostatin receptor sst2A, the subtype found most prominently in the adult rat and human nervous system. In the rat, the sst2A receptor expression appears as early as E12 and is restricted to post-mitotic neuronal populations leaving the ventricular zone. From E12 on, migrating neuronal populations immunopositive for the receptor were observed in numerous developing regions including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and ganglionic eminences. Intense but transient immunoreactive signals were detected in the deep part of the external granular layer of the cerebellum, the rostral migratory stream and in tyrosine hydroxylase- and serotonin- positive neurons and axons. Activation of the sst2A receptor <italic>in vitro</italic> in rat cerebellar microexplants and primary hippocampal neurons revealed stimulatory effects on neuronal migration and axonal growth, respectively. In the human cortex, receptor immunoreactivity was located in the preplate at early development stages (8 gestational weeks) and was enriched to the outer part of the germinal zone at later stages. In the cerebellum, the deep part of the external granular layer was strongly immunoreactive at 19 gestational weeks, similar to the finding in rodents. In addition, migrating granule cells in the internal granular layer were also receptor-positive. Together, theses results strongly suggest that the somatostatin sst2A receptor participates in the development and maturation of specific neuronal populations during rat and human brain ontogenesis.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="24"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Only a restricted number of neuropeptides have been reported to play a role in the fetal and early post-natal brain, among the region-specific factors that control cell proliferation, migration and differentiation during brain development.

Round, small (&#x0223c;7 &#x000b5;m) and densely packed immunoreactive cells were located along the outer limit of the ventricular zone, in the marginal zone, throughout rhombomeres r1 to r6. Immunoreactive processes were apparent in the ventricular zone, extending perpendicularly to the ventricle. Only rare colocalization with the proliferation marker Ki-67 was observed demonstrating that most of sst2A receptor-positive cells were not proliferating ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005509-g001">Fig. 1B&#x02013;B&#x02033;, F&#x02013;F&#x02033;</xref>). Double-labeling with the &#x003b2;-tubulin marker confirmed that this population of sst2A receptor-expressing cells was mostly post-mitotic neurons. In addition to this cell population, the sst2A receptor was also expressed by round and small post-mitotic neurons extending caudally to the nascent reticular formation and spinal cord. At E13, intense sst2A receptor immunoreactivity was visualized in the roots of several cranial nerves including the facial (7n) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005509-g001">Fig. 1G&#x02013;G&#x02033;</xref>), trigeminal and cochlear nerves. This labeling was no longer observed after E15. From E13 to E16, the number of sst2A receptor expressing cells became higher in the lateral reticular formation. These cells also expressed the &#x003b2;-tubulin marker. Between E15 and E17, most of serotonin (5-HT) positive cells, forming longitudinal columns on both sides of the floor plate from the developing dorsal raphe nucleus toward the raphe magnus nucleus, were immunoreactive for the sst2A receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005509-g002">Fig. 2</xref>).

At E14, intense receptor immunostaining was detected in the proliferative zone of the upper component of the rhombic lip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005509-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). This latter region corresponds to the germinal zone for the progenitors of the external granular layer (EGL). The vast majority of these sst2A positive cells migrating towards the future site of the EGL were post-mitotic, although some of them still expressed the proliferative marker Ki-67. From E14 to P10 the internal sublamina of the EGL strongly expressed sst2A receptor immunoreactivity. At E16, immunogold particles labeling the receptor were visualized by electron microscopy at the inner side of plasma membrane of round or elongated-shaped cells in the EGL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005509-g003">Fig. 3D,E</xref>), suggesting that receptors are efficiently targeted to active sites and could be functional. The proportion of membrane-associated receptor was 38.26&#x000b1;2.83&#x00025; of the total number of receptors. In vivo agonist-induced internalization and consequent redistribution of the receptor in intracytoplasmic domains is a powerful tool to demonstrate that receptors reach plasma membrane and can be activated by agonists, as previously demonstrated in the adult rat brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005509-Csaba4">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005509-Csaba6">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. In keeping with results obtained by electron microscopy, incubation of E16 brains with the sst2 receptor agonist octreotide induced redistribution of receptor immunoreactivity in the EGL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005509-g003">Fig. 3F,G</xref>). At P5, double-labeling experiments demonstrated that most of the sst2A receptor-expressing cells were not Ki-67-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005509-g003">Fig. 3I&#x02013;I&#x02033;</xref>) but colocalized with the neuronal marker NeuN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005509-g003">Fig. 3J&#x02013;J&#x02033;</xref>). The sst2A receptor was not expressed within the Purkinje cell layer. Beginning on E18, another important group of sst2A receptor-positive cells appeared to exit rostrally and ventrally from the rhombic lip toward the brainstem. Another pathway appeared to exit the rhombic lip dorsally toward the cerebellar cortex and disperse in a fountain-like spray. Receptor expressing cells were then gradually found in the developing internal granular layer (IGL). At P5, nearly all sst2A receptor-positive cells within the IGL also expressed the calcium-binding protein calretinin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005509-g003">Fig. 3K&#x02013;K&#x02033;</xref>). Conversely, nearly all of calretinin-positive cells were also positive for the somatostatin receptor. These sst2A receptor-expressing cells are most likely glutamatergic interneurons named unipolar brush cells because of calretinin expression and their oval-shaped and large perikaryon size displaying a single thick dendrite and a single axon. After P10, sst2 receptor immunoreactivity was no more detected in the cerebellum.</p><fig id="pone-0005509-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005509.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Regional, cellular and subcellular distribution of sst2A receptor immunoreactivity in sagittal sections of the rat cerebellum during pre- and postnatal development.</title><p>A) At E14, sst2A receptor immunoreactivity is detected in the developing cerebellum (boxed area).

In addition, we provide evidence that receptor activation has functional consequences on developing neurons. Taken together, our results led to six key findings. First, receptor expression in the rat brain is detected early during ontogenesis (E12) and is restricted to post-mitotic neuronal populations leaving the ventricular zone. Second, the brain structures known to express the sst2A receptor at adulthood also express this receptor during development. Only the medial forebrain bundle, rostral migratory stream and cerebellum expressed the receptor during development but not in adulthood. Third, in contrast to the adult brain in which receptor localization is mainly somatodendritic, some axons and growth cones were found to strongly express the receptor during ontogenesis. Fourth, the localization of receptor at the plasma membrane revealed by electron microscopy and the change of its cellular distribution following agonist challenge argue for functionality of the sst2A receptor during neuronal development. Fifth, activation of sst2A receptors indeed resulted in modification of neuronal migration and neurite patterning in <italic>in vitro</italic> model systems. Sixth, the sst2A receptor was detected both in rat and human developing neuronal structures with remarkable similarities but also differences.</p><p>An intriguing feature of the ontogeny of sst2A receptor expression in the brain is its preferential localization in neuronal populations lying in the outer part of the germinal zone at primitive developmental stages in rat and human brain tissues. Double-labeling experiments confirmed that the vast majority of these cells are not proliferative ones and represent young neuroblasts <italic>en route</italic> to populate different regions of the developing brain. The temporal coincidence of sst2 receptors and migrating neurons suggest a role for this receptor during the neuronal migration process. According to this hypothesis, we have demonstrated that activation of the sst2A receptor in EGL microexplants resulted in a dose-dependent increase of granule cell migration. These results are in line with a previous <italic>in vitro</italic> study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005509-Yacubova1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> demonstrating that SRIF-28 increases the migration rate of granule cells near their birthplace, but decreases it near their final destination in the IGL. In both rats and humans, our neuroanatomical data demonstrate the presence of the sst2A receptor in the deep part of the EGL. Together, these studies suggest that the sst2A receptor may be responsible for accelerating the movement of granule cells in the early phase of migration. The termination of migration in the IML could be regulated by another somatostatin receptor in rat, possibly the sst1 receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005509-Kramer1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. In the developing human cerebellum, it remains to be determined whether the sst2A receptor can assume both roles since in addition to the EGL, it is also observed in the granule cells of the IGL.</p><p>The persistent expression of the sst2A receptor in different brain regions following the major migratory events suggests that it could also have a role in neuronal differentiation. In line with this hypothesis, sst2A receptor stimulation induced a moderate but significant increase of the axonal length of hippocampal neurons in culture. Such an effect was not found in EGL microexplants in which sst2A receptor activation increased granule cell migration. Thus depending on the regions and/or developmental time of expression, the sst2A receptor is likely to assume different roles during neuronal maturation.</p><p>In addition to the cerebellum, our morphological data suggest involvement of sst2A receptor in neuronal migration in several other brain areas. In the developing rat and human cerebral cortex, the immunoreactive cells were found first in the preplate and later in the deep intermediate/subventricular zone. These particular regions contain the earliest-generated neurons of the cortex that will migrate using the processes of radial glial cells to reach their final position. In both rat and human cortex, sst2A receptor-positive neurons were indeed found in close apposition with vimentin-positive processes. Together, these results suggest that the sst2A receptor could play a role in the early events of the radial migration of cortical excitatory neurons.</p><p>In the developing forebrain, numerous sst2A receptor-positive cells were visible in the LGE and CGE. These two areas contribute to the development of numerous brain structures, including the neocortex, striatum, thalamus, septum and olfactory bulb for the former and nucleus accumbens, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, hippocampus, amygdala, striatum and globus pallidus for the latter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005509-Marin1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005509-Marin2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, sst2A receptor-expressing cells are indeed present during the course of maturation in most of these brain regions, as illustrated in the striatum at E16, in which strongly immunoreactive cells and processes are visible. Neurons emanating from the LGE and the CGE usually use nonradial migration to reach their final destination suggesting a potential role of the sst2A receptor in the so-called tangential (or neurophilic) neuronal migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005509-Marin2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. By contrast, the absence of sst2A receptor-expressing cells in the MGE (the major source of cortical interneurons) together with the lack of a sst2A receptor-positive cell stream between the developing subpallium and cerebral cortex (an important pathway of migrating interneurons) do not argue for a major role of this receptor in the migration of GABAergic neocortical interneurons. In line with this observation, using a gene expression microarray analysis on cortical interneuron precursors, the sstr2 gene was found not to be enriched in this population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005509-BatistaBrito1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.

Our results clearly established that, like in other developing brain areas, sst2A receptor-expressing cells were post-mitotic neuroblasts. Additional investigations are required to determine whether the sst2A receptor is a marker of a particular subpopulation of migrating neuroblast and to analyze its potential motogenic role in this cell population. It will be also of particular interest to determine the nature and the final destination of sst2A receptor-labeled neuroblasts that seem to detach from the dorsal part of the SVZ and migrate to the white matter and/or the cerebral cortex.</p><p>Interestingly, transient expression of the sst2A receptor was observed during the development of specific neuronal populations. Thus, both 5-HT and TH expressing cells were strongly immunopositive for the sst2A receptor between E15 and E17 in the developing raphe nuclei and the VTA/SN, respectively. In contrast, in adult rat brains, these regions were devoid of receptor immunoreactivity. A peak of receptor immunoreactivity was also observed at E16 in TH and 5-HT growing axons in the medial forebrain bundle. The sst2A receptors are distributed on the entire neuronal structure throughout soma-dendrites, axons and all the way to the growth tip. Together these observations suggest that the sst2A receptor may play a role, during a restricted time-window, in the migration and normal positioning of TH and 5-HT neurons as well as in axonal growth and guidance of these two cell populations.</p><p>At the ultrastructural level, we found that a significant proportion of sst2A receptors was associated with the plasma membrane.

By contrast, in rats IGL, unipolar brush cells but not granule cells expressed the receptor. Unipolar brush cells are a unique type of glutamatergic interneurons that play an important role in vestibulo-cerebellar circuitry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005509-Kalinichenko1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. They are produced in the rhombic lip, a region with high density of sst2A receptor-positive neuroblasts, and migrate to their final destination during late embryonic and early postnatal development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005509-Englund1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In the cerebral cortex, the sst2A receptor was located in the preplate at early developmental stages in both rats and humans. As soon as the cortical plate was formed, the sst2A labeling extended to the entire intermediate zone/subplate in the rats whereas it was enriched in the outer part of the germinal zone in humans. The latter location in humans emphasizes the possible role of sst2A receptor on very early post-mitotic neurons arising all along the neuronal proliferation period which last about 3 months. Later in development the sst2A cortical labeling evolved towards the deep layers as detected in the adult in both species.</p><p>In conclusion, our observations strongly suggest that in addition to its neuromodulatory role in the adult brain, the sst2A receptor participates in the development and maturation of specific neuronal populations during brain ontogenesis in both rats and humans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals</title><p>Pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were purchased from Janvier Laboratories (Le Genest St Isle, France).

Twenty three control, twenty-four 20 nM octreotide-treated and nineteen 100 nM octreotide-treated explants were analyzed. To measure migration rates, concentric areas at increasing distances from the explant border were delimited. The number of DAPI-labeled pixels within each area was counted and then expressed as a percentage of the total number of pixels. To evaluate the overall rate of neuronal migration, the total number of DAPI-labeled pixels surrounding the explants was counted. Neuritic length was estimated by laying out a circle containing approximately 90&#x00025; of the &#x000df;-III-tubulin positive neurites. Values from control and octreotide-treated explants were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test followed by Dunn's multiple comparison test using GraphPad Prism version 4.03 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). The value of p&#x0003c;0.05 was considered as statistically significant.</p></sec><sec id="s4g2"><title>Low density cultures of primary hippocampal neurons</title><p>Primary hippocampal neuron culture was prepared as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005509-Garrido1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005509-Goslin1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>.

Images of phalloidin-A546-labeled neurons were acquired with a Zeiss Axio Observer microscope (Carl Zeiss). Two hundred and seventy nine control neurons, 276 10 nM octreotide-treated and 231 50 nM octreotide-treated neurons were analyzed. Number and length of processes, including axonal and dendritic branches, as well as areas of cell bodies were measured using Image J (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Among the primary processes, the axon was defined as the longest process, whereas the other processes were classified as dendrites. Values from control and octreotide-treated explants were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test followed by Dunn's multiple comparison test using GraphPad Prism version 4.03. The value of p&#x0003c;0.05 was considered as statistically significant.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Lone Helboe for providing us the antiserum against the somatostatin sst2A receptor.
