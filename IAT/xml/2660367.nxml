ADAM family members have different activities, such as proteolysis and adhesion, making them good candidates to mediate the extracellular matrix remodelling and changes in cellular adhesion that characterise certain pathologies and cancer development. It was reported that one family member, <italic>ADAM23</italic>, is down-regulated by promoter hypermethylation. This seems to correlate with tumour progression and metastasis in breast cancer. In this study, we explored the involvement of ADAM33, another ADAM family member, in breast cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>First, we analysed <italic>ADAM33 </italic>expression in breast tumour cell lines by RT-PCR and western blotting. We also used 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5azadCR) treatment and DNA bisulphite sequencing to study the promoter methylation of ADAM33 in breast tumour cell lines. We evaluated ADAM33 methylation in primary tumour samples by methylation specific PCR (MSP). Finally, <italic>ADAM33 </italic>promoter hypermethylation was correlated with clinicopathological data using the chi-square test and Fisher's exact test.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The expression analysis of <italic>ADAM33 </italic>in breast tumour cell lines by RT-PCR revealed gene silencing in 65% of tumour cell lines. The corresponding lack of ADAM33 protein was confirmed by western blotting. We also used 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dCR) demethylation and bisulphite sequencing methodologies to confirm that gene silencing is due to <italic>ADAM33 </italic>promoter hypermethylation. Using MSP, we detected <italic>ADAM33 </italic>promoter hypermethylation in 40% of primary breast tumour samples. The correlation between methylation pattern and patient's clinicopathological data was not significantly associated with histological grade; tumour stage (TNM); tumour size; ER, PR or ERBB2 status; lymph node status; metastasis or recurrence. Methylation frequency in invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) was 76.2% compared with 25.5% in invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), and this difference was statistically significant (p = 0.0002).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p><italic>ADAM33 </italic>gene silencing may be related to the discohesive histological appearance of ILCs. We suggest that <italic>ADAM33 </italic>promoter methylation may be a useful molecular marker for differentiating ILC and IDC.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>ADAM33 protein is a member of the family of transmembrane glycoproteins composed of multidomains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. <italic>ADAM33 </italic>was originally identified as an asthma-susceptibility gene. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms have been associated with asthma and bronchial hyperresponsiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. ADAM33 protein contains an active site sequence with a zinc-binding motif. It contains a glutamic acid in the catalytic domain, and therefore it is an active metalloproteinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Despite the fact that the physiological function of ADAM33 remains unknown, it is capable of cleaving stem cell factor (SCF) <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. SCF and its receptor KIT which is known to be an oncoprotein are involved in several cancer types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The disintegrin domain in ADAM33 can mediate integrin &#x003b1;9&#x003b2;1-dependent cell adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and can inhibit &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 integrin-mediated cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The <italic>ADAM33 </italic>gene has been mapped to human chromosome 20p13, and it consists of 22 exons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The gene has CpG islands within its promoter region. It was recently reported that <italic>ADAM33 </italic>is silenced by methylation in airway epithelial cells. It shows hypomethylation in mesenchymal cells, suggesting that methylation controls expression in a cell type-specific manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Recently, aberrant epigenetic gene silencing in cancer has been reported by different groups. These findings show the implication of these mechanisms in cancer development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. <italic>ADAM23</italic>, one of the ADAM family members, has been studied previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. That study implicated promoter hypermethylation in transcriptional silencing in breast tumours at a more advanced stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In breast cancer, a variety of critical genes have been shown to be silenced by methylation (e.g., <italic>BRCA1</italic>, <italic>14-3-3</italic>, <italic>TIM3</italic>, <italic>ESR1</italic>, <italic>PGR </italic>and <italic>E-cadherin</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we investigated whether the <italic>ADAM33 </italic>gene in breast tumours is regulated by epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patient samples</title><p>Frozen samples of breast tissue (n = 72) used for methylation analysis were obtained from patients treated by primary surgery for breast cancer at the Nossa Senhora das Gra&#x000e7;as Hospital, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil, with institutional approval. All patients gave informed consent for the study to retain and analyse their tissue for research purposes. The study included only female patients with primary invasive breast cancer. The age of patients ranged from 27 years to 84 years (mean 59.1 &#x000b1; 13.1 years). In most cases, the histologic type was either infiltrative ductal carcinoma (IDC, n = 51 [70.8%]) or infiltrative lobular carcinoma (ILC, n = 21 [29.2%]). Histologic grade was determined according to the modified Bloom-Richardson criteria as Grade 1 in 27.2% of tumours, Grade 2 in 47.1% of tumours, and Grade 3 in 25.7% of tumours. TNM staging was done according to the official classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Immunohistochemical stains were evaluated and scored by two pathologists who were responsible for the clinicopathological data. The cut-off value for estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status was 5% of cells. The ERBB2 data were obtained with a HercepTestTM (DAKO A/S, Grostrup, Denmark). When a result of +2 positive was obtained, an <italic>in situ </italic>fluorescent hybridization (FISH) assay was performed to confirm the result.

The PCR conditions were as follows: one round of 95&#x000b0;C for 12 min, 94&#x000b0;C for 3 min, 48&#x000b0;C for 3 min, 72&#x000b0;C for 2 min; five cycles of 94&#x000b0;C 3 min, 50&#x000b0;C for 3 min, 72&#x000b0;C for 2 min; and 35 cycles of 94&#x000b0;C for 1 min, 52&#x000b0;C for 1 min, and 72&#x000b0;C. Different annealing temperatures (55&#x000b0;C, 57&#x000b0;C and 59&#x000b0;C) were used for the nested reaction. Amplified products were purified using the Qiaquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) and cloned into a pCR2.1 cloning vector (Invitrogen). Eight clones were sequenced for each cell line using the vector's universal and/or reverse primers. DNA sequencing reactions were performed using Big Dye Terminator technology (Applied Biosystems) on an ABI 377 sequencer (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The 100% of methylation was obtained if cytosine in the CpG dinucleotides was present in the eight sequenced clones. The methylation percentage for each tumour cell lines (global methylation pattern) was calculated by dividing the number of methylated CpG dinucleotides by the total number of CpGs analysed.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>ADAM33 </italic>Methylation-Specific PCR</title><p>Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].

These results indicate that <italic>ADAM33 </italic>is down-regulated at both the transcriptional and translational levels in breast tumour cell lines. Two bands reacting with ADAM33 antibody were detected at the molecular weights of 98 and 64 kDa, which probably correspond, respectively, to the mature form of ADAM33, which has been processed and glycosylated, and to the truncated form, which has been cleaved near the transmembrane region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold><italic>ADAM33 </italic>mRNA and protein expression</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>The <italic>ADAM33 </italic>RNA panel of breast cell lines, normal breast and HB4a normal cells.

The expression of <italic>ADAM33 </italic>was restored upon treatment in all cell lines, as detected by RT-PCR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>ADAM33 </italic>CpG island methylation analyses by sodium bisulphite sequencing</title><p>Two putative islands were found in the <italic>ADAM33 </italic>promoter region. One of the CpG islands is located between -1012 and -748. This island has 264 bp, proximal to the cut-off for a CpG island [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. For this reason, we decided to study the region from -421 to +324, which contains part of the first exon. This region possesses promoter activity, as previously described by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], as well as more than 40 transcription factor-binding sites predicted by the TFSEARCH software (data not shown). Sodium bisulphite sequencing was carried out on a region containing 77 CpG dinucleotides (-472 to +389), 71 of which were located within one of the CpG islands (-421 to +324) of the TSS (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). We analysed the methylation pattern of eight independent alleles (eight clones) from normal HB4a, as well as the breast tumour cell lines PMC42, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-436 and MCF7. Methylation of more than 80% of the CpG dinucleotides in this region was detected in the breast tumour cell lines analysed except PMC42 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). All cell lines that exhibited hypermethylation showed down-regulation of <italic>ADAM33 </italic>expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). We observed that there are some dinucleotides that are likely to be more important than others in transcriptional regulation. Comparing Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> with Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, it is clear that <italic>ADAM33 </italic>transcripts from cell lines with a lower methylation density were expressed at higher levels than in cells with a higher methylation density. However, MCF7 has its <italic>ADAM33 </italic>promoter region highly methylated (methylation percentage = 86.1%), and transcription occurs to a smaller extent (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). These results indicate that there are crucial CpGs that must be methylated in order to completely silence gene transcription. These results also indicate that the methylation density is critical to the down-regulation of expression. In other words, hypermethylation may not be the only factor of critical importance to transcription. These dinucleotides may be important for the binding of the transcription machinery, mainly because they are located near the TSS. The methylation seems to initiate mostly at dinucleotides 1&#x02013;3 and 74&#x02013;77 and to spread towards the promoter region. These results may therefore support the spreading model proposed by Turker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Moreover, methyl-binding proteins physically associate with methylated CpG and attract repressive complexes such as histone deacetylases (HDAC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Different histone tail modifications may exist. It is possible that the level of gene expression for a given allele can vary from extremely high to undetectable. Alternatively, repression by the methyl-CpG-binding proteins can occur via mechanisms that do not involve histones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Another possibility is that the biallelic inactivation of tumour suppressor genes involves DNA methylation, deletion or point mutation. Furthermore, the sequence of inactivating events can occur in any order [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold><italic>ADAM33 </italic>Methylation-Specific PCR in cell lines and in primary breast tumours.

This region was chosen for the design of methylation-specific PCR (MSP) primers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). In the MSP reactions we tested the breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, MCF7, PMC42, MDA-MB-435, and MDA-MB-436 as well as the normal cell line HB4a (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). The MSP results corroborated the bisulphite sequencing and RT-PCR data for the cell lines. This assay was subsequently used to analyse breast primary tumour samples. Representative tumour MSP for IDC or ILC results are shown (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref> respectively). Methylation was frequently observed in ILC (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>).

The methylation frequency for all of these variables was approximately 30&#x02013;40% (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Although no statistically significant correlation was found between these variables and the degree of methylation, some interesting features may justify future investigation. For example, methylation frequency was higher in tumours of size T3 and T4 than in tumours of smaller size. The methylation frequencies were similar for tumours of size T1 (30.0%) and T2 (36.8%), whereas frequencies of up to 60% were observed in tumours of size T3 and T4. However, these differences were not statistically significant (p = 0.174). Another potentially important observation is that in samples showing local tumour recurrence, the <italic>ADAM33 </italic>promoter methylation frequency was 66.7%, compared to 36.5% for non-recurrent samples (p = 0.201).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Many studies have shown that ADAM family members function in fundamental processes such as cell adhesion, cell fusion, cell migration, membrane protein shedding and proteolysis. Moreover, the shedding activity of cytokines and growth factors seems to be related to cellular migration and to the control of several signalling pathways activated in cancer. For this reason, it is not surprising that deregulated expression of ADAM family members has been reported in human tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In agreement with this observation, our results show that the <italic>ADAM33 </italic>gene is down-regulated. This probably occurs by selective DNA hypermethylation in many breast carcinomas, especially those of the invasive lobular histological type (ILC).</p><p>ILC is less common than IDC, accounting for 10&#x02013;15% of breast cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. This tumour type may appear as a palpable IDC-like mass. More frequently, however, its cells grow in single linear rows around ducts and lobules. This so-called "Indian file" pattern of infiltration causes a modest disruption of the underlying anatomic structures and generates little surrounding desmoplastic stromal reaction. This limited reaction makes diagnosis difficult even by mammography and ultrasound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The most obvious characteristic of this histological tumour type is the loss of E-cadherin expression, which is the major adhesion protein in breast epithelium. Its absence explains the histological morphology of ILC. Loss of adhesion may also explain why ILCs tend to metastasise to more remote locations, such as gastrointestinal and female reproductive systems, whereas IDCs metastasise preferentially to lung, liver and bones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. It is important to note, however, that not all lobular carcinomas show a complete loss of E-cadherin expression. In some cases, ILCs have low levels of E-cadherin expression, implying that alterations in the expression of other cell-to-cell adhesion proteins likely occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. ADAM33 may be one such protein, since a protein of the same family (ADAM23) is involved in cell adhesion. Moreover, it has recently been shown that ADAM33 is capable of interacting with integrins, suggesting its involvement in cell adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>More studies about ADAM33 protein function in cancer are necessary to understand its tumour-suppressor role. In addition, we speculate that ADAM33 is involved with the <italic>KIT </italic>oncogene pathway in cancer, given that the ADAM33 catalytic domain is capable of cleaving SCF (Kit ligand) <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. We suggest the possible usefulness of both <italic>ADAM33 </italic>promoter methylation and the lack of the protein as molecular diagnostics to differentiate IDC and ILC. Such a differential marker may be of great value in the clinic, since IDCs and ILCs are similar in many respects and their histological features occasionally overlap, primarily in cases of mixed carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. To date, E-cadherin is the only well-established immunohistochemical marker for the differentiation of ductal and lobular breast carcinomas, and few studies describe useful molecular markers for this or other purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Lobular tumour metastases in the gastrointestinal system do not form glands or tubular structures but instead infiltrate as small nests and strands. These are usually of the "signet-ring" type, making histopathological diagnosis difficult. Moreover, ILC usually has a low mitotic rate and a uniform appearance. It tends to infiltrate lymph nodes in a single-cell pattern, which makes distinguishing between lobular carcinoma cells and lymphoid cells extremely challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Effectively distinguishing between ILC and IDC may be important for determining the most appropriate treatment, since change the two types of tumour respond differently to therapy. In fact, ILCs are often resistant to neoadjuvant therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, our findings suggest that <italic>ADAM33 </italic>is a novel tumour suppressor gene that may be useful as a molecular marker for invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast. To our knowledge, this is the first study to associate <italic>ADAM33 </italic>with breast cancer and the only data that associate <italic>ADAM33 </italic>with a particular cancer type. Further studies are needed to determine the immunohistochemical the ADAM33 protein profile.
