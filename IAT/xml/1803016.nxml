At M-phase exit, MPF is destroyed by ubiquitin-dependent cyclin proteolysis. Thus, control of MPF activity via inhibitory phosphorylation is believed to be particularly crucial in regulating transition into, rather than out of, M-phase. Using the <italic>in vitro</italic> cell cycle system derived form Xenopus eggs, here we show, however, that inhibitory phosphorylation of cdk1 contributes to control MPF activity during M-phase exit. By sampling extracts at very short intervals during both meiotic and mitotic exit, we found that cyclin B1-associated cdk1 underwent transient inhibitory phosphorylation at tyr-15 and that cyclin B1-cdk1 activity fell more rapidly than the cyclin B1 content. Inhibitory phosphorylation of MPF correlated with phosphorylation changes of cdc25C, the MPF phosphatase, and physical interaction of cdk1 with wee1, the MPF kinase, during M-phase exit. MPF down-regulation required Ca<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</sup>/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activities at meiosis and mitosis exit, respectively. Treatment of M-phase extracts with a mutant cyclin B1-cdk1AF complex, refractory to inhibition by phosphorylation, impaired binding of the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) to its co-activator Cdc20 and altered M-phase exit. Thus, timely M-phase exit requires a tight coupling of proteolysis-dependent and proteolysis-independent mechanisms of MPF inactivation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rapid MPF activation is granted by an activation loop in which the cdc25C phosphatase removes inhibitory phosphorylations of cdk1 at thr-14 and tyr-15, while MPF stimulates cdc25C activity and lowers activity of wee1, the cdk1 tyr-15 kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000247-Hoffmann1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000247-Dunphy1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

By determining the amount of cyclin B1-associated cdk1 and kinase activity in cyclin B1 immunoprecipitates, we found a linear relationship in decline of cyclin B1-bound cdk1 and cyclin B1 content, thus excluding significant cyclin B1-cdk1 dissociation before degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000247-g001">Fig. 1A; graph; Cyc B1 and Cdk1</xref>). Nevertheless, cyclin B1-associated kinase activity declined ahead of the cyclin B1-cdk1 content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000247-g001">Fig. 1 A; graph; Cyc B1 activity</xref>). We asked whether inhibitory cdk1 tyr-15 phosphorylation could contribute to the observed loss of MPF activity.

We, next, determined the amount of &#x0005b;<sup>35</sup>S&#x0005d;labelled-cyclin, cdk1, cdk1-phospho-tyr-15 and kinase activity in cyclin B1 and cyclin A immunoprecipitates from extracts samples taken across the mitosis-to-interphase transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000247-g001">Fig. 1 D, E</xref>). The decline in cyclin B1-associated kinase activity was accompanied by increased cyclin B1-associated cdk1-phospho-tyr-15 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000247-g001">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Cyclin A-associated kinase activity and cyclin A content decreased with parallel kinetics and begun when cyclin B1-associated kinase activity started to decline while cdk1-phospho-tyr15 was undetectable in cyclin A immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000247-g001">Fig. 1 E</xref>). These findings were also revealed by changes in cdk1 migration after resolving cyclin B1 and cyclin A immunoprecipitates by longer SDS/PAGE runs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000247-g001">Fig. 1 F, G</xref>). At peak activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000247-g001">Fig. 1 F; 38 min</xref>), cyclin B1-bound cdk1 was mostly in the fastest migrating form, dephosphorylated at inhibitory sites, while slower migrating cdk1 forms were present at earlier and later time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000247-g001">Fig. 1.

Cdc25C ser-287 phosphorylation increased as cell cycle progressed towards interphase, while cdk1-tyr-15 phosphorylation was lost along with the cyclin signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000247-g001">Fig., 1 A, B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000247-g002">Fig. 2 A</xref>).

To determine whether sustained MPF activity had a role in delaying mitosis exit, cdk1 activity was lowered by adding the cdk inhibitor roscovitine to a PKA-inhibited extract. Cdk inhibition restored rapid cyclin degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000247-g003">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Thus, when the MPF activation loop is sustained by PKA inhibition, cyclin degradation is delayed in an MPF-dependent fashion. In CSF-arrested extracts, cdc25C-ser-287 and cdk1-tyr-15 phosphorylations were induced rapidly after calcium addition and prevented by treatment with the CaMKII inhibitor peptide CaMKII Ntide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000247.s001">Fig. S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Cdk1AF delays M-phase exit and hinders Cdc20-APC/C interaction</title><p>It has been recently published that cycling extracts forced to use a mutant cdk1AF (cdk1AF; thr 14&#x0003e;ala, and tyr 15&#x0003e;phe), refractory to inhibitory phosphorylation, enter mitosis with slower kinetics than control extracts and are delayed in exiting mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000247-Pomerening1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. However, in that report the defects in M-phase exit were ascribed to the slower onset of M-phase caused by cdk1AF rather than to a direct interference of cdk1AF with the M-phase exit mechanisms. To determine whether cdk1AF had a direct effect on M-phase exit, regardless of how the mitotic state was reached, we treated a CSF-arrested extract, that is already naturally arrested in M-phase, with a cyclin B1-cdk1AF complex and monitored cyclin degradation kinetics upon calcium addition. We found that cyclin degradation was delayed in cyclin B1-cdk1AF-treated but not in cyclin B1-cdk1wt-treated extract, as control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000247-g004">Fig. 4 A</xref>).

As previously demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000247-Solomon1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, cdk1-tyr-15 phosphorylation was stimulated shortly after &#x00394;B addition and decreased as cdk1 activity reached M-phase activity levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000247-g005">Fig. 5 B, 10 to 40 min</xref>). Subsequently, the fluctuation in cdk1 activity was accompanied by a relative increase in cdk1-tyr-15 phosphorylation (albeit rather lower than that observed at early time points; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000247-g005">Fig. 5 B, 45&#x02013;50&#x02013;55 min</xref>). Cdc25C has been reported to be hyperphosphorylated at activating sites and non-phosphorylated at ser-287 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000247-Stanford1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> under &#x00394;B-induced M-phase arrest, making unlikely its involvement in cdk1 phosphorylation control under these conditions. Wee1 activity is believed to be down-regulated in M-phase by cdk1-dependent phosphorylations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000247-Kim1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Recent evidence indicated that wee1 undergoes phosphorylation at ser-549 in M-phase of unperturbed cell cycle as well as under &#x00394;B conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000247-Stanford1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. However, by <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assays, wee1-ser-549 phosphorylation did not increase wee1 activity and wee1 isolated from interphase was slightly more active than that isolated from M-phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000247-Stanford1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. What mechanism could, then, lead to mitotic cdk1-tyr-15 phosphorylation under &#x00394;B conditions? We investigated whether wee1 and MPF could physically interact in M-phase, as recently shown for the budding yeast wee1 homolog swe1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000247-Harvey1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, providing a possible mechanism for mitotic cdk1-tyr-15 phosphorylation. Indeed, cdk1 was detected in wee1 immunoprecipitates from CSF-arrested extracts, while little cdk1 co-precipitated with wee1 from interphase samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000247-g005">Fig 5 C</xref>). Under &#x00394;B conditions, wee1-cdk1 iteraction was detectable 10&#x02013;20 min after &#x00394;B addition, when cdk1 activity was still low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000247-g005">Fig. 5 C</xref>). Subsequently, the complex significantly dissociated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000247-g005">Fig. 5 C</xref>; 20&#x02013;35 min). However, after cdk1 regained M-phase activity levels and then started to fluctuate, wee1-cdk1 interaction was regained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000247-g005">Fig. 5 C; 35&#x02013;45 min</xref>). Probing wee1 immunoprecipitates for cdk1 phospho-tyr-15 showed that the cdk1-phospho-tyr-15 signal was detectable at early (interphase; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000247-g005">Fig. 5 D; 10 min</xref>) and, more pronouncedly, at later (M-phase; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000247-g005">Fig. 5 D; 40&#x02013;45 min</xref>) time points after &#x00394;B addition, further indicating that wee1-cdk1 interaction is accompanied by cdk1-tyr-15 phosphorylation. When cdk1 activity further increased, upon prolonged incubation, cdk1 appeared to dissociate from wee1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000247-g005">Fig. 5 D; 90 min</xref>), possibly because of wee1 hyperphosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000247-Harvey1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Preliminary results indicate that wee1-cdk1 interaction is also detected during unperturbed M-phase exit in cycling extracts (not shown).</p><p>Under our experimental conditions, degradation of full-length cyclin initiated 40&#x02013;45 min from addition of non-degradable cyclin B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000247-g005">Fig. 5 E</xref>). To determine whether &#x00394;B-cdk1 activity affected cyclin degradation timing, we inhibited cdk1 activity after significant cdk1 activity had been reached following &#x00394;B addition (33 min; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000247-g005">Figs. 5 E, F</xref>) and monitored full-length cyclin B degradation. Cdk1 inhibition slightly but consistently accelerated initiation of degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000247-g005">Figs. 5 E, F</xref>). Toghether these data indicate that the cdk1-tyr-15 phosphorylation state at M-phase exit may also be regulated via wee1-cdk1 interaction and indicate that cyclin B-cdk1 activity can affect the cyclin degradation pathway even under conditions in which degradation is prevented.</p><p>Further investigation will be required to establish the role for phosphorylations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000247-Stanford1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000247-Kim1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000247-Harvey1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> in the wee1-cdk1 interaction and in wee1 activity towards wee1-bound cdk1 as well as the domains involved in binding and other potential M-phase aspects for which interaction is relevant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000247-Stumpff1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our data show that timely completion of M-phase requires proteolysis-independent control of MPF activity. Nevertheless, M-phase exit strictly relies on proteolysis and phosphorylation-dependent MPF down-regulation is insufficient to lower MPF activity to the levels required to exit M-phase if proteolysis cannot take over. We propose that proteolysis and inhibitory cdk1 phosphorylation are interconnected in a MPF inactivation loop for M-phase exit. Initial partial, phosphorylation-dependent, loss of MPF activity stimulates APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> activation. MPF degradation further weakens the MPF activation loop promoting MPF inhibitory phosphorylation. Consequent additional MPF activity loss further helps APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> activation. We cannot exclude that degradation of a small pool of cyclin initiates the loop. However, the observation that MPF binds to wee1 in M-phase even in the absence of cyclin degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000247-g005">Fig. 5</xref>) further witnesses that a tight coupling of proteolysis-independent and proteolysis-dependent mechanisms of MPF inactivation coordinate M-phase exit.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Egg extracts and immunoprecipitations</title><p>Xenopus egg extracts were prepared essentially as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000247-Murray1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.
