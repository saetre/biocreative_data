These latter, 'secondary' neurons show a complex pattern of expression of <italic>broad</italic>, which encodes a transcription factor usually associated with metamorphosis, where it acts as a key regulator in the transitions from larva and pupa.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The Broad-Z3 (Br-Z3) isoform appears transiently in most central neurons during embryogenesis, but persists in a subset of these cells through most of larval growth. Some of the latter are embryonic-born secondary neurons, whose development is arrested until the start of metamorphosis. However, the vast bulk of the secondary neurons are generated during larval growth and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation shows that they begin expressing Br-Z3 about 7 hours after their birth, approximately the time that they have finished outgrowth to their initial targets. By the start of metamorphosis, the oldest secondary neurons have turned off Br-Z3 expression, while the remainder, with the exception of the very youngest, maintain Br-Z3 while they are interacting with potential partners in preparation for neurite elaboration. That Br-Z3 may be involved in early sprouting is suggested by ectopically expressing this isoform in remodeling primary neurons, which do not normally express Br-Z3. These cells now sprout into ectopic locations. The expression of Br-Z3 is transient and seen in all interneurons, but two other isoforms, Br-Z4 and Br-Z1, show a more selective expression. Analysis of MARCM clones shows that the Br-Z4 isoform is expressed by neurons in virtually all lineages, but only in those cells born during a window during the transition from the second to the third larval instar. Br-Z4 expression is then maintained in this temporal cohort of cells into the adult.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These data show the potential for diverse functions of Broad within the developing CNS. The Br-Z3 isoform appears in all interneurons, but not motoneurons, when they first begin to interact with potential targets. Its function during this early sorting phase needs to be defined. Two other Broad isoforms, by contrast, are stably expressed in cohorts of neurons in all lineages and are the first examples of persisting molecular 'time-stamps' for <italic>Drosophila </italic>postembryonic neurons.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The sequential generation of distinct populations of neurons is a common feature across all taxa (for example, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]). Nowhere is this more striking than in the development of the nervous system of insects having complete metamorphosis, such as <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where the central nervous system (CNS) must deal sequentially with the behavior of two radically different stages, the larva and the adult. This dichotomy is reflected in the proliferative activity of the neuronal stem cells (neuroblasts (NBs)) that produce the neurons for both larval and adult versions of the CNS. After the NBs segregate from the ventral ectoderm of the early embryo, they generate an initial set of neurons that form the larval CNS. This initial set includes a diverse array of neurons (for example, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]) that establish the overall architecture of tracts and commissures, and provide the neural circuits that mediate larval behavior. The neuronal fates within an embryonic lineage are based on birth-order of the parent ganglion mother cells (GMCs) (for example, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]). The molecular code defining birth-order is used across the embryonic lineages and is based on the sequential expression by the NB of the transcription factor genes <italic>Hunchback</italic>, <italic>Kruppel</italic>, <italic>PDM</italic>, and <italic>castor </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. While present in the NB, each transcription factor is passed onto the GMC during mitosis and, subsequently, into the two daughter neurons when the GMC divides. These transcription factors encode different identities within the lineage and underlie the diversity of early neuronal types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Following the generation of this diverse set of 'primary' neurons, the NBs produce a much larger set of cells during the extended phase of neurogenesis that occurs during larval growth. These 'secondary' neurons are morphologically more homogeneous than the primary set [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Studies on the K lineage in the moth <italic>Manduca sexta </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], as well as the lineages of the mushroom bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and antennal lobes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, show that the secondary neurons are generated in discrete blocks, with those in a block having similar properties. The molecular specification of these blocks is just beginning to be understood. After the expression of <italic>castor </italic>in the embryo, the NB expresses <italic>grainyhead</italic>, and this expression then persists through the remainder of the embryonic divisions and into the postembryonic phase of neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The BTB (broad-tramtrack-brick-a-brac) domain transcription factor Chinmo is expressed in neurons born during the early larval phase of neurogenesis and undergoes both transcriptional and translational regulation to establish the early &#x003b3; neuron phenotype in the mushroom bodies and early projection neuron phenotypes in antennal lobe lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. More recently, the expression of <italic>chinmo </italic>was reported to be complementary to that of <italic>broad </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] (formerly called <italic>Broad-Complex</italic>), which encodes another BTB domain transcription factor.</p><p>Broad is best known for its role in metamorphosis and it plays a critical role in the proper transduction of ecdysone signals in different tissues during the larval-pupal transition (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]). Mutants null for <italic>broad </italic>show normal larval development but fail to initiate metamorphosis. Many <italic>broad </italic>mutations fall into one of three lethal complementation groups, and mutations in all three groups disrupt the metamorphosis of the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The <italic>broad </italic>gene encodes four major protein variants that share a common amino-terminal core region, including the BTB domain, but differ in their carboxy-terminal Zn fingers (Z1 to Z4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Using heat shock inducible cDNA transgenes, it was shown that the distinct genetic functions of the three lethal complementation groups could be ascribed to three of the Broad Zn finger isoforms (BR-Z1, -Z2, and -Z3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The function of the BR-Z4 isoform, though, remains unclear.</p><p>While most of the attention for the study of Broad has been directed towards its actions during metamorphosis, studies on the CNS suggest that this transcription factor has additional roles in development. Zhou [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] first reported the expression of Broad in the embryonic CNS of <italic>Drosophila </italic>and of the moth <italic>Manduca</italic>, and the maintenance of this expression through larval life. Recently, Maurange <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] reported that the expression of Broad and Chinmo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] divide the secondary neurons into two temporal groups at the start of metamorphosis. Here we show that it is the Br-Z3 isoform that complements Chinmo to set up this molecular dichotomy. We find, though, that Br-Z3 is transiently expressed in all interneurons, so that even the Chinmo+ neurons had expressed Br-Z3 earlier in larval life. The expression of both Chinmo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and Br-Z3 fades from the secondary neurons early in metamorphosis. However, two other Broad isoforms, Br-Z4 and Br-Z1, appear in a subset of neurons in every lineage to provide a molecular marker of neuronal birthdates that persists in the adult.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Embryonic expression of <italic>broad</italic></title><p>Individuals lacking <italic>broad </italic>function are normal through larval growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and Northern blot analyses first show <italic>broad </italic>transcripts in the last larval stage in preparation for metamorphosis (for example, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]).

Fluorescence immunocytochemistry detected weak Broad-IR in most neurons, but scattered cells showing strong expression were concentrated in the brain and thoracic and terminal abdominal neuromeres. Strongly expressing neurons were especially obvious using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies that were visualized with diaminobenzadine (for example, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, E</xref>).

Other tissues in <italic>Manduca </italic>start to express Broad only late in the last larval instar, in preparation for metamorphosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Broad expression in embryonic secondary neurons</title><p>To identify the strongly Broad-expressing neurons seen in the embryo and early larva, we first looked for Br-Z3 expression in a number of identified motoneurons and modulatory neurons, including those containing octopamine, crustacean cardioactive peptide, FMRFamide, and eclosion hormone. All were negative for Br-Z3 (data not shown). The greatest numbers of Broad+ neurons were in regions of the CNS that contained dormant embryonic NBs that would later reactivate for a second round of neurogenesis during larval growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Consequently, the Br-Z3 positive neurons might be related to the large lineages that include both embryonic and larval progeny. During their lifetime, most NBs generate an initial set of highly diverse neurons, the primary neurons, followed by a much larger set of more homogeneous cells, the secondary neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. While primary neurons immediately differentiate to make the larval CNS, the secondary neurons typically arrest shortly after their birth and wait until metamorphosis before elaborating their dendritic and axonal arbors. Most secondary neurons are born during the larval phase of neurogenesis but a few are thought to be born in the embryo prior to the embryonic arrest of their NB. They are readily identifiable in the larva because of their scant cytoplasm and lack of branching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], and they are concentrated in the thoracic neuromeres and the brain, a distribution similar to the Br-Z3 positive neurons.</p><p>To examine the arrested secondary neurons, we induced early embryonic MARCM (mosaic analysis using a repressible cell marker) clones using the <italic>elav</italic><sup><italic>C</italic>155</sup><italic>GAL4 </italic>driver. In the context of MARCM, the <italic>elav</italic><sup><italic>C</italic>155</sup><italic>GAL4 </italic>driver expresses prominently in the arrested, secondary neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Embryonic versus postembryonic neurons in NB clones were distinguished by feeding larvae on a diet containing bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) from hatching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], thereby labeling all of the neurons born during the larval phase of neurogenesis. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> shows an example of a lineage 9 NB clone from a larva that was fed a BrdU diet from hatching. All of the neurons in this clone had the appearance of arrested, secondary neurons showing the extension of an initial neurite, but lacking interstitial or terminal branching. The most basal neurons in the clone showed no BrdU incorporation, showing that they were born prior to hatching. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> shows an example of Br-Z3 expression in clones induced at the same time and examined at the start of the third larval instar (approximately 72 h after egg laying (AEL)). All of the basal neurons were Br-Z3 positive, whereas the most apical neurons had not yet begun to express Broad. Combined with the BrdU results, we conclude that arrested, embryonic-born secondary neurons are among the population of Br-Z3 positive cells seen at hatching.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Examples of early embryonic induced MARCM clones and showing embryonic-born secondary neurons and their state of <italic>Broad </italic>expression</bold>.

The following description of Br-Z3 expression focuses on the secondary neurons born during the larval phase of neurogenesis. MARCM clones were induced after hatching (24 to 26 h AEL) and then examined at various times thereafter. There is a repeating set of 25 NBs (numbered 0 to 24) in each thoracic hemisegment of the larval CNS. Clones arising from each NB can be unambiguously identified in the larva by their position in the cellular rind and by the trajectory through the larval neuropil of the bundled neurites that emerge from the cluster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> shows examples of the lineage produced by thoracic NB 3. The thoracic NBs resume dividing around 48 h AEL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], and the 72-h, lineage 3 clone contained 24 cells along with the NB. Very weak Br-Z3 expression was seen in only the most basal (oldest) cells in the cluster. The lineage 3 clone from 96 h AEL contained 78 neurons. The basal neurons were Br-Z3 positive, while the youngest cells, nearest the NB, were negative. The example of lineage 3 at pupariation had 183 cells. The shape of the clone was somewhat distorted by the growing CNS, but the larger neurons near the neuropil had lost their Br-Z3 expression. The remaining cells were strongly Br-Z3 positive with the exception of those nearest the NB. The pattern of Br-Z3 expression described for lineage 3 was typical for all of the lineages of thoracic interneurons. Unlike the MARCM clones induced in the early embryo, which had some basal cells that expressed prominent levels of Br-Z3 when examined at 72 h (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), clones that contained only postembryonic-born neurons had just traces of Br-Z3 evident at this time.

Expression of membrane-localized Notch is a feature of the NB, GMCs and the youngest neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and we find that Notch and Br-Z3 expression are mutually exclusive (JA and JWT, in preparation). We determined the timing of Broad appearance in newborn interneurons by using 96 h AEL larvae that had MARCM clones that had been induced after hatching. They were given food containing BrdU for various periods and then examined for the overlap of BrdU and Br-Z3 immunostaining in the clones. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> gives a specific example for lineage 3; after 8 h on BrdU food none of the labeled cells expressed Br-Z3, but at 16 h we consistently found BrdU-labeled cells that also expressed Br-Z3. About 11 h on a BrdU diet was needed to have co-labeled neurons in 50% of the clones (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).

Br-Z3 was expressed by young neurons of the lamina, medulla and lobula. The layered structure of the medulla, though, made the pattern of Br-Z3 expression the easiest to track through time. Br-Z3 was first seen in medulla neurons in the mid-third instar larva soon after they had started to be born (data not shown). The expressing neurons formed columns, with the most medial columns being Br-Z3 positive. By late wandering, expression was seen in approximately 15 columns (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>).

As previously reported by Consoulas <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], we did not find the reappearance of any Broad isoforms in the functional larval neurons, which would either die or remodel. Some secondary neurons, however, showed Br-Z4 in addition to Br-Z3.</p><p>The Br-Z4 expression was evident in some secondary neurons by the onset of wandering (data not shown). A number of features of Br-Z4 expression were intriguing. Firstly, Br-Z4 appeared in all of the thoracic secondary lineages (except the small motor lineage, lineage 24), but in only a subset of neurons in each. Secondly, the Br-Z4 positive neurons were clustered in each lineage, suggesting that they arose from consecutive GMCs. Thirdly, at pupariation, the Br-Z4-expressing neurons were concentrated at an intermediate level in the cellular rind (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>), suggesting that they were born at similar times across the lineages. Indeed, this layering in the cellular cortex is similar to that seen in the embryo for the transcription factors that establish the temporal identities of neurons during embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>An indication of the temporal origins of the Br-Z4+ neurons came by comparing the immunostaining against the isoform-specific Z3 and Z4 zinc fingers versus against the core region of Broad (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Maurange <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] showed that at pupariation the secondary neurons are divided into an older group of Chinmo+ neurons and a younger set that express Broad-core-IR. As seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, all of the Broad-core positive neurons also showed immunostaining for the Z3 zinc finger, showing that they all express Br-Z3. Large, Broad-core positive but Z3-negative nuclei having prominent nucleoli (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, arrows) were immunopositive for <italic>repo </italic>(data not shown), showing that they are larval glia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].

However, clones induced at 76 h AEL typically had a reduced number of Br-Z4+ neurons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F</xref>). As seen for the lineage 14 example in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, the typical pattern for the 76 h clones was for the Br-Z4+ neurons to be at the base of the clone and clustered with Br-Z4+ cells outside the clone boundary. These late induced clones had an average of only six Br-Z4+ cells in the clone. Only in clones for lineages 7 and 13 did we find numbers of BR-Z4+ cells that were similar to that seen in the early-induced clones. These higher values may reflect some variability amongst the lineages as to when their Br-Z4 cells are born. However, the overall pattern indicates that GMCs that are born around 76 h AEL make the neurons that will subsequently express Br-Z4. The larger motor lineage, lineage 15, had only a few Br-Z4+ cells and these all appeared to be born after 76 h. We found no Br-Z4+ cells in clones induced at 99 h AEL and examined at pupariation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>).</p><p>Broad was prominently expressed in most secondary neurons at the start of metamorphosis, with most of the neurons expressing Br-Z3 and about 20% expressing both Br-Z3 and Br-Z4 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). As metamorphosis progressed, the Br-Z3 was lost from all of the secondary neurons but Br-Z4 expression persisted (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Consequently, by the time of adult emergence the only cells that still expressed Broad were expressing the Br-Z4 isoform (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A, D</xref>), with the minor exceptions noted below. To determine if the neurons that expressed Br-Z4 in the adult were the same cells that were expressing this isoform at the start of metamorphosis, we induced MARCM clones at various times during larval life and then examined expression of Br-Z4 just prior to adult emergence. We scored expression in GMC clones because these would identify neurons born in the window shortly after the heat-shock (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>, Br-Z4+ cells were rarely observed in GMC clones induced at 50 h, were common in clones induced at 77 h, and rare again in 98 h clones. This temporal pattern of Br-Z4 expression is consistent with that in NB clones analyzed at pupariation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>) and indicates that the neurons expressing Br-Z4 at pupariation maintain their expression into the adult. For two-cell GMC clones generated around 76 h, both siblings were usually Br-Z4+, but we sometimes also found examples of a weakly expressing sib along with one that was negative (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). In late induced clones, the sibs were Broad-Z4 negative (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>).</p><p>The expression of Br-Z1 was evident by 16 h APF and also remained in some neurons into the adult (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). The number of Br-Z1+ cells in a lineage was much smaller than the number of Br-Z4+ neurons. We compared Br-Z1 and Br-Z4 expression to that of Broad-core immunostaining in flies just before adult eclosion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D, E</xref>). In the thoracic neuromeres, the neurons that had Broad-core immunostaining were also positive for Br-Z4. By contrast, Br-Z1+ cells made up only a small subset of the Broad-core+ neurons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). This pattern suggests that most of the Br-Z4+ neurons express this isoform alone, but a few neurons in each cluster express both Br-Z1 and Br-Z4. We do not know if Br-Z1 expression is characteristic for neurons born during a specific phase of the Br-Z4 window.</p><p>Although Br-Z1 was usually expressed along with Br-Z4, we found one notable example in which Br-Z1 was expressed alone. A large cluster of neurons at the juncture between the optic lobes and the brain showed strong Br-Z1 expression in the absence of detectable Br-Z4 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>, arrow).

The origins of the four isoforms of <italic>broad </italic>are ancient, extending back into the Crustacea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], much earlier than the evolution of complete metamorphosis in insects. Functions typified by its role in the nervous system may represent an ancestral function for <italic>broad</italic>, and its role in metamorphosis a more recently derived function for this gene.</p><sec><title>Primary and secondary neurons</title><p>In the developing vertebrate CNS, and especially the spinal cord, the initial set of neurons that set-up the basic architecture of the CNS are often called primary neurons. They are typically large and readily identifiable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] and may be later replaced by a larger flood of secondary neurons. In metamorphic species, like frogs, the primary neurons are ascribed to function in the larval tadpole while secondary neurons are generated in preparation for metamorphosis to the adult frog [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. An analogous concept of primary and secondary neurons is becoming established for <italic>Drosophila </italic>development. Similar to that seen in metamorphic vertebrates, the term primary neuron is typically associated with cells born during the first phase of neurogenesis in the embryo and secondary neuron for the cells born during the later, larval phase (for example, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]). The larval-born cells arrest their development soon after their birth and wait until metamorphosis before maturing into functional neurons. However, our BrdU feeding experiments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) show that some embryonic-born neurons also arrest without showing any branching, a condition identical to that seen in the neurons that are born in the larva. Moreover, it appears that these arrested, embryonic neurons show a sustained expression of Br-Z3, a feature characteristic of the secondary neurons born during the larval phase of neurogenesis.</p><p>In light of the latter observations, it is worth contemplating the definition of primary and secondary neurons. There are three potential uses of this designation/terminology. One would be to use it to denote embryonic versus postembryonic born neurons. A second would be to use it to refer to the functional status of a neuron, where embryonic neurons that are fully differentiated, functional components of a network could be termed primary neurons and neurons that had initiated neurite growth but 'stalled' their development prior to establishing pre- and postsynaptic specializations would be secondary neurons. A third use would be to refer to the developmental transition within lineages where a neural precursor switches from producing diverse progeny at each division to generating homogenous 'blocks' of cell types.</p><p>There is a striking difference between the mechanisms of specification of neuronal identities of early and late-born neurons in insects. For a given NB, the characteristics of the first few progeny can be strikingly diverse and are based on birth-order of the parent GMC. The determination of birth-order is based on unique molecular identities that are bestowed on successive GMCs through an intrinsic, temporal program of transcription factor production by the NB and the stable passage of that expression to the GMC during cell division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. A series of loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies confirmed that the presence of these transcription factors is responsible for the diversity of neuronal phenotypes within a given lineage and underlies the great diversity of early neuronal types seen across the lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This intrinsic progression, however, appears to stop after the expression of <italic>castor</italic>, and remaining neurons, both embryonic and postembryonic, express the transcription factor gene <italic>grainyhead </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. During the postembryonic neurogenic period, the NBs typically produce groups of neurons with similar characteristics. This is most evident during the postembryonic phase of neurogenesis in moths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and flies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], where we see neurons being produced in discrete blocks of similar cells, rather than as unique individuals. The expression of Chinmo is required for establishing the identities of an early-born block of cells in the mushroom bodies and antennal lobes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], amongst other lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Here we report that the expression of Broad-Z4 apparently provides a molecular marker for the next block of postembryonic neurons. Unlike the early embryonic identity factors, though, Broad is not expressed first in the NB and then passed into this cohort of cells. Rather, it appears in neurons some time after their birth, likely in response to hormonal conditions experienced by them or their parent GMC.</p><p>Clonal studies on <italic>Drosophila </italic>embryos suggest that the generation of neuron classes does not abruptly begin with the postembryonic neurons. Although the embryonic lineages are remarkable for the diversity of their early-born neurons, the later-born cells (farther from the neuropil) in many lineages show clustered cell bodies and similar neurite trajectories, indicating that they may constitute a discrete neuronal type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. We propose that these later cells, along with the post-embryonic neurons, should be called the secondary neurons and the term primary neurons should be confined to the initial neurons that are produced during embryogenesis during the progression from Hunchback to Castor. Typically, the first four GMCs produced by a given NB would account for its primary neurons, although, in some lineages, like NB 7-1, the expression of a factor may be prolonged to give two GMCs that produce similar properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In the ventral CNS, the primary neurons would account for the majority of the neurons present at hatching. Most of the early-born secondary neurons are also functional and contribute to larval behavior, while others show the arrested development described here.</p><p>Uncoupling of the terms primary and secondary from embryonic versus postembryonic origins circumvents problems with using these terms in a comparative context. In more basal insects, like grasshoppers, that have direct development, all of the neurons in the ventral CNS are made during embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], and, hence, would be considered as primary neurons if time of birth was the deciding criterion. Similarly, within the insects with complete metamorphosis, neurogenic arrest occurs at different points in the lineage depending on whether you are making a reduced nervous system for a relatively simple larva like a fly maggot, or a complex CNS that is a feature of the hunting larvae of ground beetles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Basing the designation of primary and secondary on the mechanisms that generate cellular diversity, rather than on the stage at their birth or their functional status within the network allows for homologues to have the same designation across these diverse taxa.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Temporal and spatial features of Br-Z3 expression</title><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, most primary neurons express low to moderate levels of Br-Z3 during late embryogenesis. We did not characterize their embryonic expression in detail, and these neurons do not then re-express Br-Z3 (or any other Broad isoform) when they undergo remodeling at the end of larval life ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and this study). The secondary interneurons also transiently express Br-Z3 during their early development. The results from feeding larvae on a BrdU diet from hatching (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) indicate that these embryonic secondary neurons account for many of the strong Br-Z3+ cells seen at hatching.</p><p>The main focus of the paper has been on the expression of Broad in the neurons born during the larval phase of neurogenesis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). We used BrdU incorporation to measure the latency to the onset of Br-Z3 expression in the secondary neurons. For larvae at 96 h AEL, the BrdU pulse length needed to see labeling in Br-Z3+ neurons was 11 h (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B, C</xref>), and defines the latency from the end of DNA synthesis in a GMC to the appearance of Br-Z3 in its daughters. At 96 h AEL (72 h post-hatching), the average lifetime of a GMC is about 7 h and its G2 phase lasts about 4 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Hence, a young neuron starts expressing Br-Z3 about 7 h after its birth, which is about 14 h after the birth of its parent GMC. The arrested embryonic NBs resume dividing early in the second instar larva, and GMCs are seen associated with them by 60 h AEL (36 h post-hatching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]). In this study, we started to see Br-Z3 appearing in the clusters of neurons by about 72 h AEL, a timing consistent with a 14 h latency between the birth of a GMC and the subsequent appearance of Br-Z3 in its daughter cells. Consequently, we assume that this latency is likely similar throughout the period of postembryonic neurogenesis.</p><fig id="F9" position="float"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p><bold>Summary of the time of the expression of the various Broad isoforms in the secondary neurons of the thoracic segmental lineages</bold>.

These showed initial Br-Z3 expression but then lost it by the start of wandering (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). They correspond to those cells characterized as being Broad negative and Chinmo+ at pupariation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The other pattern was shown by later born neurons (whose GMCs are born after about 72 h AEL) and these show the persistence of Br-Z3 through pupariation but then lose it early in adult differentiation.</p><p>The distinction between the Chinmo+ and Broad+ groups of secondary neurons is set up by the postembryonic actions of Seven-up and Castor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. For many lineages, removal of Seven-up resulted in the loss of Broad+ neurons in favor of the larger Chinmo+ cells. A similar result was seen in some of the lineages by the prolonged expression of Castor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. It is interesting that both Seven-up and Castor have roles in temporal identity in the embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. It could be that Br-Z3 expression in the embryonic secondary neurons may likewise be the result of the embryonic interplay of these two genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Broad Z3 and early neuronal development</title><p>The appearance of Br-Z3 in thoracic interneurons about 7 h after their birth coincides with the loss of expression of Notch in the membrane of these young neurons (JA and JWT, in preparation). Notch is prominent in the membranes of newborn neurons during pathfinding but then rapidly disappears. Consequently, the appearance of Br-Z3 is correlated with a new neuron arriving at its initial target. The best data on the behavior of growth cones in this post-pathfinding stage are for in-growing retinal axons in the first optic neuropil in <italic>Drosophila </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. After arriving at their initial location these axons undergo a 'sorting phase', during which their growth cones spread filopodia laterally to select their cartridge partners. Interestingly, photoreceptors are the only sensory neurons that we have found to express Br-Z3 and they do so during this early sorting phase (data not shown).</p><p>Expression of Br-Z3 in the developing medulla interneurons may also be correlated with the sorting of potential partners. As described above, when Br-Z3 first appears in the medulla in the mid third instar, it is confined to the most medial columns of neurons. Through time, more lateral columns progressively acquire Br-Z3 expression, and all outer medulla neurons are expressing this isoform by 14 h APF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). The neurons of the most medial columns interact with the first photoreceptors growing in from the posterior border of the eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], and as axons grow in from the subsequent rows of ommatidia over the next 2 days, these interact with the neurons of progressively more lateral columns. The wave of Br-Z3 expression across the medulla therefore matches the wave of afferent in-growth into this structure. Br-Z3 expression in the medulla remains prominent through 27 h APF after which it fades. Throughout this time the axon terminals of photoreceptors R7 and R8 are refining their initial positions in the layers of the medulla [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p><p>The Br-Z3 expression in thoracic interneurons suggests that there may be a similar 'sorting phase' within the developing central neuropils. The exact role of Br-Z3 in this sorting process is still being explored, but the ectopic expression of Br-Z3 in the LNv neurons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>) shows that the presence of Br-Z3 during initial outgrowth results in excessive sprouting (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). If the expression of Br-Z3 in the secondary neurons marks a sorting phase, then groups of these neurons may vary in the time when the sorting is completed. Notably, the early, Chinmo+ secondary neurons lose Br-Z3 expression by the start of wandering (approximately 110 h AEL). This early loss may mean an early commitment to initial targets, and they may serve a pioneer function in organizing the structure of the nascent adult neuropils. The bulk of secondary neurons, however, retain BR-Z3 expression until neurogenesis is almost complete in the central brain and the thorax. The last-born cells in these regions show only a very brief Br-Z3 expression as they are inserting into a neuropil that is already highly sorted.</p><p>Br-Z3 expression in the larval &#x003b3; neurons of the mushroom body is notable because it is the rare case of functioning neurons that continue to express Br-Z3. We do not know the significance of this expression. This may represent a unique function of Br-Z3 in larval mushroom body neurons. Alternatively, it may indicate that a 'sorting phase' may continue even in mature neurons. &#x003b3; neurons are continually added through the early larval stages and the older &#x003b3; neurons may have to continue to sort and rewire as the &#x003b3; class swells in number. Besides the mushroom body &#x003b3; neurons, we found that a few mature-looking neurons in the brain and thorax of newly hatched larvae were also BR-Z3 positive (data not shown). We do not know the identity of these neurons, but as proposed for the mushroom body &#x003b3; neurons, they may also have some unique plasticity demands as the larva grows.</p><p>A final puzzle involving Br-Z3 is its absence from motoneurons. In the growing larva, the axons from the lineage 15 motoneurons extend to the leg imaginal disc where they end without obvious elaborations. The subsequent interactions of their sprouting axon terminals with nascent muscles may require a very different set of processes from those used by interneurons as they sort out central targets.</p></sec><sec><title>Broad isoforms as markers of temporal identity</title><p>The BTB domain transcription factor gene <italic>chinmo </italic>was the first temporal specifying gene found for the postembryonic neurogenic period. Its presence in early-born neurons in both mushroom body and antennal lobe projection neuron lineages establishes early neuronal phenotypes in these lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Most recently, Maurange <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] showed that, just prior to metamorphosis, the secondary neuron lineages can be divided into older, Chinmo+ and younger, Broad+ neurons, the latter being due to the Br-Z3 isoform (this study). Both Chinmo and Br-Z3 disappear early in metamorphosis, though, and it is not known how their transient expression is then turned into persisting markers of temporal identity. We find here that other Broad isoforms, notably Br-Z1 and Br-Z4, provide permanent molecular time-stamps of birthdates.</p><p>Prior to metamorphosis, the Br-Z4+ neurons were always found clustered within a given lineage, a pattern suggesting that they arose from consecutively born GMCs. Br-Z4+ neurons were found in all of the thoracic lineages, except for the very small motor lineage generated by NB 24. Although we did not analyze brain lineages in detail, the broad pattern of Br-Z4 expression shows that this isoform is also expressed in most brain lineages. Thoracic lineages that made two classes of interneurons had roughly twice the number of Br-Z4+ neurons as lineages that produced only one class of interneuron (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>). The secondary neurons generated by a NB can be divided into two hemilineages, each composed of the collective Notch+ or Notch- daughters arising from the division of the series of GMCs. Studies blocking programmed cell death showed that in lineages with one bundle, one of the daughters consistently dies and only one hemilineage survives (DWW and JWT, in preparation). The lineages with both hemilineages had roughly twice the number of neurons compared with those that retain a single hemilineage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>). This pattern is consistent with a thoracic NB typically generating 13 to 16 GMCs whose daughters will express Br-Z4, but then cell death reducing the number by half in those that have a single hemilineage. Some lineages may deviate from this pattern; for example, lineage 0 has more Br-Z4+ neurons than would be expected for a lineage with a single surviving daughter, and atypically small lineages, such as lineages 2 and 15, have reduced numbers of Br-Z4+ cells.</p><p>MARCM clones induced at 24 and 54 h AEL contained their complete complement of Br-Z4+ cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>, and data not shown). Those induced at 76 h contained only a few Br-Z4+ neurons, and most Br-Z4+ cells were outside of the clone boundaries (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B, E</xref>). The presence of about six Br-Z4+ neurons within the latter clones suggests that only three to six GMCs with the Br-Z4 fate were left to be born at the time of the clone induction. Given that a NB produces about one GMC per hour at this time in larval life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], we estimate that the GMCs that generate the Br-Z4 cells are born from about 66 to about 80 h AEL (that is, from about 18 h into the second instar until about 8 h of the third larval stage). The analysis of MARCM clones in the adult (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>) shows that neurons born during this period in the larva continue to express Br-Z4 after metamorphosis. Br-Z4 expression in the adult therefore provides a molecular marker for the neurons whose GMCs were born during this window of larval life. As also described in the Results, Br-Z1 is co-localized in a subgroup of the Br-Z4 neurons, but we do not know if this expression defines a specific temporal subset of the Br-Z4 neurons. Within the postembryonic lineages, neuronal fate is clearly related to the time of birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. How Br-Z4 and Br-Z1 participate in these fate decisions remains to be examined.</p><p><italic>Broad </italic>differs from the embryonic temporal specification genes in that neither Br-Z4 nor Br-Z1 is expressed in the NBs or parent GMCs (data not shown). Br-Z4 expression only becomes evident towards the start of metamorphosis, well after the neurons are born. This suggests a mechanistic difference in the way in which primary versus secondary neurons are 'time-stamped'. The cells that will express Br-Z4 at the outset of metamorphosis are included in the Br-Z3+ group and not in the Chinmo+ group. Based on its timing, the Chinmo/Broad-Z3 boundary likely marks the start of production of the Br-Z4 neurons. Interestingly, Chinmo and Br-Z3 then disappear early in metamorphosis, whereas Br-Z4 persists as a permanent temporal marker for these neurons. This is the first reported example of a marker for temporal identity that persists into the adult.</p><p>A second potential difference from the embryonic pattern is in the signals that control expression of the timing genes. In the embryo, the switch from one timing gene to the next is intrinsically controlled within each lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In the postembryonic phase of neurogenesis, by contrast, extrinsic factors appear to play a role in determining the timing of switching from one cell type to another (E Marin and JWT, unpublished). The switching on and off of GMCs that will make Br-Z4+ neurons coincides with two 'milestones' in <italic>Drosophila </italic>larval development. The GMCs with the Br-Z4 fate start to be made late in the second instar, around the time larvae achieve the threshold size for metamorphosis and become committed to entering the terminal larval stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. They stop being made at the time in the third instar when the larva achieves its 'critical weight' sufficient to carry it through to pupariation and metamorphosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Both of these milestones represent endocrine-generated decisions. These extrinsic signals may be responsible for the expression of Br-Z4 and the specification of a distinct subtype of neuron, but this remains to be examined.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Fly stocks</title><p>Flies were reared on the standard yeast-cornmeal-molasses diet.

The same concentration was used for the phasic studies to determine the latency to Br-Z3 expression.

Labeled DNA requires acid hydrolysis prior to detection by anti-BrdU immunocytochemistry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], but this treatment can destroy other epitopes in multiply immunostained preparations. Consequently, we typically treated the tissues as described above with primaries and then secondaries for the non-BrdU epitopes. The incubation in secondary antisera was followed by rinses and then DNA hydrolysis in 2N HCl in PBS-TX for 1 h.
