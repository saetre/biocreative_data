It is generally accepted that radical surgery or radiotherapy can be curative for the majority of patients with early-stage cervical carcinoma. However, the prognosis of locally advanced or bulky disease remains very poor, and the optimal management for those patients is still a matter of debate, new therapeutic strategies, such as neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and concurrent chemoradiation, have been adopted to improve the prognosis for those patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Many clinical studies have revealed that NAC is highly effective for patients with locally advanced cervical carcinoma, the use of NAC followed by radical surgery and/or radiation for the treatment of cervical carcinoma has been investigated extensively in the past decade, it has been reported that NAC with cisplatinum-based chemotherapeutic regimens have high response rates (ranging from 53% to 94%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However, those who have a poor response to chemotherapy usually fail to respond to radiotherapy, and have a poor prognosis. Thus, NAC may delay definitive treatment, increase cost, and result in poorer outcomes in those patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. It is important to select appropriate patients before undergoing NAC; however, the variables used to predict NAC response are infrequently reported in locally advanced cervical carcinoma.</p><p>Cisplatin is considered to be the most effective drug for the treatment of cervical carcinoma, and usually is an essential element in the NAC regimen, but the mechanisms dictating variable response to chemotherapy among individuals are still unknown. Because platinum compounds produce adducts and breaks in the DNA double helix, individual variability of DNA repair may be relevant in modulating the efficacy of such cytotoxic agents. In resent years, some studies have shown that the molecular condition of DNA repair genes can predict the response of chemotherapy in some human cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The presence of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among patients suggests that genetic variability may contribute to variations in responsiveness to chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>X-ray repair cross-complementing gene 1 (<italic>XRCC1</italic>) is one of the most important DNA repair genes. The XRCC1 protein physically interacts with ligase III and poly(ADP-robose) polymerase, acting as a scaffold in the removal of adducts through both single-strand break repair and base excision repair (BER), and in the repair of other types of cisplatin-induced damage, including double-strand breaks, through a nonhomologous end-joining pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. There are three main coding polymorphisms in the <italic>XRCC1 </italic>gene: at codon 194 (Arg to Trp), 280 (Arg to His), and 399 (Arg to Gln). It was suggested that SNPs in the <italic>XRCC1 </italic>gene may alter the ability of <italic>XRCC1 </italic>to repair damaged DNA, especially SNPs at codon 399 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Some studies have shown that genetic polymorphisms of the <italic>XRCC1 </italic>gene are associated with response to platinum-based chemotherapy in non-small-cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], but few studies have investigated the association of <italic>XRCC1 </italic>SNPs with response to chemotherapy in locally advanced cervical carcinoma. Only one study has analyzed <italic>XRCC1 </italic>SNPs at codon 399, and another study has analyzed SNPs at codon 194 recently, the results have shown that the <italic>XRCC1 </italic>Arg399Trp polymorphism or the <italic>XRCC1 </italic>Arg194Trp polymorphism is associated with the response to platinum-based NAC in cervical cancer, but the number of cases were all small (36 patients and 66 patients respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. No results of this two SNPs in the same patients were showed.</p><p>To clarify the influence of the <italic>XRCC1 </italic>gene polymorphisms on the response to NAC, in the present study, we examined the association of the different genotypes (at codons 194 and 399), as well as protein expression with NAC response in patients with locally advanced cervical carcinoma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patient enrollment</title><p>From June 2003 to June 2007, a total of 109 patients with histologically confirmed locally advanced cervical carcinoma (FIGO stage IB2-IIA at least 4 cm in diameter) underwent NAC and subsequent radical hysterectomy in Women's Hospital School of Medicine, Zhejiang University. Of those, 70 patients who had complete clinical data, peripheral blood samples, and cervical carcinoma tissures by biopsy just before chemotherapy were enrolled in the study. Each patient signed a form to indicate informed consent before chemotherapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Chemotherapy</title><p>NAC regimens consisted of cisplatinum-based combined chemotherapy. The regimens included BVP (blemycin 15 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, on d1, d7; cisplatin 60 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>on d1; vindesine 4 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>on d1&#x02013;d2) in 47 patients, BIP (blemycin 15 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>on d1; ifosfamide 1 g/m<sup>2 </sup>on d1&#x02013;d5; cisplatin 50 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>on d1) in 15 patients, TP (taxol 60 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>d1; cisplatin 60 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>on d1) in 8 patients. NAC was administered every 3 to 4 weeks, for one to three cycles: one cycle in 15 patients, two cycles in 49 patients, and three cycles in 6 patients. All of the chemotherapeutic agents were administered intravenously.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation of chemotherapy response</title><p>The chemotherapy response was evaluated two weeks after completion of the final cycle according to WHO criteria, if no obvious response occurred after two cycles, the patient would not accept another cycle of chemotherapy. Tumor size was measured by pelvic examination and colposcopy as the product of the maximal perpendicular diameter of the tumor. complete response (CR) indicates disappearance of the disease, partial response (PR) indicates at least 50% reduction in tumor load, stable disease (SD) indicates that the lesion showed &#x02264; 25% progression or &#x0003c;50% shrinkage, and progression of disease (PD) indicates &#x0003e;25% enlargement of the lesion, or appearance of a new lesion. CR and PR were considered to be a good response; SD and PD, a poor response.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA extraction</title><p>Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes by the routine phenol/chloroform method. First, white blood cells were separated from red blood cells by washing three times in phosphate buffer solution. Then, the DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and was precipitated with cold ethanol. All DNA samples were dissolved in water and stored at -20&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>Genotyping</title><p>The two SNPs were detected using modified polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mismatch amplification (MA-PCR).

Owing to its possible effects on gene expression, polymorphisms of DNA repair genes related to metabolism may influence tumor response to chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The identification of molecular variables that predict either sensitivity or resistance to chemotherapy is of major interest in selecting the first-line treatment most likely to be effective. Because <italic>XRCC1 </italic>is one of the most important DNA repair genes, the main aim of the present study was to determine whether the <italic>XRCC1 </italic>genetic polymorphisms could predict clinical response of patients with locally advanced cervical carcinoma to platinum-based NAC.</p><p>Some studies have assessed the association between <italic>XRCC1 </italic>gene polymorphisms and chemotherapy response in various carcinomas, but the results are inconsistent. There has been increasing evidence that decreased DNA repair capacity resulting from genetic polymorphisms of various DNA repair genes is associated with improved survival of cancer patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy, especially in non-small cell lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Studies addressing the association of <italic>XRCC1 </italic>gene polymorphisms at codon 194 with chemotherapy response have focused mainly on non-small cell lung cancer.

On the other hand, some other studies did not find that the SNPs of <italic>XRCC1 </italic>contributed to susceptibility to cancer or to sensitivity to chemotherapy. These inconsistent results may be related to the different types of cancers studied in different ethnic populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Only one study assessed the association between XRCC1 gene polymorphisms at codon 194 and NAC response in cervical cancer, recently, Kim and his colleagues reported 66 patients with cervical cancer undergoing platinum-based NAC, the results showed that the genotypes of XRCC1 Arg194Trp was associated with the response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].

Wang and his colleagues reported that in patients with non-small cell lung cancer who received the platinum-based chemotherapy, the response rate was significantly higher in patients with the Arg/Arg genotype than that in those with at least one Gln allele (41.5% vs. 21.2%). In contrast, other studies of patients with neck cancer revealed that sensitivity to chemotherapy was higher in patients with a Gln allele than in those with other genotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Moreno and colleagues also found that the prognosis of colorectal cancer patients receiving chemotherapy with 5-FU was better in patients with the 399Gln/Gln genotype than in those with Arg/Arg or Arg/Gln genotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. While in a recent study, no significant association was found between the SNPs of <italic>XRCC1 </italic>at codon 399 and the response to chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Our study showed that the response to chemotherapy in locally advanced cervical carcinoma was significantly higher in patients with the Arg/Arg genotype at codon 399 than in those with the Arg/Gln or Gln/Gln genotype (90.0% vs. 76.92%). The risk of failure of NAC therapy was 3.254 fold higher in patients carrying at least one Gln allele compared with those carrying no Gln allele. Our findings suggest that SNPs of the <italic>XRCC1 </italic>gene at codon 399 influences the response of cervical carcinoma to platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and that the genotype carrying at least one Gln allele may be considered to be a candidate molecular marker to predict poor response to NAC in locally advanced cervical carcinoma.</p><p>The fact that SNPs of <italic>XRCC1 </italic>at codon 399 influences response to NAC in locally advanced cervical carcinoma affirms previous results reported by the studies of other carcinomas, but the exact mechanism remains unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Some studies have shown that resistance to platinum-based agents was related to the overexpression of DNA-repair protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Dabholkar and colleagues found that the mRNA level of some DNA repair gene was significantly increased in platinum-resistant ovarian carcinoma, indicating that the level of DNA repair gene expression correlates with the response to platinum-based chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Similarly, our results also showed that the level of XRCC1 protein expression was significantly higher in patients with poor response than in those with good response to NAC in locally advanced cervical carcinoma. In addition, we found that this altered expression of the XRCC1 protein was associated with <italic>XRCC1 </italic>genotype variation at codon 399, the protein expression was significantly higher in the patients with a Gln allele (Arg/Gln or Gln/Gln) than that with the Arg/Arg genotype in locally advanced cervical carcinoma. Our findings suggest that the genotype with at least one Gln allele probably increases the expression of XRCC1 protein, and consequently, results in poor response to platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced cervical carcinoma. To our knowledge, this is the first investigation of <italic>XRCC1 </italic>gene SNPs, protein expression, and their association with response to chemotherapy. Further study is needed to clarify the mechanism behind this phenomenon.</p><p>We have demonstrated that SNPs of the <italic>XRCC1 </italic>gene at codon 399 influence the response of patients with locally advanced cervical carcinoma to platinum-based NAC. Patients with a genotype carrying at least one Gln allele have an increased risk of failure to respond to chemotherapy compared with those carrying no Gln allele. This reduced response to chemotherapy is probably due to elevated expression of XRCC1 protein in those patients who have at least one Gln allele.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>XDC have made substantial contributions to conception, and drafting the manuscript.
