We previously demonstrated that regeneration melanocytes arise from cell division of the otherwise quiescent melanocyte precursors following larval melanocyte ablation with a small molecule, MoTP. The ease of ablating melanocytes by MoTP allows us to conduct a forward genetic screen for mechanisms specific to regeneration from such precursors or stem cells.

Tissue homeostasis and regeneration have often been demonstrated to act through recruiting quiescent undifferentiated precursors or stem cells to re-enter developmental programs reminiscent of embryonic mechanisms. The mechanisms regulating these processes are critical for maintaining normal physiology. For instance, uncontrolled growth of undifferentiated precursors or stem cells has been suggested to cause many types of cancers, including leukemia and skin cancer &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030088-b001">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030088-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. However, little is known about the genes and pathways that specifically regulate these precursors or stem cells. The fact that the differentiation and physiological states of adult animals are very distinct from embryos raises the possible existence of pathways or mechanisms specific to regeneration or to those mechanisms that regulate the development of these undifferentiated cells. Such mechanisms may play roles in establishing the precursors or stem cells during embryogenesis, maintaining them throughout development, or recruiting them at the adult stages for growth, regeneration, or tissue homeostasis. Understanding the mechanisms specific to regeneration or homeostasis will provide insight into the regulation of stem cells, which may lead to the development of therapies for many human diseases.</p><p>Regeneration studies are classically performed by amputating a mass of continuous tissues, such as a limb or a portion of an organ, and investigating how organisms coordinately regenerate multiple types of cells or tissues &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030088-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030088-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. Recently, some attention has been focused on single cell type ablation and subsequent regeneration &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030088-b008">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030088-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. This approach has two advantages. First, focusing on a single cell type reduces the complexity of the regeneration process, and second, it provides an opportunity to isolate the mechanisms that control adult stem cells from other biological mechanisms that may be occurring during the normal development of that cell type. Additionally, it may also provide an opportunity to understand the cause or cure for human disease resulting from single cell type deficits, such as loss of &#x003b2; cells in autoimmune type I diabetes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030088-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. Several methods that ablate single cell types have been reported in various vertebrates, including genetic approaches, and use of lasers or chemicals &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030088-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030088-b013">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030088-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. For example, Lamotte et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030088-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d; used transgenic methods to introduce tissue-specific expression of a toxin to ablate mouse pancreatic &#x003b2; cells. Other examples include exposure to a dermatology laser and incubation with a small molecule, 4-(4-morpholinobutylthio)phenol (MoTP), each of which has been shown to specifically ablate zebrafish larval melanocytes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030088-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030088-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The zebrafish larval melanocyte is an attractive cell type for regeneration studies. Mature larval melanocytes can be easily followed by the presence of black pigment; they are dispensable for fish viability in the laboratory, and multiple mutations have been generated that affect different aspects of melanocyte development at different stages of the fish life cycle &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030088-b018">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030088-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. Most importantly, after the establishment of the larval melanocyte pattern during the first three days of fish development, the number of larval melanocytes remains relatively constant throughout the following two weeks of development with little or no turnover. This period of stable melanocyte pattern provides an opportunity to study melanocyte regeneration once ablated. We previously reported that a small molecule MoTP specifically ablates melanocytes or melanoblasts in zebrafish larvae. The melanocytotoxicity of MoTP is mediated via tyrosinase activity, presumably to convert MoTP into cytotoxic quinone species. Following melanocyte ablation by MoTP, regeneration melanocytes arise from cell division of the otherwise quiescent melanocyte precursors that we suggest are equivalent to adult stem cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030088-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. The ease of ablating larval melanocytes by MoTP allows us to conduct a forward genetic screen for mechanisms specific to regeneration from such precursors or stem cells.</p><p>Here, we report a melanocyte ablation screen in zebrafish aimed at isolating mutants that fail to regenerate melanocytes. In this mutant screen, we identified two mutants, <italic>eartha</italic><sup>j23e1</sup> and <italic>julie</italic><sup>j24e1</sup>. These mutants have normal larval melanocyte development, but upon subsequent melanocyte ablation by MoTP, each mutant largely fails to regenerate their melanocytes. Our analyses revealed that <italic>eartha</italic><sup>j23e1</sup> specifically affects melanocyte differentiation (marked by melanin production) at a late stage during regeneration. Positional cloning reveals that the <italic>eartha</italic><sup>j23e1</sup> mutation is a nonsense mutation in <italic>gfpt1 (glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase 1),</italic> the rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes the formation of glucosamine-6-phosphate in the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030088-b021">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030088-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. The major end product of this pathway is UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), which is one of the building blocks for glycosyl side chains for many glycoproteins and proteoglycans. Although our analyses on chondrocyte development in <italic>eartha</italic><sup>j23e1</sup> mutants indicate that mutation in <italic>gfpt1</italic> affects the extracellular matrix (ECM) formation of cartilage, our chimera analysis reveals that <italic>gfpt1</italic> acts cell autonomously in melanocytes to promote ontogenetic melanocyte darkening.

We ablated larval melanocytes by incubating embryos in MoTP from 14 to 72 hours postfertilization (hpf) and scored their melanocyte regeneration at 5&#x02013;8 days postfertilization (dpf) when wild-type larvae have regenerated many melanocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030088-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030088-g001">1</xref>B) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030088-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. Among the 648 EP clutches generated, 421 clutches had more than ten individuals survive through the early pressure and MoTP incubation procedure for melanocyte regeneration analysis. A total of 29 of these clutches and their <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> mothers were kept as putative mutants, because each of these EP clutches had at least one individual lacking melanocytes after MoTP washout. In addition to these 421 clutches, seven small clutches (fewer than ten surviving individuals) were also kept since at least one of the surviving individuals showed defects in melanocyte regeneration. In total, we found 36 clutches with possible defects in melanocyte regeneration. We then excluded 12 of these 36 clutches from further characterization because additional phenotypes in ontogenetic melanocyte development were observed in their haploid siblings. Among the remaining 24 possible melanocyte regeneration-specific mutants, we successfully rescreened 15 (62&#x00025;) of them, either by a second EP screen of the <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub> female or from the EP embryos of <italic>F</italic><sub>2</sub> outcross, indicating that we effectively screened approximately 263 (421 &#x000d7; 0.62) haploid genomes. Among these 15 possible mutant lines, only two repeated their melanocyte regeneration phenotypes. This high false positive noise could be due to the frequent developmental defects that were caused by the early pressure procedure. Because these mutagenesis protocols typically identify mutations in targeted loci at frequencies of approximately one per 1,000 haploid genomes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030088-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030088-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;, our result suggests that there may be many more genes that could be found by the further exploitation of this melanocyte ablation screen. We followed our laboratory's cat theme for naming pigment mutants. Because the Catwoman character is regenerated with each new actress that plays the role, we chose to name our two regeneration mutations, <italic>eartha</italic><sup>j23e1</sup> and <italic>julie</italic><sup>j24e1</sup> after Catwoman actresses Eartha Kitt and Julie Newmar.</p><p>Both <italic>eartha</italic><sup>j23e1</sup> and <italic>julie</italic><sup>j24e1</sup> mutants develop ontogenetic melanocytes normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030088-g001">Figure 1</xref>C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030088-g001">1</xref>E, and 1G), but following melanocyte ablation by MoTP, <italic>eartha</italic><sup>j23e1</sup> and <italic>julie</italic><sup>j24e1</sup> mutants only regenerate 11.8&#x00025; and 10.0&#x00025;, respectively, of the normal complement of regeneration melanocytes at 5 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030088-g001">Figure 1</xref>D, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030088-g001">1</xref>F, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030088-g001">1</xref>H). Both <italic>eartha</italic><sup>j23e1</sup> and <italic>julie</italic><sup>j24e1</sup> mutations are recessive lethal, with most <italic>eartha</italic><sup>j23e1</sup> mutants dying at approximately 12 dpf, and <italic>julie</italic><sup>j24e1</sup> mutants dying at approximately 7&#x02013;8 dpf. This raises the possibility that the larval melanocyte regeneration defects observed in <italic>eartha</italic><sup>j23e1</sup> and <italic>julie</italic><sup>j24e1</sup> mutants are the consequences of nonspecific larval-stage lethality rather than specific effects on melanocyte regeneration. To help rule out this possibility, we examined melanocyte regeneration in homozygous mutants for an early larval lethal mutation, <italic>rapunzel</italic><sup>c14</sup> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030088-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. Although homozygous <italic>rapunzel</italic><sup>c14</sup> larvae show many developmental defects including defects in jaw and fin-fold development (unpublished data), the number of melanocytes in <italic>rapunzel</italic><sup>c14</sup> larvae is indistinguishable from that in wild-type larvae at 3 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030088-g001">Figure 1</xref>G). By 5 dpf, almost all <italic>rapunzel</italic><sup>c14</sup> larvae have severe edema and then die at approximately 6 dpf. Upon melanocyte ablation by MoTP (14&#x02013;72 hpf), we found that <italic>rapunzel</italic><sup>c14</sup> mutants regenerate approximately 70&#x00025; of the number of the melanocytes that regenerate in wild-type larvae, 7-fold more melanocytes than those that regenerate in <italic>eartha</italic><sup>j23e1</sup> and <italic>julie</italic><sup>j24e1</sup> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030088-g001">Figure 1</xref>H). This result rules out a strict correlation between larval-stage lethality and defects in melanocyte regeneration, and also suggests that the regeneration defects observed in <italic>eartha</italic><sup>j23e1</sup> and <italic>julie</italic><sup>j24e1</sup> larvae result from defects specific to regeneration mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title><italic>eartha</italic> Mutation Specifically Affects Larval Melanocyte Regeneration after dct<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Stage</title><p>The development of <italic>eartha</italic><sup>j23e1</sup> embryos is indistinguishable from wild-type embryos until 3&#x02013;4 dpf at which stage their melanocytes appear lighter than wild-type larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030088-g001">Figure 1</xref>C).

Larval melanocytes in <italic>eartha</italic><sup>j23e1</sup> larvae were ablated by MoTP treatment from 14 to 72 hpf, and regenerated melanocytes were analyzed at 7 dpf by in situ hybridization (ISH) analysis, a time when many melanocytes regenerate in wild-type larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030088-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Although <italic>eartha</italic><sup>j23e1</sup> larvae had only very few regenerated melanocytes (melanin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>), we detected many <italic>dct</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> melanoblasts (melanin<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) in the <italic>eartha</italic><sup>j23e1</sup> larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030088-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). The number of these <italic>dct</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> melanoblasts and regenerated melanocytes (melanin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) in the dorsum of <italic>eartha</italic><sup>j23e1</sup> mutants (30.5 &#x000b1; 9.2) is virtually identical to that in the wild-type larvae (31.0 &#x000b1; 7.2). This result suggests that regenerated melanocytes in <italic>eartha</italic><sup>j23e1</sup> larvae develop to late-stage (<italic>dct</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) but fail to produce melanin, and that <italic>eartha</italic> acts after the <italic>dct</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> stage in melanocyte differentiation during melanocyte regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030088-g002">Figure 2</xref>A).</p><p>To test the specificity of <italic>eartha<sup>'</sup></italic>s role in melanocyte regeneration, we asked if the <italic>eartha</italic><sup>j23e1</sup> mutation affects other regeneration process, such as larval tail regeneration. When wild-type larval tails were amputated at 3 dpf, the wound first heals by closing the injured tip of the notochord and neural tube. This is followed by the outgrowth of fin fold in the ensuing two days. By 9 dpf (6 d postamputation), the missing larval tails are largely reconstituted, including complete regeneration of fin-fold tissues and melanocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030088-g002">Figure 2</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030088-g002">2</xref>E). That most of these melanocytes are derived from undifferentiated precursors rather than immigration of previously differentiated melanocytes is demonstrated by the finding that larvae challenged to regenerate their tails in the presence of the tyrosinase inhibitor phenylthiourea (PTU) have few or no pigmented melanocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030088-g002">Figure 2</xref>F). Furthermore, the presence of newly differentiated but unpigmented melanocytes in these tails is revealed by the appearance of faintly pigmented melanocytes within a day after MoTP washout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030088-g002">Figure 2</xref>G) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030088-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;. When similar tail amputation experiments were conducted in <italic>eartha</italic><sup>j23e1</sup> larvae, their tails regenerated identically to those of wild-type larvae, except that we observed very few melanocytes in the regenerated tail. Those melanocytes that appear in the regenerated <italic>eartha</italic> tail were immediately distal to the amputation plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030088-g002">Figure 2</xref>H and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030088-g002">2</xref>I), similar in position and numbers to those observed in wild-type regenerated tail in the presence of PTU. This result suggests that the immigration of the differentiated melanocytes may occur normally in <italic>eartha</italic><sup>j23e1</sup> larvae, but that new melanocytes fail to regenerate. We interpret this result to suggest that <italic>eartha</italic><sup>j23e1</sup> mutation specifically affects melanocyte regeneration but not general tail regeneration. In addition, the finding that the melanocyte regeneration defect also occurs in the tail regeneration experiments, where the small molecule MoTP is not used, indicates that the <italic>eartha</italic> phenotype is not a consequence of unanticipated interactions between MoTP and the mutated gene.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title><italic>eartha</italic> Mutation Affects Late-Stage Cartilage Differentiation</title><p>To further understand how <italic>eartha</italic> regulates developmental processes, we sought to examine the development of pharyngeal skeleton in <italic>eartha</italic><sup>j23e1</sup> mutants.

We also note that one of the mutations, <italic>eartha,</italic> blocks regeneration at a late stage of differentiation, suggesting that the regeneration process may differ from ontogenetic process not only in the as yet hypothetical mechanisms that keep stem cells in check or act to recruit them back into developmental pathways, but also in those later stages in differentiation that superficially seem to be held in common between ontogenetic and regeneration processes.</p><sec id="s3a"><title><italic>gfpt1</italic> Promotes Melanocyte Differentiation from dct<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>; melanin<sup>&#x02212;</sup> to melanin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Stage during Larval Melanocyte Regeneration</title><p><italic>eartha</italic><sup>j23e1</sup> mutation allows normal development of ontogenetic melanocytes (melanin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) but blocks larval melanocyte regeneration following MoTP treatment.

Although in vitro biochemical studies showed that <italic>gfpt1</italic> regulates UDP-GlcNAc synthesis, whether <italic>gfpt1</italic> is the only enzyme for UDP-GlcNAc synthesis in vivo and whether other enzymes, such as <italic>gfpt2</italic>, also play roles in this process are unknown. Furthermore, the developmental role of <italic>gfpt1</italic> in vertebrates is unexplored.</p><p>The isolation and analyses of <italic>eartha</italic><sup>j23e1</sup> mutants may provide insight into the roles of <italic>gfpt1</italic> in vertebrate development. Alcian Blue is a cationic dye that binds negatively charged sites on the GAGs, such as hyaluronan &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030088-b055">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030088-b056">56</xref>&#x0005d;. Since cartilage is largely composed of GAGs, Alcian Blue staining reveals the presence of these long chain sugar molecules. Our findings that chondrocytes in <italic>eartha</italic><sup>j23e1</sup> mutants commit to their cell fates and develop to <italic>col2a1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> stage, but display weaker Alcian Blue staining, suggest defects in formation of GAGs in the ECM of the cartilages. These results indicate possible defects in the ECM of the connective tissues and raise the possibility that the lightly pigmented phenotype of the ontogenetic melanocytes and the melanocyte regeneration defect we observed in the <italic>eartha</italic><sup>j23e1</sup> mutants was also the consequence of defects in the ECM. Our finding by chimera analysis that wild-type or donor-derived melanocytes have normal pigmentation in the <italic>eartha</italic><sup>j23e1</sup> mutant hosts indicates that this particular function is not mediated through ECM, but instead reflects a cell autonomous, presumably intracellular, function for <italic>gfpt1</italic> in melanocyte development. Although we have not yet explored the autonomy for <italic>eartha</italic> in melanocyte regeneration, it now seems likely that the role for <italic>gfpt1</italic> in melanocyte regeneration is autonomous as well.</p><p>Although the in vitro biochemical studies suggest a general role for <italic>gfpt1</italic> in the UDP-GlcNAc production, our analyses suggest that this pathway has only a handful of easily discerned and diverse consequences when disrupted in zebrafish embryos. Thus, the defect in jaw morphogenesis may indicate a role in regulating the proper formation of the ECM in chondrocyte development, while different roles in modulating intracellular targets may be revealed by the defects in melanocyte darkening during ontogeny or defects in progression from the <italic>dct</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>; melanin<sup>&#x02212;</sup> to melanin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> stage during melanocyte regeneration.</p><p>One question remaining is how a mutation in <italic>gfpt1</italic> specifically affects the progression from <italic>dct</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>; melanin<sup>&#x02212;</sup> stage to melanin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> stage in the regenerating melanocytes but has no similar effects on this stage of ontogenetic melanocyte development. One possibility is that the <italic>gfpt1</italic> mutation reveals a function specific to melanocyte regeneration that is not shared by embryonic melanocyte development. However, our observation that ontogenetic melanocytes in <italic>eartha</italic><sup>j23e1</sup> mutants at 4&#x02013;5 dpf have lighter pigmentation than those in wild-type larvae suggests that <italic>gfpt1</italic> also plays a role in embryonic melanocyte darkening. These findings may indicate that the two different phenotypes are due to the contribution of <italic>gfpt1</italic> from two distinct mechanisms, for instance that two distinct GlcNAc modified factors are responsible, respectively, for the two different stages/types of melanocyte development. The alternative possibility is that defects in a shared mechanism cause distinct phenotypes in ontogenetic and regeneration melanocytes. Differences between the roles in ontogenetic melanocyte development and larval melanocyte regeneration have been described for the <italic>kit</italic> receptor tyrosine kinase. Ontogenetic melanocytes differentiate in the absence of <italic>kit</italic> receptor tyrosine kinase function, but melanocytes in <italic>kit</italic> receptor tyrosine kinase mutants largely fail to differentiate when challenged to regenerate &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030088-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030088-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030088-b057">57</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore, the difference between ontogenetic and regeneration stages of melanocyte development in the <italic>eartha</italic><sup>j23e1</sup> mutants may either reflect the effect of <italic>gfpt1</italic> on modification of a common substrate that in turn has important roles at different stages of melanocyte development or instead reflect two distinct pathways that are modulated by <italic>gfpt1</italic>'s role in UDP-GlcNAc production. Either of these models suggests some distinct mechanisms involved in regeneration that are not involved in ontogeny.</p><p>A less likely explanation that we cannot yet formally exclude is that the ability of ontogenetic melanocytes to reach melanin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> stage (light melanocytes) in the <italic>eartha</italic><sup>j23e1</sup> mutants reflects the perdurance of <italic>gfpt1</italic> maternal message or protein. Such a model would suggest a maternal role in melanocyte differentiation at approximately 22&#x02013;24 hpf when ontogenetic melanocytes begin to melanize. This stage of melanocyte development is far beyond the midblastula transition (4 hpf) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030088-b058">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030088-b059">59</xref>&#x0005d;, when zygotic transcription begins, and many maternal transcripts are degraded &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030088-b060">60</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, although we detected some maternal <italic>gfpt1</italic> transcripts in four-cell stage embryos, by 13 hpf, most or all <italic>gfpt1</italic> transcripts are derived from zygotic expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030088-g005">Figure 5</xref>B), tending to argue against maternal perdurance. Moreover, morpholino oligonucleotides directed against the ribosome binding site of the <italic>gfpt1</italic> transcript (ATG blocking morpholinos), which might be expected to block the translation of maternal transcripts, cause embryonic melanocyte darkening defects similar to those observed in the <italic>eartha</italic> mutants, but no defect on the initial development and pigmentation of embryonic melanocytes (unpublished data). Although such results tend to argue against a role for maternal <italic>gfpt1</italic> transcripts in promoting embryonic melanocyte development, these experiments do not rule out the possibility of maternally supplied protein or other post-translational products being responsible for the embryonic melanocytes that are observed in the <italic>eartha</italic> mutants.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title><italic>skiv2l2</italic> Regulates Cell Division during Larval Melanocyte Regeneration</title><p>We identified a second mutant, <italic>julie</italic><sup>j24e1</sup>, which develops normal ontogenetic melanocytes but fails to regenerate melanocytes upon ablation by MoTP.

Our finding of reduced <italic>pcna</italic> expressions in the proliferation zones of the eye and brain in the <italic>julie</italic><sup>j24e1</sup> larvae suggests that <italic>skiv2l2</italic> plays a role in cell division. Furthermore, the finding of virtually no <italic>dct</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> melanoblasts in the <italic>julie</italic><sup>j24e1</sup> mutants after MoTP washout suggests that <italic>skiv2l2</italic> may regulate melanocyte cell division at a relatively early stage (prior to <italic>dct</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> stage) during melanocyte regeneration. If the zebrafish <italic>skiv2l2</italic> has an equivalent biochemical function as that proposed for yeast MTR4 in transporting mRNA from the nucleus, it is possible that certain as yet unidentified mRNAs regulating cell proliferation may fail to be transported out of the nucleus in the <italic>julie</italic><sup>j24e1</sup> mutants. This, consequently, would deplete their activities, thereby reducing cell proliferation in <italic>julie</italic><sup>j24e1</sup> mutants. Alternatively, <italic>skiv2l2</italic> could function in the surveillance mechanism postulated in yeast to control the quality and quantity of various nuclear RNA species. This surveillance mechanism could be essential for proper ribosome assembly for protein translation, which is usually active in dividing cells. The defect in this surveillance mechanism could consequently lead to deficits in cell division in <italic>julie</italic><sup>j24e1</sup> mutants. Finally, several DEAD-box RNA helicases in the exosome complex have been implicated in microRNA processing of transcripts for genes that subsequently regulate cell division, differentiation, and apoptosis during various aspects of organismal development including brain morphogenesis in zebrafish &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030088-b070">70</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030088-b073">73</xref>&#x0005d;. Whether <italic>skiv2l2</italic> plays a role in any of these aspects of RNA metabolism is an intriguing question for further investigation.</p><p>A remaining question is how a mutation in <italic>skiv2l2</italic> specifically affects melanocyte regeneration but not ontogenetic melanocyte development. One possible model is that <italic>skiv2l2</italic> specifically promotes cell division at postembryonic stages, including the cell division that is required for melanocyte regeneration. This possibility suggests a fundamental difference between the regulatory mechanisms used to generate the cells that differentiate to form the embryo and those that arise during larval growth. As discussed above, one explanation for this difference might simply reflect the role of perduring maternal products. Our finding that ATG blocking morpholino oligonucleotides against <italic>skiv2l2</italic> cause morphological defects similar to <italic>julie</italic> mutants (including smaller head and eyes) but still develop ontogenetic melanocytes argues against a role for maternally deposited transcripts accounting for ontogenetic melanocyte development observed in <italic>julie</italic> mutants (unpublished data). As we discussed for <italic>eartha</italic>, this does not rule out a role for maternally deposited Skiv2l2 proteins. A more interesting model is that the <italic>julie</italic> regeneration defect during the transition to larval growth may instead reflect the use of different types of precursors, which have different stem cell qualities of self renewal or multipotency than precursors for cells that differentiate during embryonic stages. Support for this notion of different types of precursors for embryogenesis and larval growth development may best come from the analysis of melanocyte development. Our previous work and that of others suggest that larval regeneration melanocytes and adult melanocytes are derived from self-renewal of precursors or stem cell &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030088-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030088-b074">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030088-b075">75</xref>&#x0005d;.

At this stage, many melanocytes (melanin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) have regenerated in the wild-type larvae (arrowhead in &#x0005b;B&#x0005d;). Although only few pigmented melanocytes appear in <italic>eartha</italic><sup>j23e1</sup> larvae at the same stage, many <italic>dct</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> melanoblasts (melanin<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, stained purple) are revealed by ISH (arrow in &#x0005b;C&#x0005d;).</p><p>(D&#x02013;I) <italic>eartha</italic><sup>j23e1</sup> mutation specifically affects melanocyte regeneration during larval tail regeneration. Arrowheads show amputation planes at 3 dpf prior to amputation (D) and (H) and after regeneration (E&#x02013;G) and (I). Wild-type larval tails (D) were amputated at 3 dpf. The wound healed in the ensuing two days by closing the injured tip of the notochord and neural tube, followed by the outgrowth of fin fold. By 9 dpf (6 d postamputation), the missing larval tails were reconstituted, including fin-fold tissues (outlined with white-dashed lines) and melanocytes (arrow in &#x0005b;E&#x0005d;). The origins of the re-established tail melanocytes were investigated by incubating larvae in PTU immediately after larval tail amputations (F). PTU prevents melanin synthesis in newly differentiated melanocytes, and thus the pigmented melanocytes that appear in regenerated tails of the PTU-treated larvae pre-existed prior to the tail amputation. At 9 dpf, few melanocytes (arrow in &#x0005b;F&#x0005d;) appear in the newly regenerated tail immediately distal to the amputation plane in the PTU-treated larvae, suggesting that these melanocytes arise from the migration of proximately differentiated melanocytes from the stump (F). Additional lightly pigmented melanocytes appear after PTU washout (arrow in &#x0005b;G&#x0005d;), indicating that these melanocytes are newly differentiated. When similar tail amputations were conducted in <italic>eartha</italic><sup>j23e1</sup> larvae (H and I), the larval tails regenerated identically to wild-type larvae, except that few melanocytes appear in the regenerated tail in the region immediately distal to the amputation plane (arrow in &#x0005b;I&#x0005d;).
