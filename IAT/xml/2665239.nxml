Mammalian PolXs are known to be involved in several DNA-processing pathways including repair, but the cellular functions of bacterial PolXs are less known. Many bacterial PolXs have a polymerase and histidinol phosphatase (PHP) domain at their C-termini in addition to a PolX core (POLXc) domain, and possess 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity. Although both domains are highly conserved in bacteria, their molecular functions, especially for a PHP domain, are unknown. We found <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> HB8 PolX (ttPolX) has Mg<sup>2+</sup>/Mn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent DNA/RNA polymerase, Mn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease and DNA-binding activities. We identified the domains of ttPolX by limited proteolysis and characterized their biochemical activities. The POLXc domain was responsible for the polymerase and DNA-binding activities but exonuclease activity was not detected for either domain. However, the POLXc and PHP domains interacted with each other and a mixture of the two domains had Mn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity. Moreover, site-directed mutagenesis revealed catalytically important residues in the PHP domain for the 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity. Our findings provide a molecular insight into the functional domain organization of bacterial PolXs, especially the requirement of the PHP domain for 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>DNA polymerases are generally classified into seven families, the A, B, C, D, X, Y and reverse transcriptase (RT) ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). In these seven families, the study of X-family DNA polymerases (PolXs) is advanced in eukaryotes, especially in mammals. Mammalian PolXs are further classified into six members: DNA polymerase &#x003b2; (Pol&#x003b2;), &#x003bc; (Pol&#x003bc;), &#x003bb; (Pol&#x003bb;), &#x003c3;1 (Pol&#x003c3;1) and &#x003c3;2 (Pol&#x003c3;2), and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Pol&#x003b2; exhibits Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent DNA/RNA polymerase activity in a DNA-template-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) and is involved in base excision repair (BER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Pol&#x003bb; exhibits Mg<sup>2+</sup>/Mn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent DNA polymerase activity in a DNA-template-dependent/independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) and is involved in DNA double-strand break repair (DSBR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Pol&#x003bc; exhibits Mg<sup>2+</sup>/Mn<sup>2+</sup>/Co<sup>2+</sup>-dependent DNA/RNA polymerase activity in a DNA-template-dependent/independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) and is involved in DSBR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) and V(D)J recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). TdT can incorporate nucleotides at 3&#x02032;-OH in a template-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) and is involved in V(D)J recombination. The Pol&#x003c3;s are involved in sister-chromatid cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Thus, mammalian PolXs are involved in DNA repair and other DNA-processing pathways.</p><p>Eukaryotic PolXs are composed of mainly two domains, a PolX core (POLXc) domain at the C-terminus and a BRCA1 (breast cancer susceptibility protein) C-terminal (BRCT) domain at the N-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). However, Pol&#x003b2; consists of only a POLXc domain, and Pol&#x003c3;s have no POLXc or BRCT domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). The POLXc domain possesses polymerase activity and contains two helix-hairpin-helix motifs, which are responsible for sequence-nonspecific DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). On the other hand, the BRCT domain interacts with other proteins and/or DNA and joins the Ku-XRCC4-DNA ligase IV-DNA complex for DSBR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Therefore, although all PolXs are single-subunit enzymes, their domain architecture permits them to exhibit multiple biochemical activities. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Domain structures predicted by sequence motif analysis of representative PolXs.

Sequence analysis of bacterial PolXs revealed that no bacterial PolXs have a BRCT domain, and that many of them have a polymerase and histidinol phosphatase (PHP) domain at their C-termini in addition to a POLXc domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The PHP domain [also called the histidinol phosphatase-2 (HIS2) domain] is conserved in three taxonomic domains, especially in almost all bacteria. The PHP domain is associated with several proteins, such as DNA polymerases or exists as a stand-alone PHP domain protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The crystal structures of several proteins containing a PHP domain were determined to have a distorted (&#x003b2;&#x003b1;)<sub>7</sub> barrel fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19 B20 B21">19&#x02013;21</xref>). The PHP domain of the DNA polymerase III (PolIII) &#x003b1;-subunit from <italic>Thermus aquaticus</italic> possesses a trinuclear metal site, which is composed of conserved residues including histidine and aspartate ones. The PHP domain exhibits sequence and structural similarity to those of enzymes belonging to the metal-dependent amidohydrolase superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), but exhibits no similarity to the BRCT domain in mammalian PolXs. Thus, bacterial PolXs have a completely different domain structure from eukaryotic PolXs.</p><p>Contrary to the case of mammalian PolXs, the study of the cellular and molecular functions of bacterial PolXs has made little progress. There has only been one recent report of biochemical and gene disruption analysis of PolX from <italic>Deinococcus radiodurans</italic> (drPolX), which is a well-known extremophile exhibiting high resistance to desiccation and ionizing radiation. drPolX has Mg<sup>2+</sup>/Mn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent DNA polymerase and Mn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). The finding of the 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity was unexpected because the other PolXs examined so far lack this activity. The fact that the PHP domain, a member of an amidohydrolase superfamily, is missing in mammalian PolXs raises the possibility that the PHP domain is needed for 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity. This possibility is supported by the observation that the &#x003b1;-subunit of PolIII from <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> has Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity, and this subunit also contains a PHP domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). However, a study on drPolX reported that the POLXc domain had 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity and the PHP domain had no intrinsic nuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). This discrepancy must be addressed because the 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity of bacterial PolXs may be important for the DNA repair process. Blasius <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) also showed that the 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity of drPolX was dependent on Mn<sup>2+</sup> as a cofactor like its polymerase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). In this regard, however, it should be noted that compared with other bacteria, the intracellular concentration of Mn<sup>2+</sup> in <italic>D. radiodurans</italic> is very high, which is supposed to be important for the radioresistance inherent to this bacterium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Although deletion of the drPolX gene (DR0467) resulted in a significant delay in DSBR and in an increased sensitivity to &#x003b3;-irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), this bacterium might use peculiar molecular mechanisms in response to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Therefore, to verify the cellular and molecular functions of bacterial PolXs, it is necessary to study PolXs from other bacterial species. In particular, fundamental biochemical aspects of the 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity as well as the DNA polymerase activity should be addressed.</p><p>In this study, we purified PolX of <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> HB8 (ttPolX) and detected Mn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity in addition to Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent DNA/RNA polymerase activity. As a result of analysis of the two domains, POLXc and PHP, we ascribed the polymerase activity of ttPolX to the POLXc domain, the PHP domain having no intrinsic activity by itself under the conditions tested in this study. We showed that the two domains interacted with each other and that a mixture of the two domains exhibited 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity. Moreover, we identified nine catalytically important residues for 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity in the PHP domain. These findings provide an important insight for identification of the functional domains for the ttPolX activities and the properties of the conserved PHP domain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>The DNA-modifying enzymes, including restriction enzymes and LA Taq polymerase, were from Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan.

The gene fragment amplified by PCR using LA Taq polymerase was ligated into the pT7Blue T-vector (Novagen, WI, USA) by TA cloning and confirmed by sequencing. Using the NdeI and Bg1II sites, the fragment bearing the target gene was ligated into pET-11a (Novagen). <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> Rosetta(DE3) cells transformed with the resulting plasmid were cultured at 37&#x000b0;C to 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> cells/ml in 1.5 l LB medium containing 50 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> ampicillin.

Frozen cells expressing ttPolX were thawed, suspended in 20 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl and 100 mM KCl, pH 8.5, and then disrupted by sonication on ice. The lyzate was incubated at 60&#x000b0;C for 10 min and centrifuged (38 900<italic>g</italic>) for 30 min at 4&#x000b0;C. Ammonium sulfate (AS) was added to the resulting supernatant to a final concentration of 1.8 M. Then the solution was centrifuged (38 900<italic>g</italic> for 30 min at 4&#x000b0;C), and the resulting supernatant was applied to a TOYOPEARL Phenyl-650 M column (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) and proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 1.8-0 M AS. The fractions containing ttPolX were applied to a TOYOPEARL SuperQ-650 M column equilibrated with 20 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, pH 8.5, and proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0&#x02013;0.5 M NaCl. The fractions containing ttPolX were then applied to a hydroxyapatite column (Bio-Rad, CA, USA) equilibrated with 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and eluted with a linear gradient of 10&#x02013;500 mM sodium phosphate. The fractions containing the ttPolX were collected and concentrated with a Vivaspin concentrator (molecular weight 30 000 cut-off). The concentrated solution was applied to a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare UK Ltd) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl and 100 mM KCl, pH 8.5, and eluted with the same buffer using an &#x000c4;KTA explorer system. The fractions containing the ttPolX were concentrated and stored at 4&#x000b0;C. Frozen cells expressing the His-tagged ttPOLXc domain (ttPOLXc domain) were thawed, suspended in binding buffer (20 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, 500 mM NaCl and 5 mM imidazole, pH 7.9) and then disrupted by sonication on ice. The lyzate was centrifuged (38 900<italic>g</italic>) for 30 min at 4&#x000b0;C. The resulting supernatant was applied to a His&#x000b7;Bind Resin column (Novagen) equilibrated with binding buffer and proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 5&#x02013;1000 mM imidazole. The fractions containing the ttPOLXc domain were collected and AS was added to a final concentration of 0.8 M. Then the solution was applied to a TOYOPEARL Butyl column (Tosoh) equilibrated with 20 mM glycine and 0.8 M AS, pH 7.0, and eluted with a linear gradient of equilibration buffer to 20 mM glycine, pH 9.0. The fractions containing the ttPOLXc domain were collected, concentrated and applied to a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare). The purified ttPOLXc domain was stored in 20 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl and 100 mM KCl, pH 9.1, at 4&#x000b0;C. Purification of the His-tagged ttPHP domain (ttPHP domain) was performed in a similar way to for the ttPOLXc domain but with the use of a TOYOPEARL Phenyl column not a TOYOPEARL Butyl one, with equilibration buffer comprising 20 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl and 1 M AS, pH 7.4, and elution with a linear gradient of equilibration buffer to 20 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, pH 8.5. After each step, fractions were analyzed by SDS&#x02013;PAGE. The concentration of the purified protein was determined by using a molar extinction coefficient at 278 nm calculated according to the formula of Kuramitsu <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). The calculated molar extinction coefficients of ttPolX, ttPOLXc and ttPHP domains were 66 885, 29 190 and 47 880 M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively. We identified the purified protein as a ttPolX, and the ttPOLXc and ttPHP domains by means of peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) involving matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Briefly, we measured a mass spectrum of the peptide mixture resulting from the digestion of a protein by trypsin and compared it to the database containing the theoretical mass spectra of tryptic peptide mixtures from each protein encoded in <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> HB8 genome. By statistical comparison between experimentally determined and theoretical mass spectra, we identified each purified protein as a target protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Spectroscopic analysis</title><p>Circular dichroism (CD) spectra in the far-UV region (200&#x02013;250 nm) were obtained at 25&#x000b0;C with a Jasco spectropolarimeter, J-720W, using 1.5 &#x003bc;M (ttPolX) or 5 &#x003bc;M (ttPOLXc and ttPHP domains) enzyme in 50 mM potassium phosphate and 100 mM KCl, pH 7.0, at 25&#x000b0;C.

Under mild conditions, endoproteases are expected to preferentially hydrolyze a protein at the sites exposed to the solvent, which are often within interdomain linker regions. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, treatment of ttPolX (64 kDa) with trypsin or thermolysin mainly produced two fragments of 42 and 25 kDa. Peptide sequence analysis revealed that trypsin and thermolysin cleaved ttPolX at the same position. The N-terminal sequence of the 42 kDa fragment was MRNQELARIF, which agreed with N-terminal residues 1&#x02013;10 of ttPolX. The N-terminal sequence of the 25 kDa fragment was VAGGPSPEEA, which agreed with residues 380&#x02013;389. The calculated molecular masses of the fragments comprising residues of 1&#x02013;379 and 380&#x02013;575 were close to 42 and 25 kDa, respectively. In addition, there was further evidence to locate the position of the interdomain linker region. The purified ttPolX was degraded into two fragments of 44 kDa and 25 kDa after cold storage in 20 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl and 100 mM KCl, pH 9.1, at 4&#x000b0;C for half a year (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). The N-terminal sequences of these 44 and 25 kDa fragments were MRNQELA (residues 1&#x02013;7) and GGPSPEE (residues 382&#x02013;388), respectively. These results indicated that residues around 380 comprised the interdomain region of ttPolX. The notion that ttPolX is composed of mainly two structural domains is in agreement with the prediction based on sequence motif analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>The organization of structural domains of ttPolX.

However, the C-terminal fragment, corresponding to residues 380&#x02013;575, with or without a His-tag, was hardly overexpressed and could not be purified. Then, we compared the amino acid sequences of the C-terminal regions of ttPolX and <italic>E. coli</italic> YcdX. YcdX is a hypothetical protein comprising a PHP domain alone and its crystal structure has already been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Several charged residues conserved among PHP domain sequences are coordinated to bound metal ions and thus assumed to be catalytically important residues. Sequence alignment revealed that these residues are well conserved in the C-terminal regions of ttPolX and YcdX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). This alignment showed that the C-terminal domain obtained by limited proteolysis lacks the putative four residues of catalytic importance. Therefore, we reevaluated that the C-terminal domain comprises residues 339&#x02013;575 of ttPolX and constructed an expression plasmid containing this region. As a consequence, we succeeded in overexpression and purification of this fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). In this study, we used these N-terminal (1&#x02013;379) and C-terminal domains (339&#x02013;575) to identify functional domains and called them the ttPOLXc domain and ttPHP domain, respectively. The theoretical molecular weight, isoelectric point and Tm estimated from the CD spectrum of the ttPOLXc domain were 42 kDa, pH 8.4 and 70&#x000b0;C, respectively.

Such Mn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent nuclease activity prevented us from determining whether ttPolX had Mn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent DNA polymerase activity or not. After 240 min, the primer was extended up to the template length of a 40-mer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, lanes 1&#x02013;6). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B also shows that ttPolX was able to insert not only deoxyribonucleotide monophosphates (dNMPs) but also ribonucleotide monophosphates (NMPs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, lanes 7&#x02013;12).

Therefore, the intrinsic exonuclease activity of ttPolX was critically dependent on Mn<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>To estimate the ability of ttPolX to discriminate bases, we examined what kinds of nucleotide ttPolX can insert opposite the template base, dC. When one kind of canonical dNTP or NTP was added to the reaction mixture for the polymerase assay, ttPolX inserted only dGMP and GMP next to the 3&#x02032;-OH of the primer (21F), indicating that ttPolX preferentially inserted complementary nucleotides for canonical nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D, lanes 1&#x02013;10). We further examined the incorporation of guanine nucleotide derivatives opposite dC, XTP, dITP, ITP and 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine triphosphate (8-oxo-dGTP) being used as substrates. ttPolX inserted 8-oxo-dGMP, and slightly inserted dIMP and IMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D, lanes 11&#x02013;14). The observation that ttPolX inserted dGMP, GMP and 8-oxo-dGMP opposite dC indicated that ttPolX synthesizes DNA following the rule of Watson&#x02013;Crick base-pairing.</p><p>ttPolX was unable to insert nucleotides opposite noncanonical bases or RNA. We measured the translesion synthesis (TLS) activity of ttPolX using oligonucleotides 9P/12I21 (containing inosine) and 9P/12X21 (containing xanthine), and RT activity using 9P/21RNA. Because of the low Tm of the 9P primer (Tm = 30&#x000b0;C), we performed the polymerase assay using 9P/21F and 9P/12C21 as a control experiment for confirmation of primer annealing. When 9P/12C21 and dNTPs were used as substrates, extension of the primer was confirmed at 25, 30 and 37&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>E, lane 3), and the extension activity was higher at 37&#x000b0;C than at 25 or 30&#x000b0;C (data not shown). Therefore, we performed polymerase assay using 9P as the primer at 37&#x000b0;C. With the use of 9P/12I21, 9P/12X21 or 9P/21RNA, ttPolX inserted neither dNMPs nor NMPs opposite dI (12I21), dX (12X21) or A (21RNA) of the template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>E, lanes 5&#x02013;10). These results suggest that ttPolX exhibits no TLS or RT activity in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>. It should be noted that extension of the primer was hardly observed with 9P/21F and dNTPs as substrates at 25, 30 and 37&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>E, lane 2). The first inserted bases were dT and dG for 9P/21F and 9P/2C21, respectively. When dTTP was the only available nucleotide, ttPolX was able to insert dTMP even with 9P/21F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>E, lane 1).

It was confirmed by PMF analysis that all bands in the lane of the ttPHP domain contained the ttPHP domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A, lane 3). In the lane of the domain mixture, the bands with the same mobility as ttPolX were apparently increased compared with the lanes of the ttPOLXc and ttPHP domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A).

The ttPolX, ttPOLXc and ttPHP domains were eluted as single peaks at different elution volumes. When the ttPOLXc and ttPHP domains were mixed, a new peak appeared at 9.7 ml, which was different from those of the ttPOLXc and ttPHP domains. Concomitantly with the appearance of this peak, the peak of the ttPHP domain (11.3 ml) decreased. Since the peak of the ttPOLXc domain partially overlapped with that of 9.7 ml, we could not observe a clear peak of the ttPOLXc domain in the elution profile of the domain mixture. The elution volume of 9.7 ml (50 kDa) was very similar to that of ttPolX (9.8 ml, 48 kDa), suggesting that the peak eluted at 9.7 ml corresponded to a complex between the ttPOLXc and ttPHP domains in a 1:1 molar ratio. Based on the difference in the absorbance of the peaks corresponding to the ttPHP domains between the ttPHP domain alone and the domain mixture, &#x0223c;40% of the ttPHP domain was assumed to form the complex (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, we changed the ratio of domains for the domain mixture to 2:1 or 10:1 (Figure S1 and Table S1). When the domain ratio (ttPOLXc:ttPHP) was 10:1, most of the ttPHP domain appeared to form the complex with the ttPOLXc domain.

Therefore, Glu-493 was excluded from the mutagenesis analysis.

Since all mutants had weak or no 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity, we thought these mutants exhibit Mn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent DNA polymerase activity like the ttPOLXc domain. Under the polymerase assay conditions in the presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup>, however, Q342A, D349A, E413A and H531A exhibited stronger 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>C) than under the exonuclease assay conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A). H344A, H374A, H440A, H468A and D529A exhibited Mn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent DNA polymerase activity but no detectable Mn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity, therefore, these mutants hardly exhibited the exonuclease activity even in the presence of dNTPs and primer/template oligonucleotides.

Multiple sequence alignment of the POLXc domain regions of PolXs shows that three residues (B1&#x02013;B3) are partially conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>C). It was reported that Pol&#x003b2;, Pol&#x003bb;, Pol&#x003bc; and spPolIV had higher gap-filling activity against a substrate containing 5&#x02032;-phosphate group in the gap than a substrate without 5&#x02032;-phosphate group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) but scPolIV did not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). ttPolX had little or no ability to recognize a 5&#x02032;-phosphate group in the gap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Interestingly, ttPolX and scPolIV have Asp and Ser at the B2 position, respectively, whereas the other four PolXs have basic residues at the same position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>C). The distances between the oxygen atom of 5&#x02032;-phosphate and nitrogen atoms of B1&#x02013;B3 residues are as follows: Pol&#x003b2;, 2.73 (Lys-35), 2.60 (Lys-68) and 4.20 &#x000c5; (Lys-72); Pol&#x003bb;, 2.95 (Arg-275), 2.84 (Arg-308) and 3.43 &#x000c5; (Lys-312); Pol&#x003bc;, 3.65 (Arg-175) and 2.77 &#x000c5; (His-208). Since B2 is the closest residue to the 5&#x02032;-phosphate group in the three crystal structures, B2 is considered to be the critical residue for recognition of the 5&#x02032;-phosphate group. Therefore, these results suggest that it is due to the lack of a basic residue at the B2 position that ttPolX and scPolIV cannot recognize a 5&#x02032;-phosphate group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>C).</p><p>As seen in the assay of single nucleotide insertion, ttPolX inserted dGMP, GMP and 8-oxo-dGMP and slightly inserted dIMP and IMP opposite dC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D). Such an ability of ttPolX to discriminate base-pairing is similar to those of Pol&#x003b2;, Pol&#x003bb; and Pol&#x003bc; of the mammalian PolXs on single nucleotide insertion when the frameshift DNA synthesis is not taken into consideration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40 B41 B42">40&#x02013;42</xref>). ttPolX exhibited no detectable TLS against xanthine or inosine, or RT activity in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>E). Note that ttPolX exhibited no 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity in these assays because it exhibited no exonuclease activity with Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Several PolXs such as Pol&#x003bb; and Pol&#x003bc; are called translesion or error-prone DNA polymerases because they insert incorrect bases including damaged ones or carrying out TLS against a damaged base or a mismatched base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). However, ttPolX is unlikely to be a translesion DNA polymerase.</p><p>The RNA polymerase activity of ttPolX may help to repair DNA. ttPolX was able to insert NMPs opposite a DNA template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). Some PolXs such as Pol&#x003b2; and Pol&#x003bc; are also capable of incorporating NMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). It was reported that the intracellular NTPs concentration was much higher than that of dNTPs in human cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>) and in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). It is perhaps an advantage for repairing DNA that ttPolX can use NTPs, which exist at high concentrations in the cell, especially when the intracellular dNTP concentration is low. The nucleotide concentration is known to decrease in the stationary phase, but even in such a phase, the NTP concentration is still higher than that of dNTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> HB8 has a junction ribonuclease, which recognizes the RNA&#x02013;DNA junction of an RNA&#x02013;DNA/DNA heteroduplex and cleaves it leaving a mono-ribonucleotide at the 5&#x02032; terminus of the RNA&#x02013;DNA junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). Incorporated NMP in DNA could serve as a &#x02018;flag waver&#x02019; and be recognized by enzymes, such as a junction ribonuclease and induce an additional DNA repair system or DNA damage checkpoint pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).</p><p>Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that Gln-342, His-344, Asp-349, His-374, Glu-413, His-440, His-468, Asp-529 and His-531 in ttPolX are important residues for the 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). Among these residues, His-344, His-374, His-468 and Asp-529 are essential for the activity. In the YcdX crystal structure, the corresponding residues, His-9, His-40, His-131 and Asp-192 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), are coordinated to bound Zn 2, Zn 1, Zn 3 and Zn 2 in a trinuclear zinc cluster, respectively. Thus, ttPolX may have three metal ions, which are equally important for catalysis, in the active site of the PHP domain. It is possible to suppose that the mechanism underlying the 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity is similar to that of endonuclease IV, a DNA repair enzyme which has a TIM barrel fold, similar to that of YcdX and utilizes a three metal ion catalytic mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). It should be mentioned here that dNTPs promoted the 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity of several mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>C and D). Assuming that dNTPs bind to the POLXc domain, it is possible that the observed promotion was triggered by a conformational change of the ttPOLXc domain. If the ttPOLXc domain is involved in binding to ssDNA (see below), binding of dNTP might increase the affinity to ssDNA, leading to promotion of the exonuclease activity. It should be mentioned, however, that dNTPs did not significantly stimulate the exonuclease activity of ttPolX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C). Alternatively, a conformational change of the ttPHP domain might be caused through the interaction with the ttPOLXc domain (see below).</p></sec><sec><title>ttPolX mainly consists of POLXc and PHP domains</title><p>Many bacterial PolXs including ttPolX have been predicted to consist of mainly two domains, POLXc and PHP domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The POLXc domain is a polymerase domain, whereas the PHP domain is predicted to be a phosphoesterase domain. The PHP domain is associated with other domains, such as the polymerase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) or exists as a stand-alone protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). We could identify ttPOLXc and ttPHP domains in ttPolX experimentally and purify them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1 F2 F3">Figures 1&#x02013;3</xref>).</p><p>Although the ttPOLXc domain inserted dGMP, GMP, dIMP, IMP and 8-oxo-dGMP opposite dC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C), the incorporation rate of damaged bases with the ttPOLXc domain was higher than that in the case of ttPolX. This enhancement of the rate cannot be explained only by the higher polymerase activity than that of ttPolX. Moreover, the ttPOLXc domain differed from ttPolX in that this domain exhibited TLS activity opposite dI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D). It is probable that the ttPHP domain represses the incorporation of NTPs, especially damaged bases, directly or indirectly. The ttPHP domain may improve the stringency of base paring.</p><p>When the ttPOLXc and ttPHP domains were mixed, the domain mixture showed both DNA polymerase and 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activities. The metal ion selectivity of these activities was the same as that of ttPolX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). The higher 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity of the domain mixture as to ssDNA than to dsDNA was also the same as that of ttPolX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). These results suggest the domains formed a complex which has the same properties as ttPolX. The reason why the 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity of the domain mixture was lower than that of ttPolX is probably that not all the ttPOLXc and ttPHP domains formed the complex. This is supported by the results of native PAGE and size exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>We detected an interaction between the ttPOLXc and ttPHP domains. On the native PAGE gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A), the domain mixture showed a smear band exhibiting a similar mobility to ttPolX. This result suggests the two domains formed a complex with a similar surface charge and/or a similar overall shape to ttPolX. The smear band of ttPolX may be due to a nonuniform distribution of the surface charge or structural fluctuation of the ttPolX. The appearance of many bands of the ttPHP domain indicates this domain existed in several different states. However, size exclusion chromatography revealed that the ttPHP domain existed in a monomeric state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). Therefore, the observed multiple bands of the ttPHP domain may not mean different assembly states of the ttPHP domain. A further experiment on the domain interaction involving size exclusion chromatography suggested that the ttPOLXc domain bound to the ttPHP domain in the ratio of 1:1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Since it is considered that the POLXc and PHP domains are linked through an interdomain linker, the observed interaction between the separate domains is assumed to occur also between the domains in the ttPolX molecule. It was reported that the N-terminal PHP domain of the &#x003b1;-subunit of <italic>E. coli</italic> PolIII binds to the &#x003b5;-proofreading subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). This raises the possibility that the PHP domain is a platform enabling coordination of proofreading and polymerase activities during chromosomal replication. There are two &#x003b5;-subunits in <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> HB8 cells, TTHA0574 (probable PolIII &#x003b5;-subunit) and TTHA0813 (PolIII &#x003b5;-chain-like protein). These proteins exhibit 33 and 31% amino acid identity to the &#x003b5;-subunit of the <italic>E. coli</italic> PolIII, respectively. ttPolX may be able to bind to these proteins through the ttPHP domain, implying that ttPolX may be associated with a DNA &#x02018;replisome&#x02019; or &#x02018;repairsome&#x02019;.</p><p>In the presence of dNTPs, the complex of domains was slightly stabilized, and 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity was significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>C). Since dNTP is a substrate for DNA polymerases, conformation of the ttPOLXc domain may change on the binding dNTPs to a form in which the ttPOLXc domain can interact with the ttPHP domain more strongly. The addition of dNTPs increased the complex of the domains by 10% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), whereas it increased the catalytic efficiency of the 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity 4-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C). Since the size exclusion chromatography was performed in the absence of DNA, the binding of both DNA and dNTPs probably stabilized the domain complex much more than the binding of dNTPs alone. The crystal structure of the complex of Pol&#x003b2; with DNA revealed that in subdomains of the POLXc domain the conformational change induced by binding of DNA occurs in a distinct region from that induced by binding of dNTPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). ttPolX did not show an increase in the 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity on the addition of dNTPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C). Since the POLXc and PHP domains are close to each other in the ttPolX molecule, the addition of dNTPs may not stabilize the domain interaction further.</p><p>The ttPOLXc domain also exhibited both ssDNA- and dsDNA-binding abilities by itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>), and showed a similar DNA-binding manner to that of ttPolX (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Analysis of the binding curve suggested that more than two molecules of the ttPOLXc domain bound to a 40-mer DNA with or without a 1-nt gap, which is similar to the result for ttPolX (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). These results indicate that the ttPOLXc domain in ttPolX mainly contributes to the binding to DNA. Indeed, the subdomains, which exhibit binding activity as to ssDNA or dsDNA, both belong to the POLXc domain in Pol&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). However, the ttPOLXc domain exhibited lower affinity (higher <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub><sup>app</sup> values) to DNA than ttPolX. The ttPHP domain may stabilize the ttPolX&#x02013;DNA complex without affecting the DNA-binding manner, although the ttPHP domain has no DNA-binding ability. The contribution of the ttPHP domain to the affinity to DNA is probably auxiliary.</p></sec><sec><title>The ttPHP domain is essential for 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity but has no intrinsic activity by itself</title><p>Our study demonstrated that the ttPHP domain was essential for the 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity of ttPolX. This is inconsistent with the results for drPolX, which showed that the POLXc domain had 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). The observation that the PHP domain had no intrinsic activity is common to both ttPolX and drPolX. However, the ttPOLXc domain showed no exonuclease activity. As the POLXc domain of drPolX is homologous to that of ttPolX (and other PolXs), it seems difficult to explain this discrepancy. The PHP domain is present in organisms ranging from archaea and bacteria to fungi. The conserved residues in the PHP family are similar to those in the metal-dependent amidohydrolase superfamily, which includes the TatD-related DNase and phosphotriesterase families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The enzymes belonging to this superfamily have a metal-binding site where a metal-activated water molecule acts as a nucleophile for hydrolysis of the substrate. Therefore, the PHP domain is also thought to be a phosphoesterase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Actually, histidinol phosphate phosphatase belonging to the PHP domain family possesses phosphatase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). We concluded that the ttPHP domain alone has no intrinsic 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity, but is required for the activity of ttPolX.</p><p>Three possible reasons why the ttPHP domain has no intrinsic exonuclease activity by itself are as follows: (i) The ttPHP domain has almost all the catalytic residues required for 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity but has no nuclease activity due to its inability to bind DNA. Alignment showed that the ttPHP domain in ttPolX has all putative catalytic residues, except for Gln-342, interacting with three zinc ions in the YcdX crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). Site-directed mutagenesis showed that all these residues are catalytically important for 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A). Therefore, it seems reasonable to speculate that the ttPHP domain has no 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity because it cannot gain access to DNA with any structures (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). As already described, the ttPOLXc domain possesses DNA-binding ability by itself. Furthermore, the tight interaction between the ttPOLXc and ttPHP domains in the domain mixture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>) suggests that the two domains also tightly interact with each other within the ttPolX molecule. If this is the case, it is probable that the ttPHP domain requires proper interaction with the ttPOLXc domain as a substrate-binding unit to express its exonuclease activity. Indeed, the &#x003b1;-subunit of <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> PolIII, having Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), contains a DNA-binding domain besides the PHP domain; (ii) the ttPOLXc domain has some of the catalytic residues required for 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity. The strong interaction of the ttPOLXc domain with the ttPHP domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>) raises the possibility that these domains interact with each other via a large interface area within ttPolX. If the active site of the ttPHP domain is located proximately to the ttPOLXc domain, some residues of the ttPOLXc domain may serve as catalytic residues. It should be noted, however, that the sequence of the POLXc domain contains no known nuclease motif; (iii) the ttPHP domain is converted into an active form through interaction with the ttPOLXc domain. If this is true, it seems reasonable that the ttPHP domain alone had no intrinsic activity. In the case of the &#x003b1;-subunit of <italic>E. coli</italic> PolIII, deletion of the N-terminal 60 residues of the PHP domain abolishes both &#x003b5;-binding and polymerase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). A proper interaction between the PHP and polymerase domains may be important for maintaining the active forms of both domains. Combinations of the above three reasons are also possible.</p><p>In conclusion, our attempt to identify the functional domains of ttPolX revealed that the ttPHP domain has no intrinsic activity by itself but can interact with the ttPOLXc domain, and exhibits the 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity. Our findings will provide an insight into the functions of bacterial conserved PolXs including a PHP domain.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>NOTE IN PROOF</title><p>Our results are supported by two articles published just after our work had been completed. Ba&#x000f1;os <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>) revealed that PolX from <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (PolXBs) has intrinsic 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity, specialized in resecting unannealed 3&#x02032;-termini, and the activity is resided in the PHP domain of PolXBs. Ba&#x000f1;os <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>) also showed that two evolutionary conserved residues located in the PHP domain are directly involved in 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity. PolXBs is also a DNA polymerase, preferentially acting on DNA structure containing gap (52).
