Topoisomerase IV versus gyrase and Gram-positive versus Gram-negative behavior was studied based on the different recognition of DNA sequences by topoisomerase&#x02013;quinolone complexes. A careful statistical analysis of preferred bases was performed on a large number (&#x0003e;400) of cleavage sites. We found discrete preferred sequences that were similar when using different enzymes (i.e. gyrase and topoisomerase IV) from the same bacterial source, but in part diverse when employing enzymes from different origins (i.e. <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>). Subsequent analysis on the wild-type and mutated consensus sequences showed that: (i) Gn/Cn-rich sequences at and around the cleavage site are hot spots for quinolone-mediated strand breaks, especially for <italic>E. coli</italic> topoisomerases: we elucidated positions required for quinolone and enzyme recognition; (ii) for <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> enzymes only, A and T at positions &#x02212;2 and +6 are discriminating cleavage determinants; (iii) symmetry of the target sequence is a key trait to promote cleavage and (iv) the consensus sequence adopts a heteronomous A/B conformation, which may trigger DNA processing by the enzyme&#x02013;drug complex.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Type II topoisomerases are ubiquitous ATP-dependent enzymes that catalyze the transport of one DNA segment through a transient double-stranded break in a second segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). Their role in the cell is to control the supercoiling of DNA and to untangle the catenanes that arise during replication or recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6 B7">4&#x02013;7</xref>). Bacteria express two type IIA topoisomerases, DNA gyrase (Gyr) and DNA topoisomerase IV (Topo IV) with distinct and unique functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Gyr introduces negative supercoils into DNA, maintaining bacterial chromosomes in an underwound state to promote compaction and unwinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). In contrast, Topo IV is an efficient decatenase, separating tangled daughter chromosomes following replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13">11&#x02013;13</xref>). Both Gyr and Topo IV are heterotetramers, comprising two subunits each of GyrA and GyrB, and ParC and ParE, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). The GyrA and ParC subunits are homologous in their N-terminal domain that carries the DNA breakage-reunion function, but diverge in their C-terminal regions that also contribute to DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). The GyrB and ParE proteins contain the ATPase site involved in energy transduction and are closely homologous, in both primary sequence and structure.</p><p>Transient double-stranded DNA breakage by Gyr and Topo IV proceeds via an enzyme&#x02013;DNA intermediate termed the &#x02018;cleavage complex&#x02019; involving a 4-bp staggered break and covalent attachment of GyrA or ParC subunits to each 5-prime (5&#x02032;) DNA-end through a phosphotyrosine linkage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Protein&#x02013;DNA linkage preserves the energy of the DNA phosphodiester bond and allows resealing of the DNA backbone by attack of the 3-prime (3&#x02032;) OH-ends of the broken DNA. The breakage-reunion equilibrium is overwhelmingly in favor of the intact nucleic acid chain to avoid fortuitous lethal events <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, the cleavage complex can be stabilized by drugs such as quinolones producing DNA breaks, which can be detected after enzyme denaturation with sodium dodecyl sulfate. Generally, DNA cleavage is sequence-selective and is characterized by covalent bonding of the nucleic acid to GyrA or ParC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14 B15 B16 B17 B18">14&#x02013;18</xref>). Identification of DNA breakage site specificity is important for the physiological functions of bacterial topoisomerases and for their roles as quinolone targets.</p><p>Cleavage determinants have been recently determined for Gyr and Topo IV from a Gram-positive bacterial species, <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, in the presence of various clinically relevant quinolones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). The cleavage consensus sequences were GN<sub>4</sub>G(G/c)(A/c)G*GNNCtTN (C/a) for Gyr and G(G/c)(A/t)a*GNNCt(T/a)N(C/a) for Topo IV (where the asterisk denotes the cleavage site, capital letter indicates preferred base, lower case letter denotes unfavored base and N indicates no base preference). Similar cleavage preferences were observed among the quinolones tested. Even though the analysis was extremely comprehensive, some aspects remain to be answered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>): (i) The consensus sequence obtained with both enzymes is strikingly symmetric: does this property derive from actual enzyme requirements or does it arise from asymmetric sites as a consequence of analyzing just one strand of the double helix? (ii) Base prevalence was analyzed independently at each position: we do not know yet if the full consensus sequence is required for efficient DNA cleavage or if only part of it is necessary. (iii) If the entire consensus sequence, which spans a 12-base-long DNA tract, is needed for efficient DNA processing, this relatively long DNA segment should be statistically represented. Statistical analysis would hence benefit from using a more assorted DNA template repertoire.</p><p>For Gram-negative bacteria, site-specific DNA breakage details are much less exhaustive. Even for <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> topoisomerases, the data are scattered and discordant; for Gyr the most extensive analysis to date involved only 19 sites induced in <italic>E. coli</italic> on plasmid pBR322 and generated a 20-bp consensus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20 B21 B22">20&#x02013;22</xref>); for Topo IV just one study has been performed, which mapped a weak 2-bp consensus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>This study aimed to address the following points: (i) investigation and comparison of the cleavage consensus sequence exhibited by topoisomerases IIA from Gram-positive (<italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>) and -negative species (<italic>E. coli</italic>) on a large selection of DNA templates; (ii) comparison of cleavage sites generated by Gyr and Topo IV enzymes; (iii) assessment of the minimal sequence requirements and (iv) symmetric/asymmetric properties for effective DNA recognition and scission by bacterial topoisomerases in the presence of quinolones.</p><p>We found discrete preferred sequences for each enzyme analyzed. In particular, consensus sequences were very similar when comparing different enzymes (i.e. Gyr and Topo IV) from the same bacterial source, but partly different using enzymes from diverse origins (i.e. <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>). The chemical nature of the fluoroquinolones used to stabilize the DNA/enzyme complex in each case did not play a significant role. We proved that symmetry was a crucial property of the recognized DNA sequence and that an extended G<sub>n</sub>/C<sub>n</sub>-rich sequence improved efficient DNA processing. Specific bases inside the 4-bp staggered break were required, possibly because of their interaction with quinolones, however, an important role in enzyme recognition was also played by bases outside the enzymatic cleavage site, Finally, we provided evidence that the peculiar consensus sequence suggested by our study adopts an unusual double-stranded DNA conformation which could trigger enzyme-DNA recognition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Chemicals and reagents</title><p>Ciprofloxacin and Gemifloxacin were provided by GlaxoSmithKline (Verona, Italy).

Position +4 also exhibited a consistent preference for C (6 out of 8 enzyme/drug/DNA strand combinations), but with a slightly lower statistical significance (1.5 &#x0003c; &#x02212;LogP &#x0003c; 2). Positions &#x02212;2/&#x02212;4 and +6/+8 indicated a very mild preference for G and C, respectively (0.5 &#x0003c; &#x02212;LogP &#x0003c; 1.5). No essential cleavage differences were found between ciprofloxacin and gemifloxacin. As for the two enzymes, the requirements for Topo IV appeared to be somewhat more stringent than for Gyr, especially for positions &#x02212;1 and +5. Positions outside the &#x02212;4/+8 interval did not show distinct preferences. Disfavored bases were much less regularly repeated: inside the 4-bp staggered break only position +2A showed an indication of non-preference (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>A thorough statistical analysis for the <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> enzymes has already been reported by Leo <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Nonetheless, we performed cleavage analysis on SV40 DNA substrate to: (i) compare results obtained with <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> enzymes using the same drugs and DNA template, (ii) compare results with the same enzymes on different DNA templates [i.e. SV40 and <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>)] and (iii) address the issue of consensus sequence symmetry by analyzing both cut DNA strands. Only one drug was tested with each enzyme (ciprofloxacin with Topo IV and gemifloxacin with Gyr) because it had already been shown that fluoroquinolone identity does not play a critical role in DNA recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). In accordance with the previous analysis (which used &#x02212;LogP &#x0003e; 3 and &#x02212;LogP &#x0003c; &#x02212;3 as significant), we found that highly preferred bases for both Topo IV and Gyr were &#x02212;2A and +6T; +1G and +4C, and &#x02212;1G (gyrase only) were also significantly represented. In addition, +3C and +5C were favored (at &#x02212;LogP &#x0003e; 2) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). No steady preference was observed for other positions, even though positions &#x02212;4, &#x02212;3 and +7, +8 showed a mild inclination for G and C, respectively (0.5 &#x0003c; &#x02212;LogP &#x0003c; 1.5).

On the opposite, the most preferred bases with <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> proteins were &#x02212;2A and +6T. Positions &#x02013;1/+5 were GGGCCC as with <italic>E. coli</italic> topoisomerases, but this preference was less statistically represented.

Further, based on the indication that symmetry afforded efficient DNA cleavage even at non-complementary sites, we wanted to verify to what extent this condition affected enzyme/drug activity on the nucleic acid.</p><p>To answer these questions, we focused on the <italic>E. coli</italic> enzymes and their preferred sequences: we cloned the &#x02212;1/+5 GGGCCC consensus sequence into a plasmid vector and subsequently amplified a 215-bp DNA fragment by PCR. Sequences upstream (&#x02212;8/&#x02212;2) and downstream (+6/+13) the consensus sequence were arbitrary chosen to be A/T rich (see Materials and Methods section).

The consensus sequence found in the present study was limited to positions between &#x02212;1 and +5, and the region just outside this interval (i.e. &#x02212;8/&#x02212;2 and +6/+13) was arbitrary chosen to be extremely A/T rich (14 out of 15 bases were A or T, see Materials and Methods section) in the DNA oligonucleotide used for the cleavage assay. We hypothesized that these flanking non-random regions could decrease the cleavage efficiency of the consensus sequence. In fact, our current statistical analysis on both <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> topoisomerases showed a preference for &#x02212;4G, &#x02212;3G, &#x02212;2A/G, +6T/C, +7C, +8C, which was not considered before because at a low statistical significance (i.e. &#x02212;LogP &#x0003c; 2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B and C).

In particular, the &#x02212;1G cut site was the most intense with both fluoroquinolones in the case of the wild-type consensus-derived oligo. In the mutated sequences, gemifloxacin-induced cleavage was more prominent with GGAGGT and GGAGTG sequences, while ciprofloxacin was more efficient with the GGATGG oligo (compare lanes 3 and 4, all oligo, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). Gemifloxacin induced an extra band at position +2 in oligos GGAGGG, GGAGGT and GGATGG, respectively (lanes 4, * symbol, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). This cleavage site was particularly intense in the case of oligo GGAGGT, where T, instead of G, is present at position +2. An additional band was produced by gemifloxacin at position +5T in oligos GGAGGT and GGATGG, respectively (lanes 4, &#x000f7; symbol, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A).

As observed for Topo IV, the relative intensity of strand scission at position &#x02212;1 was higher in the wild-type oligo (GGAGGG) compared to the mutant sequences (lanes 3 and 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). Ciprofloxacin-induced cleavage was stronger than gemifloxacin-mediated breakage in the case of oligo GGAGGG and GGATGG, while the reverse was found for oligos GGAGGT and GGAGTG. Additional bands were found both inside (downstream position &#x02212;1) and outside the consensus sequence (both upstream and downstream). The wild-type oligo showed fewer cleavage bands inside the consensus sequence.</p></sec><sec><title>The GGAGGGCCCTCC sequence adopts an A-like guanine&#x02013;guanine stacking in solution</title><p>Next, we wondered if the above described peculiar consensus sequence could adopt a definite structure in solution. It is reported that the DNA octamer GGGGCCCC forms in aqueous solution a stable heteronomous DNA duplex where guanine&#x02013;guanine stacking is A-like, whereas cytosine bases stack in a B-like fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). To examine the actual conformation of the consensus sequence primarily recognized by <italic>E. coli</italic> Topo IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A), we compared the CD spectrum of our sample1 oligo (GGAGGGCCCTCC), with that of the reference oligo (GGGGCCCC) and of a control DNA (GCGACGCGTCGC), which shares the same base composition of the sample1 oligo, but displays a different sequence. In addition, sample1 oligo was compared to sample2 oligo (ATAGGGCCCTAT) where flanking regions were A/T rich such as those used in the cleavage assay of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>. Under native conditions (<italic>T</italic> well below <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub>, i.e. 4&#x000b0;C), the spectrum of the reference oligo exhibited two strong overlapping positive bands at 285 nm and at 260 nm, and a negative peak at 237 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). The CD of our sample1 oligo was essentially superimposable to the reference oligo, showing the same bands with very similar intensities. Conversely, the control and sample2 oligos displayed substantially different CD patterns with one positive band at 285 or 265 nm, respectively, and a negative peak at 255 or 240 nm, respectively. We conclude that the native consensus sequence adopts in solution a peculiar conformation, which closely resembles the heteronomous conformation of the reference oligo [i.e. a combination of B-type and A-type base stacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>)], whereas the control sequence is organized in a more classical B form. Sample2 oligo, on turn, exhibits a spectrum which reflects a lower propensity to adopt the heteronomous conformation thus favoring a B form. This is in agreement with the shift of the CD cross-over towards longer wavelength as an indication of lower A-like character and with the crystal structure of the dodecamer duplex CATGGGCCCATG showing a structural continuum along the transition between A- and B-DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>CD spectra of sample1 oligo GGAGGGCCCTCC, sample2 oligo ATAGGGCCCTAT, reference oligo GGGGCCCCC and control oligo GCGACGCGTCGC measured at 4&#x000b0;C.

However, it has also been reported that topo IV and/or gyrase can be alternative intracellular target depending on quinolone structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>).</p><p>To investigate whether this double biased behavior (Gyr versus Topo IV and <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> versus <italic>E. coli</italic>) could arise from a distinctively specific recognition of DNA sequences by topoisomerases (&#x000b1; quinolones), we comprehensively studied and compared the DNA sequence specificity of Gyr and Topo IV from <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> in the presence of clinically used fluoroquinolones. In view of the key role played by these proteins, the resulting information would be important from both physiological and therapeutic standpoints.</p><p>A consensus sequence for the two topoisomerases from <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> has been recently reported using <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> ParE-ParC gene sequences as DNA templates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Here, to impartially compare DNA sequence specificity of enzymes from different species, we used non-specific DNA fragments derived from the SV40 genome.</p><p>By statistical analysis of preferred bases around the cleavage position (&#x02212;20/+20) of a large set of sites (over 400), we found that the GGGCCC sequence at positions &#x02212;1/+5 was favored with both Gyr and Topo IV from the two bacterial species considered. However, this preference was much more prominent for the <italic>E. coli</italic> enzymes. Conversely, positions &#x02212;2 and +6 were non-randomly selected only with <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> enzymes, which revealed a striking preference for A and T, respectively.</p><p>Overall, statistical analysis of consensus sequences reported no major differences between Topo IV and Gyr, although the requirements for the latter appear to be less stringent in the Gram-negative species. By contrast, discrimination of Gram-positive and -negative enzymes apparently resides on different DNA sequence requirements for efficient cleavage, in particular at positions &#x02212;2 and +6.</p><p>The high structural similarity of the N-terminal binding regions of ParC and GyrA from both <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>) may explain the comparable DNA recognition properties shared by the tested topoisomerases in the presence of the two quinolone drugs. As an added proof, the aminoacidic residues reported to be essential in the protein catalytic activity and implicated in quinolone resistance, hence, likely involved in the concurrent binding of topoisomerases to DNA and quinolones in the cleavage complex (i.e. Arg32, Arg47, His78, His80, Ser83 and Asp/Glu87 in <italic>E. coli</italic> GyrA and corresponding positions in the other topoisomerases) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38 B39 B40">38&#x02013;40</xref>), are identical in the four tested enzymes. It is intriguing to note that the only consistent difference in the aminoacidic sequence between <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. pnemoniae</italic> N-terminal region of GyrA/ParC subunits is at position 84 of <italic>E. coli</italic> GyrA (and corresponding positions in the other enzymes), where an Ala is substituted with a Ser in the Gram-positive proteins. Since position 84 is just adjacent to other positions involved in enzyme/quinolone/DNA interactions (see above), it could be speculated that the introduction of an H-bond donor site (i.e. Ser) modulates <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> topoisomerases DNA recognition properties, driving sequence specificity towards A/T at positions &#x02212;2/+6.</p><p>The fluoroquinolone chemical nature did not play a major role in determining the consensus sequence, at least for the tested compounds. However, it influenced the extent of cleavage stimulation. In particular, sites number was similar between ciprofloxacin and gemifloxacin with <italic>E. coli</italic> enzymes, while it was clearly in favor of gemifloxacin with <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> proteins. These results are in line with the reported activity of the two drugs on bacterial species: gemifloxacin is more effective than ciprofloxacin on <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> strains, while the activity of the two drugs is similar on <italic>E. coli</italic> bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Therefore, our data indicate that, from a pharmacodynamic point of view, the biased activity of the two drugs may rest on their different ability to poison the molecular target, rather than on recognizing a different sequence determinant. This implies that DNA recognition is initially driven by the topoisomerases and then modulated by quinolone stabilization of the cleavage complex.</p><p>Our data, performed on SV40 DNA template, differ slightly from those obtained previously with the <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> genome DNA template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). In the first report, the consensus found between positions &#x02212;4 and +8 were GGAN*GNNCNTNC and GGAG*GNNCNTNC, asterisk at the cleavage site, for Topo IV and Gyr, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), compared to NNAN*GNCCCTNN and NNAG*GNCCCTNN, respectively, in the present work. Noteworthy, several preferences match exactly, whereas others are not observed in one case or the other. This difference depends in part on the level of statistical stringency considered: on lowering the &#x02212;LogP threshold, +2G and +3C bases become preferred in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) and &#x02212;4G, &#x02212;3G and +8C register as slightly preferred with both Gram-positive and -negative enzymes in this work (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B and C). The combination of different DNA template, enzyme activity and drug concentration could be responsible for the diverse statistical relevance found. In fact, DNA traits consisting of two or more bases can be differently represented within nucleic acids from various origins. For instance, even though SV40 and ParC/ParE DNAs share similar base composition (G/C percentage is 40% in SV40 and 42% in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>), GGG and CCC sequences are 27% more frequent in the SV40 genome than in the ParC/ParE genes.</p><p>Since each position is independently taken into account during statistical analysis, we next analyzed <italic>E. coli</italic> topoisomerase&#x02013;quinolone cleavage efficiency on the full DNA consensus sequences found in this work or obtained by combining data from the present and previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Further, mutations at selected preferred positions were also introduced to determine the contribution of each site on the cleavage complex DNA processivity.</p><p>We found that the &#x02212;2/+6 consensus sequence AGGGCCCT environed in G/C-, but not A/T-, rich flanking regions, is able to induce highly efficient DNA cleavage. In fact, the 8-nt long tract AGGGCCCT at positions &#x02212;2/+6, environed in an A/T-rich region, was able to promote only weak DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). In this instance, cleavage intensity was similar among the two enzymes and the two quinolones employed. In contrast, addition of G and C bases at positions &#x02212;4, &#x02212;3 and +7, +8, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), significantly augmented cleavage, especially with Topo IV (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A and B). The presence of the full consensus sequence was still required: in fact, modification of a single G nucleotide in the &#x02212;1/+5 region generally decreased cleavage, in the same manner for Topo IV and Gyr. In addition, whereas the intensity of cleavage with the wild-type sequence was similar between ciprofloxacin and gemifloxacin, differences in cutting efficiency were observed at the mutated sequences with the two fluoroquinolones. In particular, positions inside the 4-base staggered break seem primarily implicated in quinolone binding. In fact, changes at positions +2, +3 and +1, +4 more dramatically impaired ciprofloxacin activity, whereas gemifloxacin was more severely affected by nucleotide changes at +1 and +5. Therefore, gemifloxacin requirements seem to be somewhat less stringent than those of ciprofloxacin when modifying the quinolone-interacting region of the consensus sequence. These results are also supported by reports showing an increased binding ability of quinolones to G<sub>n</sub>/C<sub>n</sub>-rich sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>) and site-specific analysis of <italic>E. coli</italic> Gyr with oxolinic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>Our data further suggest that positions &#x02212;4, &#x02212;3 and +7, +8, which must be G/C rich, are likely required for efficient DNA recognition and binding by the topoisomerases, since these positions significantly affect cutting intensity depending upon the enzyme, but not upon the drug. The consensus found is particularly effective for Topo IV, less so in the case of gyrase, for which additional features outside positions &#x02212;4/+8 might play a key role in specificity. Positions &#x02212;2 and +6 are also probably involved in enzyme recognition. In particular, they help discriminate between proteins from different bacterial sources (e.g. <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> versus <italic>E. coli</italic>), but not between the two topoisomerases (see above).</p><p>Symmetry is an additional feature required for efficient DNA processing, as proven by analyzing cleavage sites on the two complementary DNA strands and by testing symmetric and non-symmetric consensus sequences. This property reasonably arises from the dyadic symmetry of topoisomerase complexes.</p><p>The consensus primary sequence found is very peculiar. It is known that selected nucleic acid sequences can confer unusual 3D characteristics to the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). Indeed, it is reported that Gn/Cn DNA sequences can be crystallized in A/B intermediate conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). More interestingly, the GGGGCCCC sequence adopts a partial A-like structure in aqueous solution. In particular, G bases are stacked in a DNA-A form, whereas the Cs maintain a canonical B-form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Surprisingly, in the reverse sequence CCCCGGGG, both C and G bases fold in a different A-like and less stable fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). By circular dichroism analysis, we proved that our consensus sequence GGAGGGCCCTCC folds as the reference GGGGCCCC DNA. A partial A-like conformation is likely to protect G/C-rich regions, which are involved in regulating transcription of many human genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>), against mutations: in fact these are mutated much less than A/T-rich regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). According to our findings, this particular A/B DNA conformation could also prompt DNA recognition by topoisomerases. It should be noted that the reverse sequence CCCCGGGG, which folds up in a full-A-like structure and hence presents a different environment for enzyme recognition, was not selected by statistical analysis of cleavage sites. Topoisomerases would likely recognize &#x02212;4, &#x02212;3, &#x02212;2 and +6, +7, +8 nt, permitting cleavage at &#x02212;1 and +5 positions. Quinolones would then be able to bind between the two loose ends with subsequent inhibition of the enzymatic DNA resealing.</p><p>Finally, our DNA specificity results using the test quinolones suggest that the therapeutic efficacy against a bacterial species should be related to the frequency of occurrence of G<sub>n</sub>/C<sub>n</sub>-rich sequences in the bacterial genome and to the efficiency of cleavage complex stabilization by the drug. Clearly, the observed clinical outcome is also expected to depend upon the ADME properties of each individual quinolone.</p><p>In summary, this work provided evidence that (i) a symmetric G<sub>n</sub>/C<sub>n</sub> consensus sequence at positions &#x02212;1/+5 allows efficient bacterial topoisomerase-mediated DNA processing; (ii) G/C over A/T-rich flanking sequences (positions &#x02212;4, &#x02212;3 and +7, +8) are highly preferred in protein DNA processing, which is particularly efficient for Topo IV; (iii) positions &#x02212;2 and +6 interact with the enzyme and distinguish <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> from <italic>E. coli</italic> topoisomerases; (iv) positions &#x02212;1 to +5 participate to drug activity and may modulate cleavage intensity based on the quinolone chemical nature; (v) symmetry of the target sequence is a key trait to promote effective cleavage and (vi) the consensus sequence adopts a heteronomous A/B conformation, which may trigger efficient DNA processing by enzyme/drug complex.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was carried out with the financial support of the Italian Ministry for University and Research (MIUR), Rome, Italy and EEC grant #503466.
