Invasion of melanoma cells into the dermis and subsequent metastatic dissemination are hallmarks of melanoma progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). One of the earliest steps in melanoma development includes disruption of E-cadherin&#x02013;mediated adhesive interactions between melanocytes and keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). This disruption is accompanied by increased expression of N-cadherin, which facilitates cluster formation and invasion of melanoma into the dermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>).</p><p>The Snail1 transcription factors trigger epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and have been shown to be important markers for tumor progression and invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Although EMT was originally defined as the formation of mesenchymal cells with migratory and invasive properties from epithelia during development, there is also evidence that EMT plays a crucial role in tumor progression and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Snail1-induced EMT has been mainly attributed to the direct repression of E-cadherin transcription (for review see references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>]). We have previously shown that Snail1 is highly up-regulated in melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). The signals responsible for Snail1 up-regulation in melanoma are unclear, although several mechanisms for the regulation of Snail1 expression in other cell types have been put forward. For example, in epithelial cells, Snail1 expression can be induced by TGF-&#x003b2;, oncogenic Ras, or integrin-linked kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>).</p><p>CYLD was originally identified as a tumor suppressor that is mutated in familial cylindromatosis (Brooke-Spiegler syndrome), an autosomal-dominant predisposition to multiple tumors of skin appendages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). CYLD contains a C-terminal ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase domain, which enables it to act as a deubiquitination enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). CYLD was shown to remove ubiquitin chains from target proteins such as BCL-3, resulting in inhibition of nuclear translocation of BCL-3, association with NF-&#x003ba;B p50 and p52, and cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we identified a signaling pathway that promotes mitogenic and metastatic properties of melanoma by down-regulation of CYLD through the action of Snail1, whose expression is induced by BRAF-mediated activation of extracellular signal&#x02013;regulated kinase (ERK). Snail1-dependent inhibition of CYLD transcription results in stimulation of Cyclin D1 and N-cadherin expression in melanoma cells, leading to enhanced proliferation, migration, and invasiveness of melanoma cells in vitro, as well as tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Importantly, in melanoma tissue, Snail1 induction correlated with the loss of CYLD expression, and both were linked to Clark level (tumor invasiveness) and tumor thickness. Increased Snail1 expression and reduced CLYD levels inversely correlated with progression-free and overall survival of patients. Together, these data suggest that Snail1-mediated suppression of CYLD plays a key role in melanoma malignancy and that CLYD represents a prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target of this highly aggressive tumor.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>CYLD expression is down-regulated in melanoma</title><p>To get a first insight into the role of CYLD in malignant melanoma, we evaluated-CYLD expression in six different human melanoma cell lines, as well as in freshly isolated human melanoma cells. We found strong reduction of CYLD mRNA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>) and protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>) levels when compared with normal human epidermal melanocytes (NHEMs). Also, in situ, primary melanomas and melanoma metastases displayed strongly down-regulated or absent CYLD mRNA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>) and protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). In contrast, melanocytes in normal epidermis displayed high CYLD expression, as confirmed by costaining for tyrosinase and CYLD and quantification of costaining (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, E and F</xref>). Because mutations and promoter methylation of the <italic>CYLD</italic> gene could be excluded (unpublished data), we concluded that down-regulation of CYLD likely occurs at the transcriptional level.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Reduced CYLD expression in malignant melanoma.</bold> Quantitative RT-PCR (A) and immunoblot analysis (B) showing CYLD expression in six human melanoma cell lines (Mel Im, Mel Juso, Mel Ei, Mel Ju, Mel Ho, and Mel Wei) and freshly isolated primary melanoma cells from two donors (MM1 and MM2) compared with NHEMs. (C) CYLD mRNA expression in NHEMs, primary melanomas (PT), and metastases of lymph nodes (LN), sentinel lymph nodes (SLN), and two distant metastases of malignant melanomas (M).

This highlights the strong need for rational, mechanism-based therapies. One approach with great potential for achieving this goal is the identification and targeting of tumor-activated signaling cascades.</p><p>Our study uncovers a new key signaling pathway that is responsible for progression of malignant melanoma and is related to poor prognosis in melanoma patients. This novel molecular mechanism is based on the suppression of CYLD expression by the transcriptional regulator, Snail1, driving melanoma cells to an aggressive phenotype (depicted as a model in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig8"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p><bold>Model of the regulation of Snail and how Snail affects proliferation, as well as migration and invasion, via suppression of CYLD.</bold> In melanoma cells, constitutively high ERK-activity (potentially caused by B-Raf mutations) leads to high Snail1 expression, which in turn causes strong suppression of CYLD. The repression of CYLD allows nuclear translocation of Bcl-3 and recruitment to the NF-&#x003ba;B binding sites of the Cyclin D1 and N-cadherin promoter. Activation of Cyclin D1 and N-cadherin leads to an increased proliferation rate of melanoma cells and contributes to progression and metastasis of tumors.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jem2060221f08"></graphic></fig><p>Notably, our findings reveal a thus far unknown link between Snail1, which plays an important role in EMT and favors tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>), and CYLD. CYLD was originally identified as a tumor suppressor that is mutated in familial cylindromatosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). In melanoma, we did not find mutations of the <italic>CYLD</italic> gene (unpublished data), but we identified direct recruitment of the transcriptional repressor Snail1 to the <italic>CYLD</italic> promoter as a molecular mechanism leading to strongly reduced or even absent CYLD expression in all melanoma tissues and cell lines tested. In accordance, melanoma cells in which Snail1 expression was abrogated showed a strong up-regulation of CYLD and reduced growth in vitro and in vivo.</p><p>Interestingly, we found that ERK activation is the major upstream signaling mechanism responsible for high constitutive Snail1 expression in malignant melanoma cells, as well as for induced Snail1 expression in normal melanocytes. In melanoma cells, the Ras&#x02013;Raf&#x02013;MEK&#x02013;ERK (MAPK) signaling pathway is constitutively active and exerts key functions in melanoma development and progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). Activating mutations in BRAF or N-ras have been identified in most cutaneous melanomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>), corresponding to our finding that BRAF mutations were present in all melanoma cell lines tested, but not in primary human melanocytes.</p><p>In contrast to melanoma cells, melanocytes express CYLD at a high level, exhibit low ERK activity, and lack Snail1 expression. Introducing mutated BRAF into primary melanocytes resulted in increased Snail1 expression and reduced CYLD expression. Our findings indicate that after malignant transformation, constitutively high ERK activity and Snail1 expression allow melanoma cells to permanently exploit transcriptional repression of CYLD and activation of BCL-3 to acquire a more aggressive phenotype.</p><p>BRAF V600E mutation has been shown to induce NF-&#x003ba;B activity in human melanoma cell lines via regulation of &#x003b2;-Trcp expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>), and high NF-&#x003ba;B activity resulting in increased tumorigenesis has been reported in malignant melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). Here, we provide a new mechanism for how mutational activation of B-RAF contributes to both constitutive NF-&#x003ba;B and BCL-3 activity via repression of CYLD.</p><p>Loss of CYLD promoted BCL-3 recruitment to the <italic>Cyclin D1</italic> promoter. This mechanism plays an important role for the growth of melanoma cells because stable expression of CYLD in melanoma cells reduced tumor growth and metastasis in vivo in a xenograft model. More importantly, we showed for the first time that BCL-3 is recruited to the <italic>N-cadherin</italic> promoter to activate transcription. Thereby, our study provides a novel paradigm of how CYLD affects N-cadherin expression, which has been shown to correlate with tumor cell motility and invasiveness in several malignancies including melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). Re-expression of CYLD in melanoma cells with constitutively high Snail1 levels inhibited N-cadherin expression, leading to a reduced migratory and invasive potential in vitro and less pulmonary metastasis in a murine in vivo model. Conversely, depletion of CYLD in Snail1-deficient melanoma cells resulted in highly aggressive melanoma cells with strong proliferative and invasive potential. In summary, these findings clearly demonstrate that suppression of CYLD is a central mechanism in how Snail1 facilitates both growth and metastasis in malignant melanoma. Whether this mechanism operates in other types of cancer has to be tested.</p><p>Importantly, the clinical findings further support an important role of the Snail1 CYLD pathway in tumor progression and survival in melanoma patients. Snail1 expression shows significant correlation with loss of CYLD and signs of tumor progression like tumor thickness. Even more important, both Snail1 and CYLD expression in primary tumors directly correlate with progression-free survival and overall survival of the patients.</p><p>Hence, elevated expression of Snail1 and reduced expression of CYLD in primary melanoma hint to a high metastatic potential in vivo. Although CYLD levels in primary tumor and melanoma might vary, our findings indicate the intriguing possibility that analysis of CYLD and Snail1 protein expression in the primary tumor may be used as a predictive marker for survival of melanoma patients. Such prognostic risk assessment would have major clinical implications for the appropriate selection of treatment modalities and follow up protocols, or as stratification factor for adjuvant therapy.</p><p>Finally, our data also suggest a rationale for strategies to rescue CYLD expression in malignant melanoma as therapeutic approaches for this highly aggressive tumor.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Cells, cell culture, and mouse models.</title><p>The melanoma cell lines Mel Ei, Mel Wei, Mel Ho, and Mel Juso were derived from a primary cutaneous melanoma.
