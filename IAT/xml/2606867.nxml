However, costimulation blockade protocols fail in NOD mice. To investigate further the cellular and genetic control of costimulation blockade&#x02013;induced transplantation tolerance, we used NOD <italic>Idd</italic> congenic mice that have small introgressed regions of genetic intervals derived from diabetes-resistant C57 stocks. These mice exhibit varying degrees of protection from autoantibodies, insulitis, and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>). Using <italic>Idd</italic> congenic NOD mice, we have observed that islet allograft survival is improved by the addition of the diabetes-protective <italic>Idd3</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>).</p><p><italic>Idd3</italic> modulates infiltration of autoreactive lymphocytes into the islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>), and there is compelling evidence that <italic>Idd3</italic> is the interleukin (IL)-2 gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>). In vivo stimulated NOD T-cells produce twofold less IL-2 mRNA than cells from NOD congenic mice having protective alleles at <italic>Idd3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>). Neutralizing antibodies to IL-2 lead to accelerated disease in NOD mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>), and targeted genetic disruption of IL-2 accelerates type 1&#x02013;like autoimmune diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>). Treatment with exogenous IL-2 inhibits diabetes development in NOD mice and improves T regulatory (Treg) function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>). IL-2 is also known to have a nonredundant role in CD8 T-cell activation&#x02013;induced cell death via the CD95 (Fas) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>), is required for the development of self-tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>), and is essential for the induction of allograft tolerance by costimulation blockade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>). However, IL-2 is a double-edged sword, since administration of IL-2 in vivo can either enhance or depress a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we show that costimulation blockade fails to delete alloreactive CD8 T-cells in NOD mice. Genetic replacement of IL-2 in NOD.B6 <italic>Idd3</italic> mice enhances alloreactive CD8 T-cell deletion and improves islet allograft survival. Finally, we show that <italic>Idd3</italic> synergizes with genes within the <italic>Idd5</italic> interval, leading to permanent islet allograft survival in a majority of NOD.B6/B10 <italic>Idd3 Idd5</italic> mice treated with costimulation blockade.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>C3H/He (<italic>H2<sup>k</sup></italic>) mice were obtained from the National Cancer Institute (Frederick, MD), The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME), or Taconic Farms (Germantown, NY).

However, in those experiments, islet graft rejection could have resulted from islet autoimmunity or the failure to induce allograft tolerance. To investigate this, chemically diabetic NOD mice were transplanted with syngeneic NOD-<italic>scid</italic> islets. As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>), we observed through 150 days after islet transplantation that all mice (5/5) remained normoglycemic. Analysis of the islet-bearing kidney revealed an insulin-producing islet graft present at the time of necropsy with only a small amount of leukocytic infiltrate.

We now document that some but not all <italic>Idd</italic> resistance loci synergize with <italic>Idd3</italic> to enhance islet allograft survival. We further show that a major tolerance defect in NOD mice is the resistance of alloreactive CD8 T-cells to deletion by costimulation blockade, a defect that can be reversed by addition of the <italic>Idd3</italic> gene or by administration of exogenous IL-2.</p><p>Disease-resistant alleles at the <italic>Idd10 Idd18</italic> region provide moderate protection against diabetes (45&#x02013;55&#x00025;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>), and together, the <italic>Idd3 Idd10</italic> and <italic>Idd18</italic> protective alleles confer almost complete resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>). We hypothesized that NOD.B6 <italic>Idd10 Idd18</italic> mice and NOD.B6 <italic>Idd3 Idd10 Idd18</italic> mice would demonstrate a stepwise improvement in costimulation blockade&#x02013;induced islet allograft survival. Surprisingly, islet allograft survival in NOD.B6 <italic>Idd10 Idd18</italic> mice was not increased over that achieved in NOD mice and did not increase over that achieved with <italic>Idd3</italic> alone.</p><p>Genes located within the <italic>Idd10</italic> and <italic>Idd18</italic> intervals include <italic>Ptpn22</italic>, which is orthologous to <italic>PTPN22</italic>, a human gene that is associated with the development of diabetes and other autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>). The disease-associated allele of human <italic>PTPN22</italic> is a gain-of-function variant that in vitro suppresses TCR signaling in response to TCR/CD28 ligation to a greater extent than the more common allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>). The functional outcome of TCR signaling in the <italic>PTPN22</italic> gain-of-function variant reduces expression of IL-2. Studies that altered the allelic status of the <italic>Ptpn22</italic> region in NOD congenic mice have demonstrated that the B6-derived interval confers susceptibility to type 1&#x02013;like autoimmune diabetes (L.S.W., L.B.P., unpublished data), therefore providing a potential explanation for the inability of the B6-derived <italic>Idd10 Idd18</italic> region to increase islet allograft survival.</p><p>Given the surprising results seen with the NOD.B6 <italic>Idd3 Idd10 Idd18</italic> islet allograft studies, we next determined whether a synergistic effect could be found between <italic>Idd3</italic> and <italic>Idd5</italic>. NOD.B10 <italic>Idd5</italic> mice have a lower frequency of diabetes than NOD mice, and when combined with resistance alleles at <italic>Idd3</italic>, the frequency of spontaneous diabetes is &#x0003c;2&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>). Importantly, islet allograft survival in NOD.B6 <italic>Idd3 Idd5</italic> mice was increased to levels achieved in C57BL/6 mice.</p><p>The <italic>Idd5</italic> congenic strain used in our study contains at least three diabetes resistance genes, termed <italic>Idd5.1</italic>, <italic>Idd5.2</italic>, and <italic>Idd5.3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>). The <italic>Idd5.1</italic> gene is most likely a variant of <italic>Ctla4</italic>, with the diabetes-prone NOD allele producing less of the ligand-independent CTLA-4 (liCTLA-4) molecule than the resistant B10 allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>). CTLA-4 is critical for the induction of tolerance using costimulation blockade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>). <italic>Slc11a1</italic> (formerly known as <italic>Nramp1</italic>) is likely to be the causal <italic>Idd5.2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>). Interestingly, the B10 diabetes-resistant <italic>Nramp1</italic> allele encodes a nonfunctional protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>). However, <italic>Idd5.2/Nramp1</italic> is not required for the decreased diabetes frequency in NOD.B6 <italic>Idd3</italic> B10 <italic>Idd5</italic> mice, although the B10-derived <italic>Idd5.2</italic> region is required to maintain the reduced insulitis present in NOD.B6 <italic>Idd3</italic> B10 <italic>Idd5</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>). In addition, the non&#x02013;NOD-derived <italic>Idd5.1/Ctla4</italic> and <italic>Idd3</italic> resistance alleles did not increase protection from diabetes compared with <italic>Idd3</italic> alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>). These results are consistent with our islet allograft survival data. The synergy observed between <italic>Idd5</italic> and <italic>Idd3</italic> that results in nearly complete protection from diabetes and insulitis and increases islet allograft survival to a C57BL/6-like frequency is dependent on the B10-derived <italic>Idd5.2</italic> region, either alone or in combination with the other <italic>Idd5</italic> loci. To extend this observation, additional congenic strain combinations would have to be developed and tested: <italic>Idd3/Idd5.3</italic>, <italic>Idd3/Idd5.2</italic>, and <italic>Idd3/Idd5.2/Idd5.3</italic>.</p><p><italic>Idd3</italic>, which is partially protective of diabetes, significantly improves islet allograft survival in the NOD mouse, with the strongest effect seen in the NOD.B6 <italic>Idd3</italic> B10 <italic>Idd5</italic> congenic strain. The <italic>Idd3</italic> effect likely results from differential expression of IL-2 that modulates CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Treg cell function in NOD mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>). IL-2 is also required for the development of self-tolerance and for costimulation blockade&#x02013;induced allograft tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>).</p><p>Based on the NOD.B6 <italic>Idd3</italic> congenic data, we hypothesized that the inability to induce tolerance in NOD mice is due to a failure to efficiently delete host alloreactive CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cells and that injection of exogenous IL-2 would correct this defect. As expected, (KB5 CBA &#x000d7; C57BL/6<italic>.H2<sup>g7</sup></italic>)F1 synchimeric mice treated with costimulation blockade showed a marked deletion of alloreactive CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cells compared with (KB5 CBA &#x000d7; NOD)F1 synchimeric mice. When (KB5 CBA &#x000d7; NOD)F1 synchimeric mice were treated with exogenous IL-2, alloreactive CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell deletion was significantly improved. These data suggest that NOD mice fail to efficiently delete alloreactive CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cells because of insufficient IL-2 production.</p><p>To extend this finding, we observed that islet allograft survival in NOD mice treated with costimulation blockade plus IL-2 was slightly longer than in those receiving costimulation blockade alone, likely through enhancement of alloreactive CD8 T-cell apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>). This interpretation has previously been proposed based on the observation that coadministration of rapamycin plus IL-2 prevents spontaneous and recurrent autoimmunity in NOD mice through the ability of rapamycin to inhibit IL-2 T-cell proliferation but not IL-2&#x02013;induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>). The fact that graft survival isn't as prolonged as that achieved in NOD.B6 <italic>Idd3</italic> mice may be due to the transient administration of IL-2 and its short half-life, whereas the increased IL-2 achieved in NOD.B6 <italic>Idd3</italic> mice is present throughout the animal's life. Alternatively, we had previously documented in CD8-deficient NOD and (NOD &#x000d7; C57BL/6)F1 mice that CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cells are not solely responsible for the failure to induce prolonged allograft survival after costimulation blockade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>), implicating a role for <italic>Il2</italic>/<italic>Idd3</italic> in other transplantation tolerance pathways, consistent with the known role of <italic>Idd3</italic> in Treg function in NOD mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>).</p><p>These data suggest that impaired production of IL-2 in NOD mice is a barrier to costimulation blockade&#x02013;induced tolerance. IL-2 is indispensable for supporting the in vivo growth, survival, and function of naturally occurring Tregs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>), and because of their corrected <italic>Idd3</italic> haplotype, NOD.B6 <italic>Idd3</italic> mice have CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Tregs with enhanced regulatory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we have shown that the resistance to costimulation blockade&#x02013;induced tolerance to islet allografts in NOD mice is in part due to the failure to efficiently delete alloreactive CD8 T-cells. Genetically, this can be overcome by the introgression of a normal <italic>Idd3</italic> (i.e., <italic>Il2</italic>) gene that synergizes with one or more protective subregions within <italic>Idd5</italic> to promote allograft tolerance. Speculatively, we propose that the B6 allele of <italic>Idd3</italic> might also contribute to the apoptosis of islet-specific CD8 cells in spontaneous diabetes. Because SNP polymorphisms in the IL-2 receptor have been associated with a genetic predisposition for type 1 diabetes in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref>), these data suggest that regulation of IL-2 may be important not only for diabetes but also for islet transplantation in type 1 diabetic individuals.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported in part by grants AR35506 and AI42669, an institutional Diabetes Endocrinology Research Center (DERC) grant (DK52530) from the National Institutes of Health, grant DK53006 from the National Institutes of Health, and a grant to L.D.S. from the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF).
