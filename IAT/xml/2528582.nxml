RCC1 binds to chromatin through a bimodal attachment to DNA and histones, and defects in binding cause chromosome missegregation. Chromatin binding is enhanced by apo-Ran. However, the mechanism underlying this regulation has been unclear. We now demonstrate that the N-terminal tail of RCC1 is essential for association with DNA but inhibits histone binding. Apo-Ran significantly promotes RCC1 binding to both DNA and histones, and these effects are tail mediated. Using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer biosensor, we detect conformational changes in the tail of RCC1 coupled to the two binding modes and in response to interactions with Ran and importin-&#x003b1;. The biosensor also reports changes accompanying mitosis in living cells. We propose that Ran induces an allosteric conformational switch in the tail that exposes the histone-binding surface on RCC1 and facilitates association of the positively charged tail with DNA.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; Imp, importin; WT, wild type.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The Ran GTPase performs vital functions throughout the eukaryotic cell cycle. During interphase, high RanGTP within the nucleus drives the vectorial transport of cargo between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Terry et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Trinkle-Mulcahy and Lamond, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yoon et al., 2008</xref>). In organisms with open mitoses, RanGTP stabilizes spindle microtubules near chromatin and facilitates kinetochore attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carazo-Salas et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kalab et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zhang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gruss et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gruss and Vernos, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Silverman-Gavrila and Wilde, 2006</xref>), whereas in telophase, RanGTP is required for reassembly of the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zhang and Clarke, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Walther et al., 2003</xref>). These functions depend on association of the Ran guanine nucleotide exchange factor with chromatin, which spatially restricts the generation of RanGTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kalab et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Caudron et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In vertebrates, the Ran guanine nucleotide exchange factor is called RCC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bischoff and Ponstingl, 1991</xref>). RCC1 resembles a donut, from which protrudes a flexible N-terminal tail consisting of aa 1&#x02013;20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Renault et al., 1998</xref>). Early studies suggested that the tail binds DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Seino et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2007</xref>), and recently we demonstrated that this association is facilitated by an unusual posttranslational modification of RCC1 in which the initial Met residue is removed and the exposed &#x003b1;-amino group (Ser in primates and Pro in other vertebrates) is tri- or dimethylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2007</xref>). Deletion of the tail or mutations of RCC1 that block methylation show weaker binding to chromatin, which causes mitotic defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Moore et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2007</xref>). However, the isolated N terminus binds only weakly to chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2007</xref>). A second important binding mode occurs through histones H2A/H2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nemergut et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>The RCC1 tail is a locus for multiple regulatory mechanisms. It contains an NLS, which is recognized by the transport factor importin-&#x003b1;3 (Imp&#x003b1;3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Nemergut and Macara, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Talcott and Moore, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Moore et al., 2002</xref>), and Imp&#x003b1; binding can interfere with chromatin association. Mitotic phosphorylation of the tail has been reported to block Imp&#x003b1;3 binding, thereby stabilizing chromatin association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hutchins et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Li and Zheng, 2004</xref>). In addition, there are three splice variants of RCC1, &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, and &#x003b3;, and the &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; variants contain unique inserts downstream of the tail, which affect chromatin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hood and Clarke, 2007</xref>).</p><p>RCC1 association with chromatin is also regulated by Ran. The dynamic interaction of RCC1 with chromatin in living cells is stabilized by Ran(T24N), a mutant that mimics the apo state of the GTPase and forms a stable binary complex with RCC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Li and Zheng, 2004</xref>). Conversely, a mutation in RCC1 (D182A) that disrupts Ran binding destabilizes chromatin association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Moore et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hutchins, et al., 2004</xref>). Mutational analyses have suggested that one face of the RCC1 donut binds to chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Seino et al., 1992</xref>), whereas the other face binds Ran (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Renault et al., 2001</xref>). In this study, we address the question of how Ran on one side of RCC1 can regulate chromatin binding to the other. We propose that the tail undergoes an allosteric conformational change upon binding Ran. In the closed state, the tail inhibits histone binding, whereas in the open state, the tail permits histone binding and can more readily bind DNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>How does Ran enhance the binding of its exchange factor, RCC1, to chromatin? Steric effects are unlikely because Ran binds to one face of RCC1 and chromatin to the opposite face. An alternative mechanism involves allosteric switching, but the crystal structures of RCC1 alone and Ran(T24N)-bound RCC1 are almost identical to one another. However, the 20-aa N-terminal tail is absent from both structures and is assumed to be flexible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Renault et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2001</xref>). Therefore, we reasoned that Ran binding might cause a conformational change in the tail. To test this hypothesis, we needed to know whether the first 20 aa are necessary for chromatin binding. Deletion of aa 1&#x02013;27 results in a diffusive cytoplasmic distribution of RCC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Moore et al., 2002</xref>), but this deletion also removes residues that lie across the chromatin-binding face of the RCC1 donut and interact with key amino acids on this surface.</p><p>Because the NLS lies within the first 20 aa (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>), we used cells permeabilized with Triton X-100 to remove the nuclear envelope and added recombinant YFP-tagged wild-type (WT) RCC1 &#x003b1; isoform or RCC1(&#x00394;1&#x02013;20) proteins. Using recombinant proteins also avoids the complication of &#x003b1;-N-methylation. The cells were washed with increasing salt concentrations, and retained YFP-RCC1 was imaged (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). RCC1(&#x00394;1&#x02013;20) showed substantially reduced binding to chromatin as compared with WT-RCC1, even at the lowest salt concentration (70 mM), and was almost entirely lost at higher concentrations, whereas WT-RCC1 was partially retained by chromatin even at 320 mM NaCl, suggesting that the 1&#x02013;20-aa tail is essential for stable chromatin binding.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>The N-terminal tail controls binding to both DNA and histones.</bold> (A) Amino acid sequence of the human RCC1 N-terminal tail.

Images were collected before and after the cells were washed sequentially with buffers containing indicated NaCl concentrations. (C) Deletion of the tail abolishes DNA binding.

Therefore, we next assayed the binding of His6-tagged WT-RCC1 and RCC1(&#x00394;1&#x02013;20) to DNA beads and to core histone octamers coupled to beads. Bound RCC1 was detected by immunoblotting with anti-His6 antibody. Under salt concentrations close to physiological, deletion of the N-terminal tail drastically reduced the binding of RCC1 to DNA beads compared with WT-RCC1, confirming that the tail is necessary for DNA binding (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Next, because the N-terminal &#x003b1;-amino group of RCC1 is methylated in mammalian cells, the DNA binding capacities of in vitro methylated RCC1, recombinant RCC1, and RCC1(&#x00394;1&#x02013;20) were also compared. Confirming our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2007</xref>), methylation of RCC1 resulted in elevated binding to DNA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>).</p><p>The region of RCC1 that interacts with histones has not been previously established. Surprisingly, deletion of the tail strongly increased binding to core histone-conjugated beads (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). This result suggests that the tail inhibits RCC1 binding to histones either by charge repulsion or by screening the interaction surface. In either case, one can imagine that a conformational change in the tail might modulate the ability of RCC1 to bind chromatin. To detect such conformational switches, we developed a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)&#x02013;based RCC1 biosensor. Because both the N and C termini of RCC1 extend from the same side of the donut, we predicted that a FRET pair attached to the ends would be sufficiently close to interact. CFP was fused to the N terminus, and YFP was fused to the C terminus of RCC1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). The CFP-RCC1-YFP fusion was expressed in HEK293T cells, and emission spectra were collected from the soluble fraction. Lysates from cells expressing CFP alone and YFP alone were also analyzed. The CFP-RCC1-YFP emission spectrum showed a large peak at 522 nm, corresponding to YFP emission, which demonstrates that, as expected, the biosensor exhibits efficient FRET (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Development of FRET-based RCC1 biosensor.</bold> (A) Schematic of the FRET-based RCC1 biosensor CFP-RCC1-YFP.

Imp&#x003b1;3 binds to an NLS in the tail, and because it is a large (50 kD) protein, it might be expected to force the tail away from the body of RCC1, which could change either the distance or orientation between fluorophore dipoles of the biosensor. Therefore, we tested whether the biosensor would detect this interaction. In the presence of Imp&#x003b1;3, FRET efficiency of CFP-RCC1-YFP showed a saturable decrease (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, C and D</xref>), which is consistent with the known affinity of Imp&#x003b1; for monopartite NLSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Nemergut and Macara, 2000</xref>). This result demonstrates that the biosensor is sensitive to direct interactions with the N-terminal tail.</p><p>To test whether DNA binding to the tail would also alter its conformation, we added increasing concentrations of annealed 64-mer oligonucleotides and observed a dose-dependent decrease in FRET efficiency (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, E and F</xref>). Note that the CFP emission increases as the YFP emission drops, confirming that the response resulted from a change in FRET efficiency rather than collisional quenching or other nonspecific effects. Moreover, because the biosensor cannot be &#x003b1;-amino methylated, it tests conformational changes independently of &#x003b1;-methylation&#x02013;mediated effects on DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2007</xref>). We conclude that the biosensor can detect changes in the conformation of the RCC1 tail and that both Imp&#x003b1;3 and DNA can alter this conformation.</p><p>Ran binds to the face of RCC1 opposite to that from which the N and C termini protrude. Moreover, Ran binding does not alter the structure of the body of the RCC1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Renault et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2001</xref>). A priori, therefore, one would not expect Ran binding to change the orientation or position of the N-terminal tail. However, the FRET efficiency of the biosensor was significantly reduced in a saturable manner by the addition of Ran(T24N) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>), whereas the addition of BSA as a negative control did not affect FRET (not depicted). To exclude the possibility that the FRET reduction might be caused by interference from other proteins in cell lysate, we purified a recombinant biosensor from <italic>Escherichia coli,</italic> His<sub>6</sub>-CFP-RCC1-YFP-Flag. This fusion protein exhibits the same emission characteristics as the protein expressed in HEK293T cells and gave a similar response upon addition of Ran(T24N) (Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803110/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803110/DC1</ext-link>).

For this reason, it binds RCC1 with an affinity &#x0223c;10-fold higher than that of GDP- or GTP-bound Ran (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Klebe et al., 1995</xref>). Therefore, to further confirm that the Ran(T24N)-induced FRET decrease was caused by binding of Ran to the RCC1, emission spectra were measured in the presence of Ran(Q69L), a Ran mutant deficient in nucleotide hydrolysis that binds to RCC1 weakly. In the absence of GTP and Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, Ran(Q69L) behaved like Ran(T24N), decreasing the FRET efficiency of the biosensor (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>). However, in the presence of GTP and Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, Ran(Q69L) did not change the FRET efficiency, even at high concentrations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>). These results confirm that the effect of Ran(T24N) is mediated by its binding to RCC1.</p><p>Because Ran binds to one side of the RCC1 body and chromatin is believed to bind to the other, we were also interested in whether histones would perturb the conformational alteration in the tail. Surprisingly, addition of core histones caused a significant increase in the FRET efficiency (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref>). This change was saturable with increasing histone concentration (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 F</xref>). Because the C and N termini are on the same chromatin-binding face, core histones might push the two termini closer together, resulting in elevated FRET. When Ran(T24N) was added together with histones, FRET efficiency could still be reduced by Ran(T24N) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 G</xref>). At high concentrations, Ran(T24N) completely overrode the FRET increase induced by core histones, suggesting that core histones and Ran(T24N) have independent effects on conformation of the RCC1 tail (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 H</xref>).</p><p>Does a Ran(T24N)-triggered conformational change also occur when RCC1 is associated with intact chromatin? To address this issue, the biosensor was expressed in MDCK cells. The cells were permeabilized and imaged by FRET microscopy before and after the addition of Ran(T24N). Raw FRET images were corrected for donor bleedthrough, acceptor bleedthrough, and for levels of both donor and acceptor to acquire normalized FRET (N<sub>FRET</sub>) images. Cells cotransfected with CFP and YFP as a negative control showed no detectable FRET signal, whereas cells expressing a CFP-YFP fusion protein as a positive control generated a high FRET signal as expected. CFP-RCC1-YFP gave a signal lower than that of the CFP-YFP fusion. When recombinant Ran(T24N) was added, N<sub>FRET</sub> was significantly reduced (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). As expected, however, addition of Ran(Q69L) had no effect (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). To rule out the possibility that permeabilization might affect the dynamics of the RCC1 binding to chromatin, we also transiently cotransfected the biosensor together with Ran(T24N) and measured FRET efficiency in live cells (Fig. S1 B). N<sub>FRET</sub> was consistently reduced by the presence of the Ran mutant.</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>FRET imaging reveals conformational changes in RCC1 bound to chromatin upon binding Ran(T24N) and during mitosis in MDCK cells.</bold> (A) Ran(T24N) binding reduces FRET efficiency of the CFP-RCC1-YFP biosensor bound to chromatin.

After permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100, cells were imaged &#x000b1; recombinant Ran(T24N) (middle) or Ran(Q69L) (bottom).

Using our biosensor, we found that mitotic cells display a slight but consistent reduction in FRET as compared with interphase cells, with the FRET efficiency dropping through anaphase and going up at the end of mitosis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, B and C</xref>). Thus, conformational changes might contribute to the different dynamics of RCC1-chromatin association during progression through mitosis. Together, these results demonstrate that apo-Ran binding triggers a conformational switch in the tail of RCC1, even when the protein is bound to chromatin. Small conformational alterations also occur in mitosis.</p><p>What is the function of this conformational change? To determine whether and how the Ran-induced conformational change in the tail might regulate chromatin association, we conducted in vitro binding assays using DNA- and histone-conjugated beads. Binding of RCC1-His<sub>6</sub> was compared &#x000b1; a molar excess of Ran(T24N). RCC1 binding to DNA was substantially increased by Ran(T24N), suggesting that the conformational change makes the tail more accessible to DNA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). Intriguingly, Ran(T24N) also promoted the interaction of RCC1 with histones (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). This result is consistent with the aforementioned data that the tail inhibits histone binding and with the idea that a Ran-induced conformational switch releases the inhibition. To test this model more decisively, we measured the binding of tailless RCC1 to histones in the presence or absence of Ran(T24N). As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>, the affinity of RCC1(&#x00394;1&#x02013;20) for histones was constitutively high and was not further increased by the Ran mutant. We conclude that the effects of Ran(T24N) are mediated by a conformational switch in the N-terminal tail.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Ran(T24N) promotes both RCC1 bindings to DNA and histones in vitro.</bold> The effects of Ran(T24N) require the RCC1 tail. (A) RCC1 binding to DNA is promoted by Ran(T24N). (B) RCC1 binding to core histones is increased by Ran(T24N). (C) Ran(T24N) has no effect on RCC1(&#x00394;1&#x02013;20) binding to core histones. (D) Core histone binding of RCC1 is increased by Imp&#x003b1;3. (E) Conformational switch model. The N-terminal tail of RCC1 is essential for DNA binding but allosterically inhibits association with histones. In its closed state, RCC1 has a low affinity for both DNA and histones. Binding of Ran causes the tail to undergo a conformational switch to an open state, exposing the histone-binding surface and enabling the tail to interact efficiently with DNA. This interaction is enhanced by &#x003b1;-N-methylation.

However, the Ran(T24N) mutant does not appear able to bind histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bilbao-Cort&#x000e9;s et al., 2002</xref>), so it is unlikely to influence RCC1-chromatin association through this mechanism.</p><p>Mitotic phosphorylation of the tail has been reported to prevent RCC1 association with Imp&#x003b1;3, thereby stabilizing chromatin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hutchins et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Li and Zheng, 2004</xref>). Consistent with this, the addition of Imp&#x003b1;3 reduced the association of our biosensor with chromatin in permeabilized cells (Fig. S2 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803110/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803110/DC1</ext-link>), indicating that Imp&#x003b1;3 could potentially block chromatin binding of RCC1 by associating with its NLS. However, it is unlikely that the Imp blocks RCC1 binding in intact cells because high RanGTP concentrations near the chromatin surface would prevent the Imp&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; complex from associating with NLSs and would also promote association of Imp&#x003b1; with its export factor, CAS. To determine the molecular mechanism by which Imp&#x003b1; regulates RCC1 binding to chromatin, we examined RCC1 retention on DNA beads and histone beads &#x000b1; Imp&#x003b1;3. As expected, the addition of Imp&#x003b1;3 significantly reduced RCC1 binding to DNA, possibly by directly blocking the DNA-binding region or pulling the tail away (Fig. S2 B). Strikingly, however, the addition of Imp&#x003b1;3 increased RCC1 binding to core histones (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>), which is consistent with the effects of deletion of the tail on core histone binding and further supports the idea that conformational changes in the tail can relieve its inhibitory effect on histone association. These data are summarized in Table S1 (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803110/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803110/DC1</ext-link>).</p><p>We conclude that RCC1 binding to chromatin can be regulated by an allosteric switch mechanism (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 E</xref>). The RCC1 tail binds to DNA, whereas its body interacts with histones H2A/H2B. The tail can also inhibit association with histones. It undergoes a conformational switch in response to Ran binding, DNA binding, or to interactions with Imp&#x003b1;3. We propose that in its closed state, RCC1 has a low affinity for both DNA and histones. Ran binding causes the tail to swing away from the body, exposing the histone-binding surface and enabling the positively charged tail to interact efficiently with DNA. Moreover, this bimodal binding mechanism is enhanced by &#x003b1;-N-methylation. Other factors, such as RanBP3, might also play important roles in regulating RCC1 conformation and chromatin association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nemergut et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yoon et al., 2008</xref>). Together, such factors likely control the RanGTP gradient around chromatin and are essential for ensuring normal chromosome segregation, nuclear envelope formation, and nucleocytoplasmic transport.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Constructs</title><p>To generate RCC1-His<sub>6</sub>, RCC1(&#x00394;1&#x02013;20)-His<sub>6</sub>, RCC1-YFP-His<sub>6</sub>, and RCC1(&#x00394;1&#x02013;20)-YFP-His<sub>6</sub>, human RCC1 or RCC1-YFP was amplified to introduce a 5&#x02032; NdeI site and 3&#x02032; XhoI site and was subcloned into pET-30a (Novagen).
