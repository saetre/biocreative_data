We hypothesized that <italic>Myd88</italic>, an adaptor molecule in the Toll-like-receptor (TLR) pathway, regulates pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell function and homeostasis. We first examined &#x003b2;-cells histologically and found that <italic>Myd88&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> mice have smaller islets in comparison to C57Bl/6 controls. <italic>Myd88&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> mice were nonetheless normoglycemic both at rest and after an intra-peritoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT). In contrast, after low-dose streptozotocin (STZ) challenge, <italic>Myd88&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic>mice had an abnormal IPGTT relative to WT controls. Furthermore, <italic>Myd88</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice suffer enhanced &#x003b2;-cell apoptosis and have enhanced hepatic damage with delayed recovery upon low-dose STZ treatment. Finally, we treated WT mice with broad-spectrum oral antibiotics to deplete their commensal flora. In WT mice, low dose oral lipopolysaccharide, but not lipotichoic acid or antibiotics alone, strongly promoted enhanced glycemic control. These data suggest that <italic>Myd88</italic> signaling and certain TLR ligands mediate a homeostatic effect on &#x003b2;-cells primarily in the setting of injury.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize structurally conserved microbial products and mediate the initiation of inflammatory and immune defense responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005063-Takeda1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

The conclusion that <italic>Myd88&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> suffer greater injury upon STZ treatment is buttressed by the fact that they also displayed transaminitis indicative of hepatocyte damage. <italic>Myd88</italic> mediated activation of NF-kB is known to promote cell survival via production of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005063-Gelman1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005063-Francois1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005063-Akira1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005063-Lombardo1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. However, <italic>Myd88</italic> also binds the Fas-associated Death Domain (FADD) and promotes induction of apoptosis via a pathway involving caspase 8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005063-Aliprantis1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. In the context of the pancreas, TLR4&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice were found to have reduced apoptosis in a surgical model of pancreatitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005063-Sawa1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. Whether <italic>Myd88</italic> signaling contributes toward anti- or pro-apoptotic pathways is dependant on the particular TLR involved and other contextual cues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005063-Salaun1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. While TLR have been found to contribute to the maintenance of tissue integrity at multiple sites of host-microbial interface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005063-Jiang1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005063-Seki1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005063-Macedo1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005063-RakoffNahoum1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, these data extend this model to two tissue types not always considered to be part of that interface, the pancreatic islet and liver.</p><p>The enhanced sensitivity to low-dose STZ was not recapitulated in WT mice denuded of intestinal flora upon the long-term administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Since this treatment did not render the intestines of these mice entirely sterile, it may be that even small quantities of intestinal bacteria are adequate. Alternatively, endogenous TLR ligands might suffice to maintain islet homeostasis upon STZ treatment in the setting of competent <italic>Myd88</italic> signaling.</p><p>Our data do not contradict the recent finding that the absence of <italic>Myd88</italic> leads to changes in the penetrance of diabetes in NOD mice raised in either SPF or gnotobiotic conditions. In our work diabetes is induced by a toxin whereas diabetes in NOD mice is mediated by an autoimmune phenomenon. Together these data emphasize that effects of different TLR ligands and gut microbiota on diabetes are likely to be complex, multifactorial and dependent on the genetic underpinnings of the diabetes in question.</p><p>Our data also do not directly contradict the recent report that <italic>Myd88&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> mice developed an increased incidence of autoimmune diabetes relative to WT controls one to two months after low-dose STZ treatment. Notably those authors did not find relative hyperglycemia in <italic>Myd88&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> mice in the weeks immediately following low-dose STZ treatment but they measured blood glucose in fasting mice rather then upon glucose challenge via IPGTT as we have done here.</p><p>We were intrigued to find that low-dose oral LPS has a salutary effect on glycemic control. These data are consistent with reports that endogenous gram negative bacteria tonically prime insulin production in rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005063-Cornell1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref> and consistent with data that treatment of islets <italic>ex vivo</italic> with LPS promotes &#x003b2;-cell insulin production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005063-VivesPi1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. In that study the tonic effects of LPS on insulin secretion were dose dependant, with the lower concentrations being more beneficial. These effects were observed at LPS concentrations of 1&#x02013;100 ng/ml, which is similar to that used to stimulate macrophages. At higher concentrations of LPS (e.g. 5&#x02013;10 &#x000b5;g/ml) cytotoxic effect on islets have been observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005063-Arnush1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005063-Saitoh1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref> and <italic>in vivo</italic> are associated with sepsis-induced hypoglycemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005063-Oguri1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. In sum, low-dose LPS appears to promotes insulin production and release while high dose LPS leads to stress-related responses. The dose-dependent nature of LPS effects on &#x003b2;-cells may be clinically relevant during acute endotoxemic events and in settings of inflammation. Chronic inflammation and basal endotoxemia have been correlated with obesity and type 2 diabetes in humans and rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005063-Cani1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005063-Creely1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. Dose-dependant effects of endotoxin on &#x003b2;-cells may also be relevant to the viability and function of transplanted islets. In the most commonly followed transplant protocol, endotoxins are infused into the portal circulation of recipients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005063-Ryan1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>, where levels of endotoxin have been shown to be higher relative to peripheral circulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005063-Jacob1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We interpret the effects observed upon low-dose oral LPS treatment as functionally distinct from the role described here for <italic>Myd88</italic> signaling in the setting of &#x003b2;-cell injury. The salutary effect of oral LPS was apparent irrespective of STZ treatment and in the absence of injury. <italic>Myd88</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice, conversely, were phenotypically unremarkable until they received STZ. While these findings appear to describe distinct physiologic processes, they may be mechanistically related. Such overlap between pathways involved in &#x003b2;-cell survival and &#x003b2;-cell autoimmunity may account for the complex and sometimes contradictory relationship between infection and type 1 diabetes. Together these data suggest that TLRs and their ligands may play important roles in &#x003b2;-cell physiology in both health and injury. They point towards an additional frontier in diabetes research, the role of microbial products in the regulation of glycemic control.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0005063.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Myd88&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice do not have diminished levels of GLP-1.
