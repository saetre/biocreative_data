The novel findings reported here are: 1) partial reduction of <italic>VE-cadherin</italic> expression using low doses of morpholinos causes vascular fragility, head hemorrhages and increase in permeability; this has not been described before and suggests that the total amount of the protein expressed is an important determinant of vascular stability; 2) concentrations of morpholinos which abrogate <italic>VE-cadherin</italic> expression prevent vessels to establish successful reciprocal contacts and, as a consequence, vascular sprouting activity is not inhibited. This likely explains the observed vascular hyper-sprouting and the presence of several small, collapsing vessels; 3) the common cardinal vein lacks a correct connection with the endocardium leaving the heart separated from the rest of the circulatory system. The lack of closure of the circulatory loop has never been described before and may explain some downstream defects of the phenotype such as the lack of a correct vascular remodeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions and Significance</title><p>Our observations identify several steps of vascular development in which VE-cadherin plays an essential role. While it does not appear to regulate vascular patterning it is implicated in vascular connection and inhibition of sprouting activity. These processes require stable cell-cell junctions which are defective in absence of VE-cadherin. Notably, also partial modifications in <italic>VE-cadherin</italic> expression prevent the formation of a stable vasculature. This suggests that partial internalization or change of function of this protein may strongly affect vascular stability and organization.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Homotypic endothelial cell-cell adhesion is particularly important for the correct formation, networking and remodeling of vessels. Endothelial cells are maintained in contact one another by a complex network of transmembrane adhesion proteins anchored to the actin cytoskeleton. Growing evidence indicates that endothelial cell-cell adhesion is accompanied by intracellular signaling which promotes the resting state of the cells and contributes to their homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005772-Dejana1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;. It is well known that cultured sparse and confluent cells present a different functional phenotype. Gene expression profiles of sparse and confluent cells also show that several genes are regulated by cell-cell contacts, many of which are implicated in cell growth, apoptosis, matrix and cytoskeletal remodeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005772-Wallez1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005772-Dejana2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Adherens and tight junctions (AJ and TJ respectively) are the major adhesive junctions in endothelial cells. They are both formed by transmembrane adhesive proteins that are linked inside the cells to a complex network of cytoskeletal and signaling partners <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005772-Dejana1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005772-Bazzoni1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005772-GonzalezMariscal1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Adhesion at AJs is induced by members of the cadherin family. VE- and N-cadherin are the major cadherins present in endothelial cells. However, only VE-cadherin is found in the majority of inter-endothelial AJs both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Inactivation of <italic>VE-cadherin</italic> gene in mice leads to major defects in vascular development causing embryo lethality around 9.5&#x02013;10.5 E <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005772-Carmeliet1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005772-GoryFaure1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. While the first primitive vascular plexus is formed even in the absence of VE-cadherin, the vessels are unable to further progress and the vasculature undergoes regression. The mechanism of action of VE-cadherin in vascular development is quite complex. Several reports indicate that, besides its adhesive properties, this protein can transfer intracellular signals which promote vascular stability and remodeling. Most of these activities, however, have been studied <italic>in vitro</italic> in cultured cells and, due to the early lethality of <italic>VE-cadherin</italic> null mouse embryos, it is difficult to understand how and at which step of vascular development this protein acts.</p><p>We therefore decided to use the zebrafish embryo which, due to its transparency and external development, allows a more detailed study of vascular defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005772-Baldessari1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005772-Chico1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, only one <italic>VE-cadherin</italic> orthologue has been identified in the fish that maintains endothelial specific expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005772-Larson1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Our studies show that reduction of <italic>VE-cadherin</italic> expression does not change vascular patterning but leads to a concentration-dependent alteration in vascular integrity and lumen formation. A novel finding derived from the analysis of this phenotype is that the sprouting vessels lack the capacity to establish successful reciprocal contacts and subsequent fusion. When <italic>VE-cadherin</italic> expression is abrogated the heart remains disconnected from the peripheral vascular network and blood circulation is absent. When <italic>VE-cadherin</italic> expression is only partially reduced, the vessels are fragile and hemorrhagic, particularly in the head. These data support the notion that VE-cadherin plays a non redundant role in maintaining the integrity of endothelial cell-cell contacts and, as a consequence, in the establishment of correctly interconnected vascular structures. Notably, also partial modifications in <italic>VE-cadherin</italic> expression may prevent the formation of a stable vasculature suggesting that also small reduction in expression or function of this protein may severely affect vascular integrity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Zebrafish lines and husbandry</title><p>Zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) were raised and maintained as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005772-Westerfield1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> in agreement with local and national sanitary regulations.

The embryos were studied at 48 hpf, since at this stage ISVs and DLAV are fully lumenized in control embryos, and confocal images illustrate the absence of lumen in most of the <italic>VE-cadherin</italic> morphant ISVs. An important question, however, is whether these alterations may be a direct effect of <italic>VE-cadherin</italic> knockdown or an indirect effect of the lack of circulation. To clarify this aspect we compared <italic>VE-cadherin</italic> morphants with <italic>silentheart</italic> (<italic>sih</italic>) morphants that lack blood flow due to complete impairment of cardiac contractility. We observed that, similarly to <italic>VE-cadherin</italic>, <italic>sih</italic> morphants show strongly reduced lumen in some portions of ISVs and fairly no lumens in DLAV at 48 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005772-g006">Figure 6C&#x02013;E</xref>).

However, the absence of VE-cadherin inhibits the establishment of successful vessel contacts and fusion which are necessary steps for lumen formation. Several vessels lack connection with the rest of the vasculature and present reduced lumen and signs of initial regression. At high <italic>VEcad</italic>MO concentrations CCV cannot connect with the endocardium leaving the heart separated from the rest of the circulatory system.</p><p>The lack of blood flow contributes but does not fully explain the altered vascular lumenization in <italic>VE-cadherin</italic> morphants as suggested by comparison with <italic>sih</italic> phenotype. While ISVs lacked lumen in both types of morphants, SIV in <italic>sih</italic> morphants show the presence of a fully connected lumen which was instead strongly reduced or absent in <italic>VE-cadherin</italic> morphants. These data are consistent with the observations reported in <italic>VE- cadherin</italic> null mouse embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005772-Carmeliet1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> where, in large vessels, the vascular lumen was reduced or absent even before the establishment of flow.</p><p>Blood flow and shear stress are important factors for vascular remodeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005772-Haga1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Flow is important in the formation of stable vessels that integrate in a functional network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005772-Lawson1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005772-Isogai1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> and seems to be required in certain vessels (ISVs) for lumen opening. From the data presented here we propose that the role of VE-cadherin in lumen formation may be mediated, directly, by flow-independent induction of cell polarization and, indirectly, by promoting a correct connection between the sprouting vessels which is required for establishment of flow and final reshaping of the lumen.</p><p>During vascular development the first vessels which form in the embryo arise through vasculogenesis. This process involves endothelial cell differentiation, migration and assembly in tubular structures. After establishment of the axial blood vessels, smaller vessels such as the ISVs form through sprouting from the existing large vessels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005772-Lawson1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005772-Adams1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. This process has been studied in detail and includes endothelial cell migration towards the concentration gradient of growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005772-Lundkvist1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Migration is directed by &#x0201c;leader&#x0201d; endothelial cells that, similarly to branching morphogenesis in other tissues, direct the movement of the cells of the stalk. The leader endothelial cells form many filopodia at the leading edge which explore the sourrounding environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005772-Adams1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005772-Gerhardt1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. When the leader cells encounter other sprouting vessels they fuse and form a communicating lumen. Upon fusion, the number of protruding filopodia rapidly decreases and the vessels form an interconnected vasculature (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005772-g007">figure 7C</xref>).</p><p>While the molecular pathways which regulate vascular sprouting and patterning have been described to a relatively large extent, very little is known about the molecules implicated in vascular fusion and lumen formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005772-Adams1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. The present work shows for the first time that VE-cadherin plays an important role in these developmental steps. Most of the vascular defects observed in <italic>VE-cadherin</italic> morphants may be explained by the lack of strong intercellular contacts. When VE-cadherin is reduced or absent, contacts among vessels are weak and vessel fusion is delayed or absent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005772.s010">Movies S7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005772.s011">S8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005772-g007">figure 7</xref>). In few regions such as the head vasculature or ISVs after the small vessels come in contact they maintain sprouting filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005772-g004">figure 4J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005772-g007">7B</xref>) strongly suggesting that the interconnection is incomplete and that the signals which follow vascular fusion are insufficient to abrogate sprouting. In other regions like the CCV and SV, the connection is unsuccessful and the vessels detach and eventually regress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005772-g005">Figures 5E&#x02013;F</xref>).</p><p>In the isolated and cultured mouse allantois, in absence of VE-cadherin, the vessels form a primitive vascular network but they fail to organize stable connections, the vascular rudiments regress and the network collapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005772-Crosby1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. This occurs in the absence of flow and supports the concept that VE-cadherin plays an important role in the early organization of vascular like structures also in the absence of mechanical forces.</p><p>The abrogation of VE-cadherin in the mouse embryo leads to endothelial cell apoptosis in a report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005772-Carmeliet1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> but not in another <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005772-GoryFaure1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. In the present work we show that apoptosis was very limited in endothelial cells. A conceivable explanation is that apoptosis of endothelial cells is more apparent when the vascular phenotype is more severe as in Carmeliet et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005772-Carmeliet1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. In the fish the vascular pattern is rather well preserved and the observed phenotype is mild as compared to VE-cadherin gene inactivation in the mouse embryo. This likely explains the reduced apoptotic signal in vascular endothelium.</p><p>In summary, the present study introduces novel findings which clarify to a good extent the mechanism of action of VE-cadherin in promoting vascular development and which could not be observed in the mouse in earlier studies.</p><p>In general, VE-cadherin is a key protein in promoting early stages of vascular connection and fusion. This functional aspect of the protein fits with our knowledge on its mechanism of action in <italic>in vitro</italic> cell culture systems. Several published reports point to a role of VE-cadherin in transferring signals which promote junctional integrity and vascular stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005772-Dejana1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. VE-cadherin engagement inhibits endothelial cell growth, apoptosis and motility and upregulates a set of genes such as claudin-5 which contributes to tight junction organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005772-Taddei1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. We report here for the first time that VE-cadherin engagement may exert a negative feedback mechanism in reducing formation of sprouting filopodia. We still do not know the exact mechanism which regulates this inhibitory process but a recent report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005772-Abraham1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref> shows that small GTPases, which are regulated by VE-cadherin, play a role through reshaping of the cell cytoskeleton.</p><p>Another novel observation resulting from the present work is that also a partial reduction in <italic>VE-cadherin</italic> expression may induce important defects in vascular integrity such as cranial hemorrhages and increase in vessel permeability. These defects were not observed in heterozygous mice where <italic>VE-cadherin</italic> expression was reduced by 50&#x00025; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005772-Carmeliet1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005772-GoryFaure1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. We cannot exclude, however, that stress conditions such as alterations in blood flow or the combined reduction of other related junctional proteins may cause hemorrhages also in heterozygous mice. It has recently been found in zebrafish that individual knockdown of genes implicated in junction stability such as <italic>Rap1b</italic>, <italic>Pak2a</italic>, <italic>&#x003b2;-Pix</italic> or <italic>ccm1/krit</italic> cause hemorrhagic phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005772-Buchner1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005772-Gore1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. Strikingly, the combined knockdown of these genes synergizes and results in higher incidence of intracranial hemorrhages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005772-Gore1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. Importantly, all these genes are directly or indirectly associated to VE-cadherin and likely play a role in AJ stabilization. Thus, also partial alterations in expression or function of endothelial AJ proteins may result in high frequency of hemorrhagic events and altered control of permeability as we observed in the present study.</p><p>Finally, a new finding reported here is that the common cardinal vein lacks a correct connection with the endocardium leaving the heart separated from the rest of the circulatory system. As far as our knowledge it is the first time that this has been reported for VE-cadherin. The lack of closure of the circulatory loop may explain some downstream defects described in this phenotype such as the lack of a correct lumen formation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0005772.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Endothelial cell death is not increased in VE-cadherin endothelial cells.
