Such disordered states are imparted by fatty acids that act to offset the closely packed ordered arrangement of the lipid bilayer acyl chains imparted by straight-chain saturated acyl chains. In most bacteria the role of introducing acyl chain disorder is fulfilled by unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs). Some bacteria synthesize UFA by desaturation, an oxygen-requiring reaction that introduces the double bond in a single concerted reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However, as first recognized by Bloch and coworkers this is not an option for anaerobically grown bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. These investigators originally proposed that introduction of the double bond involved a direct dehydration of the 3-hydroxydecanoyl intermediate of fatty acid synthesis to give a <italic>cis</italic>-3 double bond which would be conserved though subsequent cycles of addition of two carbon atoms to give the membrane lipid UFA moieties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. However, when tested in cell-free extracts of <italic>E. coli</italic>, the reaction proved to proceed by a more conservative dehydration to give the classical <italic>trans</italic>-2-decenoyl fatty acid synthetic intermediate followed by isomerization of the <italic>trans</italic>-2-double bond to the <italic>cis</italic>-3 species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. This <italic>cis </italic>double bond was then preserved through successive C<sub>2 </sub>elongation cycles to form the double bond of the mature UFAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The dehydration and isomerization reactions were demonstrated by purification of the <italic>E. coli </italic>FabA enzyme (called the "Bloch dehydratase" to distinguish it from the <italic>E. coli </italic>FabZ dehydratase of the elongation cycle) that catalyzed both the dehydration and isomerization reactions(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Ironically, although the pathway was originally proposed based on the patterns of incorporation of short chain radioactive fatty acids into UFAs by cultures of <italic>Clostridium butyricum </italic>(now <italic>Clostridium beijerinckii</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], all of the extant Clostridial genomes lack a homologue of FabA, the <italic>E. coli </italic>dehydratase-isomerase studied by Bloch and coworkers. Indeed, many bacterial genomes do not encode a recognizable FabA. This is also true of FabB, the <italic>E. coli </italic>chain elongation enzyme that channels the metabolic intermediate produced by FabA into the mainstream fatty acid synthetic pathway. Indeed in the extant genome sequences FabA and FabB homologues are encoded only in the genomes of &#x003b1;- and &#x003b3;-proteobacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Thus far, two solutions that solve the problem of anaerobic UFA synthesis in the absence of FabA and FabB have been reported. The first solution was that of <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae </italic>which introduces a <italic>cis </italic>double bond into the growing acyl chain using FabM, a <italic>trans</italic>-2 to <italic>cis</italic>-3-decenoyl-ACP isomerase (i.e., the second partial reaction of FabA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The second solution was that of <italic>Enterococcus faecalis </italic>which uses homologues of FabZ and FabF to perform the functions performed by FabA and FabB in <italic>E. coli </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. <italic>E. faecalis </italic>encodes two FabZ homologues and two FabF homologues (FabF is closely related to FabB). Wang and Cronan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] showed that one of these proteins, now called FabN, functioned as a dehydratase/isomerase analogous to FabA, whereas the other FabZ homologue possessed only dehydratase activity. A similar picture was seen for the FabF proteins, one (now called FabO) performed the FabB function whereas the other functioned only as a FabF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, neither of these scenarios seemed applicable to the Clostridia. <italic>C. acetobutylicium </italic>lacks <italic>fabM, fabA </italic>and <italic>fabB </italic>and has only a single copy of <italic>fabZ</italic>, although its fatty acid composition is similar to that of <italic>E. coli</italic>. This bacterium contains three genes that encode putative FabFs, although only one of these seemed likely to be involved in fatty acid synthesis (see Discussion). The most likely FabF homologue candidate was that encoded within a large gene cluster (<italic>fabH acpP fabK</italic>, <italic>fabD fabG fabF accB fabZ accC accD accA</italic>) that encodes what appears to be a complete set of the genes required for saturated fatty acid synthesis. How does <italic>C. acetobutylicium </italic>make unsaturated fatty acids? One possibility was that the single FabZ and FabF homologues could somehow function in both the saturated and unsaturated branches of the fatty acid synthetic pathway. We report that the <italic>C. acetobutylicium </italic>FabZ cannot catalyze isomerization of its <italic>trans</italic>-2-decenoyl-ACP product to the <italic>cis-</italic>3 species either in <italic>vitro </italic>or when expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>. However, the single FabF homologue active in fatty acid synthesis has the functions of both <italic>E. coli </italic>long chain 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthases, FabB and FabF.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Unsaturated fatty acid biosynthetic pathway of <italic>E. coli</italic></bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2180-9-119-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Only one of the three <italic>C. acetobutylicium fabF </italic>homologues can functionally replace <italic>E. coli </italic>FabF in <italic>vivo</italic></title><p>There are three annotated <italic>C. acetobutylicium fabF </italic>homologues designated as CAC3573, CAC2008 and CAA0093 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. We will temporarily call these genes <italic>fabF1, fabF2 </italic>and <italic>fabF3</italic>, although our data indicate that only the first of these genes functions in fatty acid synthesis. To test the functions of these homologues, the three genes were inserted into the arabinose-inducible vector pBAD24. The resulting plasmids were then introduced into two <italic>E. coli fabB</italic>(Ts) <italic>fabF </italic>strains, CY244 and JWC275. At the non-permissive temperature these mutant strains lack both long chain 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase activities and thus are unable to grow even when the medium is supplemented with the unsaturated fatty acid, oleate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Derivatives of strains CY244 or JWC275 carrying pHW36 encoding <italic>fabF1 </italic>grew at 42&#x000b0;C in the presence of oleate whereas the strains carrying pHW37 and pHW38 (encoding <italic>fabF2 </italic>and <italic>fabF3</italic>, respectively) failed to grow (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) (similar results were seen with plasmids of both low and high copy number vectors). Thus, only <italic>fabF1 </italic>complemented the <italic>E. coli fabF </italic>mutation showing that <italic>C. acetobutylicium </italic>FabF1, like <italic>E. coli </italic>FabF, is able to catalyze all of the elongation reactions required in the synthesis of saturated fatty acids. Furthermore, expression of FabF1 restored thermal control of fatty acid composition to a FabF null mutant strain (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). An <italic>E. coli fabF </italic>strain in which <italic>C. acetobutylicium </italic>FabF1 was expressed from the <italic>lac </italic>promoter of a low copy number vector closely mimicked the changes in fatty acid composition seen in wild type <italic>E. coli </italic>strains upon changes in growth temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Expression of FabF1 restored <italic>cis</italic>-vaccenate synthesis at all temperatures, but was much more effective at 30&#x000b0;C than at 37&#x000b0;C or 42&#x000b0;C (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). This effect seems likely to be due to the effects of temperature on FabF1 synthase activity since thermal regulation disappeared upon expression of FabF1 from a high copy number vector (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) and the enzyme was thermolabile in <italic>vitro </italic>(see below). Apparently, at high growth temperatures low levels FabF1 elongation activity was overcome by high-level expression of the protein. We also found high levels of <italic>cis</italic>-vaccenate at the non-permissive temperature upon expression of <italic>fabF1 </italic>in an <italic>E. coli fabB fabF </italic>strain that carried the <italic>fabB </italic>gene of <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic>, a bacterium naturally defective in both <italic>cis</italic>-vaccenate synthesis and in regulation of fatty acid composition by temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] (data not shown).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Effects of growth temperature on fatty acid compositions (% by weight)of <italic>fabF </italic>strain MR52 carrying plasmids encoding <italic>C. acetobutylicium fabF1</italic>.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th align="center" colspan="2">30&#x000b0;C</th><th align="center" colspan="2">37&#x000b0;C</th><th align="center" colspan="2">42&#x000b0;C</th></tr><tr><th/><th colspan="6"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="center">Fatty acid</th><th align="center">pHW33</th><th align="center">pHW36</th><th align="center">pHW33</th><th align="center">pHW36</th><th align="center">pHW33</th><th align="center">pHW36</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">C14:0</td><td align="center">2.2</td><td align="center">5.8</td><td align="center">2.4</td><td align="center">6.2</td><td align="center">2.6</td><td align="center">3.3</td></tr><tr><td align="center">C16:1</td><td align="center">40.3</td><td align="center">29</td><td align="center">35</td><td align="center">24.8</td><td align="center">53.4</td><td align="center">28.9</td></tr><tr><td align="center">C16:0</td><td align="center">21.4</td><td align="center">25.8</td><td align="center">32.4</td><td align="center">25.1</td><td align="center">26.2</td><td align="center">28.7</td></tr><tr><td align="center">C18:1</td><td align="center">33.3</td><td align="center">30</td><td align="center">25.9</td><td align="center">32.4</td><td align="center">14.8</td><td align="center">30.2</td></tr><tr><td align="center">C18:0</td><td align="center">2.8</td><td align="center">9.4</td><td align="center">4.3</td><td align="center">11.6</td><td align="center">2.9</td><td align="center">8.7</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Growth of <italic>E. coli </italic>strains CY242, K1060, CY244, and JWC275 transformed with plasmids encoding the <italic>C. acetobutylicium fabF </italic>homologues</bold>.

The lack of growth in the absence of oleate argued that either FabF1 lacked the ability to replace FabB or that FabF1 was unable to simultaneously perform the tasks of both FabB and FabF under these conditions. To decide between these alternatives we transformed pHW36 into strain K1060, a strain that carries an unconditional <italic>fabB </italic>allele, and into strain CY242 which carries the same <italic>fabB</italic>(Ts) allele as strain CY244. The complementation experiments showed that <italic>C. acetobutylicium fabF</italic>1 allowed strain K1060 to grow on RB medium lacking oleate at 37&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). However, <italic>fabF</italic>1 failed to complement growth of the temperature sensitive <italic>fabB </italic>mutant strain, CY242 at 42&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). If FabF1 possessed FabB activity at 37&#x000b0;C, unsaturated fatty acids should be synthesized. To test this hypothesis, we grew strain K1060 carrying pHW36 or pHW33 (both encoding <italic>fabF1</italic>) at different temperatures and the fatty acid compositions of these strains were determined by collision induced dissociation electrospray mass spectroscopy (CID ES-MS) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). The strains clearly synthesized unsaturated fatty acids when grown at all of the different temperatures. However, the level of unsaturated fatty acids synthesized was lower than that seen in K1060 carrying a plasmid (pCY9) that encoded <italic>E. coli fabB </italic>and the amount of <italic>cis</italic>-vaccenate decreased with increased growth temperature. Moreover, despite the differing copy numbers, the two plasmids that encoded <italic>C. acetobutylicium </italic>FabF1 gave similar levels of unsaturated fatty acids. These results provide an explanation for lack of complementation of the <italic>fabB</italic>(Ts) phenotype at 42&#x000b0;C by the <italic>fabF1</italic>-encoding plasmids. At 42&#x000b0;C the low activity of FabF1 did not allow enough unsaturated fatty acid synthesis to support growth. To test whether or not <italic>C. acetobutylicium </italic>FabF1 has FabB function at 42&#x000b0;C we assayed unsaturated fatty acid synthesis in strain CY242 carrying the <italic>fabF</italic>1 plasmid pHW36 (growth was supported by cyclopropane fatty acid supplementation) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Under these conditions [<sup>14</sup>C] acetate labeling showed low levels of unsaturated fatty acids synthesis upon arabinose induction of FabF1 expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Therefore, FabF1 has the ability to replace FabB in <italic>E. coli </italic>unsaturated fatty acid synthesis but its expression allows growth only when the host FabF is present to perform the bulk of the chain elongation reactions.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Fatty acid compositions (% by weight)of <italic>fabB </italic>strain K1060 transformed with plasmids encoding either <italic>C. acetobutylicium fabF1 </italic>or <italic>E. coli fabB</italic>.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th align="center" colspan="3">30&#x000b0;C</th><th align="center" colspan="3">37&#x000b0;C</th><th align="center" colspan="3">42&#x000b0;C</th></tr><tr><th/><th colspan="9"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="left">Fatty acid</th><th align="left">pHW33</th><th align="left">pHW36</th><th align="left">pCY9</th><th align="left">pHW33</th><th align="left">pHW36</th><th align="left">pCY9</th><th align="left">pHW33</th><th align="left">pHW36</th><th align="left">pCY9</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">C14:0</td><td align="left">4.9</td><td align="left">9.2</td><td align="left">2.2</td><td align="left">11.1</td><td align="left">7.7</td><td align="left">4</td><td align="left">11.1</td><td align="left">9.9</td><td align="left">2.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left">C16:1</td><td align="left">12.8</td><td align="left">8.1</td><td align="left">16.8</td><td align="left">17.5</td><td align="left">18</td><td align="left">20</td><td align="left">19.7</td><td align="left">13.5</td><td align="left">20.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left">C16:0</td><td align="left">22.1</td><td align="left">21.6</td><td align="left">10.8</td><td align="left">25.9</td><td align="left">23.6</td><td align="left">13.8</td><td align="left">32.6</td><td align="left">42.7</td><td align="left">19.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left">C18:1</td><td align="left">43.1</td><td align="left">43.1</td><td align="left">67.1</td><td align="left">31.8</td><td align="left">34.4</td><td align="left">58.1</td><td align="left">17.7</td><td align="left">22.4</td><td align="left">51</td></tr><tr><td align="left">C18:0</td><td align="left">17</td><td align="left">18</td><td align="left">3.2</td><td align="left">13.7</td><td align="left">16.3</td><td align="left">3.7</td><td align="left">18.9</td><td align="left">11.5</td><td align="left">6.5</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of <italic>C. acetobutylicium </italic>FabF1 restores UFA synthesis to <italic>E. coli fabB </italic>strains</bold>.

However, it remained possible that <italic>C. acetobutylicium </italic>FabZ catalyzed UFA synthesis, but that the levels of UFA produced were too low to support growth. This possibility was tested by [<sup>14</sup>C]-acetate labeling of the fatty acids synthesized by strain CY57 carrying pHW22 and analysis of the resulting radioactive fatty acids for traces of UFA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). No UFA synthesis was detected. Another possible explanation for the observed lack of UFA synthesis was that FabI, the enoyl-ACP reductase of <italic>E. coli</italic>, converted the intermediate <italic>trans</italic>-2-decenoyl-ACP to decanoyl-ACP before the putative isomerase activity of <italic>C. acetobutylicium </italic>FabZ could act. Thus, we repeated the labeling experiment in the presence of a low dose of triclosan, a specific <italic>E. coli </italic>FabI inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], in order to give the putative isomerase a better opportunity to act on the <italic>trans</italic>-2-decenoyl-ACP intermediate.

[<sup>35</sup>S]Methionine labeling showed that strain BL21 (DE3) carrying plasmids encoding either <italic>C. acetobutylicium fabF1 </italic>or <italic>fabZ </italic>under control of a phage T7 promoter expressed proteins of the expected sizes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). However, the expression level of the FabZ protein was so low that it was not detected upon staining the SDS gels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). We attributed this poor expression to the fact that the <italic>C. acetobutylicium FabZ </italic>gene contains 24 codons that correspond to nonabundant (rare) tRNA species in <italic>E. coli</italic>. We therefore changed these codons to synonymous codons that correspond to abundant <italic>E. coli </italic>tRNA species thereby resulting in a modified gene we call <italic>fabZ</italic>m. Plasmid pHW74m (which encoded the His-tagged <italic>fabZ</italic>m under T7 promoter control) abundantly expressed a protein with an apparent mass of 17 kDa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>) in good agreement with the expected value for the His<sub>6</sub>-tagged protein (17.5 kDa). The His<sub>6</sub>-tagged FabZ protein was purified to essential homogeneity using nickel-chelate chromatography (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). We also purified the N-terminally His<sub>6</sub>-tagged versions of <italic>C. acetobutylicium </italic>FabF1 and the <italic>E. coli </italic>fatty acid biosynthetic proteins FabD, FabG, FabA, FabZ, FabB and FabI plus the <italic>Vibrio harveyi </italic>AasS acyl-ACP synthetase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] by nickel-chelate chromatography. AasS was used to synthesize the 3-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP substrate whereas the other enzymes were used to assemble a defined in <italic>vitro </italic>fatty acid synthesis system in which the activities of <italic>E. coli </italic>FabA and <italic>C. acetobutylicium </italic>FabZ or <italic>E. coli </italic>FabB and <italic>C. acetobutylicium </italic>FabF1 could be directly compared. In reactions containing FabA 3-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP was converted to a mixture of <italic>trans</italic>-2 and <italic>cis</italic>-3-decenoyl-ACPs as expected from prior work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. <italic>E. coli </italic>FabB is unable to elongate <italic>trans</italic>-2-decenoyl-ACP, but elongates the <italic>cis</italic>-3 species to 3-keto-<italic>cis</italic>-5-dodecenoyl-ACP in the presence of malonyl-ACP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. This product is then reduced by FabG and dehydrated by FabA to form <italic>trans</italic>-2-<italic>cis</italic>-5-dodecadienoyl-ACP[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The <italic>trans</italic>-2-<italic>cis</italic>-5-dodecadienoyl-ACP product accumulates because the reaction mixtures lacked enoyl-ACP reductase which precluded further elongations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Using this system we showed (as has long been known) that FabA is a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes both the dehydration of 3-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP and well as the reversible isomerization of <italic>trans</italic>-2-decenoyl-ACP to <italic>cis</italic>-3- decenoyl-ACP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). As expected <italic>E. coli </italic>FabZ converted 3-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP to <italic>trans</italic>-2-decenoyl-ACP. However, addition of <italic>E. coli </italic>FabB to this reaction failed to give the 12-carbon unsaturated elongation product seen with FabA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>) in agreement with prior reports that <italic>E. coli </italic>FabZ acts solely as a dehydratase and that FabB is unable to elongate <italic>trans</italic>-2-decenoyl-ACP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. If <italic>C. acetobutylicium </italic>FabZ was capable of the isomerization reaction, then upon addition of <italic>E. coli </italic>FabB the reaction would yield <italic>trans</italic>-2, <italic>cis</italic>-5-dodecadienoyl-ACP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. However, the only product formed was <italic>trans</italic>-2-decenoyl-ACP, the product of <italic>E. coli </italic>FabZ (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). Hence, we conclude that <italic>C. acetobutylicium </italic>FabZ possesses only dehydratase activity and introduction of the <italic>cis </italic>double bond requires another enzyme that has yet to be discovered.

We found that addition of FabF1 gave a modest conversion of <italic>cis</italic>-3-decenoyl-ACP to <italic>trans</italic>-2-<italic>cis</italic>-5-dodecadienoyl-ACP and at 37&#x000b0;C the product yields were lower than those seen at 25&#x000b0;C and 30&#x000b0;C consistent with the low activity of FabF1 at high temperature seen in <italic>vivo </italic>(Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>).</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of <italic>C. acetobutylicium </italic>FabZ and FabF1 in <italic>E. coli</italic></bold>.

Like other Clostridia the <italic>C</italic>.<italic>acetobutylicium </italic>genome encodes none of the three known anaerobic unsaturated fatty acid synthesis pathways denoted by the presence of genes encoding FabM, FabA or FabN proteins. One possibility was that the single FabZ of this bacterium could somehow partition acyl chains between the saturated and unsaturated branches of the pathway. However, our in <italic>vivo </italic>and in <italic>vitro </italic>data show that <italic>C. acetobutylicium </italic>FabZ cannot synthesize the first intermediate in unsaturated fatty acid synthesis. Hence, Clostridia must contain a novel enzyme that introduces the <italic>cis </italic>double bond. Note that the proposed isomerase activity of the <italic>C. acetobutylicium </italic>FabZ was not unreasonable. <italic>C. acetobutylicium </italic>FabZ shares 51.4 and 59.3% identical residues with <italic>E. faecalis </italic>FabN and FabZ, respectively, and there is no sequence signature that denotes isomerase ability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. This is because the isomerase potential of 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratases is not determined by the catalytic machinery at the active site but rather by the &#x003b2;-sheets that dictate the orientation of the central &#x003b1;-helix and thus the shape of the substrate binding tunnel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. We are currently seeking the gene(s) that encode the enzyme responsible for <italic>cis </italic>double bond introduction in <italic>C. acetobutylicium</italic>.</p><p>In contrast to FabZ, the single 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase (FabF) of this bacterium performs the elongation functions required in both branches of the fatty acid synthetic pathway. This protein can both elongate palmitoleoyl-ACP to <italic>cis-</italic>vaccenoyl-ACP as does FabF in <italic>E. coli </italic>and also elongates the <italic>cis </italic>double bond containing product of FabA as does <italic>E. coli </italic>FabB. However, <italic>C. acetobutylicium </italic>FabF, was unable to perform the two tasks simultaneously and thus differs from <italic>Enterococcus faecalis </italic>FabO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Although the <italic>C. acetobutylicium </italic>FabF and <italic>E. faecalis </italic>FabO proteins are 45&#x02013;46% identical to <italic>E. coli </italic>FabF, they are only 55% identical to one another. Hence, each of the three proteins is distinct from the other two. The finding that <italic>C. acetobutylicium </italic>FabF was unable to perform the two tasks simultaneously could be due to the intrinsic temperature sensitivity of FabF1 and to the enzyme undergoing a type of kinetic confusion in this unnatural setting. Perhaps the intermediates of one branch of the pathway act (in effect) as inhibitors of the other branch. In this scenario the presence of the <italic>E. coli </italic>enzyme (either FabB or FabF) would result in the inhibitory intermediates being converted to long chain acyl chains, thereby freeing the <italic>C. acetobutylicium </italic>FabF to operate in the other branch. The complex task faced by FabF1 upon expression in an <italic>E. coli </italic>strain lacking both FabB and FabF is illustrated by the effects of overproduction of FabA and FabB in <italic>E. coli </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Overproduction of FabA results in increased production of saturated fatty acids rather than the increase in unsaturated fatty acid levels that might have been expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In contrast overproduction of FabB has the opposite result; unsaturated fatty acid levels are increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. However, if the two enzymes are simultaneously overproduced, the fatty acid composition returns to normal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. These counter-intuitive results are due to the fact that FabA catalyzes reversible reactions whereas the FabB reaction is irreversible. Hence, when FabB activity is limiting, any excess <italic>cis</italic>-3-decenoyl-ACP produced by FabA can be isomerized back to <italic>trans</italic>-2-decenoyl-ACP and upon FabI action, this acyl chain can enter the saturated arm of the pathway. However, when FabB is in excess, it catalyzes the irreversible elongation of <italic>cis</italic>-3-decenoyl-ACP and thereby pulls the flow of carbon toward the unsaturated branch of the pathway. Thus, it would seem a surprising finding if the <italic>C. acetobutylicium </italic>FabF was able to accurately partition acyl chains between the two branches of the fatty acid synthetic pathway of a foreign organism.</p><p>It should be noted that it was not unexpected that the FabF homologue encoded within the <italic>fab </italic>gene cluster was the only FabF homologue that functioned in fatty acid synthesis. There are good arguments against the other two homologues having this function. The CAC2008 ORF in located within a cluster of genes that appear involved in synthesis of a glycosylated product of a hybrid polyketide-nonribosomal polypeptide pathway. If so, the CAC2008 ORF would be involved in synthesis of the polyketide moiety. The CAA0088 ORF is encoded on the <italic>C. acetobutylicium </italic>megaplasmid required for the late steps of solvent production by this organism. <italic>C. acetobutylicium </italic>survives loss of the megaplasmid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and therefore the CAA0088 ORF cannot encode an enzyme essential for fatty acid synthesis (although it could still provide FabF function). Note that it has been recently reported that the single FabF protein of the distantly related gram positive bacterium <italic>Lactococcus lactis </italic>can also perform the FabB reaction as well as that of FabF[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Unsaturated fatty acid synthesis in Clostridia cannot be explained by a plenipotent FabZ indicating that these bacteria encode a novel enzyme that introduces the <italic>cis </italic>double bond.

The mixtures were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 1 h. To assay <italic>C. acetobutylicium </italic>FabF1, the following incubation 1 &#x003bc;g each of <italic>E. coli </italic>FabD, FabG and FabA, 100 &#x003bc;M NADPH, 100 &#x003bc;M NADH, 100 &#x003bc;M malonyl-CoA, and 1 &#x003bc;g of either <italic>E. coli </italic>FabB or <italic>C. acetobutylicium </italic>FabF1 was added. To assay <italic>C. acetobutylicium </italic>FabZ, the following incubation contained 1 &#x003bc;g each of <italic>E. coli </italic>FabD, FabG and FabB, 100 &#x003bc;M NADPH, 100 &#x003bc;M NADH, 100 &#x003bc;M malonyl-CoA, and 1 &#x003bc;g of <italic>E. coli </italic>FabA or <italic>C. acetobutylicium </italic>FabZ was added. The resulting mixture was incubated for an additional 1 h and the reaction products were analyzed by conformationally sensitive gel electrophoresis on 20% polyacrylamide gels containing 2.5 M urea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>LZ cloned <italic>Clostridium acetobutylicium fabF</italic>s genes, constructed several <italic>fabF </italic>expression vectors and did complementation experiments with <italic>fabF</italic>s expression vectors.
