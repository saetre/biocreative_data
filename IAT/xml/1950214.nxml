Pharmacologic management to improve fracture repair would substantially improve patient outcome. The signaling pathways regulating bone healing are beginning to be unraveled, and they provide clues into pharmacologic management. The &#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway, which activates T cell factor (TCF)-dependent transcription, has emerged as a key regulator in embryonic skeletogenesis, positively regulating osteoblasts. However, its role in bone repair is unknown. The goal of this study was to explore the role of &#x003b2;-catenin signaling in bone repair.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>Western blot analysis showed significant up-regulation of &#x003b2;-catenin during the bone healing process. Using a &#x003b2;-Gal activity assay to observe activation during healing of tibia fractures in a transgenic mouse model expressing a TCF reporter, we found that &#x003b2;-catenin-mediated, TCF-dependent transcription was activated in both bone and cartilage formation during fracture repair. Using reverse transcription-PCR, we observed that several WNT ligands were expressed during fracture repair. Treatment with DKK1 (an antagonist of WNT/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway) inhibited &#x003b2;-catenin signaling and the healing process, suggesting that WNT ligands regulate &#x003b2;-catenin. Healing was significantly repressed in mice conditionally expressing either null or stabilized &#x003b2;-catenin alleles induced by an adenovirus expressing Cre recombinase. Fracture repair was also inhibited in mice expressing osteoblast-specific &#x003b2;-catenin null alleles. In stark contrast, there was dramatically enhanced bone healing in mice expressing an activated form of &#x003b2;-catenin, whose expression was restricted to osteoblasts. Treating mice with lithium activated &#x003b2;-catenin in the healing fracture, but healing was enhanced only when treatment was started subsequent to the fracture.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>These results demonstrate that &#x003b2;-catenin functions differently at different stages of fracture repair. In early stages, precise regulation of &#x003b2;-catenin is required for pluripotent mesenchymal cells to differentiate to either osteoblasts or chondrocytes. Once these undifferentiated cells have become committed to the osteoblast lineage, &#x003b2;-catenin positively regulates osteoblasts. This is a different function for &#x003b2;-catenin than has previously been reported during development. Activation of &#x003b2;-catenin by lithium treatment has potential to improve fracture healing, but only when utilized in later phases of repair, after mesenchymal cells have become committed to the osteoblast lineage.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>In a study in mice Benjamin Alman and colleagues show that &#x003b2;-catenin functions differently in different stages of fracture repair; moreover, activation of &#x003b2;-catenin by lithium improves fracture healing when used in later phases of repair.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="editor"><title>Editors' Summary</title><sec id="sb1a"><title>Background.</title><p>Most people break at least one bone during their life. If the damaged bone is immobilized with a plaster cast or with metal plates and pins, most fractures heal naturally and quickly. Soon after a bone is damaged, cells called pluripotent mesenchymal cells collect at the injury site. Here, they multiply and change (differentiate) into osteoblasts (cells that make bone) and chondrocytes (cells that make cartilage, the dense connective tissue that covers joints). Osteoblasts and chondrocytes mend the fracture by making new bone, a process called ossification. Bone healing involves two types of ossification. In intramembranous ossification, mesenchymal cells and osteoblast progenitor cells make bone directly, forming a hard &#x0201c;callus&#x0201d; within the fracture. In endochondral ossification, mesenchymal cells differentiate into chondrocytes and make cartilage at the fracture site, which osteoblasts turn into bone. Finally, the bone made by both types of ossification is remodeled so that it closely resembles the damaged bone's original shape and strength.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>Unfortunately, fractures do not always heal efficiently. If healing is delayed, additional surgery may be needed to repair the break. But surgery can be risky, so drug-based ways of encouraging bone repair would be very useful. To develop such treatments, researchers need to understand what controls the differentiation and activity of osteoblasts and chondrocytes during normal healing. In this study, the researchers have investigated the role of the &#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway in bone repair. This pathway regulates bone formation during embryonic development, a process that closely resembles bone healing. &#x003b2;-catenin is usually degraded rapidly in cells. However, if a member of a particular family of proteins known as the WNT family binds to a WNT receptor on the surface of a cell, &#x003b2;-catenin moves into the cell's nucleus where it interacts with a protein called T cell factor (TCF). This interaction activates the transcription (the copying of DNA into messenger RNA, which is used to make proteins) of numerous genes and alters the behavior of the cell.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers first measured &#x003b2;-catenin levels in mouse and human bones. In both species, much more &#x003b2;-catenin was made in bones undergoing repair than in intact bones. Then they studied TCF reporter mice&#x02014;animals in which TCF controls the expression of a marker gene. &#x003b2;-catenin-mediated TCF-dependent transcription, they report, was activated during both bone and cartilage formation after a fracture in these mice. Next, the researchers made mice that could be induced to express an inactive form of &#x003b2;-catenin or a stabilized (permanently active) form of &#x003b2;-catenin in all the cells in a bone fracture. Expression of inactive &#x003b2;-catenin slowed the rate of healing but, unexpectedly, so did expression of stabilized &#x003b2;-catenin. Osteoblast-specific expression of inactive &#x003b2;-catenin also delayed bone healing, whereas osteoblast-specific expression of stabilized &#x003b2;-catenin enhanced the process. Finally, treatment of wild-type mice with lithium (which prevents the degradation of &#x003b2;-catenin) enhanced bone healing if given after a fracture, but interfered with it if given before.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These findings indicate that &#x003b2;-catenin signaling (which, the researchers show, is mainly activated by WNT signaling) has different effects at different stages of bone repair. Early in the process, it controls the ratio of osteoblasts and chondrocytes made from the pluripotent mesenchymal cells. Consequently, too much or too little &#x003b2;-catenin interferes with bone healing at this stage. Later on, &#x003b2;-catenin promotes the differentiation of osteoblasts and enhances their ability to make bone, and so too little &#x003b2;-catenin at this stage prevents healing, whereas increased &#x003b2;-catenin levels stimulate healing. These findings need to be confirmed in people before testing agents that affect &#x003b2;-catenin signaling for their effects on human bone healing. Nevertheless, the researchers' final discovery that lithium improves bone healing if given at the right time is particularly encouraging; lithium is widely used to treat one form of depression so could be readily tested in clinical trials.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040249">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040249</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>MedlinePlus encyclopedia contains pages on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000001.htm">broken bones</ext-link> and on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002966.htm">bone fracture repair</ext-link> (in English and Spanish)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Wikipedia has pages on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture">bone fracture</ext-link> and on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_healing">bone healing</ext-link> (note: Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit; available in several languages)</p></list-item><list-item><p>The UK National Health Service Direct encyclopedia provides pages on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?articleId=166">broken bones</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p>Animations of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://commons.bcit.ca/biology/ossification/files/ossification.html">intramembranous and endochondral ossification</ext-link> are available from the Ministry of Advanced Education, Training and Technology, Province of British Columbia, Canada</p></list-item><list-item><p>The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons has an <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/fact/thr_report.cfm?Thread_ID=125&#x00026;topcategory=General&#x00025;20Information">informative discussion of fractures</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p>The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto (where the authors of this study are affiliated) has a Web site called <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sickkids.ca/default.asp">SickKids</ext-link>, which contains a page on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sickkids.ca/childphysiology/">child physiology</ext-link>, including diagrams of bone development</p></list-item></list></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Chen Y, Whetstone HC, Lin AC, Nadesan P, Wei Q, et al.

In the initial phase of fracture repair, undifferentiated mesenchymal cells aggregate at the site of injury, proliferate, and differentiate, presumably in response to growth factors produced by the injured tissues &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040249-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. This process involves both intramembranous and endochondral ossification. Intramembranous ossification involves the formation of bone directly from committed osteoprogenitor cells and undifferentiated mesenchymal cells that reside in the periosteum, resulting in hard callus formation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040249-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040249-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. During endochondral ossification, mesenchymal cells differentiate into chondrocytes, producing cartilaginous matrix, which then undergoes calcification and eventually is replaced by bone. The formation of primary bone is followed by extensive remodeling until the damaged skeletal element regains original shape and size. These processes are reminiscent of embryonic bone development, suggesting that fracture repair recapitulates normal bone development &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040249-b004">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040249-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. When fracture healing is impaired, osteoblastic differentiation is inhibited, and undifferentiated mesenchymal tissue remains at the fracture site. In patients, this outcome results in delayed union, or nonunion, usually requiring additional surgery for successful fracture healing. In certain surgeries, such as spinal fusion surgery or total joint replacement, a lack of bone ingrowths results in a failed outcome and the need for additional surgery. A pharmacologic adjunct to improve bone healing has the potential to avoid the need for additional surgery in these cases, improving patient outcomes.</p><p>&#x003b2;-catenin signaling has emerged as a key regulator of embryonic bone development &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040249-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040249-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. Secreted WNT ligands and antagonists of WNT signaling bind to the transmembrane receptors including low-density lipoprotein jureceptor-related protein 5/6 (LRP5/6) and frizzled (FZ) to regulate the WNT pathway. WNT signaling activation produces a cytoplasmic signaling cascade leading to the transcriptional regulation of gene expression, cytoskeletal reorganization, and calcium flux &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040249-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. Signaling through the canonical WNT pathway is initiated by the binding of appropriate WNT ligands to the FZs and LRP5/6 co-receptor. In the absence of appropriate WNT ligands, &#x003b2;-catenin is targeted for phosphorylation, ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation by a multi-protein complex comprising glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3&#x003b2;), adenomatous polyposis coli, and axin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040249-b010">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040249-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. In the presence of an appropriate WNT ligand, this multi-protein complex is dissociated by dishevelled (DVL), an intracellular mediator that plays a central role in transducing the signal from the receptor complex, leading to the activation of &#x003b2;-catenin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040249-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. Hence, &#x003b2;-catenin cannot be targeted for degradation and translocates to the nucleus, where in concert with members of the T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) family, activates the transcription of a wide range of genes. During embryonic skeletogenesis, inhibition of &#x003b2;-catenin signaling can block osteoblast differentiation and shift pluripotent mesenchymal cells to develop a chondroblastic phenotype &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040249-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040249-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. &#x003b2;-catenin signaling also can regulate bone mass, and its activation results in increased bone density &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040249-b016">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040249-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Although the histology and general mechanism of fracture repair are clear and well established, much remains to be understood about the process of bone healing, particularly at the molecular signaling level. Based on a microarray analysis, it was found that WNT pathway members are expressed during fracture repair &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040249-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. DVL is expressed during fracture repair and when blocked using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), inhibits both proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040249-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>WNT1-induced secreted protein 1 (WISP1),</italic> a WNT target gene, is also expressed during fracture healing, and overexpression of this gene increases proliferation but decreases the differentiation in a chondrocytic cell line &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040249-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;.

Based on these findings, it is likely that &#x003b2;-catenin plays a role in fracture repair. In this study, we aimed at investigating how &#x003b2;-catenin signaling functions during fracture healing, and to test for the effect of lithium treatment. Since lithium is a pharmacologic agent already approved for use in patients, this approach could be developed into a novel therapy to improve bone healing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ad-DKK1 and Ad-Cre</title><p>Dickkopf 1 (DKK1) is a secreted protein that binds to LRP5/6 and Kremen proteins, blocking canonical WNT signaling.

These data, therefore, not only support our notion that &#x003b2;-catenin signaling functions differently at different stages of fracture repair, but more importantly, raises the possibility that lithium treatment can be used to enhance bone repair.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we demonstrated that &#x003b2;-catenin signaling plays a crucial role in fracture healing. We observed that precise regulation of &#x003b2;-catenin is important in the early phases of fracture healing to allow differentiation of mesenchymal cells into osteoblast and chondrocyte lineages. Our findings also indicate that &#x003b2;-catenin plays a disparate role in undifferentiated mesenchymal cells and in committed osteoblasts, and as such acts differently during different phases of fracture repair. These findings are important not only for understanding the role of &#x003b2;-catenin in different cell types, but also has a practical implication for therapy&#x02014;pre-fracture lithium treatment inhibits the repair process, but post-fracture treatment enhanced bone healing. As such, lithium will enhance fracture healing, but only if started after cells have become committed to the osteoblast lineage.</p><p>During fracture repair, &#x003b2;-catenin-mediated TCF-dependent transcription is not activated in the earliest mesenchymal tissues present at the fracture site. Once cells that begin to show phenotypic features of either chondrocyte or osteoblast precursors, they exhibit &#x003b2;-catenin-mediated TCF-dependent transcription activity, suggesting a role in the initial phases of differentiation. In osteoblast lineage cells, &#x003b2;-catenin signaling activity decreased in later phases of differentiation, as osteoblasts matured into osteocytes. This finding is in agreement with a previous in vitro study, in which van der Horst and colleagues also observed a down-regulation of &#x003b2;-catenin signaling during the formation of a mineralized bone matrix in KS483 cells undergoing late phase osteoblast differentiation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040249-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;, suggesting a similar role for &#x003b2;-catenin in osteoblasts in fracture healing. During limb development, &#x003b2;-catenin is expressed in prechondrogenic mesenchymal cells but is significantly decreased in differentiated chondrocytes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040249-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;. However, in our study, we found that &#x003b2;-catenin-mediated TCF-dependent transcription was also activated in chondrocytes and, to a lesser extent, in prehypertrophic chondrocytes. Thus, the range of activity for &#x003b2;-catenin mediated TCF-dependent transcription in chondrocytes is greater in fracture healing than in development, suggesting that &#x003b2;-catenin plays a role in chondrocytes over a broader range of differentiation in repair than in development.</p><p>Our results showed that many WNT ligands and receptors are selectively up-regulated during bone healing, several of which (e.g., WNT4, WNT10b, and LRP6) are known to activate the canonical WNT pathway &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040249-b036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040249-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. Moreover, our data showing that DKK1 treatment inhibits &#x003b2;-catenin signaling and suppresses fracture repair suggest that the canonical WNT pathway is the dominant mechanism regulating &#x003b2;-catenin during bone healing. Since multiple WNT ligands that activate &#x003b2;-catenin signaling are expressed during the repair process, there is likely functional redundancy. However, our results do not exclude the possibility that noncanonical WNT pathways are also likely activated during fracture repair, as WNT5a and WNT11 can signal through the WNT/Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> pathway, which regulates Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> flux and Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-sensitive protein kinases and transcription factors, such as PKC&#x003b1; and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040249-b038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040249-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;. WNT11 can also activate the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040249-b047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040249-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;. Indeed, in our study, we not only noticed that WNT11 was expressed during fracture healing, but also observed an activation of both WNT5a and its mediator PKC&#x003b1;. These results suggest that the role for WNT ligands in fracture repair is complex, potentially involving activation of multiple pathways (i.e., canonical and noncanonical WNT pathways).</p><p>We observed that &#x003b2;-catenin-mediated TCF-dependent transcription is activated during both chondrogenesis and osteogenesis in fracture repair. Mice expressing conditional &#x003b2;-catenin null alleles after treatment of Cre recombinase failed to heal, and there was a lack of bone and cartilage at the fracture site. The histology studies showed immature mesenchymal cells at the fracture sites. This finding is not unexpected given the role of &#x003b2;-catenin during fetal bone development, in which conditional deficiency in early osteoblast progenitors results in a blockade of osteoblast differentiation, with immature mesenchymal cells persisting &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040249-b049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040249-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d;. However, fractures also failed to heal in <italic>Catnb<sup>lox(ex3)</sup></italic> mice whose &#x003b2;-catenin-encoding gene had been stabilized by treatment with Cre recombinase. The fracture site in this case was also composed of immature mesenchymal cells, suggesting a block to differentiation. This observation was in stark contrast to the results from <italic>&#x003b1;1(I)-Catnb<sup>stab</sup></italic> mice, which expressed osteoblast-specific stabilized &#x003b2;-catenin alleles; these mice exhibited significantly enhanced bone healing. Thus, during fracture healing, Cre-mediated conditional &#x003b2;-catenin stabilization represses differentiation of these mesenchymal cells, perhaps maintaining these cells in an undifferentiated proliferative state. Previous in vitro studies and studies of bone development provide evidence to support this notion, as WNT signaling activation maintains mesenchymal stem cells in a less differentiated state during osteogenic differentiation, and stabilization of &#x003b2;-catenin can interfere with the differentiation of precursors into chondrocytes as well as osteoblasts during development &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040249-b049">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040249-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d;. In cells that have already adopted an osteoblast phenotype, &#x003b2;-catenin signaling activation works differently; that is, it promotes osteoblastic differentiation and enhances osteogenesis. Therefore, the level of &#x003b2;-catenin needs to be precisely regulated at the earliest phase of fracture healing to allow for proper differentiation.</p><p>Interestingly, fractures in <italic>&#x003b1;1(I)-Catnb<sup>null</sup></italic> mice healed with abundant cartilage matrix at the fracture site, while <italic>Catnb<sup>tm2Kem</sup></italic> mice in which conditional &#x003b2;-catenin null alleles were regulated by Ad-Cre mainly exhibited undifferentiated mesenchymal-like cells at the fracture site. These data imply that mesenchymal precursors that have already become committed to an osteoblast phenotype will adopt a chondroblastic phenotype instead if &#x003b2;-catenin is absent. This result agrees with data from bone development, which show that osteoblast precursors lacking &#x003b2;-catenin are blocked in differentiation and develop into chondrocytes instead &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040249-b049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040249-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Our findings raise the possibility that therapy to activate &#x003b2;-catenin could be used to enhance fracture repair. However, since activation of &#x003b2;-catenin signaling inhibits differentiation of mesenchymal cells not yet committed to the osteoblastic phenotype, such treatment should be utilized only after cells are committed to the osteoblast lineage. One potential therapeutic agent is lithium, which activates the canonical WNT signaling through inhibition of GSK3&#x003b2; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040249-b041">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040249-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;, and has demonstrated its capacity to increase bone formation and improve bone mass in mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040249-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;.
