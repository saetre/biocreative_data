To cope with these complex microbial challenges, intestinal epithelial cells produce a diverse repertoire of protein antibiotics from multiple distinct protein families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>). These proteins are secreted apically into the luminal environment of the intestine where they play a pivotal role in protecting against enteric infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>) and may also function to limit opportunistic invasion by symbiotic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>).</p><p>We previously identified lectins as a novel class of secreted antibacterial proteins in the mammalian intestine. RegIII&#x003b3; is a member of the RegIII subgroup of the C-type lectin family and is expressed in the small intestine in response to microbial cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>), stored in epithelial cell secretory granules, and released into the small intestinal lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). Similarly, HIP/PAP (hepatointestinal pancreatic/pancreatitis-associated protein; the human ortholog of RegIII&#x003b3;)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6">6</xref> is expressed in the human intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>) and is up-regulated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). These proteins are produced in multiple epithelial lineages, including enterocytes and Paneth cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>). Both RegIII&#x003b3; and HIP/PAP are directly bactericidal at low micromolar concentrations for Gram-positive bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>), revealing a previously unappreciated biological function for mammalian lectins. The antibacterial functions of RegIII&#x003b3; and HIP/PAP are dependent upon binding bacterial targets through interactions with peptidoglycan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). As peptidoglycan is localized on surfaces of Gram-positive bacteria but is buried in the periplasmic space of Gram-negative bacteria, this binding activity provides a molecular explanation for the Gram-positive specific bactericidal effects of these lectins. Although the mechanism of lectin-mediated antibacterial activity remains unclear, RegIII&#x003b3; and HIP/PAP have been shown to elicit extensive damage to the cell surfaces of targeted bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we show that C-type lectin bactericidal activity is under stringent post-translational control. RegIII&#x003b3; and HIP/PAP each undergo <italic>in vivo</italic> proteolytic removal of a flexible anionic N-terminal prosegment that maintains the proteins in a biologically inactive state. NMR spectroscopy suggests that the prosegment functions by controlling a two-state conformational switch between the biologically active and inactive states of the protein. We propose that this regulatory mechanism allows the host to restrict expression of RegIII lectin antibacterial activity to the intestinal lumen. Together, our findings represent a unique example of post-translational control of C-type lectin biological activity, and provide novel insight into the regulation of lectin-mediated innate immunity in the mammalian intestine.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Purification of Endogenous RegIII</italic>&#x003b3;&#x02014;Endogenous RegIII&#x003b3; was purified from the small intestines of C57BL/6 mice. Intestinal tissues were homogenized in 20% acetic acid solution containing protease inhibitors using a pre-chilled homogenization probe and lysed by sonication using a Misonix XL sonicator. The extract was dialyzed against 25 m<sc>m</sc> MES pH 5.0, 25 m<sc>m</sc> NaCl and was loaded onto a cation exchange column (SP-Sepharose, Sigma). The column was washed with 25 m<sc>m</sc> MES pH 5.0, 150 m<sc>m</sc> NaCl, and eluted with 25 m<sc>m</sc> MES pH 5.0, 500 m<sc>m</sc> NaCl. The eluate was concentrated and loaded onto a Sephacryl S-100 column (GE Healthcare). RegIII&#x003b3;-containing fractions were identified by Western blot, pooled, and purified by passage over immobilized anti-RegIII&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). The eluate was concentrated, transferred to Immobilon P, and subjected to Edman degradation on an ABI494 sequencer (PE Biosystems) to determine the N-terminal sequence.</p><p><italic>Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins</italic>&#x02014;Recombinant pro-RegIII&#x003b3; (rpro-RegIII&#x003b3;) and rpro-HIP/PAP were expressed and purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). To generate the recombinant processed form of RegIII&#x003b3;, a 417-bp amplicon was generated using the rpro-RegIII&#x003b3; expression construct (pET3a-RegIII&#x003b3;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>) as template and the specific primers 5&#x02032;-ATTGCGAGG<underline>CATATG</underline>AGCAGCTGCCCCAAGGGCTCCC-3&#x02032; (forward) and 5&#x02032;-CTATGG<underline>GGATCC</underline>CTAGGCCTTGAATTTGCAGACATAGGGT-3&#x02032; (reverse). The forward primer contained an NdeI restriction site (underlined) for cloning into pET3a. The reverse primer contained the native stop codon followed by an engineered BamHI site (underlined). The amplicon was digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated into NdeI/BamHI-digested pET3a (Novagen). Similarly, the rHIP/PAP expression construct was generated using pET3a-HIP/PAPmut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>) as template and specific primers 5&#x02032;-ATTGCGAGGCATATGATTCGATGTCCAAAAGGCTCCAAG-3&#x02032; (forward) and 5&#x02032;-CTATGGTGATCATCAGTGAACTTTGCAGACATAGGGTAACC-3&#x02032; (reverse). The forward primer contained an NdeI site (underlined) while the reverse primer contained a BclI site (underlined) after the native stop codon. The amplicon was digested with NdeI and BclI and ligated into NdeI/BamHI-digested pET3a. Point mutations were introduced into rpro-HIP/PAP using the QuikChange II Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and specific primers harboring the desired mutations. Expression and purification of recombinant wild-type and mutant proteins was carried out as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). Antimicrobial assays and peptidoglycan binding assays were carried out as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). Proteins were stored at &#x02013;20 &#x000b0;C for a maximum of 1 week prior to assay.</p><p><italic>Immunoblotting</italic>&#x02014;Intestinal extracts were prepared from wild-type C57BL/6 or MMP7<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice (Jackson Laboratories) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). Extracts from human intestinal tissues were prepared by extraction in acetic acid as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). 20 &#x003bc;g of each extract was loaded onto 15% SDS-PAGE gels and blotted onto Immobilon P (Millipore). Blots were probed with anti-RegIII&#x003b3; antiserum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>) and goat anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences), and were detected by chemiluminescence using the Pierce SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent detection kit.</p><p><italic>In Vitro Trypsin Proteolytic Processing</italic>&#x02014;Recombinant pro-RegIII&#x003b3; and pro-HIP/PAP were digested with bovine pancreatic trypsin (Sigma) at a 1:200 molar ratio of trypsin:lectin at 37 &#x000b0;C for 2 h. Proteins were immediately analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 15% gels, and were subjected to N-terminal Edman sequencing.</p><p><italic>NMR Spectroscopy</italic>&#x02014;To prepare samples for NMR experiments, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RILP transformed with expression plasmids were grown in M9 minimal media containing 1 g/liter of <sup>15</sup>NH<sub>4</sub>Cl for uniformly <sup>15</sup>N-labeled samples, further substituting unlabeled glucose with 3 g/liter of <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-glucose for uniformly <sup>15</sup>N/<sup>13</sup>C-labeled samples. RegIII&#x003b3; and HIP/PAP were purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). Backbone <sup>15</sup>N, <sup>13</sup>C, and <sup>1</sup>H chemical shift assignments of rpro-HIP/PAP were generated from triple resonance NMR data recorded at 25 &#x000b0;C using a cryoprobe-equipped Varian Inova 600 MHz spectrometer.

All spectra were processed using NMRPipe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>) and analyzed with NMRView (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p><italic>RegIII</italic>&#x003b3; <italic>Is Proteolytically Processed by Trypsin in Vivo</italic>&#x02014;Two distinct forms of endogenous RegIII&#x003b3; are present in the mouse small intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). The higher molecular weight form co-migrates at &#x0223c;16.5 kDa with recombinant RegIII&#x003b3; that lacks its N-terminal secretion signal, while the lower molecular weight form migrates at &#x0223c;15 kDa. The presence of the lower molecular weight form suggested that RegIII&#x003b3; might be proteolytically processed <italic>in vivo</italic>. To test this idea we purified endogenous RegIII&#x003b3; from mouse small intestine by acid extraction, gel filtration chromatography, and antibody affinity chromatography. Edman sequencing of the purified proteins verified that the higher molecular weight RegIII&#x003b3; form indeed harbors an N terminus (Glu<sup>27</sup>) that is generated by removal of the signal sequence (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). The N terminus of the lower molecular weight form is Ser<sup>38</sup>, corresponding to the predicted trypsin cleavage site located at Arg<sup>37</sup>&#x02013;Ser<sup>38</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). This site is conserved among all mouse and human RegIII family members (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>), and is also present in other Reg subfamilies including RegI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) of both RegIII&#x003b3; forms did not reveal any further modifications of the protein (data not shown). These results indicate that the N terminus of endogenous mouse RegIII&#x003b3; is proteolytically processed by trypsin or a trypsin-like protease <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Small intestinal &#x003b1;-defensins are a distinct family of antimicrobial peptides that also undergo N-terminal proteolytic processing. While human &#x003b1;-defensins are processed by trypsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>), the processing enzyme for mouse &#x003b1;-defensins is matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>). To verify that MMP-7 is not the processing enzyme for mouse RegIII&#x003b3; we performed Western blots on small intestinal tissue extracts from wild-type and MMP7<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice. Both RegIII&#x003b3; forms were detectable in MMP7<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>), establishing that MMP-7 is dispensable for RegIII&#x003b3; processing. Thus, RegIII&#x003b3; and &#x003b1;-defensins are processed by distinct proteases in the mouse small intestine.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>FIGURE 1.</label><caption><p><bold>RegIII&#x003b3; is proteolytically processed by trypsin <italic>in vivo</italic>.</bold><italic>A</italic>, purification and N-terminal sequencing of endogenous mouse RegIII&#x003b3; reveals processing at the conserved N-terminal trypsin site. <italic>B</italic>, conserved canonical trypsin site (indicated by <italic>arrow</italic>) is present near the N terminus of mouse and human RegIII family members.

Proteins were digested with a 1:200 molar ratio of trypsin:lectin and were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. N-terminal sequencing verified cleavage at Arg<sup>37</sup>&#x02013;Ser<sup>38</sup> and Arg<sup>37</sup>&#x02013;Ile<sup>38</sup>, respectively.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc0110967420001"></graphic></fig></p><p>In the human small intestine, HIP/PAP is the predominantly expressed ortholog of RegIII&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>) and performs a similar antibacterial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). Immunoblotting of human small intestinal extract revealed two forms of HIP/PAP with different molecular weights, suggesting that HIP/PAP is also expressed as a pro-protein that is proteolytically processed <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref>). Although the small amounts of HIP/PAP present in human tissue presented an obstacle to purification and sequencing, we established that the lower molecular weight form co-migrates with recombinant HIP/PAP engineered to lack the 11 amino acids N-terminal to the predicted Arg<sup>37</sup>&#x02013;Ile<sup>38</sup> trypsin cleavage site (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref>). The idea that the HIP/PAP N terminus is processed <italic>in vivo</italic> by trypsin is supported by two additional observations. First, two trypsin isoforms are produced by human small intestinal epithelia and have been shown to process other intestinal proteins <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). Second, <italic>in vitro</italic> incubation of recombinant pro-HIP/PAP (rpro-HIP/PAP) with bovine trypsin (at a 1:200 molar ratio of enzyme to lectin) resulted in quantitative cleavage at Arg<sup>37</sup>&#x02013;Ile<sup>38</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>E</italic></xref>).</p><p><italic>Proteolytic Processing by Trypsin Activates RegIII Lectin Antimicrobial Activity</italic>&#x02014;We next investigated the biological relevance of lectin proteolytic processing. To test the hypothesis that processing regulates RegIII lectin antibacterial activity, we incubated recombinant pro-RegIII&#x003b3; (rpro-RegIII&#x003b3;) with trypsin <italic>in vitro</italic> and quantitated antimicrobial activity against <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> in standard antibacterial assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). Mock-digested rpro-RegIII&#x003b3; exhibited limited antibacterial activity, with <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> numbers declining by 68% in the presence of 10 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> rpro-RegIII&#x003b3; (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). However, trypsin-digested rpro-RegIII&#x003b3; exhibited enhanced antibacterial potency, with <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> numbers declining by &#x0003e;96% in the presence of 10 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> of digested RegIII&#x003b3; (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). A comparison of proteolytically cleaved and uncleaved rpro-HIP/PAP yielded similar results (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>). The enhanced activity of trypsin-cleaved HIP/PAP is not attributable to the N-terminal prosegment itself, as addition of 50 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> of synthetic N-terminal peptide to <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> did not affect bacterial viability (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>).

We noted that the rpro-HIP/PAP is labile and the N terminus is progressively removed over time during storage at 4 &#x000b0;C (supplemental Fig. S1). The presence of small amounts of mature HIP/PAP is thus likely to account for the antibacterial activity of protein preparations derived from recombinant prosegment-containing lectins. This may also explain why we detect modest antibacterial activity in rpro-RegIII&#x003b3; and rpro-HIP/PAP following mock digestion for 2 h at 37&#x000b0;C (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic></xref>).</p><p><italic>N-terminal Acidic Residues Are Essential for Prosegment Inhibitory Activity</italic>&#x02014;We next sought to gain insight into the inhibitory mechanism of the RegIII lectin N-terminal prosegment. We noted the presence of either two or three acidic residues (Glu or Asp) at conserved positions in both mouse and human RegIII family members (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>). To evaluate the functional importance of the three acidic residues contained within the HIP/PAP prosegment (Glu<sup>27</sup>, Glu<sup>28</sup>, and Glu<sup>32</sup>), we mutated combinations of these residues to Ala and assessed the mutant rpro-HIP/PAP proteins for antibacterial activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>).

We therefore used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to structurally characterize the interaction between HIP/PAP and its N-terminal prosegment. Using uniformly <sup>15</sup>N,<sup>13</sup>C-labeled pro-HIP/PAP and standard triple resonance methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>) we assigned the chemical shifts of 98% of the backbone resonances. We first analyzed the conformational dynamics of pro-HIP/PAP by measuring <sup>15</sup>N relaxation rates, which are influenced by fast (ps-ns) and slow (&#x003bc;s-ms) motions of backbone amides throughout a protein. In particular, we measured rate constants for spin-lattice relaxation (R<sub>1</sub>), and spin-spin relaxation (R<sub>2</sub>), finding that the ratio of these values (R<sub>1</sub>/R<sub>2</sub>) was highest in residues 27&#x02013;34 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>). This indicates a high degree of backbone conformational mobility at the N terminus. Furthermore, TALOS analyses of backbone chemical shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>) and <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>1</sup>H NOEs indicated that the prosegment adopts an extended structure.

Given that acidic amino acids in the N terminus are essential for prosegment inhibitory activity, we hypothesized that interactions with nearby HIP/PAP basic residues may be required for repression of antibacterial activity. Because the prosegment is only 11 amino acids in length, we reasoned that it was likely to be constrained to local interactions with amino acids near the trypsin site. Examination of the HIP/PAP primary sequence revealed three basic residues (Arg<sup>39</sup>, Lys<sup>42</sup>, Lys<sup>45</sup>) positioned immediately C-terminal to the Arg<sup>37</sup>&#x02013;Ile<sup>38</sup> cleavage site (Figs. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1<italic>B</italic></xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6<italic>A</italic></xref>). While introduction of a single mutation (R39A) was insufficient to activate antimicrobial activity in rpro-HIP/PAP, mutation of all three basic amino acids to alanine (rpro-HIP/PAP-RKK/AAA) yielded a prosegment-containing variant that exhibited potent antibacterial activity, producing a &#x0003e;99% decline in <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> viability (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref>). Critically, the presence of these mutations had no effect on the antimicrobial activity of the mature protein lacking the prosegment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>C</italic></xref>). These data demonstrate that basic HIP/PAP residues, positioned C-terminal to the trypsin site, are essential for prosegment inhibitory activity but are dispensable for antibacterial function.</p><p><italic>Structural Effects of Activating Pro-HIP/PAP Mutations</italic>&#x02014;Overall, these results suggested a model in which the prosegment maintains HIP/PAP in an inactive state through transient interactions between acidic N-terminal residues and basic residues positioned C-terminal to the trypsin site. Mutation of these charged residues derepresses HIP/PAP antibacterial activity in the prosegment-containing protein, thus mimicking the derepression that occurs when the peptide is removed by proteolysis. To further examine this interaction we compared <sup>15</sup>N/<sup>1</sup>H heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra of rpro-HIP/PAP glutamic acid-to-alanine mutants with the wild-type protein (supplemental Fig. S2). We observed significant chemical shift changes (&#x00394;&#x003b4; &#x0003e; 0.05 ppm) only in residues N-terminal to and including Ile<sup>38</sup> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>A</italic></xref>). This verified that the gain-of-function phenotype produced by the EEE/AAA and RKK/AAA mutations did not result from gross protein misfolding. Furthermore, the lack of significant chemical shift changes in the main body of the protein argues against prosegment inhibitory activity being related to global changes in the core HIP/PAP structure. Notably, <sup>15</sup>N/<sup>1</sup>H HSQC spectra of HIP/PAP with and without the wild-type prosegment showed no significant chemical shift changes aside from those at the trypsin cleavage site, confirming that proteolysis itself also does not cause a global conformational change (data not shown). Analysis of peak intensity did not reveal evidence of prosegment-modulated dimer or oligomer formation, even at the high concentration (300 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) used for NMR spectroscopy (data not shown). However, as these spectra were collected in the absence of ligand, the possibility remains that multimer formation may occur in the presence of peptidoglycan ligands.</p><p>We noted a striking co-linear pattern of change in key N-terminal backbone amide chemical shifts when comparing the <sup>15</sup>N/<sup>1</sup>H HSQC spectra of rpro-HIP/PAP and single, double or triple glutamic acid-to-alanine mutants.

Such a co-linear chemical shift pattern signifies a molecule that is in conformational equilibrium between two states, with intermediate chemical shifts deriving from a population-weighted average of these states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). Furthermore, the additivity of these chemical shift changes indicates a simple, non-cooperative interaction between the charges on the prosegment and the rest of the HIP/PAP protein. Notably, similar chemical shift changes for the Ser<sup>35</sup>&#x02013;Ile<sup>38</sup> segment were observed in the activated rpro-HIP/PAP-RKK/AAA mutant, suggesting that the same conformational change is being triggered from the &#x0201c;opposite&#x0201d; side of the putative charge/charge interaction (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>B</italic></xref>). Close inspection of the <sup>15</sup>N/<sup>1</sup>H HSQC spectrum for this mutant shows that peaks for residues Ser<sup>35</sup>&#x02013;Ile<sup>38</sup> are doubled on this vector, indicative of further conformational exchange occurring on a slow time scale. Collectively, these data support a model in which perturbation of the interaction between HIP/PAP and its prosegment drives a shift in the conformational equilibrium toward a biologically active state (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). Our data further suggest that the degree to which the prosegment shifts the HIP/PAP population to the inactive state is simply determined by the number of intramolecular charge-charge interactions rather than any specific ordering of the prosegment against the core HIP/PAP structure.</p><p><table-wrap position="float" id="tbl1"><label>TABLE 1</label><caption><p><bold>Simple additivity of chemical shift differences in HIP/PAP E/A mutants</bold></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top"/><th colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top"><bold>S35</bold></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top"><bold>A36</bold></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top"><bold>R37</bold></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top"><bold>I38</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left" valign="top"/><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top"><italic>ppm</italic></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top"><italic>ppm</italic></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top"><italic>ppm</italic></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top"><italic>ppm</italic></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left" valign="top"> E/A<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn1"><italic>a</italic></xref> (E32A) </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top"> 0.565 </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top"> 0.265 </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top"> 0.543 </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top"> 0.399 </td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left" valign="top"> EE/AA<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn1"><italic>a</italic></xref> (E27A/E28A) </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top"> 0.542 </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top"> 0.268 </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top"> 0.318 </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top"> 0.510 </td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left" valign="top"> EEE/AAA<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn1"><italic>a</italic></xref> (E27A/E28A/E32A) </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top"> 1.017 </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top"> 0.511 </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top"> 0.859 </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top"> 0.872 </td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left" valign="top"> Calculated EEE/AAA<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn2"><italic>b</italic></xref> (E/A + EE/AA) </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top"> 1.107 </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top"> 0.533 </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top"> 0.861 </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top"> 0.909 </td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn1"><label>a</label><p>Chemical shift differences (&#x00394;&#x003b4;<sub>TOT</sub>) were obtained using the following equation: &#x00394;&#x003b4;<sub>TOT</sub> = [&#x00394;&#x003b4;<sup>1</sup>H)<sup>2</sup> + (&#x003c7; &#x000d7; &#x00394;&#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N)<sup>2</sup>]<sup>1/2</sup> (normalized for proton with the scale factor &#x003c7; = 0.17, established from estimates of atom-specific chemical shift ranges in a protein environment) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>).</p></fn><fn id="tblfn2"><label>b</label><p>Calculated chemical shift differences were determined by &#x00394;&#x003b4;TOT = &#x00394;&#x003b4;E/A + &#x00394;&#x003b4;EE/AA.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p><fig position="float" id="fig7"><label>FIGURE 7.</label><caption><p><bold>Structural effects of activating pro-HIP/PAP mutations.</bold><italic>A</italic>, chemical shift changes in the <sup>15</sup>N/<sup>1</sup>H HSQC spectra of rpro-HIP/PAP and the activated mutant rpro-HIP/PAP-EEE/AAA are plotted as a function of residue number.

However, little is known about how RegIII antibacterial activity is regulated. In this report we show that RegIII lectins are subject to repression by an inhibitory N-terminal prosegment that is removed <italic>in vivo</italic> by trypsin. This represents a novel regulatory mechanism governing C-type lectin biological activity. The inhibitory activity of the N-terminal segment depends on charge-charge interactions with the main body of the protein. Derepression of antibacterial activity occurs when these interactions are perturbed, either through proteolytic removal of the prosegment or by mutation of the charged residues (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig8"><label>FIGURE 8.</label><caption><p><bold>Model of HIP/PAP prosegment inhibition of antibacterial activity.</bold> The HIP/PAP hinge region (<italic>dashed line</italic>) undergoes a two-state conformational shift between a closed (<italic>inhibited</italic>) and an open (<italic>active</italic>) form. Maintenance of the closed, inactive state depends on transient interactions between negatively charged prosegment residues and positively charged residues on the HIP/PAP core protein. Inhibition is relieved either by cleavage at a conserved trypsin site in the hinge region, or by mutation of either charged region, leading to a &#x0223c;1000-fold increase in antibacterial activity. Note that the hinge region in the activating mutants is in a constitutively open form, as demonstrated by NMR. We propose that disruption of prosegment-core protein interactions alleviates inhibition by unmasking a region (<italic>shown in white</italic>) necessary for bacterial cell surface damage or for multimerization that may be required for bactericidal activity.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc0110967420008"></graphic></fig></p><p>This regulatory mechanism may have evolved to give the host control over the timing and location of the expression of RegIII antibacterial activity. As RegIII lectin antibacterial activity involves damage to microbial cell surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>), it is possible that these proteins could also damage host cell membranes. This would suggest a need to maintain RegIII lectins in an inactive state prior to their luminal release. Two trypsin isozymes are expressed in human gut epithelial cells and are stored as inactive zymogens that are activated by proteolysis in the intestinal lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). It thus seems likely that trypsin-mediated activation of RegIII proteins occurs only after they are secreted. Given the fact that we were able to detect processed RegIII&#x003b3; and HIP/PAP in small intestinal tissue extracts, we cannot completely rule out the possibility of some intracellular cleavage. However, it is likely that this reflects extracellular processing of proteins that are trapped in the mucus layer that overlies the intestinal epithelium. Thus, we propose that this regulatory mechanism evolved to ensure that lectin bactericidal activity is inhibited during intracellular storage, and activated upon secretion into the gut lumen.</p><p>In the small intestine, members of the &#x003b1;-defensin family of antimicrobial peptides also require activation through proteolytic removal of an N-terminal prosegment by specific intestinal proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). While trypsin is the processing enzyme for at least one member of the human &#x003b1;-defensin family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>), mouse &#x003b1;-defensins undergo processing by matrix metalloproteinase-7 (matrilysin; MMP-7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>). Our findings demonstrate that trypsin coordinately activates multiple innate immune effector proteins in both mice and humans, suggesting that this protease may function as a central regulator of diverse intestinal antibacterial responses in multiple host species.</p><p>Our results indicate that HIP/PAP prosegment inhibitory activity is governed by interactions between acidic prosegment residues and cationic residues on the remainder of the protein. The prosegments of key intestinal &#x003b1;-defensins confer inhibitory activity through a similar charge-charge interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>). However, our results suggest that the functional outcome of this interaction is quite different in the two protein families. The &#x003b1;-defensin prosegment neutralizes cationic amino acids that bind to negatively charged bacterial phospholipids and are thus essential for antibacterial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>). In contrast, while HIP/PAP cationic amino acids are required for peptide inhibitory activity, they are dispensable for antibacterial function, indicating that the HIP/PAP prosegment represses antibacterial activity through a distinct mechanism. This is consistent with our finding that RegIII&#x003b3; and HIP/PAP bind to bacterial surfaces through specific recognition of peptidoglycan, and that this binding interaction is not modulated by the prosegment. Collectively, these observations suggest that the RegIII lectins may mediate their antibacterial functions via mechanisms that differ from the &#x003b1;-defensins.</p><p>NMR spectroscopy has provided structural insight into the HIP/PAP-prosegment interaction. Our analysis revealed a distinctive colinear correspondence between backbone amide shifts as point mutations were made to either side of a putative charge-charge interaction pair. Notably, point mutants with derepressed killing activity demonstrated the greatest degree of chemical shift changes. Such correspondence between structural and functional changes is distinctive, and has previously been observed in several other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>). The linearity of this behavior further suggests that intramolecular interactions between HIP/PAP and its N-terminal prosegment govern a shift between two states with differing activities. Although the physical basis for this shift is not yet clear, we envision at least three possibilities. One is that disruption of HIP/PAP-prosegment interactions results in allosteric changes in residues that are physically distant from the N terminus. This seems very unlikely given the limited chemical shift changes observed outside the N-terminal region in comparisons of the wildtype and EEE/AAA <sup>15</sup>N/<sup>1</sup>H HSQC spectra. A second possibility is that the activating mutations increase accessibility of the trypsin site to cleavage. However, the lack of HIP/PAP proteolysis in our <italic>in vitro</italic> antibacterial assays suggests that this is unlikely to explain the enhanced bactericidal activity of the activated pro-HIP/PAP mutants (supplemental Fig. S3). A third possibility is that disruption of the HIP/PAP-prosegment interaction unmasks surfaces on the HIP/PAP core structure that are required for bactericidal activity, and that our chemical shift changes reflect a hinging motion of the prosegment away from the rest of the protein. Such movement could allow the HIP/PAP molecule to adopt an optimal conformation to damage microbial cell surfaces, or could induce formation of multimers that may be required for bactericidal activity (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). The latter of these two mechanisms has been observed in other systems in which bactericidal activity requires formation of protein oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>). Although our NMR spectra did not show evidence of HIP/PAP multimerization at high concentration (300 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) in the absence of ligand, it is possible that such association requires both the presence of peptidoglycan ligands and the disruption of HIP/PAP-prosegment interactions.</p><p>In summary, we have uncovered a novel mechanism controlling C-type lectin biological activity. We propose that impaired regulation of RegIII antibacterial activity in human populations could result in compromised intestinal immunity and a predisposition to enteric infections and inflammation.
