Such an arrest raises the question: how can the quiescent meiotic cell cycle be precisely awakened or re-started? At least in principle, the answer to this phenomenon, which we refer to as &#x0201c;The Sleeping Beauty Kiss,&#x0201d; might have two molecular solutions: the controlled expression of a protein that re-starts the cell cycle, or the inactivation of an inhibitory protein that prevents such a re-start. We show here that the re-start of the meiotic cycle in <italic>Drosophila</italic> depends on both mechanisms: the controlled expression of an &#x0201c;activator&#x0201d; known as Polo kinase, and the presence of a regulatory protein called Matrimony (Mtrm), which binds to and physically inactivates Polo. Indeed, Mtrm is the first known protein inhibitor of Polo kinase. The excess of Mtrm prior to the time of normal meiotic re-start, keeps Polo inactive. However, either the production of an excess quantity of Polo, or the destruction of Mtrm, at the appropriate time, releases active Polo, permitting a properly controlled re-start of meiotic progression.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>The restart of the meiotic cycle in <italic>Drosophila</italic> depends on both the controlled expression of Polo kinase and a protein called Matrimony (Mtrm), which binds to and physically inactivates Polo.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Xiang Y, Takeo S, Florens L, Hughes SE, Huo LJ, et al.

One can imagine that both the maintenance and the termination of this arrest might involve either or both of two mechanisms&#x02014; the transcriptional or translational repression of a protein that induces NEB, and thus meiotic entry, or the presence of an inhibitory protein that precludes entry into the first meiotic division. Because <italic>Drosophila</italic> females exhibit a prolonged G2 arrest (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050323-g001">Figure 1</xref>) and are amenable to both genetic and cytological analyses, they provide an ideal system in which to study this problem.</p><fig id="pbio-0050323-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Oocyte Development in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic></title><p>This figure displays a schematic depiction of oocyte development showing the timing (in hours) of the relevant stages. The end of meiotic prophase, as defined by SC dissolution, occurs at stages 5&#x02013;6. By the end of stages 5&#x02013;6, the chromosomes have condensed into a dense mass known as the karyosome, as pointed out by Mahowald and Kambysellis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050323-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. The karyosome remains compacted until stages 8&#x02013;10, at which time it decondenses and a high level of transcription is observed. The chromosomes recompact during stages 11 and 12 to form a tight mass that is released into the cytoplasm upon NEB at stage 13. The end of pachytene is separated from NEB by approximately 40 h.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0050323.g001"/></fig><p>The ovaries of <italic>Drosophila</italic> females are composed of a bundle of ovarioles, each of which contains a number of oocytes arranged in order of their developmental stages &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050323-b001">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050323-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. For our purposes, the process of oogenesis may be said to consist of three separate sets of divisions: the initial stem cell divisions, which create primary cystoblasts; four incomplete cystoblast divisions, which create a 16-cell cyst that contains the oocyte; and the two meiotic divisions. Although a great deal is known regarding the mechanisms that control cystoblast divisions and oocyte differentiation, relatively little is known about the mechanisms by which the progression of meiosis is controlled.</p><p>As is the case in many meiotic systems, female meiosis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> involves preprogrammed developmental pauses. The two most prominent pauses during <italic>Drosophila</italic> meiosis are an arrest that separates the end of pachytene at stages 5&#x02013;6 from NEB at stage 13, and a second pause that begins with metaphase I arrest at stage 14 and continues until the egg passes through the oviduct. It is the release of this second preprogrammed arrest event that initiates anaphase I and allows the completion of meiosis I followed by meiosis II. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050323-g001">Figure 1</xref>, the end of meiotic prophase by dissolution of the synaptonemal complex (SC) at stages 5&#x02013;6 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050323-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050323-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d; is separated from the beginning of the meiotic divisions, which is defined by NEB at stage 13, by approximately 40 h to allow for oocyte growth.</p><p>We are interested in elucidating the mechanisms that arrest meiotic progression at the end of prophase, but then allow onset of NEB and the initiation of meiotic spindle formation some 40 h later. One intriguing possibility is that during this period of meiotic arrest, the oocyte actively blocks the function of cell cycle regulatory proteins such as cyclin dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1), the phosphatase Cdc25, and Polo kinase (Polo), all of which promote meiotic progression just as they do during mitotic growth. Recently, Polo was shown to be expressed in the germarium and required for the proper entry of <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes into meiotic prophase, as defined by the assembly of the SC &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050323-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. Decreased levels of Polo resulted in delayed entry into meiotic prophase, whereas overexpression of Polo caused a dramatic increase in the number of cystocyte cells entering meiotic prophase, indicating that Polo is involved both in the initiation of SC formation and in the restriction of meiosis to the oocyte. How then is Polo, which is known to play multiple roles in promoting meiotic and mitotic progression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050323-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050323-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;, prevented from compelling the differentiated oocyte to proceed further into meiosis?</p><p>One component of this regulation may well lie in the fact that Polo is not expressed during much of oogenesis. As shown below, Polo is clearly visible in the germarium but is then absent until stage 11, when it begins to accumulate to high levels in the oocyte (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050323-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). We show here that a second component of Polo regulation is mediated by binding to the protein product of the <italic>matrimony</italic> (<italic>mtrm</italic>) gene, which occurs from stage 11 until the onset of NEB at stage 13. This binding serves to inhibit Polo in the early stages of its expression, and thus prevents precocious nuclear envelope breakdown.</p><p>The <italic>mtrm</italic> gene was first identified in a deficiency screen for loci that were required in two doses for faithful meiotic chromosome segregation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050323-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>mtrm/&#x0002b;</italic> heterozygotes display a significant defect in achiasmate segregation (the meiotic process that ensures the segregation of those homologs that, for various reasons, fail to undergo crossingover). As a result of this defect, <italic>mtrm/&#x0002b;</italic> heterozygotes exhibit high levels of achiasmate nondisjunction. As homozygotes, <italic>mtrm</italic> mutants are fully viable but exhibit complete female sterility. We show here that the Mtrm protein prevents precocious NEB. Indeed, as discussed below, the effects of reducing the dose of <italic>mtrm</italic> on meiotic progression and on chromosome segregation are easily explained as the consequence of precocious NEB at stages 11 or 12, and can be suppressed by simultaneously reducing the copy number of <italic>polo<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic>. In addition, the effects of heterozygosity for loss-of-function alleles of <italic>mtrm</italic> can be phenocopied by increasing the copy number of <italic>polo<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic>. These genetic interactions suggest that Mtrm negatively regulates Polo in vivo.</p><p>Interestingly, Mtrm was shown to interact physically with Polo by a global yeast two-hybrid study &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050323-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. We demonstrate that this yeast two-hybrid finding reflects a true physical interaction in vivo by both coimmunoprecipitation studies and by multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) mass spectrometry experiments, which indicate that Mtrm binds to Polo with an approximate stoichiometry of 1:1. Moreover, ablating one of the two putative Polo binding sites on Mtrm by mutation prevents the physical interaction between Polo and Mtrm and renders the mutated Mtrm protein functionless. This experiment, along with genetic interaction studies, provides compelling evidence that the function of the binding of Mtrm to Polo is to inhibit Polo, and not vice versa.</p><p>The analysis of <italic>mtrm</italic> mutants allows us to examine the effects of premature Polo function during oogenesis. Our evidence shows that in the absence of Mtrm, newly synthesized Polo is capable of inducing NEB from stage 11 onward. As a result of this precocious NEB, chromosomes are not properly compacted into a mature karyosome and they are released prematurely onto the meiotic spindle. In many cases, the centromeres of achiasmate bivalents subsequently fail to co-orient.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The <italic>mtrm</italic> Gene Encodes a 217&#x02013;Amino Acid Protein Whose Expression Is Limited to the Period between the End of Pachytene and the Onset of NEB</title><p>The <italic>mtrm</italic> gene was first identified as a dosage-sensitive meiotic locus; heterozygosity for a loss-of-function allele of <italic>mtrm</italic> specifically induced the failed segregation of achiasmate homologs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050323-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;.

Indeed, the majority (11/15) of those oocytes that underwent bivalent individualization eventually formed bipolar spindles with the chiasmate chromosomes properly balanced on the metaphase plate (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050323-g004">Figure 4</xref> of Harris et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050323-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;).

In general, enzymes are usually not recovered from affinity purifications at levels similar to their targets. They do not form stable complexes, but rather form transient interactions with their substrates, which is how efficient catalysis is achieved. Here, Mtrm is able to sequester activated Polo away in a stable binary complex over a long period of time. It is only when this equilibrium is disturbed at the onset of stage 13 by the production of an excess of Polo (as suggested in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050323-g009">Figure 9</xref>) or by degradation of Mtrm that Polo can be released.

For chiasmate bivalents, this is apparently not a problem, because they still co-orient correctly (for example, the chiasmate <italic>X</italic> chromosomes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050323-g008">Figure 8</xref> still achieve proper co-orientation in the vast majority of oocytes). However, the nonexchange bivalents frequently fail to co-orient properly, such that both homologs are oriented toward the same pole (but often occupy two different arcs of the spindle). This initial failure of proper co-orientation leads to high frequencies of nondisjunction as demonstrated by the genetic studies and analysis of metaphase I images presented in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050323-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Although achiasmate homologs are properly co-oriented in wild-type oocytes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050323-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050323-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d; , we have noted previously such homologs can often vacillate between the poles such that two achiasmate homologs are often found on the same arc of the same half-spindle during mid to late prometaphase (&#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050323-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d; and unpublished data). These chromosomes are often observed to be physically associated. This situation is quite different from the defect observed in <italic>mtrm/&#x0002b;</italic> heterozygotes, where the homologs are neither physically associated nor on the same arc of the spindle.</p><p>It is tempting to suggest that the chromosome segregation defects we observe in <italic>mtrm/&#x0002b;</italic> heterozygotes are simply the result of precocious release of an incompletely re-compacted karyosome. According to this explanation, the defects observed in meiotic chromosome segregation are solely the consequence of premature NEB. (Implicit in this model is the assumption that it is the events that occur during karyosome re-compaction, at stages 11 and 12, that serve to initially bi-orient achiasmate chromosomes, and we do not have direct evidence to support such a hypothesis.)</p><p>Alternatively, Polo plays multiple roles in the meiotic process &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050323-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050323-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;, and it is possible that the chromosome segregation defects we see represent effects of excess Polo that are un-related to the precocious breakdown of the nuclear envelope. Such a view is supported by two observations. First, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050323-g007">Figure 7</xref>, the bivalent individualization observed after NEB in <italic>mtrm</italic>/&#x0002b; oocytes does not disrupt <italic>FM7-X</italic> pairings. Second, although heterozygosity for <italic>twine</italic> in <italic>mtrm<sup>126</sup>/&#x0002b;</italic> heterozygotes suppresses the frequency of precocious NEB from 42&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050323-g005">Figure 5</xref>) to less than 10&#x00025; (7/72), two alleles of <italic>twine</italic> tested (<italic>twe<sup>1</sup></italic> and <italic>twe<sup>k08310</sup></italic>) failed to suppress the levels of meiotic nondisjunction observed in <italic>FM7/X; mtrm<sup>126</sup>/&#x0002b;</italic> heterozygotes. These data suggest that the effects of excess Polo on nondisjunction may not be regulated <italic>via</italic> Cdc25/Twine, but rather by the effects of excess Polo on some other as-yet-unidentified Polo target. This suggests that the effects of Mtrm on the level of Polo might affect multiple Polo-related processes.</p><p>Support for such an idea that Mtrm can inhibit Polo-regulated proteins that are unrelated to NEB comes from the observation that the ectopic expression of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Mtrm in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Schizosaccharomyces pombe</named-content> blocks karyokinesis, producing long multi-septate cells with only one or two large nuclei (&#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050323-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d; and Bruce Edgar, personal communication). This phenotype is similar, if not identical to, that exhibited by mutants in the <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. pombe</named-content> Polo homolog <italic>plo1</italic> (Plo1), which fail in later stages of mitosis due to the role of Plo1 in activating the septation initiation network to trigger cytokinesis and cell division. However, Plo1 also plays a role in bipolar spindle assembly that might also be inhibited in the Mtrm expressing cells, but this function of Plo1 is less well understood.</p><p>Thus the possibility exists that the effect of <italic>mtrm</italic> mutants on meiotic chromosome segregation may well not be the direct consequence of early NEB, but rather may be due to the role of Polo in other meiotic activities, such as spindle formation or the combined effects of these defects with precocious NEB. Efforts to identify such processes and their components are underway in the lab.</p><p>Finally, we should note that while Mtrm is the first known protein that is able to inactivate Polo by physical interaction with Polo itself; there is certainly additional mechanisms of Polo regulation. For example, Archambault et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050323-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d; have described mutants in the gene that encodes Greatwall/Scant kinase, which have both late meiotic and mitotic defects. Although there is no evidence for a physical interaction between these two kinases, the authors speculate that the function of the Greatwall kinase serves to antagonize that of Polo. The <italic>Scant</italic> mutations create a hyperactive form of Greatwall, which might be expected to lower the dosage Polo, and thus perhaps partially suppress the defects observed in <italic>mtrm/&#x0002b;</italic> heterozygotes. Indeed, exactly such a suppressive effect has been observed in <italic>Scant</italic> homozygotes (however, this suppression is much weaker than that obtained by heterozygosity for loss of function alleles of <italic>polo</italic>).</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Summary</title><p>The data presented above demonstrate that Mtrm acts as a negative regulator of Polo during the later stages of G2 arrest during meiosis. Indeed, both the repression of Polo expression until stage 11 and the inactivation of newly synthesized Polo by Mtrm until stage 13 play critical roles in maintaining and properly terminating G2 arrest. Our data suggest a model in which the eventual activation of Cdc25 by an excess of Polo at stage 13 triggers NEB and entry into prometaphase. Although our data do shed some light on the mechanism by which Mtrm inhibits Polo, it is not entirely clear whether Polo's ability to phosphorylate targets other than Cdc25 might be blocked by Mtrm::Polo binding. These issues will need to be addressed in the future studies. Finally, we note that although small molecule inhibitors of Polo have been identified &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050323-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;, Mtrm represents the first case of a protein inhibitor of Polo.

Perhaps that might best be accomplished through a screen for oocyte-specific Polo-interacting proteins.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> stocks.</title><p>Throughout this study, a <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> stock served as our normal sequence <italic>X</italic> wild-type control, and for achiasmate <italic>X</italic> chromosome studies, <italic>FM7/yw</italic> was used as wild-type control.
