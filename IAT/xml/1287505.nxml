The mechanisms regulating chromosome segregation in human cells are therefore of great interest. Recently it has been reported that human cells without an <italic>hSecurin</italic> gene lose chromosomes at a high frequency.

After a few passages <italic>hSecurin<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells became chromosomally stable and executed mitoses normally. This was unexpected, as the securin loss resulted in a persisting reduction of the sister-separating protease separase and inefficient cleavage of the cohesin subunit Scc1.

Indeed, mouse embryonal stem cells lacking both forms of separase regulation suffer from precocious sister chromatid separation under mitotic checkpoint arrest &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. Another level of control is probably exerted by shugoshin, which prevents removal of centromere-specific cohesin before the onset of anaphase &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Our findings demonstrate that deletion of <italic>hSecurin</italic> has little or no effect on long-term chromosome segregation fidelity in human cells. In fact, our results even raise the possibility that the chromosomal instability (CIN) phenotype observed in early passages of the <italic>hSecurin</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells might have been caused by insults during the deletion process rather than by loss of securin per se.</p><p>Alternatively, cells might upregulate other control pathways in response to loss of securin, thereby regaining chromosomal stability. Comparative gene expression profiling before and after loss of <italic>hSecurin</italic> might reveal compensatory changes in the expression of genes involved in anaphase regulation. We therefore compared the transcriptomes of the HCT116 parent and the <italic>hSecurin</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cell line using the Affymetrix U133A chip. Indeed, significantly different expression levels were found for <italic>PLK2</italic> (Polo-like kinase 2), <italic>RCC1</italic> (regulator of chromosome condensation 1, also known as chromosome condensation 1 &#x0005b;<italic>CHC1</italic>&#x0005d;), and <italic>SMC6L1</italic> (SMC6 structural maintenance of chromosomes 6-like 1) (unpublished data). However, future experiments will be required to determine the physiological significance of these findings and whether the above proteins might play a currently unknown role in the other two known regulations of sister chromatid separation.</p><p>In summary, we have shown that securin is not required for chromosomal stability in human cells. Our results affect current mathematical models of colorectal cancer investigating the role of genetic instability in tumorigenesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. The crucial effect attributed to CIN is acceleration of the mutation rate. However, our data indicated that a CIN-causing mutation may not reach fixation in a given cell compartment, which should therefore change existing assumptions on the evolution of CIN lesions and their growth rates.</p><p>Finally, implications of this study extend beyond mechanisms leading to chromosomal instability and affect possible strategies for cancer therapy. It has been suggested that, as stability pathways of tumor cells are defective, cancer cells may be more sensitive to stress-inducing agents and they should be especially susceptible to attack by instability-inducing drugs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. However, our results suggest that targeting a particular pathway may not destroy a cell but rather activate alternative pathways. A search and detailed characterization of these alternative pathways will provide further clues to the nature of CIN in human cancers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell lines</title><p>The colorectal cell line HCT116 was used as parent cell line.
