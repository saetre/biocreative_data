However, recent genotyping studies suggest that additional regions of MSP1 may be under selective pressure, including a locus of intragenic recombination designated as block 4 within the 3' region of the gene.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The current study examined the antibody response to the two parental and two recombinant forms of block 4 and to blocks 16-17 (3D7) in study populations from Colombia, Papua New Guinea and Cameroon that differ in malaria transmission intensity and ethnic composition.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>IgM and IgG antibodies were detected against parental and recombinant MSP1 block 4 peptides in all three populations. Overall, 32-44% of the individuals produced IgM to one or more of the peptides, with most individuals having IgM antibodies reactive with both parental and recombinant forms. In contrast, IgG seropositivity to block 4 varied among populations (range 15-65%), with the majority of antibodies showing specificity for one or a pair of block 4 peptides. The IgG response to block 4 was significantly lower than that to blocks 16-17, indicating block 4 is subdominant. Antibodies to block 4 and blocks 16-17 displayed distinct IgG subclass biases, with block 4 responses biased toward IgG3 and blocks 16-17 toward IgG1. These patterns of responsiveness were consistently observed in the three study populations.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Production of antibodies specific for each parental and recombinant MSP1 block 4 allele in different populations exposed to <italic>P. falciparum </italic>is consistent with balancing selection of the MSP1 block 4 region by the immune response of individuals in areas of both low and high malaria transmission.

The MSP1 gene has been divided into 17 sequence blocks that are conserved, semi-conserved, or variable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The semi-conserved and variable regions are generally dimorphic, with the prototype MSP1 alleles represented by the K1 and MAD20 parasite isolates. Exceptions to this dimorphism are tripeptide repeat sequences comprising block 2, which are of variable length and composition, and a RO33 non-repetitive block 2 variant. In addition, the MSP1 gene contains several loci of intragenic recombination which represent another potential source of antigenic polymorphism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. While it has been suggested that intragenic recombination can occur throughout the MSP1 gene, recombination sites in the 5' region (conserved blocks 3 and 5, and variable block 4) and in the 3' region (block 17) have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Sequence analysis of 34 full-length MSP1 sequences has provided no evidence of recombination in blocks 6 through 16 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>In a previous study, the genetic composition of polymorphic MSP1 regions of <italic>P. falciparum </italic>obtained from Buenaventura, Colombia, an area of low, seasonal malaria transmission was examined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. There was restricted genetic diversity of MSP1 in this population, with a high level of conservation within blocks 2, 6, and 16-17 that corresponded exclusively to the MAD20 allelic type. In contrast, four MSP1 block 4 types corresponding to the K1 and MAD20 parental and recombinant sequences were detected. The persistence of both parental and recombinant alleles of block 4 despite the restricted heterogeneity throughout the rest of the gene suggested that block 4 allelic diversity may be under balancing selection.</p><p>This study examined the recognition of MSP1 block 4 by antibodies of humans exposed to <italic>P. falciparum </italic>infection in order to begin to address the potential immunological significance of MSP1 block 4 sequence variability. The study populations examined were from three different countries with varying <italic>P. falciparum </italic>transmission intensities. IgM and IgG antibodies to block 4 peptides were measured to determine the seroprevalence and magnitude of the block 4 responses. The specificity of antibodies produced against block 4 epitopes were characterized as cross-reactive or allele-specific, and thus capable of discriminating among parental and recombinant block 4 sequences. Finally, the IgG isotype distribution of antibodies specific for block 4 as compared to those specific for blocks 16-17 was compared. A basic question addressed in these experiments was: are antibodies specific for each parental and recombinant MSP1 block 4 allele found in different populations exposed to <italic>P. falciparum</italic>? If so, this would be consistent with balancing selection of the MSP1 block 4 region by the immune response of individuals in areas of both low and high malaria transmission.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study populations</title><p>The patient samples examined were archived sera collected from regions of varying endemicity for <italic>P. falciparum </italic>malaria.

Briefly, antigen-coated microspheres were mixed with diluted plasma (1:100 dilution) in microtiter plates and incubated on a microplate shaker (Lab-line, Melrose Park, IL) for 1 hour at 500 rpm. After incubation, the plates were washed and microspheres resuspended in buffer containing 1 mg/ml R-phycoerythrin-conjugated, F(ab')2 fragment, goat anti-human IgG (Fc&#x003b3; fragment specific) (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) or R-phycoerythrin-conjugated, F(ab')2 fragment, donkey anti-human IgM (Fc5&#x003bc; fragment specific) (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA).

For IgG subclass-specific assays, diluted plasma was incubated with antigen-coated microspheres in microtiter plates on a microplate shaker (Lab-line, Melrose Park, IL) for 1 hour at 500 rpm. After incubation, the plates were washed and microspheres resuspended in buffer containing the appropriate secondary antibody diluted to 1:1000 (mouse anti-human IgG1 Fc fragment specific (Calbiochem) or mouse anti-human IgG3 (Southern Biotechnology)).

In order to establish a cut-off for positive samples, frequency distribution curves for median fluorescent intensity (MFI) values were plotted for each antigen and the corresponding limits for negative and positive samples were determined. This allowed for a better assessment of the cut-off than the mean MFI plus three standard deviations of the negative serum controls. The following cut-off values were used in this study: block 4 peptides IgM: 800 MFI; block 4 peptides IgG: 600 MFI; blocks 16-17 polypeptide IgM: 500 MFI; blocks 16-17 polypeptide IgG: 2000 MFI; block 4 peptides and blocks 16-17 polypeptide IgG subclasses: 100 MFI.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Mean MFI values were calculated for positive samples for each peptide or polypeptide antigen.

Correlation of MFI values for pairs of peptides were calculated using Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient (r).

The magnitude of IgG responses to block 4 tended to be lower than IgG responses to blocks 16-17, and these differences were statistically significant for all block 4 peptides for Papua New Guinea and for block 4-2 for Colombia (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Among block 4-specific antibodies, the predominant response was to the parental alleles, with the 68% of positive Colombian sera reacting with block 4-2 (MAD20); 20% and 15% of positive sera from PNG reacting with peptides 4-1 (K1) and 4-2 (MAD20), respectively. In contrast , 27% of Cameroonian sera reacted with peptides 4-1 (K1) and 4-4 (MAD20/K1 recombinant) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). A portion of the samples, however, contained antibodies that recognized both a parental and one recombinant block 4 peptide, usually blocks 4-1 + 4-3 and blocks 4-2 + 4-4 combinations Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). No sample recognized the combination of blocks 4-2 + 4-3 or block 4-3 + 4-4 combination. These observations, along with the correlations observed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, suggest that in the IgG response (1) there are major block 4 epitopes that are unique to the two parental block 4 sequences, (2) there are epitopes that are shared between parent and recombinant forms (eg. between blocks 4-1 and 4-3 and between blocks 4-2 and 4-4, and (3) cross-reactive IgG antibodies are rare between the two parental and between the two recombinant block 4 peptides.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison of overall seroprevalence of block 4 and blocks 16-17 antibodies</title><p>In considering the seropositivity of the various study populations, it is helpful to examine the total seropositivity (IgM + IgG) presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> since the responses were largely IgM responses in the low endemicity area (Colombia) but had switched to IgG responses in areas of higher endemicity (PNG and Cameroon).

While extensive studies have analysed the immune responses to the MSP1 block 2 repeat region and blocks 16-17, few immunological studies have been performed on MSP1 block 4. Immune recognition of this region was first shown using a mouse monoclonal antibody that bound an isolate-specific epitope within block 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Later, human antibodies were detected to one allelic form of block 4 in sera of German adults following <italic>P. falciparum </italic>infection and in Burkina Fasoan infants and adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The seroprevalence of anti-block 4 IgG antibodies was lower in German adults undergoing a primary (14%) or subsequent (21%) responses compared to Burkina Fasoan infants (50%) following initial malaria infections. Subsequently, allele-specific antibodies to MSP1 block 4 were detected in sera of malaria-exposed individuals in a study utilizing a panel of MSP1 recombinant polypeptides that included peptides spanning block 4 of the K1, MAD20 and RO33 parasites isolates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. IgG reactive with MAD20, K1 and RO33 block 4 were detected in children (1-5 y), adolescents (6-14 y), and adults (&#x0003e;14 y). The seroprevalence of antibodies was similar for all three block 4 sequences in adults, while the responses were more variable among children and adolescents. However, little was known about the specificity and cross-reactivity of IgM and IgG block 4 antibodies prior to the current study.</p><p>In this study, immune recognition of dimorphic and recombinant MSP1 block 4 peptides by IgM and IgG antibodies from malaria-exposed subjects from Colombia, Papua New Guinea and Cameroon was evaluated. For comparison, antibody responses to the MSP1 C-terminal 42 kDa region (blocks 16-17), which is highly immunogenic in malaria-infected individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] were examined. Despite the diverse characteristics of the study populations, a consistent pattern emerged with respect to IgM and IgG antibody recognition of block 4 and blocks 16-17. Sera from all three populations contained IgM and IgG antibodies to the block 4 synthetic peptides and to blocks 16-17. For IgM, MSP1 block 4 and blocks 16-17 seroprevalences in most instances were similar ranging from 44% and 66% in Colombia, 32% and 35% in Papua New Guinea, and 40% and 43% in Cameroon, respectively. In contrast, IgG seroprevalences were much lower for MSP1 block 4 than for blocks 16-17 in the three populations. When IgM and IgG recognition are combined, more than half of the individuals from each population produced antibodies recognizing MSP1 block 4, while more than 80% produced antibodies to MSP1 block 16-17.</p><p>The similarity in prevalence and magnitude of the IgM response to MSP1 block 4 and blocks 16-17 suggests that these regions are equi-dominant during the initial immune response in contrast to dominance of a later MSP1 IgG response specific for the blocks 16-17. Thus, it appears that exposure to <italic>P. falciparum </italic>MSP1 through natural infection in all endemic settings generally resulted in the preferential expansion of IgG-producing B cells specific for blocks 16-17 over those specific for MSP1 block 4. Studies on humans naturally exposed to malaria infection have reported high seroprevalence levels of antibodies against MSP1 C-terminal epitopes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>The IgM response, which reflects the repertoire of early B cells that have not undergone isotype-switching, was highly cross-reactive among the parental and recombinant block 4 sequences as demonstrated by pair-wise comparisons (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). This high level of cross-reactivity is remarkable since only ~28% sequence homology exists among block 4 parental and recombinant sequences. IgM antibodies may be directed against amino acid residues shared by all four block 4 sequences or, alternatively, may display low affinity binding of similar conformational determinants preserved among the alleles by conservative amino acid substitutions. It is notable that cross-reactive block 4 IgM antibodies were also detected in cord blood samples from Papua New Guinea indicating that these antibodies may be produced by the foetus during the response to malaria antigens in utero.</p><p>The IgG block 4 response was specific and clearly discriminated among MSP1 block 4 sequences. A majority of individuals produced IgG antibodies specific for one of the two parental block 4 peptides (i.e., K1 or MAD20) and these antibodies may contribute to isolate-specific immunity to <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. A subgroup of samples had IgG antibodies that cross-reacted with epitopes shared by one parental and one recombinant allele. Pair-wise comparisons of IgG levels to MSP1 block 4 peptides (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), as well as the specificity of individual samples (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>) mapped these two allelic epitopes to dimorphic sequences localized within a 19 amino acid region upstream of the putative block 4 recombination site (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). However, in all three study populations, IgG antibodies highly specific for the prototype K1 (Block 4-1) and MAD20 (block 4-2) sequences were more prevalent than antibodies recognizing the recombinant (block 4-3 and 4-4) forms.</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Mapping of dimorphic allelic IgG MSP1 Block 4 epitopes</bold>.

Parasites expressing all four MSP1 block 4 sequences were found in this low-transmission region. In the current study, Colombian sera exhibited the highest block 4 IgM seroprevalence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), the highest cross-reactivity of IgM for the four peptide pairs (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), but the most restricted IgG specificity for single block 4 peptides compared to the other two higher-transmission regions. In Papua New Guinea and Cameroon, where higher malaria transmission occurs, a much broader range of specificities developed, including a higher proportion of sera containing IgG that recognized two or more block 4 allelic sequences.</p><p>IgG subclass analysis revealed that MSP1 block 4 and blocks 16-17 epitopes also differ in isotype switching preference. In general, the majority of samples contained both IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies to blocks 16-17, whereas, the response to block 4 was more polarized, with one cluster of samples containing either high levels of IgG3 with or without lower levels of IgG1 and a second cluster of samples containing predominantly IgG1. While block 4 induced both IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies, a greater proportion of these antibodies are biased toward a high IgG3 response than observed for blocks 16-17. When IgG subclass data were analysed by geographic region, it appeared that production of IgG3 antibodies, particularly against block 4, was dependent on malaria transmission intensity. A relatively high IgG1 and low IgG3 seroprevalence was seen against block 4 in the area of lowest malaria transmission while the prevalence of IgG3 antibodies was higher in the intermediate transmission region and maximal in the area of highest transmission, exceeding the IgG1 seroprevalence.</p><p>The potential relevance of the MSP1 block 4-specific antibody response to protective immunity remains to be explored. Antibodies against the MSP1 83 kDa processing fragment containing block 4 can inhibit the growth of <italic>P. falciparum </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], as well as block the activity of inhibitory antibodies to the MSP1 C-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. MSP1 block 2 antibodies, which are predominantly IgG3[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], are highly efficient in mediating the monocyte-dependent antibody-mediated cellular inhibition (ADCI) of <italic>P. falciparum </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. It has been suggested that variant MSP1 epitopes, such as the block 2 repeat region, are more likely to stimulate B cells that class switch to IgG3 production, and that these antibodies may be more effective in mediating ADCI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Since many serum samples recognizing MSP1 block 4 peptides contained high levels of IgG3 in the current study, these block 4 antibodies may exert biological activity against blood stage parasites through monocyte-mediated inhibition of parasite growth.</p><p>The observation that individuals in the low transmission region produce antibodies against only a single block 4 peptide while those from intermediate and high malaria transmission regions produce antibodies against multiple block 4 peptides suggests that antibodies against the complete array of block 4 sequences may be associated with increased immunity to malaria. Differences in seropositivity among small numbers of individuals primed by natural infection may allow parasites expressing certain block 4 alleles to survive in individuals lacking antibodies against those particular alleles. Thus, balancing selection, ie. frequency dependent immune selection of block 4 peptide alleles within the parasite population, would exist at all transmission intensities but may be more forceful in areas of higher malaria transmission. Given this scenario, a polyvalent block 4 vaccine should induce immunity to all four alleles, even in individuals naturally primed against only one or a few block 4 alleles.</p><p>Subdominant epitopes play an important role in immunity to viral pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and it has been suggested that subdominant epitopes may be important in immunity to <italic>Plasmodium </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This possibility is particularly pertinent in view of the lack of protective efficacy of a highly-immunogenic MSP1 42 kDa C-terminal vaccine in children in a recent Phase IIb trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. To date, the only blood-stage malaria vaccine that has been documented to provide partial protection in a Phase I-2b trial, is the Combination B vaccine containing MSP1 blocks 3 and 4 fused to a universal circumsporozoite protein T cell epitope along with merozoite surface protein-2 and the ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Genetic analyses indicating that MSP1 block 4 may be a locus of balancing selection along with the results of the current study demonstrating IgG discrimination among block 4 allelic peptides and increased production of anti-block 4 antibodies of certain IgG subclasses in areas of high malaria transmission suggest that the immune response to MSP1 block 4 epitopes is biologically and evolutionarily relevant and may contribute to the protective antibody response to <italic>P. falciparum</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SPC conceived of and coordinated the study, performed the data analysis and drafted the manuscript.
