We found that loss-of-function alleles of the protein phosphatase 7 (AtPP7) are responsible for the light hypersensitivity in <italic>psi2</italic> demonstrating that AtPP7 controls the levels of phytochrome signaling. Plants expressing reduced levels of AtPP7 mRNA display reduced blue-light induced cryptochrome signaling but no noticeable deficiency in phytochrome signaling. Our genetic analysis suggests that phytochrome signaling is enhanced in the AtPP7 loss of function alleles, including in blue light, which masks the reduced cryptochrome signaling. AtPP7 has been found to interact both in yeast and <italic>in planta</italic> assays with nucleotide-diphosphate kinase 2 (NDPK2), a positive regulator of phytochrome signals. Analysis of <italic>ndpk2-psi2</italic> double mutants suggests that NDPK2 plays a critical role in the AtPP7 regulation of the phytochrome pathway and identifies NDPK2 as an upstream element involved in the modulation of the salicylic acid (SA)-dependent defense pathway by light. Thus, cryptochrome- and phytochrome-specific light signals synchronously control their relative contribution to the regulation of plant development. Interestingly, PP7 and NDPK are also components of animal light signaling systems.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Signal regulation is essential in perceptive systems.

Plants contain additional photoreceptors: phototropins phot1 and phot2 are the blue light receptors controlling phototropism, chloroplast movement and stomatal aperture, whereas cryptochrome (cry) receptors respond to high fluences of blue light during deetiolation (cry1), or to low blue light fluences during deetiolation with an involvement in the photoperiodic induction of flowering (cry2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002699-Briggs1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002699-Cashmore1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002699-Lin1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.
