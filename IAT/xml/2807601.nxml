A&#x003b2; is a proteolytic product of amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, generated by sequential cleavage by &#x003b2;-secretase (&#x003b2;-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1, BACE1) and &#x003b3;-secretase. Dysfunction of BACE1 and &#x003b3;-secretase inevitably causes aberrant APP processing, production of toxic A&#x003b2; species, and amyloidogenesis. Although no BACE1 mutation has been identified in AD, BACE1 protein and activity levels are significantly increased in AD brains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and elevated BACE1 levels increase A&#x003b2; production in <italic>BACE1</italic> transgenic (TG) mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A&#x003b2; is produced as a monomer, but readily aggregates to form oligomeric complexes, and further assembles to form fibrils.</p><p>Dysregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) has been suggested to be one of the downstream processes affected by A&#x003b2; toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Cdk5 is expressed in most tissues, but its neuron-specific activator p35/p25 restricts its activity largely to neurons. p25 and Cdk5 activities are increased in human AD brains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Elevated p25 was recently shown to increase A&#x003b2; production, an effect that was mediated by an increase in BACE1 levels and reversed with a pharmacological inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. These data demonstrate a positive regulatory loop between A&#x003b2; and p35/p25.</p><p>Collagen XXV alpha 1 (COL25A1), also known as collagen-like Alzheimer&#x02019;s amyloid plaque component precursor, is a newly identified type II transmembrane protein specifically expressed in neurons that colocalizes with A&#x003b2; in senile plaques in AD brains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Previously, a modest association between SNPs of <italic>COL25A1</italic> and increased AD risk was reported in a Swedish population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The primary structure of COL25A1 is composed of three collagenous domains (COL1&#x02013;3) flanked by four noncollagenous domains (NC1&#x02013;4). The N-terminal NC1 domain contains a short cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane domain, and an extracellular ectodomain which harbors a furin cleavage site. Proteolytic processing by furin releases the COL25A1 C-terminus to the extracellular matrix. COL25A1 binds specifically to A&#x003b2; fibrils in vitro, slows their elongation, and facilitates their assembly into aggregates with increased resistance to proteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It is not known whether COL25A1 contributes to the pathogenesis of AD in vivo.</p><p>To investigate the role of COL25A1 in the pathogenesis of AD, we assessed the effects of <italic>COL25A1</italic> over-expression on A&#x003b2;, p35/p25, and BACE1 levels in TG mice. The effect on synaptophysin and astrocyte were examined. We also carried out behavioral analyses. In addition, we evaluated the importance of NC1, NC2, and NC3 domains of COL25A1 in the induction of BACE1 in stably transfected SH-SY5Y cell lines. Our findings provide in vivo evidence that COL25A1 plays a critical role in AD pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Generation of TG mice</title><p>Human <italic>COL25A1</italic> complementary DNA (cDNA; GenBank accession no.

The experimenter was blinded to the genotypes during testing. First, mice were tested in an elevated, plus-shaped maze consisting of two open arms and two closed arms equipped with rows of infrared photocells interfaced with a computer (Hamilton-Kinder, Poway, CA, USA). Briefly, mice were placed individually in the center of the maze and allowed free access for 10&#x000a0;min. The time spent and distance moved in each of the arms and the number of times the mice extended over the edges of the open arms was calculated from recorded infrared beam breaks for each 5-min interval of testing. The main difference in anxiety was found in the first 5&#x000a0;min. Next, in the novel field test, mice were placed in a open chamber (16&#x000a0;in.&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;16&#x000a0;in.) and allowed to explore freely for 15&#x000a0;min. Activity was recorded by an array of infrared photocells interfaced with a computer (Photobeam Activity System, San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA, USA) that can detect and distinguish horizontal ambulatory movements, fine movements, and vertical movements (rearing). The center of the field was defined as the central 4&#x000a0;in.&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;4&#x000a0;in. square. Finally, mice were tested in the Morris water maze. Mice were trained to find a platform (14&#x000a0;cm&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;14&#x000a0;cm) submerged 1.5&#x000a0;cm below the surface of the water (18&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2&#x000b0;C), made opaque with nontoxic tempera powder in a 122-cm pool. Mice were pretrained to remain on the platform in a series of four trials in which they were placed in a restricted (14&#x000a0;cm&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;122&#x000a0;cm) alley within the pool and allowed to swim until they encountered the platform. If the mouse did not find the platform within 90&#x000a0;s, the mouse was led to the platform by hand, placed on it, and allowed to sit for 5&#x000a0;s. After 1&#x000a0;day of pretraining, mice were trained to find a visibly cued platform, marked with a 10-cm-high, black-and-white striped marker affixed to the center of the platform. Mice were trained in two daily sessions of two trials each over three consecutive days. Then, mice were trained to find a hidden platform in two daily sessions of three trials each over five consecutive days. For both cued and hidden platform training, the intertrial interval was 10&#x000a0;min, and the time between sessions was 3&#x000a0;h. Maximum trial length was 60&#x000a0;s. Time to reach the platform (latency), path length, and swim speed were recorded with an EthoVision video tracking system (Noldus, The Netherlands). Probe trials were performed 18&#x000a0;h after the 18th and 30th trials of hidden platform training. For each 60-s probe trial, the platform was removed from the pool, and the amount of time the mouse spent searching in the target quadrant was recorded.</p><p>Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to detect the effect of genotype in the elevated plus maze and open field test. For Morris water maze testing, the main effects and interactions between genotype and session or probe trials were assessed by repeated-measures ANOVA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Plasmid constructs and cell culture</title><p>Human <italic>COL25A1</italic> cDNA coding region (full-length or with designed deletion, GeneBank accession no.

These changes were accompanied by synaptophysin loss, astrocyte activation, and alterations on elevated plus maze and open field test. The NC1, NC2, and NC3 domains of COL25A1 were important for induction of BACE1 in stably transfected SH-SY5Y cell lines. Our findings suggest that COL25A1 plays a critical role in AD pathogenesis, perhaps by acting as an amyloidogenic cofactor in vivo.</p><p>Prominent A&#x003b2; accumulation was detected in two independent <italic>COL25A1</italic> transgenic lines (861 and 797) by immunohistochemical staining with A&#x003b2;1-40/42 antibody. Although it is possible that the detected peptides were A&#x003b2;-containing APP derivatives, these peptides cannot be full-length APP, as the well-characterized full-length APP antibody 22C11 did not detect obvious change in these mice (data not shown).</p><p>The intracellular A&#x003b2; aggregation could result from increased production of A&#x003b2;, abnormal retention of A&#x003b2; within the secretory system, or enhanced uptake of secreted A&#x003b2; by the endocytic pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. No obvious change in APP levels was found in these mice by immunohistochemistry. However, BACE1 levels were increased in both TG lines, suggesting that increased APP processing was responsible for the A&#x003b2; accumulation. BACE1 levels were also elevated in stably transfected SH-SY5Y cells over-expressing <italic>COL25A1</italic>. Since extracellular A&#x003b2; deposits were observed in the mice, it is unlikely that an aberrant secretory pathway was the major cause of A&#x003b2; accumulation. Another possibility is that the membrane-tethered (precursor) form of COL25A1 favors the internalization of secreted A&#x003b2; by binding to extracellular A&#x003b2; aggregates, resulting in abnormal accumulation of intracellular A&#x003b2;.</p><p>The extracellular A&#x003b2; deposits in <italic>COL25A1</italic> TG mice were clusters or patches evolving into protofibrillar structures. In contrast to many other AD models, these mice did not have compact or diffuse plaques at 16&#x000a0;months of age. Monomeric A&#x003b2; is thought to form oligomeric or protofribrillar intermediates that mature into the amyloid fibrils found in plaques. Evidently, the protofibrillar deposits in <italic>COL25A1</italic> TG mice did not progress to form fibrils in mice up to 16&#x000a0;months of age. Since secreted COL25A1 builds up extracellular fibrillar deposits in TG mice, it is possible that COL25A1 binds to A&#x003b2; deposits and slows A&#x003b2; fibril elongation, as suggested by in vitro binding assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The weaker amyloidogenic ability of mouse A&#x003b2; peptides might also have contributed to the lack of plaque formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. It is unlikely that the age of the mice at testing (16&#x000a0;months) contributed markedly to the lack of plaque formation, since intracellular A&#x003b2; accumulation was apparent as early as 6&#x000a0;months of age, when distinct extracellular A&#x003b2; protofibrillar deposits were seen in one of three TG mice but in none of three WT littermates. Nonetheless, further experiments are needed to test whether they will develop fibrillar plaques at more advanced ages.</p><p>In recent years, the amyloid cascade hypothesis has been modified to reflect experimental evidence that oligomers of A&#x003b2;, not monomers or amyloid fibrils, are the major initiators of AD pathology. A growing body of report indicates that oligomeric/protofibrillar A&#x003b2; species are toxic while mature A&#x003b2; fibers are largely inert [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].

Both synaptophysin loss and astrocyte lesions were detected in <italic>COL25A1</italic> TG mice along with the A&#x003b2; accumulation, indicating abnormalities of neurites. Interestingly, <italic>COL25A1</italic> mice had elevated levels of the activator subunit (p35/p25) of Cdk5 kinase, which has been implicated in regulating synaptic plasticity, emotionality, learning, and memory in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. <italic>COL25A1</italic> mice also exhibited reduced emotionality or disinhibition in behavioral tests, suggesting neuronal dysfunction. <italic>COL25A1</italic> mice spent more time exploring the open arms in the elevated plus maze and in the center area in the open field test, indicating reduced anxiety. Similar behaviors have also been noted in other AD mouse models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>Another noticeable behavioral change of <italic>COL25A1</italic> mice was their significantly reduced swimming speed in the Morris water maze test.

The reduced swimming speed of <italic>COL25A1</italic> mice did not result from floating behavior, since the average speed was above 10&#x000a0;cm/s in each session. Nor was disturbance of motor function responsible, as locomotor activity in the elevated plus maze and open field tests was unimpaired, and <italic>COL25A1</italic> mice perform normally in rotarod and tightrope tests (unpublished data). The slow swimming speed was evident from the beginning of the test and was sharply reduced when the platform was removed during the probe trials. These unique behavioral characteristics might reflect motivational difficulties.</p><p><italic>COL25A1</italic> mice exhibited no deficits in spatial learning or working memory performance in the water maze test. This was surprising, considering the prominent, widespread accumulation of A&#x003b2; and increased levels of BACE1 and p35/p25. The absence of learning and retention deficits in the water maze has been noted in some AD mouse models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], although others did have cognitive deficits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Although the reasons are unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], such discrepancies are likely to be due, in part, to differences in murine and human physiology and in the toxicity of intracellular A&#x003b2;. Genetic differences in specific species or strains may substantially modify detectable phenotypes in mouse models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. It is also possible that over-expression of <italic>COL25A1</italic> might activate other pathways to balance the toxicity of A&#x003b2;, thus eliminate the spatial memory deficits found in some AD models.</p><p>Motifs in the NC1, NC2, and NC3 domains of COL25A1 were important for induction of BACE1 in stably transfected SH-SY5Y cell lines. Deletion of the NC1 motif caused the protein to lose its ability to traffic to cell membranes, implying its importance for cellular localization. Deletion of the NC2 or NC3 motif did not impair the trafficking of COL25A1 but attenuated its effect on BACE1. The NC2 domain harbors one positively charged amino acid-rich A&#x003b2; binding motif that is a predicted binding domain for heparin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The NC3 domain contains one coiled-coil motif thought to be necessary for the triple-helix structure of COL25A1 collagenous fibrils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The COL1 domain mediates the interaction with A&#x003b2;, which requires COL25A1 to form a triple helix structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In stably transfected SH-SY5Y cell lines, deletion of the COL1 motif did not affect the localization of COL25A1 or its effect on BACE1 expression.

On the other hand, COL25A1 might directly bind to A&#x003b2; aggregates, slow A&#x003b2; fibril elongation, and lead to A&#x003b2; aggregation in the toxic protofibrillar intermediary form. The resulting increase in A&#x003b2; toxicity might cause dysregulation of p35/p25 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], further increasing A&#x003b2; production through BACE1. A&#x003b2; and p35/p25 toxicity disrupts synaptic activity and induces local inflammatory response. Ultimately, these changes translate into the behavioral alterations observed in <italic>COL25A1</italic> mice. <fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;6</label><caption><p>Hypothetical model of the AD-like pathogenic process in <italic>COL25A1</italic> mice.
