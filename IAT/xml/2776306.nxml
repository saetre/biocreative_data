Cohesin also has important roles in gene regulation, but the mechanistic basis of this function is poorly understood. In mammalian genomes, cohesin co-localizes with CCCTC binding factor (CTCF), a zinc finger protein implicated in multiple gene regulatory events. At the imprinted <italic>IGF2-H19</italic> locus, CTCF plays an important role in organizing allele-specific higher-order chromatin conformation and functions as an enhancer blocking transcriptional insulator. Here we have used chromosome conformation capture (3C) assays and RNAi&#x02013;mediated depletion of cohesin to address whether cohesin affects higher order chromatin conformation at the <italic>IGF2-H19</italic> locus in human cells. Our data show that cohesin has a critical role in maintaining CTCF&#x02013;mediated chromatin conformation at the locus and that disruption of this conformation coincides with changes in <italic>IGF2</italic> expression. We show that the cohesin-dependent, higher-order chromatin conformation of the locus exists in both G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle and is therefore independent of cohesin's function in sister chromatid cohesion. We propose that cohesin can mediate interactions between DNA molecules in <italic>cis</italic> to insulate genes through the formation of chromatin loops, analogous to the cohesin mediated interaction with sister chromatids in <italic>trans</italic> to establish cohesion.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Recent work has shown that cohesin, a protein best known for its role in holding sister chromatids together, and CTCF, a protein implicated in the formation of chromatin loops, localize to the same regions of DNA in mammalian genomes. This observation raised the intriguing possibility that cohesin might facilitate the role of CTCF in structuring chromatin. CTCF is well known for its role in regulating genomic imprinting at the <italic>IGF2-H19</italic> gene locus. Imprinted genes are widely studied due to their roles in fetal growth and cancer and have the unusual property of expressing only one parental copy of the gene. CTCF is thought to regulate imprinting of <italic>IGF2</italic> and <italic>H19</italic> by enabling DNA to form loops that separate the genes into silent or active domains. In this paper we describe, for the first time, the looping structure of the human <italic>IGF2-H19</italic> locus and show that cohesin stabilises CTCF&#x02013;mediated DNA loops. Depletion of cohesin leads to disruption of long-range chromatin interactions and changes expression levels of the <italic>IGF2</italic> gene. This work adds a new level of understanding of how cohesin can play a role in gene expression.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cohesin is an evolutionarily conserved protein complex composed of the core subunits, SMC1, SMC3, SCC1/RAD21 and SCC3/SA (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000739-Peters1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>).

Insulators are chromatin boundaries that separate gene promoters from regulatory elements. The only known protein that directly binds insulators in mammalian cells is the multi-functional zinc finger protein CTCF (CCCTC binding factor, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000739-Wallace1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>). Several studies have recently identified co-localisation of CTCF and cohesin in mammalian genomes and have shown that CTCF is needed to recruit cohesin to these binding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000739-Wendt1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000739-Rubio1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000739-Stedman1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Remarkably, although CTCF can associate with its binding sites in the absence of cohesin, its enhancer blocking activity depends on cohesin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000739-Wendt1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000739-Parelho1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. It has, therefore, been speculated that CTCF may mediate transcriptional insulation by recruiting cohesin to particular sites in the genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000739-Wendt1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, but it remains unknown how cohesin controls gene regulation at these sites.</p><p>The <italic>IGF2-H19</italic> locus plays a role in the aetiology of embryonic growth disorders and in various cancers (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000739-Murrell1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>).

This insulator is located upstream of the <italic>H19</italic> gene and is known as the imprinting control region (ICR). It acquires methylation on the paternal allele during male germ cell development and is therefore also called the <italic>H19</italic> differentially methylated region (DMR) or domain (DMD). CTCF binding at the insulator prevents the <italic>IGF2</italic> gene from accessing enhancers downstream of the <italic>H19</italic> gene. This physical separation is thought to maintain the silence of the maternal <italic>IGF2</italic> allele.

In mice it has been demonstrated that higher order chromatin conformation at this locus differs between the maternal and paternal alleles and that CTCF binding is essential for the formation of chromatin loops on the maternal allele <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000739-Engel1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000739-Murrell2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to the ICR and the downstream enhancers, several additional regulatory regions have been described surrounding the locus.

Our results indicate that cohesin has an important role in long-range interactions between CTCF sites, whereas CTCF independent chromatin associations do not require the presence of cohesin. Cohesin may, therefore, contribute to gene regulation at CTCF sites by mediating the formation of chromatin loops.</p><fig id="pgen-1000739-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000739.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of the <italic>IGF2-H19</italic> locus.</title><p>(A) The Insulin (<italic>INS</italic>), Insulin-like Growth Factor 2 (<italic>IGF2</italic>), and <italic>H19</italic> genes (blue boxes) are displayed together with the downstream enhancer (Enh; green oval).

The nearest site to the CTCF AD is on the edge of the DMR0 region (restriction site a). For this reason we have regarded CTCF AD/DMR0 as a single 3C element in our analysis. The resulting data represent an average of association frequencies on both parental alleles across the whole locus. Random ligations are expected to decrease exponentially the further a restriction site is away from the anchor, while specific associations occur as &#x0201c;spikes&#x0201d; above the random ligation curve <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000739-Dekker1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. However, because the resolution of 3C is limited, multiple adjacent restriction sites within a 5 Kb stretch of DNA will associate with similar frequencies with a distant restriction site used as an anchor. The 3C signals therefore indicate proximities to interactions, rather than pinpoint the exact sequences involved in the interactions.</p><p>When a primer within the ICR was used as an anchor (primer k), weak but specific associations were detected with the CTCF AD/DMR0 region (restriction site a, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000739-g003">Figure 3B and 3C</xref>).

Because the DMR0 does not bind CTCF, it is possible that the associations between the CTCF AD/DMR0 and the CCD are caused by CTCF binding at the CTCF AD. To confirm that the CTCF AD/DMR0 region interacts with the distant CTCF DS sites we also used a primer within the CTCF DS (primer q) as an anchor. As expected, this revealed associations between CTCF DS and the CTCF AD/DMR0 region (restriction sites a and b1), and in addition showed associations with the CCD (restriction site h) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000739-g003">Figure 3G</xref>).

The interaction between the CTCF AD/DMR0 and the ICR could be weaker than the CTCF AD/DMR0 and the CCD because the ICR is a monoallelic CTCF/cohesin binding site, and/or because our ChIP experiments indicated that less CTCF and cohesin are bound to the ICR than to the other sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000739-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>). Alternatively, we cannot exclude the possibility that the 3C interactions that we detected between the ICR and CTCF AD/DMR0 were caused indirectly by the strong associations between CTCF AD/DMR0 and the CCD and the CTCF DS sites, which are located to the left and the right of the ICR.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Allele specificity of chromatin associations</title><p>To examine which of the detected chromatin associations is allele specific we combined the 3C assays with SNP analysis of ligated products.

These promoter-enhancer interactions suggest that, despite the low levels of <italic>IGF2</italic> transcription, the chromatin conformation in HB2 cells is favourable for monoallelic expression.

This result suggests that ICR- CTCFAD/DMR0 interactions are indirect and mediated through interactions between the CTCF AD/DMR0 with other CTCF sites near the ICR such as the CTCF DS. It is also conceivable that elements within the DMR0 and the adjacent CTCF sites interact separately with the methylated and the unmethylated ICR.

First, we tested two predictions that are made by this hypothesis. Cohesin associates with chromatin throughout interphase and regulates transcription at the <italic>IGF2-H19</italic> locus both in G1 and G2 phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000739-Wendt1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. If cohesin affects gene regulation by enabling the formation of chromatin loops one would, therefore, predict that these loops are also present in G1 and G2 phase. To test this we used 3C assays to compare chromatin conformation between cells that were synchronised by double thymidine arrest-release either in G1 or G2 phase. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000739-g003">Figure 3</xref> shows that synchronisation of cells in G1 and G2 phase did not change the overall 3C profiles using the CTCF AD/DMR0, ICR or enhancers as anchors. An exception was observed for the association between the ICR anchor and the CTCF DS which did not stand out as a &#x0201c;peak&#x0201d; in G1 cells, but could be detected as a &#x0201c;shoulder&#x0201d; in the 3C profile of the G2 cells. We presently do not know if this difference is of physiological relevance. Since most interactions did not change between G1 and G2 phase, our results are consistent with the possibility that cohesin mediates chromatin loop formation throughout interphase. Importantly, these data also suggest that cohesin's role in chromatin conformation would have to be independent of its function in sister chromatid cohesion, which exists in G2 but not G1 phase.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Cohesin is associated with loops that are formed by interactions between CTCF sites</title><p>Another prediction made by the hypothesis that cohesin mediates 3C interactions between CTCF sites at the <italic>IGF2-H19</italic> locus is that cohesin should be present in the corresponding chromatin loops.

Pink and pale blue ovals represent the CTCF/cohesin complexes. CpG methylation is depicted as filled lollipops. (A) Linear representation of the <italic>IGF2-H19</italic> locus. Elements above the bar represent the maternal allele with CTCF and cohesin binding the ICR and an active <italic>H19</italic> gene. Elements below the bar represent the paternal allele with active <italic>IGF2</italic> gene and methylated ICR. ChIP data indicate that cohesin and CTCF co-localise at the CCD, CTCF AD and CTCF DS on both alleles. 3C data indicate that these CTCF/cohesin sites interact strongly with each other; while the ICR and enhancer have limited allele specific interactions (long curved arrows indicate 3C interactions between 3C elements). Based on these data we propose the following model: (B) On the paternal allele, co-localisation of CTCF and cohesin at CTCF AD, CCD, and CTCF DS brings these regions together. The methylated ICR does not bind CTCF and is thus excluded from CTCF/cohesin interacting regions. The exclusion of the ICR may enable the <italic>IGF2</italic> gene promoters and <italic>H19</italic> enhancer region to interact, (shown by yellow oval close to <italic>IGF2</italic> arrow) even though they are on different looping domains. (The <italic>H19</italic> domain is shaded.) (C) On the maternal allele, CTCF/cohesin can bind to the unmethylated ICR which can then interact with other CTCF/cohesin sites. An interaction between CTCF AD/DMR0 and the ICR may be indirectly mediated through the interaction between CTCF AD/DMR0 and CTCF DS. A monoallelic interaction between the ICR and CTCF DS could redefine the H19 domain and constrain the enhancer to prevent interaction with <italic>IGF2</italic> promoters on the maternal allele. Without cohesin, CTCF does not maintain stable loops and <italic>IGF2</italic> promoters can access the enhancers and perhaps even other regulatory elements from neighbouring genes. Interactions between the various CTCF sites are likely to be dynamic and may occur sequentially.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1000739.g009"/></fig><p>Transcription of <italic>IGF2</italic> and <italic>H19</italic> is developmentally down regulated in most adult tissues but reactivated in various cancers (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000739-Murrell1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>).

Methylation profiles of the <italic>IGF2-H19</italic> locus in many cancers indicate that loss of <italic>IGF2</italic> imprinting and methylation are often disconnected during neoplasia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000739-Byun1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000739-Wu2">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. The roles of higher order chromatin structure and loss of imprinting in cancer are still largely unexplored. Defects in proper positioning of cohesin on DNA could therefore contribute to abnormal gene regulation in neoplastic cells.</p><p>The finding that cohesin is required to stabilise higher order chromatin conformation raises the intriguing possibility that cohesin physically connects two DNA sequences on the same DNA molecule in <italic>cis</italic>, to form loop structures similar to how cohesin interacts with two DNA molecules in <italic>trans</italic>, to mediate sister chromatid cohesion. It is conceivable that cohesin forms chromatin loops by embracing two DNA strands at the base of a loop, similar to how cohesin has been proposed to mediate cohesion as a ring <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000739-Haering1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Alternatively, it is possible that cohesin complexes bound to two DNA sites can interact with each other, as has been suggested for CTCF molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000739-Yusufzai1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>.

The results in this study show a modest reduction in looping interactions after cohesin depletion which suggest that cohesin is a stabilising factor in chromatin looping. It will therefore be important to test if these mutations affect higher order chromatin structure at specific loci. Although such defects may be very subtle, they could at some loci cause defects in gene regulation during development.</p><p>Another important goal for the future will be to determine at the genomic level which CTCF-cohesin sites can interact with each other, if these interactions change during cell differentiation and how such changes might be specified.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title><italic>IGF2-H19</italic> methylation and expression analysis</title><p>Methylation analysis was by bisulphite- and pyrosequencing with primers as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000739-Ito1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000739-Murrell3">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000739-Dupont1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>.

Blue boxes represent the position of genes, the green oval depicts the localisation of the enhancer (Enh) (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000739-g001">Figure 1</xref>) and red boxes in the second line represent the CTCF/cohesin binding regions CTCF AD, CCD, ICR, and CTCF DS. Vertical blue lines in a row indicate the position of <italic>Bam</italic>HI restriction sites within the locus and letters point out the restriction sites analysed by 3C (3C RS). Anchor primers are shown as black arrows below the restriction site map. (B) Enlarged view of the region comprising the CTCF AD/DMR0 and the <italic>IGF2</italic> gene showing exons as boxes (blue for coding and empty for non-coding exons). Promoters are shown as arrows above the exons and the DMR0 region is shown as a yellow bar. Reciprocal 3C primers are shown as grey arrowheads. (C) Association frequencies of the ICR (j-primer as anchor) with restriction sites in the CTCF AD/DMR0 (a and b1) and <italic>IGF2</italic> gene promoter (c1) in cohesin depleted (SCC1 RNAi) and control (G1 control) cells synchronised in G1 phase. Association frequencies with restriction sites in <italic>IGF2</italic> upstream region drop significantly in cohesin depleted cells compared to a random ligation with a restriction site in the intervening region (restriction site e) that is not reduced. (D) The effect of cohesin depletion on associations between the enhancer (m primer) and restriction sites close to promoters P2 (b1 restriction site), and P3 (d restriction site), was analysed. Upon cohesin depletion no significant change in the association frequencies was observed, confirming that these interactions occur independently of CTCF/cohesin binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000739.s006">Table S1</xref>). # Denotes significant differences (P&#x0003c;0.05) between control and SCC1 RNAi.</p><p>(0.74 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000739.s004.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000739.s005"><label>Figure S5</label><caption><p>Effects of normalisation using circularisation of a restriction fragment as an internal control. <italic>Bam</italic>HI restriction of i and j sites followed by random ligation results in circularisation of this fragment (i-fragment). Circularisation of i-fragment can be detected by using primers amplifying 180 bp spanning the re-ligated i and j sites. (Primer sequences are located in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000739.s008">Table S3</xref>.) Inefficient digestion or ligation will give very low yields of this PCR product and therefore it is a good ligation and digestion control. (A) We found that the variation of i-fragment circularisation relative to the copy number of template between 3 biological replicates was low. There was also no significant difference in the relative circularisation frequency of i-fragment between control and cohesin depleted samples. (B) All interactions in our 3C samples were normalised using the circularisation frequency of the i-fragment. There was no significant difference between control and cohesin depleted samples at an interaction between the enhancer anchor (primer m) and a restriction site between the enhancer and the CTCF DS (site p). The interaction between m and p is not dependent on CTCF/cohesin and is therefore not expected to change after cohesin depletion.</p><p>(0.29 MB TIF)</p></caption><media
