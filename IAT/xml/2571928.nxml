Four E3 ubiquitin ligases, Mind bomb (Mib) 1, Mib2, Neuralized (Neur) 1, and Neur2, regulate the Notch ligands to activate Notch signaling, but their roles in lymphocyte development have not been defined. We show that Mib1 regulates T and marginal zone B (MZB) cell development in the lymphopoietic niches. Inactivation of the <italic>Mib1</italic> gene, but not the other E3 ligases, <italic>Mib2</italic>, <italic>Neur1</italic>, and <italic>Neur2</italic>, abrogated T and MZB cell development. Reciprocal bone marrow (BM) transplantation experiments revealed that Mib1 in the thymic and splenic niches is essential for T and MZB cell development. Interestingly, when BM cells from transgenic Notch reporter mice were transplanted into <italic>Mib1</italic>-null mice, the Notch signaling was abolished in the double-negative thymocytes. In addition, the endocytosis of Dll1 was impaired in the Mib1-null microenvironment. Moreover, the block in T cell development and the failure of Dll1 endocytosis were also observed in coculture system by Mib1 knockdown. Our study reveals that Mib1 is the essential E3 ligase in T and MZB cell development, through the regulation of Notch ligands in the thymic and splenic microenvironments.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: DN, double negative; DP, double positive; ETP, early T lineage progenitor; FOB, follicular B; HSC, hematopoietic stem cell; Mib, mind bomb; MMTV, mouse mammary tumor virus; MZB, marginal zone B; NECD, Notch extracellular domain; Neur, neuralized; NICD, Notch intracellular domain; pIpC, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid; siRNA, small interfering RNA; SP, single positive; TNR, transgenic Notch reporter; TSP, thymic seeding progenitor.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>The thymus is an organ that supports the differentiation and selection of T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). The thymic development of T cells consists of several processes that require the relocation of developing lymphocytes into, within, and out of the different environments of the thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). First, the thymic seeding progenitors (TSPs) enter the subcapsular cortical areas, where they encounter networks of cortical epithelial cells. Second, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> double-positive (DP) thymocytes generated in the outer cortex are motile, interacting with stromal cells that are localized in the cortex for positive and negative selection. Third, positively selected thymocytes interact with medullary thymic epithelial cells to complete thymocyte development. Last, mature T cells export from medulla to peripheral lymphoid tissues. The thymus provides the functional microenvironment to selectively induce T lineage differentiation from the TSPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). Notch signaling in the thymus influences lineage decisions at multiple stages of T cell development, the generation of early T lineage progenitors (ETPs), &#x003b1;&#x003b2;/&#x003b3;&#x003b4; specification, and pre&#x02013;T cell receptor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). At the T cell&#x02013;B cell branchpoint in the thymus, Notch signaling is delivered to progenitors with T and B potential. These progenitors undergo the T lineage development after receiving Notch signals and the B lineage development in the absence of Notch signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Moreover, Notch signaling regulates the generation of ETPs after thymic entry of TSPs in the thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). In addition, Notch signaling regulates the final differentiation step of BM-derived B cells in the spleen, where it facilitates the generation of marginal zone B (MZB) cells while it suppresses the generation of follicular B (FOB) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>).</p><p>Notch signaling is a widely used cell&#x02013;cell signaling pathway that plays a critical role in cell fate determination of various lineages in vertebrates as well as invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). In mammals, four Notch receptors (Notch1&#x02013;4) and five Notch ligands (Dll [Deltalike] 1, Dll3, Dll4, Jag [Jagged] 1, and Jag2) have been identified. Upon binding to their ligands, the Notch receptors undergo sequential proteolytic cleavages that result in the release of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) and the Notch extracellular domain (NECD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). The NICD acts in the nucleus as a transcriptional regulator with RBP-J&#x003ba; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>), and the NECD seems to undergo transendocytosis along with Delta in the signal-sending cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). A surprising, but poorly understood, finding is that the internalization of Delta in the signal-sending cell is required to activate the Notch signaling in the receiving cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). To date, two structurally distinct E3 ubiquitin ligases, Neuralized (Neur)-1/2 (Neur in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>) and Mind bomb (Mib)&#x02013;1/2, have been shown to regulate the endocytosis of Notch ligands in vertebrates and invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). The requirement of Notch signaling for lymphocyte development has been well studied; however, the role of the E3 ubiquitin ligases that regulate T and MZB cell development is unknown.</p><p>Studies using Cre-loxP&#x02212;mediated gene targeting have shown that specific deletion of <italic>Notch1</italic> in hematopoietic cells leads to a complete block of T cell development with a substantial increase in B cells in the thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). In contrast, enforced expression of the active form of Notch1 inhibits B cell development in the BM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). These results demonstrate that Notch1 is indispensable for T cell commitment at the branch point of T cells versus B cells. Dll1 and Dll4, which are expressed in the thymic epithelial cells, have been suggested to be responsible for activating the Notch1 receptor in T cell progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). Consistent with these findings, the BM stromal cell line OP9 ectopically expressing the Notch ligand Dll1 (OP9-DL1) or Dll4 loses its ability to support B cell lymphopoiesis but acquires the capacity to induce the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) into T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). However, conditional deletion of Dll1 in mice shows that Dll1 is dispensable for T cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>), and analysis of mice with floxed Dll4 has not yet been reported. In addition, although the requirement of Dll1 as well as Notch2 for the generation of MZB cells has been well studied in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>), the microenvironment that supports MZB cell development remains to be elucidated. Therefore, requirement of Notch signaling in the microenvironments to hematopoietic cells for lymphopoiesis in vivo needs to be clarified.</p><p>Therefore, to investigate which E3 ubiquitin ligase is essential for T and MZB cell development and which types of cells in the thymus and spleen transduce Notch signals to their progenitors, we analyzed <italic>Mib1</italic> conditional KO (<italic>Mib1<sup>f/f</sup></italic>), <italic>Mib2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>, <italic>Neur1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>, and <italic>Neur2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice. Surprisingly, only the conditional inactivation of <italic>Mib1</italic> caused severe defects in T and MZB cell development. Moreover, an analysis of Mib1-deficient hosts reconstituted with WT BM cells revealed that Mib1 regulates T and MZB cell development in the signal-sending cells of the thymic and splenic microenvironments. In addition, Dll1 was not endocytosed but accumulated in the Mib1-null thymic niches. Consistent with the results from the <italic>Mib1</italic>-null mice, knockdown of Mib1 in OP9-DL1 abolished T cell development and inhibited endocytosis of Dll1. These findings demonstrate that Mib1 is an essential E3 ubiquitin ligase for Notch signaling in T and MZB cell development in the thymic and splenic microenvironments.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>The expression of E3 ubiquitin ligases of Notch signaling in lymphoid tissues</title><p>The expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligases of Notch signaling in lymphoid tissues suggests the involvement of these molecules in lymphopoiesis. To test the relevance of the E3 ligases in lymphocyte development, we examined the expression of E3 ligase transcripts in lymphoid tissues, thymus, and spleen. Because we expected that the E3 ligases might work in the nonhematopoietic stromal cells, we measured the expression levels of E3 ligases in isolated cell populations by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. In the thymus, transcripts of all four E3 ligases were detected in both CD45<sup>&#x02212;</sup> nonhematopoietic and CD45<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> hematopoietic cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>).

In this study, our data provide in vivo evidence that an E3 ubiquitin ligase of Notch signaling, Mib1, is required for lymphopoiesis, including T lineage commitment and MZB cell development. Conditional inactivation of the <italic>Mib1</italic> gene caused a block of T lineage commitment and MZB cell development, whereas their development was not perturbed in the other three mutant mice with inactivation of <italic>Mib2</italic>, <italic>Neur1</italic>, and <italic>Neur2</italic>, and even in the <italic>Neur1/2</italic> double KO mice. More importantly, reciprocal BMT experiments revealed that Mib1 in the thymic and splenic microenvironments is essential for Notch signaling to the hematopoietic progenitors. Although the Notch ligands and the E3 ligases are expressed in both hematopoietic progenitors and their microenvironments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref>), the defective Notch activation of hematopoietic progenitors and the failure of Notch ligand endocytosis were observed in the Mib1-null microenvironment. These results demonstrate that Notch signaling in the lymphopoietic niches to progenitors, but not the interactions between hematopoietic cells, is required for lymphopoiesis. In addition, the block in T cell development and the defect in the endocytosis of Dll1 were also observed in OP9-DL1 cell by Mib1 knockdown. Collectively, our study provides the first in vivo evidence that Mib1, in the lymphopoietic niches, controls T lineage commitment and MZB cell development by regulating Notch signaling.</p><p>The Notch signaling pathway is conserved in all metazoans. So far, four E3 ubiquitin-ligases, Mib1, Mib2, Neur1, and Neur2, which regulate the Notch ligands, have been identified in vertebrates, and three, dMib1, dMib2, and dNeur, have been found in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, mutations in <italic>dNeur</italic> result in a variety of developmental defects that closely resemble those of Notch mutants and other Notch pathway mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">60</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">62</xref>). However, mice with a disrupted <italic>Neur1</italic> gene exhibit no abnormal cell fate specifications during neurogenesis and somitogenesis, two processes involving Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">63</xref>). This discrepancy might be caused by the functional redundancy provided by Neur2. We originally expected a subset of Notch phenotypes in the <italic>Neur1/2</italic> double KO mice because most mutant mice with disruptions in the key components of the Notch signaling pathway, such as Dll1, Dll4, Jag2, Notch1, Notch2, lunatic fringe, RBP-J&#x003ba;, MAML1, and MINT, exhibit a subset of defects in lymphopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref>). In this study, however, T and B cell development was not disturbed in the <italic>Neur1/2</italic> double KO mice, demonstrating that <italic>Neur1/2</italic> is not involved in these cell fate decisions.</p><p>In addition to Neur, Mib1 has been identified as another E3 ubiquitin ligase that interacts with Delta to promote its ubiquitination and internalization in the signal-sending cells, using zebrafish mutant models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, dMib1 is involved in regulating Notch ligand endocytosis, and the ectopic expression of dNeur bypasses the requirement for dMib1, suggesting that they appear to be interchangeable in mediating the ubiquitination and internalization of the Notch ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">65</xref>). However, dMib1 and dNeur are expressed in different patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">65</xref>), suggesting that both dNeur and dMib1 regulate Notch ligand endocytosis in different contexts of Notch-dependent cell fate decisions. In contrast to the results in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>Mib1</italic>-null mouse embryos showed completely defective Notch activation in terms of NICD generation and Notch-target gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>), whereas the <italic>Neur1/2</italic> double KO mice did not show any gross defects in mammalian development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). Consistent with these findings, a developmental block in T and MZB cell development, which is a prototype of a Notch signaling defect, was observed only in <italic>Mib1</italic>-null mice, suggesting an obligatory role of Mib1 in mammalian T and MZB cell development.</p><p>In addition to Mib1, we previously identified Mib2 as an E3 ligase that regulates Delta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Overexpression of Mib2 rescues both the neuronal and vascular defects in the zebrafish <italic>Mib<sup>ta52b</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>), suggesting that they are interchangeable in mediating the ubiquitination and internalization of the Notch ligand. Mib2 is highly expressed in adult tissues, whereas Mib1 is expressed in both embryonic and adult tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Therefore, although Mib1 is an essential core component of the mammalian Notch pathway that controls multiple Notch ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>), it is necessary to determine whether Mib1 regulates multiple ligands beyond embryonic development. The existence of Mib2, which has functional similarities to Mib1 and is highly expressed in adult tissues with Mib1, brings us to speculate that both Mib1 and Mib2 might have functional redundancy in the adult tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). However, in vivo studies using KO mice have revealed the essential role of Mib1 in Notch-mediated lymphocyte development beyond embryonic development.</p><p>We previously found that Mib1 is an essential regulator for generating functional Notch ligands to activate Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). In this study, the conditional inactivation of <italic>Mib1</italic> disturbed both T lineage commitment and MZB cell specification, suggesting that Dll1 and Dll4 should be nonfunctional. Indeed, the BM transplantation experiments using the TNR mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>) demonstrate that the Mib1-null thymic microenvironment cannot initiate Notch signaling to thymic progenitors. Moreover, our reciprocal BM transplantation experiments revealed that the Mib1-null lymphopoietic niches cannot support T lineage commitment and MZB cell specification. This inability of Mib1-null microenvironments might be caused by the malfunction of Dll1 and Dll4. Consistent with this finding, the Dll1 was accumulated in the <italic>MMTV-Cre;Mib1<sup>f/f</sup></italic> thymus, although it is unlikely that most of Dll1 was present at the plasma membrane. This abnormal localization of Dll1 might result from the continual accumulation of Dll1 in the ER, Golgi, or other organelle in the absence of Mib1. Furthermore, the block in T cell development and the failure of Dll1 endocytosis were also found in OP9-DL1 cells by Mib1 knockdown, which recapitulates the defect in T cell development observed in the <italic>MMTV-Cre;Mib1<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice. Collectively, our data suggest that Mib1 controls Notch signaling in the thymic progenitors from the thymic stromal cells, through the regulation of Dll1 and Dll4.</p><p>We previously proposed that Mib1 and Neur2 may play a cooperative role in the endocytic pathway of Delta using COS-7 cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). In this study, however, the endocytosis of Dll1 was impaired in the thymi from only <italic>Mib1</italic>-null mice but not <italic>Neur1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>, <italic>Neur2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>, or <italic>Neur1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>;<italic>Neur2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice. In addition, <italic>Mib2</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice also showed normal endocytosis of Dll1, despite Mib2 readily inducing its endocytosis in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). This discrepancy might be caused by the difference between in vivo and in vitro systems. Our in vivo study using KO mice would represent more relevant physiology of the Notch ligand endocytosis than in vitro observation.</p><p>Many studies have reported that maintenance of HSCs and regulation of their self-renewal and differentiation depends on their specific microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">67</xref>). Notch ligand&#x02013;receptor interactions between the BM microenvironment and hematopoietic cells are thought to have a role in the maintenance of HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">68</xref>). In this paper, we have clearly shown that Notch signaling between the lymphopoietic niches and hematopoietic cells is required for T and MZB cell specification.
