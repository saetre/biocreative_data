Here, we describe the first mutation in the human <italic>AP1S1</italic> gene, encoding the small subunit &#x003c3;1A of the AP-1 complex. This founder splice mutation, which leads to a premature stop codon, was found in four families with a unique syndrome characterized by mental retardation, enteropathy, deafness, peripheral neuropathy, ichthyosis, and keratodermia (MEDNIK). To validate the pathogenic effect of the mutation, we knocked down <italic>Ap1s1</italic> expression in zebrafish using selective antisens morpholino oligonucleotides (AMO). The knockdown phenotype consisted of perturbation in skin formation, reduced pigmentation, and severe motility deficits due to impaired neural network development. Both neural and skin defects were rescued by co-injection of AMO with wild-type (WT) human <italic>AP1S1</italic> mRNA, but not by co-injecting the truncated form of <italic>AP1S1</italic>, consistent with a loss-of-function effect of this mutation.

However, these are all embryonic lethal, further emphasizing the importance of these complexes for appropriate development.</p><p>So far, a few but severe genetic disorders caused by mutations in genes encoding AP complex components have been described in humans. One of the most studied involves a mutation in the &#x003b2;3A subunit of AP-3 which underlies the Hermansky&#x02013;Pudlak syndrome 2 (HPS-2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000296-Huizing1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. This syndrome is characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, bleeding diathesis with absence of platelet dense bodies and abnormal depositions of ceroid lipofuscin in various organs. Mutated <italic>AP3B3A</italic> is believed to cause abnormal formation of intracellular vesicles from the trans-Golgi network or late endosomes, and probably mistrafficking of lysosomal proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000296-Ohno2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000296-Huizing1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, three mutations in <italic>AP1S2</italic>, encoding the &#x003c3;1B isoform of AP-1, have been associated with X-linked mental retardation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000296-Tarpey1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. As AP-1 is associated with synaptophysin and the vesicular acetylcholine transporter, it was suggested that these mutations cause abnormal synaptic development and function.</p><p>Erythrokeratodermia variabilis (EKV) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by erythematous lesions and hyperkeratosis caused by mutations in two epidermally expressed connexin genes, <italic>GJB3</italic> (Cx31) and <italic>GJB4</italic> (Cx30.3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000296-Richard1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000296-Macari1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Because a significant proportion of EKV families do not have mutations in <italic>GJB3</italic> and <italic>GJB4</italic>, additional EKV genes remain to be identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000296-Richard1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. We previously described the identification a new locus on chromosome 7q22 for an atypical form of EKV, in families with EKV lesions, as well as lamellar and erythrodermic ichthyosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000296.s001">Figure S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000296-Saba1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to the skin lesions, affected individuals from these families exhibit severe psychomotor retardation, peripheral neuropathy, and sensorineural hearing loss, together with elevated very-long-chain fatty acids and severe congenital diarrhea (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000296.s003">Table S1</xref>). Given the similarities with the more recently described CEDNIK syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000296-Spreche1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, we used the related acronym MEDNIK for <underline>m</underline>ental retardation, <underline>e</underline>nteropathy, <underline>d</underline>eafness, <underline>n</underline>europathy, <underline>i</underline>chthyosis, and <underline>k</underline>eratodermia to designate this unique syndrome. These MEDNIK families live in a relatively isolated population descended from a limited number of ancestors, and the gene responsible for this autosomal recessive syndrome was mapped by identifying a common homozygous region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000296-Saba1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study we present a novel splice mutation in human <italic>AP1S1</italic>, a ubiquitously-expressed gene encoding the small subunit &#x003c3;1A of AP-1, in four families with MEDNIK syndrome from the Quebec population. This founder mutation is predicted to cause the skipping of exon 3, leading to a premature stop codon at the beginning of exon 4. To further validate the <italic>AP1S1</italic> mutation, we knocked down native <italic>Ap1s1</italic> using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (AMOs) in the developing zebrafish and examined the ability of wild-type (WT) and mutated human mRNA to rescue the developmental phenotype. Overall, our results confirm that mutation of the <italic>AP1S1</italic> gene causes MEDNIK syndrome and suggest a critical implication for the <italic>AP1S1</italic> gene in development of the skin and spinal cord.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Identification of Mutated <italic>AP1S1</italic> in Individuals with MEDNIK</title><p>The region harbouring the causative gene for MEDNIK syndrome, previously named Erythrokeratodermia Variabilis type 3 (EKV3), was recently mapped to a 6.8 Mb segment of chromosome 7p using a genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) panel in 3 families originating from the Bas-St-Laurent region in the province of Quebec (Canada), sharing a common ancestor at the 10th or 11th generation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000296-Saba1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. We genotyped a fourth pedigree, which enabled us to reduce the critical region to 5.3 Mb between markers D7S2539 and D7S518 (data not shown). Among the candidate genes mapping to that interval, <italic>GJE1</italic> (encoding a connexin) and <italic>CLDN15</italic> (encoding a claudin) were sequenced but no mutation was found. Recently, a mutation in a SNARE protein (SNAP29) was associated with cerebral dysgenesis, neuropathy, ichthyosis and palmoplantar keratoderma (CEDNIK) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000296-Spreche1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Since clinical manifestations of CEDNIK show striking similarities to the MEDNIK syndrome described here, we hypothesized that a mutation in <italic>AP1S1</italic>, a functionally related gene mapping to the candidate interval, may cause the disease. By sequencing the gene, we identified a mutation in the acceptor splice site (A to G) of exon 3 in all individuals with MEDNIK (IVS2-2A&#x0003e;G). This splice mutation is predicted to cause skipping of exon 3, leading to a premature stop codon at the beginning of exon 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000296-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). All parents and an unaffected sibling were heterozygous for this mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000296-g001">Figures 1B and 1C</xref>).

Direct sequencing confirmed that the lower band corresponded to an mRNA isoform lacking exon 3. The higher band from the affected individuals corresponded to another RNA isoform, in which a cryptic splice acceptor site located 9 bp downstream of the start of the third exon was used. The resulting in frame protein is thus predicted to lack only three amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000296-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).

Immature WT larvae did not show abnormal morphology of the skin and fin, suggesting that this phenotype is specific to the morpholino treatment rather than a general developmental retardation. The specificity of the AMO effect was confirmed by using Ap1s1 Western blotting and immunolabelling in wholemount larvae. With both methods we observed a decrease in the intensity of the Ap1s1-specific labeling in the <italic>Ap1s1</italic> KD larvae compared to the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000296-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, inset, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000296-g002">Figures 2F and 2C</xref>).

Based on the observation of reduced neurogenesis we have made in zebrafish, we speculate that MEDNIK syndrome in affected patients is caused by an impaired development of various neural networks, including the spinal cord (ataxia and peripheral neuropathy) and possibly the brain (microcephaly and psychomotor retardation) and inner ear (sensorineural deafness). We also hypothesize that disruption of AP1S1 in humans may be associated with more extensive perturbation of organogenesis. Indeed, growth retardation, digestive tract malformations and dysfunction (chronic diarrhea), and elevation of very long chain fatty acid observed in individuals with MEDNIK syndrome might reflect more widespread perturbation of vesicular transport and of epithelial cell development. One intriguing question is why the <italic>AP1S1</italic>-exon 3 mutation is not lethal in homozygous individuals with MEDNIK. Indeed, overexpression of human <italic>AP1S1</italic>-exon3 mRNA failed to rescue the phenotype observed in <italic>Ap1s1</italic> KD larvae, suggesting a loss of function of this critical protein. However, co-injection of the <italic>AP1S1</italic>-9bp human mutant mRNA with AMO, the alternative RNA species detected in our MEDNIK patients, rescued the phenotype, suggesting that this alternative splicing results in a functional protein.

The fact that the <italic>AP1S1</italic>-9bp mRNA is expressed at low levels (less than 10 &#x00025; of normal levels in fibroblasts) could explain why it is not sufficient to sustain normal development and function and further highlight the important role of AP1S1 in normal development.

All primers were designed using NM_001283 as the reference sequence. As an expression control for use in quantification, universal 18S primers were included in the same reaction mixes. PCR conditions were: 95&#x000b0;C for 10 min, 45 cycles of 30 sec at 95&#x000b0;C, 30 sec at 56&#x000b0;C, and 30 sec at 72&#x000b0;C. Reactions were cycled on the 7900HT Real-time PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems). Relative expression for each sample was evaluated by using the difference in the threshold cycle (&#x00394;Ct ) value to achieve a similar level of fluorescence. 18S relative expression was used to normalize for the cDNA quantity of each sample. All values correspond to an average of three independent experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Cloning of Human <italic>AP1S1</italic></title><p>We designed primers (<italic>AP1S1</italic>-<named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-TAAGCGGATCCATGATGCGGTTCATGCTATTATTC</named-content>, and <italic>AP1S1</italic>-<named-content content-type="gene">3&#x02032;-GTAAGCCTCGAGTCAGTGGGAAAAGGGGAAAGTGG</named-content>) to amplify the complete open reading frame of <italic>AP1S1</italic>-variant1 from a human brain cDNA library (Marathon-ready, BD Biosciences Clontech), using <italic>Pfu</italic> Polymerase (Stratagene).
