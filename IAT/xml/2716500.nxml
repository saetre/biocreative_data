WNT ligands and Frizzled receptors are coexpressed in primary breast tumors and cancer cell lines. Moreover, many breast tumors show hypermethylation of the secreted Frizzled-related protein 1 (sFRP1) promoter region, causing low expression of this WNT antagonist. We have previously shown that the WNT pathway influences proliferation of breast cancer cell lines via activation of canonical signaling and epidermal growth factor receptor transactivation, and that interference with WNT signaling reduces proliferation. Here we examine the role of WNT signaling in breast tumor cell migration and on xenograft outgrowth.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 was used to study WNT signaling. We examined the effects of activating or blocking the WNT pathway on cell motility by treatment with WNT ligands or by ectopic sFPR1 expression, respectively. The ability of sFRP1-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells to grow as xenografts was also tested. Microarray analyses were carried out to identify targets with roles in MDA-MB-231/sFRP1 tumor growth inhibition.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We show that WNT stimulates the migratory ability of MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, ectopic expression of sFRP1 in MDA-MB-231 cells blocks canonical WNT signaling and decreases their migratory potential. Moreover, the ability of MDA-MB-231/sFRP1-expressing cells to grow as xenografts in mammary glands and to form lung metastases is dramatically impaired. Microarray analyses led to the identification of two genes, <italic>CCND1 </italic>and <italic>CDKN1A</italic>, whose expression level is selectively altered <italic>in vivo </italic>in sFRP1-expressing tumors. The encoded proteins cyclin D1 and p21<sup>Cip1 </sup>were downregulated and upregulated, respectively, in sFRP1-expressing tumors, suggesting that they are downstream mediators of WNT signaling.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results show that the WNT pathway influences multiple biological properties of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. WNT stimulates tumor cell motility; conversely sFRP1-mediated WNT pathway blockade reduces motility. Moreover, ectopic sFRP1 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells has a strong negative impact on tumor outgrowth and blocked lung metastases. These results suggest that interference with WNT signaling using sFRP1 to block the ligand- receptor interaction may be a valid therapeutic approach in breast cancer.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The WNT signaling network is complex, with 19 WNT ligands, 10 Frizzled (FZD) receptors, as well as the co-receptors, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) 5 and LRP6. WNT receptor binding stimulates intracellular signaling, promoting stabilization and nuclear translocation of the key effector of the canonical pathway, &#x003b2;-catenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Intracellular mediators of the WNT pathway are mutated in many human cancers. Inactivating mutations in the <italic>APC </italic>or <italic>AXIN </italic>genes, as well as activating <italic>CTNNB1 </italic>mutations, each causes &#x003b2;-catenin stabilization and nuclear accumulation in the absence of WNT ligands. In the nucleus, &#x003b2;-catenin forms functional complexes with transcription factors of the lymphoid enhancer binding factor-1/T-cell factor (TCF) family, activating expression of target genes with cancer-promoting roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In addition to activation of the canonical pathway by engagement of FZD and LRP receptors, WNT ligands bind the Ror2 or Ryk receptors to stimulate &#x003b2;-catenin-independent pathways that have been involved with cytoskeletal reorganization and cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>In breast cancer, deregulation of WNT signaling appears to occur by autocrine mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Multiple WNT ligands and FZD receptors are expressed in primary human breast tumors and in breast cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, most breast tumors show hypermethylation of the promoter region of secreted Frizzled-related protein 1 (sFRP1) and low expression of this negative WNT pathway regulator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Interference with autocrine WNT signaling has been shown to block <italic>in vitro </italic>proliferation of many human breast cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. We have extended these studies and show in the present article that blocking the WNT pathway in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells not only decreases proliferation, but also impairs the motility of the tumor cells. Furthermore, we show that stable expression of sFRP1 in MDA-MD-231 cells has a dramatic effect on the ability of the cells to grow as tumor xenografts in nude mice. The results presented here provide further evidence supporting approaches to target WNT pathway activity in breast cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>The following primary antibodies were used: c-Myc (9E10, to detect Myc-tagged protein), DVL2 and DVL3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA); DVL1 (R&#x00026;D Systems, Abingdon, UK); active &#x003b2;-catenin (anti-ABC; Upstate, Billerica, VA, USA); &#x003b1;-tubulin (DM1A) (Neomarkers, Fremont, CA, USA); cyclin D1 (SP4) (Cell MARQUE, Rocklin, CA, USA) for immunohistochemistry (IHC); cyclin D1 (Chemicon, Billerica, MA, USA) for western blotting; bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) (Roche, Basel Switzerland); p21<sup>Cip1 </sup>(OP64-100UG) (Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA, USA); ERK and P-ERK (Thr202/Tyr204) (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA); total &#x003b2;-catenin and CD31 (BD Pharmingen, Franklin Lakes, CA, USA); and active &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-integrin (Clone HUTS-4, MAB2079Z; Chemicon).</p><p>As secondary antibodies we used anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK; LI-COR Bioscience, Lincoln, NE, USA), anti-rat antibody (GE Healthcare) or anti-goat antibody (DAKO A/S, Glostrup, Denmark) coupled to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or IRDye 800CW.</p><p>For IHC we used Biotin-SP-conjugated affinipure donkey anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, anti-rat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA) and goat anti-rat ALEXA 568 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA).

As a consequence of WNT binding to FZD, cytoplasmic scaffolding proteins of the Dishevelled family (DVL1, DVL2 and DVL3) become phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues. DVL phosphorylation, which is the most proximal signaling event downstream of FZD activation, can be monitored by a decrease in the electrophoretic mobility of p-DVL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. DVL1, DVL2 and DVL3, total &#x003b2;-catenin and stabilized active &#x003b2;-catenin were examined by western analysis in the individual clones. In the sFRP1-expressing cells, there was a decrease in the level of the three p-DVLs, compared with the vector control cells. Furthermore, the level of total &#x003b2;-catenin and active &#x003b2;-catenin was reduced in the two clones expressing the highest level of sFRP1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>).</p><p>Next we examined transcriptional activity of the canonical WNT signaling pathway following transient expression of the TOPFlash TCF reporter plasmid in the cells. TOPFlash luciferase reporter activity showed a significant 2.7-fold decrease in the sFRP1-expressing cells compared with controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>), confirming that ectopic expression of sFRP1 reduces canonical pathway activity in MDA-MB-231 cells. The phosphorylation status of ERK, another signaling protein that is active in MDA-MB-231 cells, was not altered in the sFRP1-expressing cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>), suggesting that the effects of sFRP1 are specific for the WNT pathway.</p><p>For further studies, the three sFRP1-expressing clones were pooled (P1) and a second pool of sFRP1-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells consisting of &#x0003e; 100 clones was generated (P2).

One day after plating there was no significant difference between the control cells and the sFRP1-expressing cells. After 3 days, however, we observed a significant difference in the sFRP1-P1 cells and sFRP1-P2 cells compared with control cultures. This effect appears to be dependent on sFRP1 expression levels since, in comparison with controls, there is a 31% and a 16% reduction in proliferation of MDA-MB-231/sFRP1-P1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref>) and MDA-MB-231/sFRP1-P2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1e</xref>) cells at day 3, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Xenografts of sFRP1-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells show reduced growth in nude mice</title><p>To test the <italic>in vivo </italic>effects of sFRP1 expression, control and sFRP1-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells were injected into the mammary fat pads of female nude mice and tumor growth was monitored.

In summary, the <italic>in silico </italic>analysis carried out on RNA of tumors arising from the MDA-MB-231/sFRP1 cells revealed altered levels of target genes (<italic>CCND1 </italic>and <italic>CDKN1A</italic>) that probably contribute to the anti-proliferative effects of sFRP1 expression. Moreover, our results also show the strong influence that the <italic>in vivo </italic>tumor environment has, not only on gene expression, but also on c-Myc protein. Decreased c-Myc levels might also contribute to the <italic>in vivo </italic>activity of sFRP1.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Aberrant activation of WNT signaling plays an important role in many types of human cancer, warranting therapeutic approaches to target the pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Wnt1 was the first identified oncogene activated by mouse mammary tumor virus insertional mutagenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], establishing the potential of aberrant WNT expression to promote mammary cancer. Currently, it is well documented that multiple WNT ligands and FZD receptors are expressed in primary human breast tumors and breast cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], making it difficult to identify an individual ligand/receptor complex that could serve as a cancer target. Using broad antagonists &#x02013; including the cysteine-rich domain of the FZD8 receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] or sFRP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] &#x02013; to interfere with WNT/FZD binding, however, the potential of targeting WNT binding to FZD as a therapeutic approach in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and in other cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] has been demonstrated.</p><p>Aberrant methylation of the sFRP1 promoter is one of the most consistent alterations in human cancer. In addition to breast tumors that have low sFRP1 levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], sFRP1 suppression has been described in colon tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], ovarian tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], bladder tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and prostate tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Based on its widespread loss, interest in testing the effects of sFRP1 treatment in tumor models has been high. Indeed, sFRP1 has also been shown to impact on transforming properties of breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and cervix cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]; while sFRP2 has been shown to block proliferation of gastric cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. We have previously shown that proliferation of the estrogen-receptor-positive MCF7 and T47D, and the ErbB2-overexpressing JIMT-1, SKBR3 and BT474 breast tumor cell lines is decreased following treatment with sFRP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In the current study we tested the impact of ectopic sFRP1 expression in the aggressive, basal-like [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells. The results presented show that ectopic sFRP1 expression in MDA-MB-231 tumor cells blocks the migratory ability and the proliferative potential of the tumor cells, both <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>, supporting the proposal that blockade of WNT signaling with sFRP1 might be a general approach to target not only breast, but also other types of cancer.</p><p>In addition to testing sFRP1, we also examined the effects of specific Wnt ligands on motility and found that the canonical ligands Wnt1 and Wnt3a stimulate MDA-MB-231 cells in a wound closure assay. These results correlate well with the stimulatory effects of both Wnt ligands in other cellular models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The Wnt/PCP pathway is considered the major mediator of cell motility. Indeed, this pathway stimulates many cytoskeleton regulators, including Rho family GTPases and Rho kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Both Wnt1 and Wnt3a have been shown to activate RhoA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], whereas the non-canonical Wnt5a promotes melanoma migration via RhoB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Furthermore, Rho kinase inhibition has been shown to block the effects of Wnt3a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. We have also observed that the Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 blocks Wnt3a-induced MDA-MB-231 wound closure (data not shown). In contrast to the positive effects of Wnt ligands on motility, we show here that sFRP1-mediated blockade of endogenous WNT signaling not only reduced the basal motility of the MDA-MB-231 cells, but also impaired the ability of the cells to respond to Wnt1 in a wound closure assay. sFRP1 has also been shown to block motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] of other types of tumor cells. Importantly, the negative impact of sFRP1 on MDA-MB231 motility translated, <italic>in vivo</italic>, to a block in the metastatic potential of these aggressive breast tumor cells. In comparison with control MDA-MB-231 cells, we observed a 20-fold decrease in the number of lung metastasis arising from sFRP1-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells.</p><p>MDA-MB-231/sFRP1 cells also proliferated more slowly than control cells; however, the effect of sFRP1 was more striking <italic>in vivo </italic>than <italic>in vitro</italic>. Following injection of MDA-MB-231/sFRP1 cells into mammary glands of nude mice, the time to appearance of the tumors was consistently longer than that observed with control MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, tumors generated by the sFRP1-expressing cells not only grew more slowly than control tumors, but there were threefold more tumor-free mice at the end of each experiment in this group. Since sFRP1 is a secreted protein, it could act extrinsically on cells in the tumor environment. We concentrated in particular on tumor-associated vessels based on the reported ability of sFPR1 to block <italic>in vivo </italic>neovascularization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Neither the vessel number nor their functionality differed, however, in tumors generated by sFRP1-expressing cells in comparison with those of control MDA-MB-231 cells. The impact of sFRP1 on WNT signaling and downstream transcription in the MDA-MB-231 cells might therefore more probably explain the protein's strong <italic>in vivo </italic>effects. Indeed, there were 3.7-fold more genes whose transcription was altered by sFRP1 expression <italic>in vivo </italic>compared with <italic>in vitro </italic>(1,246 vs. 332). Furthermore, only 54 genes overlapped in the two lists. Taken together, these results demonstrate the strong impact of tumor environment on gene expression.</p><p>We also performed an in-depth analysis to identify genes that were only affected <italic>in vivo</italic>, in the sFRP1-expressing tumors, with the intention of finding potential targets that could account for the strong effect of sFRP1 on MDA-MB-231 tumor-forming potential. There were a total of 168 genes (106 downregulated genes and 62 upregulated genes) that were only affected <italic>in vivo </italic>in sFRP1-expressing tumors (see Additional data files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>). Changes in expression of two <italic>in vivo </italic>identified genes, <italic>CCND1 </italic>and <italic>CDKN1A</italic>, encoding important cell cycle regulators were confirmed by IHC and immunoblotting on tumor cells. Cyclin D1 and p21<sup>Cip1 </sup>were found to be downregulated and upregulated, respectively, only in sFRP1-expressing tumors, which might be one reason why the impact of sFRP1 expression is stronger <italic>in vivo</italic>. These results raise the question as to why <italic>CCND1 </italic>and <italic>CDKN1A </italic>were only affected <italic>in vivo</italic>. While we can only speculate at this time, two explanations are worth discussion. First, c-Myc, which controls expression of both genes, was only downregulated in the sFRP1-expressing tumors; second, in the tumors there were major changes in expression of probesets for extracellular matrix proteins.</p><p><italic>MYC </italic>is WNT pathway target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. We did not detect changes in <italic>MYC </italic>expression, however, either in the microarrays (see Additional data files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>) or by quantitative real-time PCR (see Additional data file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>). Interestingly, c-Myc protein was low in all of the sFRP1-expressing tumors (see Additional data file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>). C-Myc is subject to control at many levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and the fact that c-Myc protein only changed in the sFRP-1-expressing tumors could be a reflection of the <italic>in vivo </italic>environment. Irrespective of the mechanism underlying these results, the fact that c-Myc stimulates cyclin D1 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and is a repressor for p21<sup>Cip1 </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] suggests that lower c-Myc levels could contribute to the altered expression of both cell cycle regulators in sFRP1-expressing tumors.</p><p>Turning to the extracellular matrix components, probesets for fibronectin, laminins and collagens were found to be strongly altered (see Additional data file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>, 29 probesets for the extracellular matrix). As expected, <italic>FN1 </italic>&#x02013; a WNT pathway target (see Additional data files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>) &#x02013; was decreased in sFRP1-expressing cells and tumors. The most striking difference, however, was seen when comparing the signal of the 29 probesets in cultured cells versus tumors. On the one hand, 25 out of the 29 probesets (see Additional data file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>) were strongly increased <italic>in vivo </italic>in control tumors, showing the impact of the tumor environment on expression of the encoded genes. Moreover, 21 out of these 25 were downregulated in sFRP1-expressing tumors.</p><p>Fibronectin, laminin and collagen are ligands for &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-integrin, which was also suppressed in sFRP1-expressing cells (see Additional data file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>). The decrease in &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-integrin RNA was confirmed at the protein level by performing a fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis on intact cells with an antibody that recognizes active &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-integrin (see Additional data file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref>). Integrin engagement is therefore likely to be decreased in sFRP1-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells, which in turn is likely to influence their proliferation. On the one hand fibronectin has been shown to stimulate proliferation of cancer cells, and this was associated with increased cyclin D1 and decreased p21<sup>Cip1 </sup>levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Moreover, we have previously shown that siRNA-mediated knockdown of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-integrin in MDA-MB-231 cells increases p21<sup>Cip1 </sup>expression and leads to a proliferative decrease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. We propose that integrin engagement would be more strongly affected <italic>in vivo </italic>since not only the receptor but also many of its extracellular matrix binding partners are decreased <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>In summary, the results presented here show that sFRP1-mediated blockade of WNT signaling in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells has an impact on the <italic>in vitro </italic>proliferation and motility of the cancer cells. The <italic>in vivo </italic>effects of WNT pathway blockade were even more dramatic since we observed a strong decrease in the mammary tumor-forming potential and an impairment of lung metastases. In summary, blockade of the WNT-FZ interaction using sFRP1 has a strong effect on breast tumor growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results presented in this paper showing that sFRP1-mediated WNT pathway blockade strongly blocks the <italic>in vivo </italic>tumor forming potential of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells suggest that interference with WNT signaling at the ligand-receptor level may be a valid therapeutic approach in breast cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BrdU: bromodeoxyuridine; CM: conditioned medium; DMEM: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; DVL: Dishevelled; ERK1/2: extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2; FCS: fetal calf serum; FITC: fluorescein isothiocyanate; FZD: Frizzled; HRP: horseradish peroxidase; IHC: immunohistochemistry; LRP: low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; PCR: polymerase chain reaction; RM ANOVA: repeated-measures analysis of variance; sFRP1: secreted Frizzled-related protein 1; siRNA: small interfering RNA; TCF: T-cell factor; WNT: wingless and integration site growth factor.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>YM planned and performed the experiments and participated in writing the paper.
