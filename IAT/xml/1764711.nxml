Upon binding to their target recognition sequences, SSRs can induce the deletion, insertion, or inversion of DNA sequences leading to conditional gene inactivation or expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000162-Branda1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The first widely used SSR in mammalian cultured cells and animals was the P1 bacteriophage-derived Cre, a member of the &#x003bb; integrase family that recognizes homotypic 34 bp loxP recognition sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000162-OGorman1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000162-Sauer1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. To date, Cre recombinase remains the most efficient only SSR to efficiently mediate DNA recombination both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. A second SSR from the &#x003bb; integrase family, FLP from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, has also been used in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000162-Dymecki1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> and recognizes distinct 34 bp FRT sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000162-McLeod1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Initial use of FLP in mammalian cells revealed inefficient recombinase activity due to thermo-instability of the protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000162-Buchholz1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Subsequent screening for thermo-stable mutants resulted in the identification of FLPe, with a 4-fold increase in recombination efficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000162-Buchholz2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Despite this improvement, the recombination efficiency of FLPe in cells remains quite low, at most a 6&#x00025;, with mosaic recombination found in almost all ES clones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000162-Schaft1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. A third SSR, &#x003a6;C31 from <italic>Streptomyces lividans</italic>, also displays activity in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000162-Belteki1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000162-Groth1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Unlike Cre and FLP, &#x003a6;C31 mediates DNA recombination at heterotypic binding sequences known as attB and attP sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000162-Groth1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Upon recombination of these target sites, hybrid attL or attR sites are created which are refractive to further recombination, locking the newly formed sequences into place <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000162-Groth1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, a distinct feature desirable in many molecular applications. Although one report suggests that &#x003a6;C31 may be nearly as efficient as Cre in mediating recombination in cultured cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000162-Andreas1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, others have indicated more limited success <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000162-Belteki1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> and thus the broad utility of this recombinase as a tool remains to be established. In this manuscript we now report that the <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of mouse codon-optimized FLP (FLPo) and &#x003a6;C31 (&#x003a6;C31o) SSRs result in DNA recombination efficiencies similar to that of Cre.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>One reason for the observed varying degrees of efficiency of SSRs in mammalian cells may be their non-mammalian origin. Achieving high steady-state expression levels of non-endogenous genes in mammalian systems can be difficult, due to differences in amino acid codon usage, or the presence of cryptic splice acceptor/donor sites since these genes do not normally undergo splicing in the native host. To improve their translational efficiency in mammalian cells, FLPe and &#x003a6;C31 recombinases were re-engineered <italic>de novo</italic> according to the native amino acid sequence but with mouse codon usage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000162.s001">Figures S1</xref> &#x00026; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000162.s002">S2</xref>). The final &#x003a6;C31 and FLP DNA coding sequence optimization was designed using the GeneOptimizer software algorithm (Geneart GmbH, Regensburg, Germany; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.geneart.com/">http://www.geneart.com/</ext-link>). During the optimization process a number of sequence motifs were avoided, including internal TATA-boxes, ribosomal entry sites, stretches of AT- and GC-rich sequence, repeat sequences, RNA secondary structure, and cryptic splice and polyadenylation sites (for review on synthetic gene design see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000162-Gustafsson1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>). Additionally, the codon-optimized &#x003a6;C31 gene (&#x003a6;C31optimized or &#x003a6;C31o) was synthesized with a reduced number of CpG dinucleotides, to avoid gene silencing associated with DNA methylation at such sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000162-Schumacher1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Last, the overall base composition of the codon-optimized FLPe gene (FLP optimized or FLPo) was modified to prolong mRNA half-life, since genes with low G/C content often result in less stable mRNAs and low levels of expression. Two stop codons were included in the optimized SSRs to ensure efficient translational termination.</p><p>Recombination activity of the re-engineered FLPo and &#x003a6;C31o were directly compared in appropriate ROSA26 based ES reporter lines to the native FLPe and &#x003a6;C31 sequences, as well as to Cre (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000162-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). To allow a direct comparison between SSRs, all expression constructs were driven by the phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK) promoter, included a Kozak consensus translational start sequence, an SV40 nuclear localization signal, and were terminated by a bovine growth hormone polyadenylation sequence. Since a multitude of changes were made across the entire coding sequences of the codon-optimized recombinases, any potential observed differences in DNA recombination activity would be due to the combined effects of a number of parameters that were altered in the re-engineering process. Recombination activity for &#x003a6;C31 and &#x003a6;C31o was assessed in R26attR reporter ES cells that contain a &#x003b2;-galactosidase gene disrupted by an attB and attP-flanked stop cassette (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000162.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p><p>The results of these stable transfection assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000162-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) indicate that codon-optimization of the FLPe and &#x003a6;C31 genes significantly improves recombination activity in ES cells, to a level similar to that observed with Cre recombinase. Analysis of X-gal staining revealed that a majority of ES cell colonies displayed complete Cre-mediated recombination activity when harboring an integrated PGKCre expression vector compared to reporter cell line alone. However, ES cell colonies containing an integrated &#x003a6;C31 expression construct showed either no or very mosaic X-Gal staining. In marked contrast, most ES cell clones containing an integrated codon-optimized &#x003a6;C31o construct displayed robust X-gal staining. We next performed alkaline phosphatase staining on FLP reporter ES cells and observed no recombination mediated by the native FLPe gene (although using pCAGGS-FLPe we observed &#x0223c;5&#x00025; of clones with mosaic recombination, as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000162-Schaft1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>). In contrast, the majority of the ES colonies displayed efficient FLP-mediated recombination activity when containing an integrated codon-optimized FLPo expression vector. These results indicate that Cre, FLPo and &#x003a6;C31o, all achieve similar recombination efficiency in ES cells.</p><p>Based on the promising activity of &#x003a6;C31o in mediating recombination events in ES cells, we tested recombination efficiency <italic>in vivo</italic> by targeting the coding sequences of &#x003a6;C31 and the codon-optimized &#x003a6;C31o to the broadly expressed ROSA26 locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000162-Soriano1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000162-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Such strains would potentially allow for more complex genetic analysis when used in combination with Cre and FLP expressing mouse strains. Although continued expression of &#x003a6;C31 has been shown to lead to chromosomal aberrations in primary human fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000162-Liu1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, R26&#x003a6;C31 and R26&#x003a6;C31o heterozygous or homozygous mice were viable and neither showed any obvious deleterious effects from the widespread expression of the SSR. Recombination activity was assessed by crossing R26&#x003a6;C31 and R26&#x003a6;C31o mice to the R26attR reporter mouse strain. E10.5 embryos carrying the R26attR reporter allele alone exhibited no background X-gal staining (data not shown). R26&#x003a6;C31; R26attR compound heterozygotes exhibited a variable low-level mosaic pattern of X-Gal staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000162-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). In contrast, R26&#x003a6;C31o; R26attR embryos exhibited broad X-gal staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000162-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), although sectioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000162-g002">Figure 2D</xref>) revealed that recombination was not as efficient as was observed in R26Cre; R26R embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000162-Soriano1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The use of multiple, highly efficient SSRs in ES cells and mice now opens possibilities for a broader range of molecular manipulations. These not only include the potential for additional genetic alterations during ES cell expansion (such as removal of selectable markers) and performing multiple general or tissue-specific gene knockouts, but also for studying gene function in over-lapping domains of expression. Additionally, the use of multiple SSRs could potentially be used for controlling gene expression in a temporal &#x0201c;off-on-off&#x0201d; manner in single or multiple cell types or tissues.

SSR-mediated recombination activity was assessed on hygromycin-resistant ES cell colonies by X-gal (Cre and &#x003a6;C31) and AP staining (FLP). Variable degrees of recombination were observed in colonies, as judged by the percentage of cells reacting with X-Gal; representative ES cell colonies are shown.
