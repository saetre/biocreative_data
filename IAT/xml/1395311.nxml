On this respect, dexamethasone (Dex) dependent protection against TNF-alpha-mediated cell death in the MCF-7 cell line has been demonstrated to be a useful model for the study of this type of cancer.

Next, negative dominants of PI3K and IkappaB-alpha, designed to block the PI3K/Akt and NF-kappaB pathways, respectively, were transfected and selection and evaluation of several clones overexpressing the mutants were examined. Also, correlation with inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) expression was examined. Independent inhibition of these two pathways allowed us to test their participation in Dex-dependent protection against TNF-alpha-cytotoxicity in MCF-7 cells. Expression of the PI3K dominant negative mutant did not alter the protection conferred by Dex against TNF-alpha mediated cell death. Contrariwise, clones expressing the IkappaB-alpha dominant negative mutant lost the Dex-conferred protection against TNF-alpha. In these clones degradation of c-IAP was accelerated, while that of XIAP was remained unaffected.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>NF-kappaB, but not PI3K/Akt activation, is required for the Dex protective effect against TNF-alpha-mediated cell death, and correlates with lack of degradation of the anti-apoptotic protein c-IAP1.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Breast cancer is one of the most important oncologic diseases worldwide, and in Mexico is the second most frequent neoplasia in women population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. It is widely accepted that among the factors involved in the development of this ailment are long-standing inflammation and steroid hormone regulation. On this respect, the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;) has been postulated as a key player in the tumor microenvironment, but has a paradoxical role in disease evolution: It can act both as a necrotic or as a promoting factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] e.g., the endogenous TNF-&#x003b1; chronically produced in the tumor microenvironment enhances both tumor development and spreading, while local administration of high-doses of TNF-&#x003b1; is antiangiogenic and has a powerful anti-tumoral effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. It is worth to note that TNF-&#x003b1; acts as a mediator of the apoptotic process and has selective cytotoxicity against malignant breast tumor cells, promoting an apoptotic type of cell death in MCF-7 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>TNF-&#x003b1;, a 17,000 kDa polypeptide, elicits a wide range of biological responses, including inflammation, cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The binding of TNF-&#x003b1; to the TNF receptor type I (TNF-RI) promotes the recruitment of several intracellular adaptors which in turn, activate multiple signal transduction pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. While recruitment of death domain (DD) containing adaptors such as Fas associated DD (FADD) and TNF-R associated DD (TRADD) can lead to the activation of signal transduction pathways that induce apoptosis, recruitment of TNF-RI associated factors (TRAFs) can lead to the activation of multiple cell survival intracellular signals such as NF-&#x003ba;B, JNK, p38 and Erk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Glucocorticoids (GCs) are essential steroid hormones required for the maintenance of several key physiological and developmental processes. GCs act through binding to the GC receptor (GR), which is followed by GR translocation into the nucleus and trans-activation or trans-repression of target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In addition, rapid nongenomic effects of GCs have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. There is a dual and cell-type-specific role for GCs in cell death regulation: GCs are able to induce apoptosis in lymphocytes, leukemic cells, lymphomas and multiple myeloma cells (reviewed in 10). However, in other cell types such as hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], vascular endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], osteoclasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and particularly in mammary epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], GCs can inhibit apoptosis induced by a variety of different stimuli. Besides, in the human breast tumor derived cell line MCF-7 the synthetic GC dexamethasone (Dex) is able to completely abrogate the TNF-&#x003b1;-mediated cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In fact, this system has been recognized as a valuable experimental model to study hormone dependent breast cancer cells. However, and despite many efforts, the mechanism used by Dex to interfere with the TNF-&#x003b1;-dependent cell death remains poorly understood.</p><p>To investigate the interaction of TNF-&#x003b1; and Dex we used the MCF-7 cell line and evaluated the contribution of two main routes involved in cell survival: the nuclear factor &#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B) and the phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase (PI3K) activated pathways. NF-&#x003ba;B is a heterodimer, typically consisting of the p50 and p65 monomers, sequestered in the cytoplasm of most un-stimulated cells by members of the family of inhibitory proteins I&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. NF-&#x003ba;B is activated by TNF-&#x003b1; through ubiquitin-mediated degradation of I&#x003ba;Bs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. After I&#x003ba;B degradation, NF-&#x003ba;B translocates to the nucleus and binds to &#x003ba;B sites up-regulating a panel of proteins, including the anti-apoptotic proteins (IAP) c-IAP1, c-IAP2 and XIAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Deficiencies in NF-&#x003ba;B activation or interference with the synthesis of new proteins render a cell extremely sensitive to TNF-&#x003b1; induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>In addition to their participation in survival and proliferation, PI3K and its target PKB/Akt, have emerged as critical signaling molecules that regulate multiple cellular processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The ability of PI3K or Akt to suppress apoptosis has been attributed to both, Bad and caspase-9 phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], as well as ceramide regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In addition to these anti-apoptotic effects, Akt can also contribute activating NIK, with the consequent nuclear translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Thus, depending on cell context and cell type, TNF-&#x003b1; is able to induce cell survival or apoptosis pathways.</p><p>It has been demonstrated that NF-&#x003ba;B is able to inhibit apoptosis triggered by TNF-&#x003b1;, and that NF-&#x003ba;B activation by both, constitutively active PI3K or Akt, suppresses TNF-&#x003b1;-dependent apoptosis in MCF-7 and HEK 293 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. We found that Dex protection against a TNF-&#x003b1;-dependent cell death was not affected by the expression of a dominant-negative PI3K mutant protein (&#x00394;p85). However, expression of a non-degradable I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; mutant protein (dnIKB&#x003b1;) completely abrogated Dex protection against TNF-&#x003b1;-induced cell death. In addition, expression of dnI&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; was accompanied by downregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein c-IAP1.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Dexamethasone blocks the cytotoxicity of TNF-&#x003b1; in the breast carcinoma-derived cell line MCF-7</title><p>In order to determine the sensitivity of MCF-7 cells to TNF-&#x003b1; cell cultures were incubated with 2, 5 and 10 ng ml<sup>-1 </sup>of TNF-&#x003b1; for different periods of time. Cell survival was determined by crystal violet assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Like it was reported before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], TNF-&#x003b1; showed a dose- and time-dependent cytotoxic effect on cell survival. We observed that the minimum cell survival of 17.4 % was at the highest dose of TNF-&#x003b1; used (10 ng ml<sup>-1</sup>) at the longest period of incubation (96 h). The maximum change in cytotoxicity occurred between 24 and 48 h with about 80% to 45% survival respectively with a dose of 10 ng ml<sup>-1</sup>. At longer periods of time cell mortality increased even further (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). To evaluate the range of the protective doses of Dex against TNF-&#x003b1; cytotoxicity, MCF-7 cells were co-incubated with TNF-&#x003b1; (10 ng ml<sup>-1</sup>) at different concentrations of Dex or its vehicle for 48 h (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Dex protected cells against TNF-&#x003b1;-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner. 10 &#x003bc;M Dex offered a complete protection against the cytotoxic effect of TNF-&#x003b1; and, at 100 &#x003bc;M, had a toxic effect on its own. In subsecuent experiments we used a concentration of Dex of 10 &#x003bc;M. As shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, Dex 10 &#x003bc;M was able to prevent the TNF-&#x003b1;-dependent reduction in cell number in MCF-7 cultures without any alteration of cellular morphology even after 48 h of incubation. To elucidate the molecular mechanism involved in the protective effects of Dex against TNF-&#x003b1; dependent cell death, we evaluated the possible participation of the PI3K and NF-&#x003ba;B survival pathways.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Dexamethasone inhibits in a dose-dependent manner the TNF-&#x003b1; mediated cytotoxicity in MCF-7 cells: </bold>(<bold>A</bold>) MCF-7 cells were treated with different concentrations of TNF-&#x003b1; and cell survival was determined at the indicated times (24, 48, 72 and 96 h).

As is shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, TNF-&#x003b1; stimulation of MCF-7 cells resulted in an increase of the phosphorylated state of Akt (pAkt). Dex treatment did not affect the levels of pAkt in unstimulated or TNF-&#x003b1; treated cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), suggesting that Akt phosphorylation does not participate in Dex protection. Expression of the PI3K dominant negative mutant (&#x00394;P85) protein in three independent clones, A6, A8 and A10, abrogated the TNF-&#x003b1;-associated phosphorylation of Akt (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, upper panel) without affecting total Akt protein levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, lower panel). It is worth to note that Akt activation has been reported to play an important role in I&#x003ba;B degradation and NF-&#x003ba;B activation in diverse cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. To assure that PI3K/Akt signal pathway inhibition did not affect the NF-&#x003ba;B survival route, we tested if overexpression of &#x00394;P85 could alter the I&#x003ba;B degradation and NF-&#x003ba;B nuclear translocation. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> shows that the inhibition of Akt phosphorylation by &#x00394;P85 in the clone 6 did not affect the I&#x003ba;B degradation induced by TNF-&#x003b1; stimulation. Moreover, the NF-&#x003ba;B activation induced by TNF-&#x003b1; was not affected in these cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>).

In contrast, when the clone C8, expressing low levels of dnI&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;, was stimulated with TNF-&#x003b1;, NF-&#x003ba;B activation was almost as intense as in the parental MCF-7 cells or in those transfected with the empty vector (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, compare lines 9&#x02013;12 with lanes 1&#x02013;4 and 5&#x02013;8). When cell survival was determined in the different clones after exposure to TNF-&#x003b1; in the presence or absence of Dex, we found that Dex protection was completely abrogated in the clone expressing high levels of the dnI&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). In addition, the clone C1 became more susceptible to the cytotoxic effect of TNF-&#x003b1; since cell viability fell by half when compared to the clone C8 or parental untransfected cells. In both clones Dex protection was dramatically reduced when compared to the parental cell line: viability was indistinguishable from that of cells exposed only to TNF-&#x003b1; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). These results suggest a dose-dependent effect of active NF-&#x003ba;B in the protection mediated by Dex.</p></sec><sec><title>Loss of dexamethasone protection in dnI&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; expressing cells correlates with a lower c-IAP1 content</title><p>As has been previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], Dex protection against TNF-&#x003b1; cytotoxicity correlates with inhibition of XIAP and c-IAP1 protein degradation. TNF-&#x003b1; exposure resulted in a time dependent decline of both XIAP and c-IAP1 in the parental MCF-7 cells (left panels, figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Dex treatment alone had no effect on the levels of either of the two antiapoptotic proteins even after 24 hrs (data not shown). Simultaneous stimulation with TNF-&#x003b1; and Dex led to higher levels of the two proteins when compared to the effect of TNF-&#x003b1; alone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>, left panels), as previously shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. When MCF-7 cells expressing dnI&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; were treated with TNF-&#x003b1; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, right panels) the downregulation of XIAP and, especially that of c-IAP1, was accelerated and resulted in lower levels than those reached in parental cells. Treatment with TNF-&#x003b1; plus Dex led to a differential effect in the two antiapoptotic proteins: In the case of XIAP, the protein downregulation time course was similar to that of the parental cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, right panel), while in the case of c-IAP1 the protein downregulation was stimulated in response to Dex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>, right panels). These results indicate that only cIAP1 levels correlate with the protection conferred by Dex and with NF-&#x003ba;B activation.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>The dominant negative I&#x003ba;B mutant protein stimulates the dexamethasone induced downregulation of IAPs: </bold>MCF-7 parental cells and Clone 1 of the dnI&#x003ba;B expressing cells were treated for 20 min with TNF-&#x003b1; (10 ng ml<sup>-1</sup>) alone (A and C) or in combination with Dex (10 &#x003bc;M) (B and D): Protein expression of XIAP (A and B) or c-IAP (C and D) at different times was determined by Western blot: Actin was used as loading control.

In MCF-7 cells Dex is able to prevent the cytotoxic effect of TNF-&#x003b1;, and the anti-apoptotic proteins IAP1, IAP2 and XIAP have been postulated as effector molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, and despite extensive studies, the molecular mechanisms of this protection are just beginning to be described. On this respect, the role played by anti-apoptotic routes others than the one regulated by IAP proteins in the Dex protection from TNF-&#x003b1; cytotoxicity has not been analyzed. Also, TNF-&#x003b1; stimulation does not only activate cell death pathways, but survival ones too. In consequence, it can be assumed that the balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic regulators defines the apoptotic threshold of a cell. The anti-apoptotic effect of TNF-&#x003b1; requires the activation of PI3K and NF-&#x003ba;B and, as active participants of survival routes, these proteins could participate in the Dex protection against TNF-&#x003b1; cytotoxicity. Thus, we analyzed their participation in Dex mediated-protection against TNF-&#x003b1; cytotoxicity.</p><p>It has been suggested that the scarcity of breast tumor derived cell lines has led to the apparition of several sub-lines, evidenced by different results obtained for the evaluation of related phenomena [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], including their susceptibility to TNF-&#x003b1; induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>This led us to corroborate the ability of TNF-&#x003b1; to induce cell death and to evaluate the protection mediated by Dex in our cell system. As previously reported, TNF-&#x003b1; treatment induced cell death in a dose and time dependent fashion and co-incubation with Dex protected MCF-7 cells against TNF-&#x003b1;-induced cell death.</p><p>We have found that in MCF7 and ZR-70-35 human mammary tumor cells the protective effect of Dex was compromised in the presence of 2.5 &#x003bc;M of Bay-117082, a pharmacological inhibitor of NF-&#x003ba;B activation (data not shown). This result correlates with those observed in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>, where protection is lost in cells expressing the dominant negative form of IkB&#x003b1;, thus providing further support to the notion that Dex protection requires NF-&#x003ba;B activation. Furthermore, the use of the inhibitor of NF-&#x003ba;B lead to a marked decrease in c-IAP1 cellular content in ZR-70-35 cells (data not shown). While c-IAP1 could not be detected in TNF-&#x003b1;-treated cells, in the presence of TNF-&#x003b1; + Dex c-IAP1 content returned to control levels. This behavior reproduced the results presented in figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>, and documents the correlation between Dex protection and c-IAP1 cellular content.</p><p>In our system the Akt phosphorylation level was not affected by Dex treatment in the presence or absence of TNF-&#x003b1;. Besides, transfection of a dominant negative mutant of PI3K (&#x00394;P85) in MCF-7 cells did not affect Dex protection, suggesting that the PI3K/Akt pathway is not involved in Dex protection against TNF-&#x003b1;. NF-&#x003ba;B activation through PI3K/Akt has been a controversial issue due to cell type variations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Although in some cells Akt acts upstream of NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], we found that NF-&#x003ba;B activation is completely independent of Akt function.</p><p>In our cell system Dex did not modify the NF-&#x003ba;B activation in the presence or absence of TNF-&#x003b1;. However, a non-degradable I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; mutant protein (dnI&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;), which prevents NF-&#x003ba;B nuclear translocation; completely blocked Dex protection against TNF-&#x003b1; induced cell death. In the absence of Dex, dnI&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; expression increased the susceptibility to TNF-&#x003b1;-induced death. These results suggest that the TNF-&#x003b1;-dependent NF-&#x003ba;B activation participates in the protection conferred by Dex. Furthermore, in dnIkB&#x003b1; transfectant MCF-7 cells, the susceptibility to TNF-&#x003b1; cytotoxicity correlated with the level of expression of the I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; mutant form, suggesting a threshold for the protective action of NF-&#x003ba;B activation.</p><p>NF-&#x003ba;B regulates the expression of a great number of genes, including several antiapoptotic gene products such as members of the Bcl-2 family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins XIAP, c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Interestingly, NF-&#x003ba;B regulates XIAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and cIAP1 promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Thus, we analyzed the effects of interfering with NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway during Dex protection on XIAP and c-IAP1 protein content. We detected that, as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], TNF-&#x003b1;-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells correlated with downregulation of XIAP and c-IAP1 proteins, postulated as effectors of the protective effect against TNF-&#x003b1;-mediated cytotoxicity. However, only the expression level of c-IAP1 correlated with the protective effect of Dex: In cells expressing dnI&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; stimulated with TNF-&#x003b1; (i) the protein level of this antiapoptotic factor was lower than in parental cells and correlated with an increased cell death and, (ii) in parental MCF-7 cells Dex treatment correlated with a slower rate of decrease of the anti-apoptotic factors content.</p><p>While estrogen dependence in mammary tumor cells is being extensively studied due to its clinical importance, the dependency on GC has received less attention. The protection conferred by Dex against TNF-mediated cytotoxicity has been extensively analyzed in MCF-7 cells and, interestingly, this synthetic GC has also been reported to confer protection against pharmacological mediators of cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In contrast, GCs have been reported to interfere with proliferation in MCF7, ZR-75-1, Con-8 and MDA-MB-231 mammary tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. At present, GC therapy is not included in patients with mammary tumors, although no comparative study has been performed to discard its efficacy. Whether or not the antiproliferative effect of natural or synthetic GCs is related to the protection against TNF-mediated cytotoxicity remains to be determined.</p><p>Also, IAPs belong to a diverse group of proteins which modulate the apoptotic pathways by binding to caspases and inhibiting their proteolitic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In addition to this well characterized anti-apoptotic effect, some IAP isoforms have been reported to interfere with apoptosis through caspase-inhibition independent mechanisms. Expression of IAPs in MCF-7 cells in response to Dex has been previously described and is suggestive of the anti-apoptotic protection against TNF-mediated cytotoxicity. Nevertheless, the contribution of IAP expression to this protective effect remains to be shown by specific interference with IAPs expression, possibly through iRNA technology. Without this kind of experiments, it is difficult to establish the relative contribution of IAP expression to the protective effect of Dex.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We conclude that the protective effect of Dex is dependent on TNF-&#x003b1;-mediated activation of NF-&#x003ba;B, and it seems likely that the NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent gene expression of antiapoptotic proteins is strenghtened by Dex treatment, probably through the GC receptor. This protection appears to be independent of the PI3K pathway. Moreover, GC-receptor activation through Dex has been reported to induce the expression of different anti-apoptotic gene products, including c-IAP1 and XIAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], serum and GC-inducible protein kinase one (SGK-1), and mitogen activated protein kinase phosphatase one (MKP-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. On this respect, we found the existence of a suggestive correlation between susceptibility against TNF-&#x003b1;-induced cell death and the diminished c-IAP expression in the absence of NF-&#x003ba;B translocation. Although the interaction among glucocorticoids and cytokines is often cell type specific and depends on the physiologic context of the cell, our data point towards the NF-&#x003ba;B system as a potential therapeutic target in the combat against some hormone-dependent forms of mammary cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Dexamethasone and human recombinant TNF-&#x003b1; were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA) and R&#x00026;D Systems, Inc (Minneapolis, MN, USA), respectively.
