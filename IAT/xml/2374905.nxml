In this report, we show that the nuclear lamina can also play a role in the downregulation of heterochromatin and in gene activation. Herpes simplex virus DNA initiates replication in replication compartments near the inner edge of the nucleus, and histones are excluded from these structures. To define the role of nuclear lamins in HSV replication, we examined HSV infection in wild-type and A-type lamin&#x02013;deficient (<italic>Lmna</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). In <italic>Lmna</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells, viral replication compartments are reduced in size and fail to target to the nuclear periphery, as observed in WT cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies demonstrate that HSV DNA is associated with increased heterochromatin in <italic>Lmna</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs. These results argue for a functional role for A-type lamins as viral gene expression, DNA replication, and growth are reduced in <italic>Lmna</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs, with the greatest effect on viral replication at low multiplicity of infection. Thus, lamin A/C is required for targeting of the viral genome and the reduction of heterochromatin on viral promoters during lytic infection. The nuclear lamina can serve as a molecular scaffold for DNA genomes and the protein complexes that regulate both euchromatin and heterochromatin histone modifications.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Transcription of eukaryotic genes is regulated by sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins that bind to the DNA as well as the structure of the chromatin associated with the specific gene. Posttranslational modification of histones plays a major role in the higher order structure of the chromatin and whether it serves as heterochromatin or inactive chromatin versus euchromatin or active chromatin. The nuclear lamina has been shown to promote the maintenance of heterochromatin in mammalian cells, but little is known about where heterochromatin is modulated. In this study, we find that the A-type lamins are required for the targeting of herpes simplex virus genomic DNA to the periphery of the infected cell nucleus and for the prevention or reduction of heterochromatin on the viral genome and transcriptional silencing of the viral genome. This raises the broader function of the nuclear lamina in the regulation of both euchromatin and heterochromatin. We propose that the nuclear lamina is a platform for the organization of chromatin remodeling and histone modification enzymes that regulate both euchromatin and heterochromatin.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Herpes simplex virus (HSV) undergoes productive infection through transcription and replication of its viral genome within the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000071-Roizman1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus, it is believed that the nuclear lamina is the site of heterochromatin maintenance. However, little is known about the sites or structures involved in modulation of heterochromatin. In this study we find that the A-type lamins are required for targeting of herpes simplex virus genomic complexes to the periphery of the infected cell nucleus and for preventing or reducing heterochromatin on the viral immediate-early lytic gene promoters. This raises the potential of a broader role for the nuclear lamina in the regulation of both euchromatin and heterochromatin. We propose that the nuclear lamina is a platform for the organization of chromatin remodeling and histone modification enzymes that regulate both euchromatin and heterochromatin. In HSV-infected cells, viral regulatory proteins shift the activity of these chromatin regulatory complexes to prevent assembly of or reduce heterochromatin on the viral genome so that optimal viral gene transcription can occur.</p><p>During lytic infection, only limited amounts of nucleosomes are associated with viral DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000071-Leinbach1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000071-Lentine1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus, the viral and cellular proteins involved in tethering HSV DNA on the nuclear periphery remain to be defined. Also, the stage in viral replication at which the HSV genome associates with the nuclear lamina or nuclear periphery is not known. Association of the viral genome with the nuclear lamina could occur at the time of IE gene transcription, E gene transcription or initiation of viral DNA replication, although our data and those of others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000071-Everett1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> argue that this may occur at or before IE gene transcription.</p><p>Replication of the genomes of RNA viruses in the cytoplasm has also been proposed to occur on a surface but in that case on membranes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000071-Peery1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>).

Defects in replication compartment formation and heterochromatin association with replication compartments were observed under both conditions; thus, we believe that A-type lamins exert similar effects on viral replication at low and high MOI. At high MOI, however, the virus can circumvent the heterochromatin block. It is conceivable that at high MOI the large number of input viral genomes titrates out the finite amount of histones in the infected cell and the genomes are transcribed. Alternatively, at high MOI, the increased numbers of viral genomes eventually encounter histone-modification enzymes by less efficient means than in the assemblies located on the nuclear lamina.

Although these results may seem to be inconsistent, we propose that lamin A can serve as a platform for the organization of enzyme complexes that, under the appropriate conditions, can lead to heterochromatin or euchromatin formation on DNA sequences associated with the lamina. We further hypothesize that during HSV lytic infection viral gene products act to shift the balance towards euchromatin through the assembly of chromatin and enzyme complexes on viral lytic genes associated with the nuclear lamina that lead to euchromatic modifications of histones.

Further studies should determine the precise mechanism by which the nuclear lamins are exploited by HSV to keep its genome transcriptionally active during productive infection. These studies should provide the basis for mechanisms operative on cellular chromatin as well.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cells and virus</title><p>Immortalized <italic>Lmna</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and litter-matched <italic>Lmna</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> control MEFs were provided by Brian Kennedy, University of Washington <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000071-Sullivan1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.
