However, the effects of genomic DNA hypomethylation on mutation rates are still elusive. We have developed a model system to analyze the effects of DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) deficiency on DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. We generated sibling ES cell clones with and without functional <italic>Dnmt1</italic> expression, containing a stable reporter gene that allowed us to measure the slippage rate at a mononucleotide repeat. We found that Dnmt1 deficiency led to a 7-fold increase in the microsatellite slippage rate. Interestingly, the region flanking the mononucleotide repeat was unmethylated regardless of Dnmt1 status, suggesting that it is not the local levels of DNA methylation that direct the increase in microsatellite instability (MSI). The enhanced MSI was associated with higher levels of histone H3 acetylation and lower MeCP2 binding at regions near the assayed microsatellite, suggesting that Dnmt1 loss may decrease MMR efficiency by modifying chromatin structure.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Establishment and maintenance of proper DNA methylation are important in mammalian development and genomic stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c1">1</xref>). Global DNA hypomethylation is frequently observed in tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c3">3</xref>). DNA hypomethylation can induce B- and T-cell lymphomas and sarcomas in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c6">6</xref>). However, the effects of genomic DNA hypomethylation on mutation rates are still elusive. Disruption of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> (DNA methyltransferase 1) in mouse ES (embryonic stem) cells led to changes in mutation rates with conflicting results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c8">8</xref>). Hypomethylation can induce chromosomal instability such as chromosomal loss, rearrangement, and duplication at endogenous loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c7">7</xref>). On the other hand, Dnmt1 deficiency and the accompanying genomic DNA hypomethylation can suppress gene loss and gene mutation of exogenously introduced transgenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c8">8</xref>).</p><p>Mismatch repair (MMR) is a genome-surveillance system that maintains the genomic integrity of mammalian organisms. The proteins encoded by MMR genes recognize mismatched nucleotides that arise during DNA replication, homologous recombination, or other forms of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c10">10</xref>). Impaired MMR can give rise to malignancies exhibiting microsatellite instability (MSI), which manifests itself as alterations in the length of simple, repetitive DNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c11">11</xref>). Several lines of evidence suggest an association between DNA methylation and MMR. The properties of the methyl binding protein MBD4 provide the strongest link thus far between these two processes. MBD4 has a methyl binding domain as well as G&#x0002f;T and G&#x0002f;U glycosylase repair activities and interacts with the MMR protein MLH1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c13">13</xref>). Both DNMT1 and MLH1 have a binding site for PCNA (Proliferating cell nuclear antigen), a processivity factor that is involved in DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c16">16</xref>). Both proteins are active in S phase. Human <italic>MLH1</italic> is often silenced by the promoter CpG island hypermethylation in about 15&#x02013;20% of colorectal cancer that exhibits MSI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c17">17</xref>). We showed that the reduction of Dnmt1 activity modifies tumor formation in MMR-deficient <italic>Mlh1<sup>&#x02212;&#x0002f;&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c4">4</xref>). <italic>Dam</italic> methylation plays an important role in MMR strand discrimination in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and is mediated by MutH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c18">18</xref>). However, CpG methylation is not thought to be the strand discrimination signal in mammalian cells, but utilization of strand discontinuities such as nicks may be the signal for MMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c19">19</xref>). Furthermore, no MutH homolog has been identified in eukaryotes.</p><p>Guo <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c20">20</xref>) recently reported that Dnmt1-deficient ES cells showed MSI. This report appeared as we were preparing our work for publication. Remarkably, using different approaches and initial goals, both studies arrived at the same conclusion: Dnmt1 deficiency leads to reduced MMR efficiency. In the present study, we measured the slippage rate at a mononucleotide repeat tract in Dnmt1-deficient ES cells. In addition, we extended the findings of Guo <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c20">20</xref>) by investigating potential mechanisms of enhanced slippage in Dnmt1-deficient ES cells. Our results indicate that Dnmt1 deficiency does not increase MSI through local changes in DNA methylation levels. This suggests that efficient MMR in mammals may involve participation by the Dnmt1 protein itself, either directly, or indirectly through modification of chromatin structure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>The puromycin marker and the hygromycin marker-containing <italic>Dnmt1</italic>-targeting vectors, pMC-PURO and pMC-HYG, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c4">4</xref>), were used for <italic>Dnmt1</italic> gene targeting. The slippage construct pZCTN25A was constructed as follows. A zeocin selectable cassette from pZeoSVLacZ (Invitrogen) was ligated into the 3&#x02032; end of the artificially constructed in-frame triple fusion gene, bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT [from pCAT (Promega)]), herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV&#x02013;TK), and neomycin phosphotransferase II (Neo) [from pPGKTKNeo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c8">8</xref>)]. A 25 adenine (25A) mononucleotide repeat was inserted into the MluI site at the 5&#x02032; end of TK, resulting in an out-of-frame TKNeo.</p></sec><sec><title>ES cell culture and transfection</title><p>Mouse ES cells were maintained in HEPES-buffered (20 mM, pH 7.3) DMEM (USC tissue culture core facility) supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum (Hyclone Labs), 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), 0.1 mM &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), and penicillin&#x02013;streptomycin (Irvine Scientific). ES cells were grown on feeder layers of gamma-irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblast cells and supplemented with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF; Chemicon) at 10<sup>6</sup> U&#x0002f;ml to prevent ES cell differentiation.

For fluctuation analysis, one of the parallel vials of cells was thawed, and 6 parallel cultures of 1000 cells per well in a six-well plate were plated onto feeders in normal medium without selection for the expansion phase of the fluctuation analysis. Counting the day of plating as day 0, medium was changed every 2 days. On day 10, the cells were trypsinized, and the number of live and dead cells was determined with a hemacytometer. For G418 selection, all of the trypsinized cells were transferred to a new six-well plate without selection. On the following day, each parallel culture was replaced with 250 &#x003bc;g&#x0002f;ml of G418-containing ES media. G418 concentration was raised to 500 &#x003bc;g&#x0002f;ml after 2 days of initial selection and maintained for the rest of selection phase. The number of colonies on the selection plates was determined by a systematic microscopic scan at a 100&#x000d7; magnification and the counting was performed on the same day for the different genotypes. About 1&#x02013;2 colonies per well were picked for DNA analysis and the rest of the clones were stained with methylene blue.

The slippage construct consists of three open reading frames (ORF) (CAT, HSV&#x02013;TK and Neo) fused together in-frame. <italic>Tk</italic> and <italic>Neo</italic> were used in a double selection scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c30">30</xref>). A 25A mononucleotide repeat was inserted 5&#x02032; of the <italic>TK</italic> ORF, bringing both the <italic>TK</italic> and <italic>Neo</italic> coding sequences out of frame. This slippage construct allows for the direct elimination of any initial in-frame mutants by FIAU counterselection and the enrichment of reversion mutants by G418 selection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh912f1">1</xref>).</p><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh912f2">2</xref> shows a pedigree of cell lines used in this study along with a Southern blot analysis of the <italic>Dnmt1</italic> locus. First, one <italic>Dnmt1</italic> allele was disrupted in wild-type J1 cells (7 kb of KpnI fragment) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c31">31</xref>) using a puromycin-resistant insertion-type targeting vector (P). The resulting heterozygous <italic>Dnmt1<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002f;P</sup></italic> BA cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c8">8</xref>) contains a wild-type allele (7 kb) as well as a mutant <italic>P</italic> allele (22 kb). Second, the slippage construct was randomly integrated into BA cells giving rise to a <italic>Dnmt1<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002f;P</sup></italic> DKB6 cell line. A single-copy integration of this slippage construct was verified by Southern blot analysis using a 1 kb SmaI fragment containing the Zeocin gene as a probe (data not shown). Since this slippage construct was integrated before the second round of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> allele targeting, any potential positional effects would be similar in the sister cell lines, allowing us to accurately compare the MSI rate. Third, the second <italic>Dnmt1</italic> allele was disrupted in DKB6 cells using a hygromycin-resistant insertion-type targeting vector (H). The resulting sibling ES clones were either <italic>Dnmt1<sup>P&#x0002f;H</sup></italic> (DLC1, DLC4) or <italic>Dnmt1<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002f;PH</sup></italic> (DLC2, DLC3), depending on whether the hygromycin vector had recombined at the wild-type allele or at the previously targeted puromycin allele. Southern blot analysis was performed to verify targeting events as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh912f2">2</xref>B. The <italic>H</italic> allele could be identified by the 21 kb KpnI fragment whereas the <italic>PH</italic> allele generated a 36 kb KpnI fragment.

The <italic>P</italic>, <italic>H</italic>, and <italic>PH</italic> alleles were generated by the disruption of a ClaI site in <italic>Dnmt1</italic> that leads to protein truncation. The RT&#x02013;PCR primers were designed to span the wild-type sequence at this ClaI site, which allowed us to specifically detect expression from the wild-type endogenous <italic>Dnmt1</italic> sequence in the knockout cell lines. <italic>Dnmt1</italic> mRNA levels were greatly reduced in the homozygous knockout cell lines (<italic>Dnmt1<sup>P&#x0002f;H</sup></italic>), whereas the heterozygous cell lines (<italic>Dnmt1<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002f;PH</sup></italic>) gave approximately half the expression levels seen in the wild-type cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh912f3">3</xref>A). This decrease of Dnmt1 mRNA was also associated with a concomitant decrease of methylation at the minor satellite centromeric repeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c26">26</xref>), which suggests a drastic reduction in global methylation content (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh912f3">3</xref>B).</p><p>To quantitate the effects of Dnmt1 deficiency on DNA slippage rates, we performed Luria&#x02013;Delbr&#x000fc;ck fluctuation analyses using the method of means equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c23">23</xref>).

We performed six independent fluctuation analyses of sibling pairs, with each analysis consisting of six parallel expansions.

The average reversion rate in <italic>Dnmt1<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002f;PH</sup></italic> cells was 4.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>, whereas the reversion rate was 2.9 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> in <italic>Dnmt1<sup>P&#x0002f;H</sup></italic> cells. Thus, the MSI rate was consistently higher in Dnmt1-deficient cells as compared to Dnmt1-proficient cells by an average of 6.8-fold (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh912f4">4</xref>B). This difference was statistically significant (two-tailed <italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.0152) by a Mann&#x02013;Whitney test.</p><p>To examine whether the G418 reversion mutants were generated by expansion or contraction of the mononucleotide tract, we used PCR to amplify a 204 bp fragment of <italic>TK</italic> gene using flanking primers as depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh912f1">1</xref>. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh912f4">4</xref>C shows an example of seven G418 reversion mutants isolated from a Luria&#x02013;Delbr&#x000fc;ck fluctuation experiment. When amplified PCR products were resolved on an acrylamide gel, 6 out of 7 mutant PCR products showed size reductions as compared to pre-expansion controls, indicating that the mononucleotide repeat had undergone contraction. Slippage was not detected in the R1 mutant, suggesting the possibility of a mutational event occurring outside of the PCR amplified region or the limitation of the assay to detect small deletions.</p><p>To exclude the possibility that the observed increase in G418 resistant colonies was due to the differences in the growth rate, we investigated whether there was indeed a difference in growth rate between <italic>Dnmt1<sup>P&#x0002f;H</sup></italic> and <italic>Dnmt1<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002f;PH</sup></italic> ES cells with and without G418 selection and found no apparent difference (data not shown).</p><p>The enhanced slippage rate of Dnmt1-deficient cells suggested that MSI could be elevated by local DNA hypomethylation. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the methylation status of 37 CpGs in <italic>TKNeo</italic> DNA sequences flanking the mononucleotide repeat by bisulfite genomic sequencing. A 364 bp fragment containing the repeat was amplified using bisulfite converted DNA of Dnmt1-deficient and proficient cells as a template, and then 10 clones from each of these cell lines were sequenced (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh912f5">5</xref>). Surprisingly, this region was generally unmethylated in both Dnmt1 homozygous and heterozygous knockout cells with the exception of sporadically methylated CpGs in <italic>Dnmt1<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002f;PH</sup></italic> ES cells.</p><p>Since the body of the slippage construct was unmethylated in both Dnmt1-deficient and proficient cells, we speculated that the MSI observed in Dnmt1-deficient ES cells was not caused by local hypomethylation, but was more likely to be the result of a more global effect of Dnmt1 deficiency. Dnmt1 has been reported to associate with histone remodeling proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c34">34</xref>). Thus, a lack of Dnmt1 could perhaps lead to a permissive chromatin complex in which mismatched DNA is corrected at a lower efficiency. To investigate this possibility, we performed ChIP analyses of the slippage construct with antibodies against MeCP2 and acetylated H3-K9&#x0002f;14 in <italic>Dnmt1<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002f;PH</sup></italic> and <italic>Dnmt1<sup>P&#x0002f;H</sup></italic> cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh912f6">6</xref>). MeCP2, known to directly bind to Dnmt1 as well as methylated CpGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c35">35</xref>), is a marker of closed chromatin that is not actively transcribed and alternatively, histone acetylation is correlated with active transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c38">38</xref>). After chromatin immunoprecipitation, the quantitation of immunoprecipitated DNA was determined by real-time fluorescence-based PCR using primers located in the TK locus, downstream from the mononucleotide repeat as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh912f6">6</xref>. No detectable MeCP2 recruitment was observed in <italic>Dnmt1<sup>P&#x0002f;H</sup></italic> cells. We found reduced MeCP2 occupancy in general at the <italic>TK</italic> locus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh912f4">4</xref>), which is in agreement with the observed lack of DNA methylation in the region surrounding the mononucleotide repeat (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh912f5">5</xref>). We also observed higher levels of H3-K9&#x0002f;14 acetylation in <italic>Dnmt1<sup>P&#x0002f;H</sup></italic> cells as compared to <italic>Dnmt1<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002f;PH</sup></italic> cells. In addition, the <italic>Neo</italic> locus downstream of <italic>TK</italic> showed a similar trend of decreased MeCP2 recruitment and increased histone H3 acetylation in <italic>Dnmt1<sup>P&#x0002f;H</sup></italic> cells (data not shown). This observation was found consistently in three independent ChIP experiments. We conclude that Dnmt1 deficiency may be associated with chromatin alterations. A further investigation is needed to address whether the chromatin alterations form the basis for the observed increase in MSI.</p></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In the present study, we used mouse ES cells as a model system to study whether Dnmt1 affects MMR efficiency. Our results demonstrated that disrupting both copies of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> caused an elevated MSI. The slippage rate was approximately 7-fold higher in homozygous cells and was predominantly due to the contraction of the mononucleotide repeat. While this manuscript was in preparation, Guo <italic>et al</italic>. reported quite similar findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c20">20</xref>). In that study, <italic>Dnmt1</italic> was identified as a novel MMR gene in a genetic screen for MMR mutants in Bloom's syndrome protein (Blm)-deficient ES cells. When Guo <italic>et al</italic>. assayed slippage at a (CA)<sub>17</sub> dinucleotide repeat using a similar selection strategy to ours, they found a nearly 4-fold enhancement of MSI in homozygous Dnmt1 knockout cell line when compared with wild-type. Our findings are in agreement with those of Guo <italic>et al</italic>.</p><p>Although Guo <italic>et al</italic>. reported that Dnmt1 deficiency does not result in alterations in the expression of MMR genes, they did not further investigate how Dnmt1 loss influences local methylation or chromatin modification at the assayed microsatellite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c20">20</xref>). Luria&#x02013;Delbr&#x000fc;ck fluctuation results are dependent on cellular growth rates and thus a difference in growth could skew mutation rate estimations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c22">22</xref>). We investigated whether there was indeed a difference in growth rate between <italic>Dnmt1<sup>P&#x0002f;H</sup></italic> and <italic>Dnmt1<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002f;PH</sup></italic> ES cells with and without G418 selection and found no apparent difference (data not shown). This is consistent with previous reports that Dnmt1-deficient ES cells retain their normal phenotype and growth characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c31">31</xref>).</p><p>There would be two distinct models by which the enhanced rate of MSI in Dnmt1-deficient ES cells can be explained. One model is that local changes in methylation pattern can alter MMR efficiency, and the other model is that the Dnmt1 protein itself can participate in MMR either directly or indirectly. We observed that the region flanking the 25A repeat was generally unmethylated regardless of Dnmt1 status, which is inconsistent with the idea that local methylation patterns affect MMR efficiency. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that sequences outside the region assayed may be differentially methylated, affecting MMR efficiency from a distance. Drummond <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c19">19</xref>) have shown that MMR strand discrimination in artificially generated mismatched DNA does not require CpG methylation.</p><p>As an alternative explanation, we hypothesize that MMR could have been perturbed by the absence of Dnmt1. Aside from its methylating property, the Dnmt1 protein itself could directly participate in MMR. Interestingly, we observed that the disruption of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> was associated with the modification of local chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c34">34</xref>). Dnmt1 deficiency may be associated with the formation of distinct chromatin structures that alter the fidelity of DNA replication and repair, leading to different repair efficiency. It has been reported that DNMT1 is required to maintain proper nuclear architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c39">39</xref>). Thus, it is possible that the MMR machinery was affected by altered chromatin structure in the knockout cells. Our data is consistent with a previous study, which shows that histone H3 acetylation is increased in DNMT1-deficient human cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c39">39</xref>). MeCP2 can interact with Dnmt1 directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c35">35</xref>), not just by binding to methylated CpGs. Hence, Dnmt1 deficiency may have an impact on MeCP2 recruitment and its coupled chromatin modification, although the regional methylation differences between <italic>Dnmt1<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002f;PH</sup></italic> and <italic>Dnmt1<sup>P&#x0002f;H</sup></italic> cells seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh912f5">5</xref> were not obvious. Taken together, the participation of Dnmt1 protein in MMR either directly or indirectly through chromatin modification may be a mechanism by which the enhanced MSI in Dnmt1-deficient ES cells can be explained, although this needs to be addressed by further research.</p><p>DNA hypomethylation has been associated with genomic instability. DNA hypomethylation promotes tumorigenesis in some mouse models and is associated with the acquisition of additional chromosomal changes such as loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and chromosome 15 trisomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c6">6</xref>). We have demonstrated that <italic>Mlh1<sup>&#x02212;&#x0002f;&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice are more susceptible to T and B-cell lymphoma in the <italic>Dnmt1</italic> hypomorphic genetic background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c4">4</xref>). Consistent with this, human ICF (immunodeficiency, centromere instability and facial anomalies) syndrome caused by mutations in <italic>DNMT3b</italic> is characterized by genomic hypomethylation and genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c40">40</xref>). However, it is not clear whether the loss of genomic stability is a consequence of DNA methylation loss. We have shown that the rates of CpG mutagenesis and LOH are decreased in Dnmt1-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c8">8</xref>). Thus, the quantitative effects of DNA methylation on various mechanisms of genomic stability will require further investigation.</p><p>Although we found that Dnmt1 loss led to MSI in mouse ES cells, it is unlikely that this is a major mechanism by which MSI is induced in human cancers. Mutation of DNMT1 has not been demonstrated to be common in human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c41">41</xref>). Moreover, loss of Dnmt1 is lethal during embryonic development as well as in differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c42">42</xref>). The enhanced MSI reported in this study and by Guo <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c20">20</xref>) was not caused by the same mechanism of MSI seen in colorectal cancer, which is mainly due to the promoter CpG island hypermethylation of <italic>MLH1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c17">17</xref>). The global hypomethylation in Dnmt1-deficient cells is much more severe than that which has been commonly observed in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh912c43">43</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our study extends the current understanding of the relationship between DNA methylation and genomic stability to MMR. Our results suggest that Dnmt1 may be closely linked to MMR to maintain genomic integrity.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh912f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Schematic diagram of slippage assay (not drawn to scale).
