The important actin nucleators formins and the Arp2/3 complex are believed to have nonoverlapping functions in inducing actin filament bundles in filopodia and dendritic networks in lamellipodia, respectively. We tested this idea by investigating the role of mDia2 formin in leading-edge protrusion by loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches. Unexpectedly, mDia2 depletion by short interfering RNA (siRNA) severely inhibited lamellipodia. Structural analysis of the actin network in the few remaining lamellipodia suggested an mDia2 role in generation of long filaments. Consistently, constitutively active mDia2 (&#x00394;GBD-mDia2) induced accumulation of long actin filaments in lamellipodia and increased persistence of lamellipodial protrusion. Depletion of mDia2 also inhibited filopodia, whereas expression of &#x00394;GBD-mDia2 promoted their formation. Correlative light and electron microscopy showed that &#x00394;GBD-mDia2&#x02013;induced filopodia were formed from lamellipodial network through gradual convergence of long lamellipodial filaments into bundles. Efficient filopodia induction required mDia2 targeting to the membrane, likely through a scaffolding protein Abi1. Furthermore, mDia2 and Abi1 interacted through the N-terminal regulatory sequences of mDia2 and the SH3-containing Abi1 sequences. We propose that mDia2 plays an important role in formation of lamellipodia by nucleating and/or protecting from capping lamellipodial actin filaments, which subsequently exhibit high tendency to converge into filopodia.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Cell motility is a cyclic process, with the protrusion of the leading edge followed by retraction of the rear. Protrusion is driven by polymerization of actin filaments, with the spatial organization of these filaments determining the shape of the protrusions. For example, the spike-like filopodia contain bundles of long actin filaments, whereas the sheet-like lamellipodia contain branched actin networks. In biochemical assays, two stimulators of actin polymerization, Arp2/3 complex and formins, induce branched or individual filaments, respectively. In cells, Arp2/3 complex and formins also appear to be implicated in the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia, respectively. However, when we investigated the role of mDia2 formin by functional approaches, we unexpectedly found that it is essential, not only for filopodia, but also for lamellipodia. Moreover, functions of mDia2 in lamellipodia and filopodia appeared intimately linked. We recorded behavior of cells by light microscopy and then used electron microscopy to study actin architecture in the same cells. We found that an activated form of mDia2 was first recruited to lamellipodia, where it induced many long, unbranched filaments, and from there, drove formation of filopodia through gradual convergence of these lamellipodial filaments into bundles. These data demonstrate a strong relationship between structurally different actin filament arrays and molecular machineries involved in their formation.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Formin mDia2 was believed to function mainly in the generation of filopodia in migrating cells.

Actin filament polymerization provides a driving force for protrusion, whereas the shape and dynamics of protrusive organelles depend on the spatial organization of underlying filaments and activity of accessory molecules. Spatially restricted and temporally controlled actin filament nucleation is critical for generating membrane protrusions. Arp2/3 complex and formins are two major actin filament nucleators acting as convergent nodes of signaling pathways leading to initiation of actin-based motility (reviewed in&#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;.

Unexpectedly, we found that mDia2 was implicated in lamellipodia formation, suggesting that the Arp2/3 complex, despite being essential, was not sufficient for this function. Furthermore, the constitutively active mDia2 mutant efficiently induced filopodia, but these filopodia were formed, not from a focal spot away from lamellipodia, but by the gradual reorganization of lamellipodial filaments converging into filopodial bundles. We also found that specific targeting to the membrane was essential for mDia2 functions in protrusion. The targeting required a multifunctional scaffolding protein Abi1, which also participates in other actin-remodeling events, including regulation of Arp2/3-dependent nucleation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;.

Projection of the life history onto EM image revealed that filaments converged in parallel with condensation of GFP fluorescence (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g008">Figure 8</xref> legend for detail), similar to normal filopodia &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The second example (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g008">Figure 8</xref>F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g008">8</xref>G) shows a slightly older filopodium formed from a line of GFP fluorescence visible in the first frame of the movie. By approximately 50&#x02013;60 s before fixation, the line gradually condensed into a dot, suggesting that the filopodial bundle was formed by that time. Subsequently, the dot moved approximately 1 &#x003bc;m as the filopodium protruded. In the corresponding EM image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g008">Figure 8</xref>I and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g008">8</xref>J), the filopodium contained a spindle-shaped actin bundle that tapered both toward the front (perhaps because of tighter filament bundling) and toward the rear due to gradual termination of filaments. The projection of the fluorescence history of this filopodium onto the EM image showed a sparse actin network proximally from the position of the leading edge at time 0:00 (yellow line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g008">Figure 8</xref>I).

As we showed above (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g005">Figure 5</xref>), the linear distribution of &#x00394;GBD-mDia2, as it appears at the 0:00 time point for this filopodium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g008">Figure 8</xref>F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g008">8</xref>I), always associates with dense lamellipodial network of long, aligned filaments. Thus, the tapered shape of the filopodium root among sparse actin network is more consistent with the alternative possibility that actin depolymerization eliminated much actin from the filopodium rear in parallel with the filopodium protrusion at the front.</p><p>Correlative analysis of six cells imaged live for 90&#x02013;120 s showed that all nascent filopodia (31 total) emerged by condensation of linear lamellipodial fluorescence.

However, FH1FH2-mDia2 was not sufficient to fully restore formin's functions in mDia2-interferred cells and to efficiently induce filopodia, likely reflecting inferior membrane targeting of FH1FH2-mDia2 as compared to &#x00394;GBD-mDia2 or full-length mDia2. In the second mechanism, binding of N-terminal regulatory sequences of mDia2 to Abi1 provides a potential additional surface for mDia2 proper localization to leading edges. This is also consistent with the observation that similar regions were previously shown to control targeting of other formins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. It is also possible that Abi1 not only recruits mDia2 to the membrane, but also participates in its regulation, but we currently do not have data to evaluate this idea.</p><p>The majority of Abi1 has been shown to be engaged in complex with WAVE, Nap1, and PIR121 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;. However, we did not detect interaction of mDia2 with WAVE, Nap1, or PIR121, indicating that mDia2 and Abi1 may form a distinct macromolecular signaling unit with respect to the WANP complex. Accordingly, only a minor fraction of Abi1 interacted with mDia2 in coimmunoprecipitation experiments. The ability of Abi1 to act as a scaffolding molecule driving the formation of additional signaling units, such as those containing N-WASP &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d; or Eps8 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d;, has been previously observed. The Abi1-mDia2 assembly adds to the versatility of Abi1, which by entering distinct complexes is capable of controlling diverse processes and/or coordinating related activities, such as the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia protrusions reported here. The precise regulatory events governing the relationship between these units remain to be defined and represent one of the challenges for future investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Lamellipodia Protrusion</title><p>Specific targeting of proteins is a common way to confine the protein activity to a certain area. Therefore, mDia2 targeting to lamellipodia and filopodia points to an idea that mDia2 may function there. Although mDia2&#x02032;s role in filopodia is expected &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;, the lamellipodial function contrasts with the current belief that formins and Arp2/3 complex are responsible for different actin structures. Two complementary sets of data in our study suggest that mDia2 is an important player in lamellipodial protrusion. First, mDia2 inhibition by siRNA severely impaired lamellipodia and reduced long filaments in the remaining lamellipodial network. Second, constitutively active &#x00394;GBD-mDia2, conversely, induced numerous long filaments in lamellipodia. Similar complementarity was observed regarding the persistence of lamellipodia protrusion, which decreased after mDia2 depletion and increased after expression of the constitutively active mutant. The lamellipodial function seems specific for mDia2; other formins, which were supposedly present in knockdown cells, were not sufficient. Moreover, overexpression of a related formin, mDia1, did not rescue lamellipodia formation. Interestingly, 3T3 cells lacking mDia2 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d; still make lamellipodia. We found, however, that 3T3 cells express another related formin, mDia3, which is absent in B16F1 cells (unpublished data), raising a possibility that mDia3 may be partially redundant with mDia2.</p><p>Biochemical activities of mDia2 suggest that it may contribute to lamellipodia formation through nucleation and/or anticapping protection of actin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g013">Figure 13</xref>A). Our &#x00394;GBD-mDia2 data are consistent with both possibilities. Thus, high frequency of linear filaments with unlinked &#x0201c;pointed&#x0201d; ends, and fast depolymerization of actin filaments from the rear (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g008">Figure 8</xref>) are consistent with formin, but not with Arp2/3-mediated nucleation. The anticapping activity of mDia2 is also employed during lamellipodia formation. Indeed, the dissociation of mDia2 from barbed ends is very slow, at least in vitro &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d;, suggesting that it would protect the nucleated filaments from capping for long time. In addition to this consideration, we found that (1) capping protein was diminished in &#x00394;GBD-mDia2&#x02013;rich lamellipodial regions; (2) &#x00394;GBD-mDia2 enrichment at the leading edge correlated with the presence of long actin filaments in EM images; and (3) mDia2-depleted lamellipodia contained very short branched filaments. The latter observation also suggests that mDia2 may protect from capping branched filaments, apparently nucleated by Arp2/3 complex. The ability of &#x00394;GBD-mDia2 to displace VASP from barbed ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g006">Figures 6</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050317-sg006">S6</xref>) is also consistent with this idea. Notably, long unbranched filaments may also form in the course of debranching of Arp2/3-nucleated and mDia2-protected filaments without nucleation by &#x00394;GBD-mDia2. Importantly, lamellipodial filaments nucleated and/or protected from capping by mDia2 may be responsible for the presence of long filaments &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d;, and two kinetically distinct actin subpopulations in lamellipodia &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d; noted earlier.</p><fig id="pbio-0050317-g013" position="float"><label>Figure 13</label><caption><title>Models for mDia2 Functions in Lamellipodia and Filopodia</title><p>(A) In lamellipodia, mDia2 is targeted to the membrane in an Abi1-dependent manner, where it may nucleate &#x0201c;mother&#x0201d; filaments, which serve as a base for Arp2/3-dependent nucleation, and/or protect from capping elongating barbed ends, which are nucleated by mDia2 itself or by Arp2/3 complex.

One possibility is that mDia2-nucleated filaments may help to initiate lamellipodia by nucleating &#x0201c;mother&#x0201d; filaments, which are required to Arp2/3-dependent nucleation. Additionally, mDia2 may be a better &#x0201c;device,&#x0201d; compared to VASP, for example, to maintain fast and processive barbed-end growth and thus to ensure persistent protrusion. Long filaments induced by mDia2 in lamellipodia may also provide better connection of lamellipodia to the rest of the cytoskeleton. In any case, our results suggest that two different actin nucleators, Arp2/3 complex and mDia2, jointly contribute to generation of lamellipodia.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Filopodia Protrusion</title><p>A role of mDia2 in filopodia formation in mammalian cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d; and of dDia2 in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> was reported &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;, but the mechanism of formin-mediated filopodia induction has not been fully investigated.

In this study, we provide evidence to solve this contradiction. By investigating the spatiokinetic mechanism underlying filopodia initiation by active mDia2, we found that, in our experimental system, lamellipodia are a highly preferred site for filopodia initiation, although subsequently, filopodia may lose association with lamellipodia, for example, by moving to the dorsal surface. However, we cannot exclude a possibility that in other experimental systems or conditions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b054">54</xref>&#x0005d;, formins may nucleate actin bundles from focal spots without association with lamellipodia or other dendritic arrays.</p><p>The overall process of filopodia initiation by mDia2 was very similar to that described for naturally emerging filopodia &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d; and involved gradual convergence of lamellipodial filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g013">Figure 13</xref>B). These results show that the convergent elongation mechanism is applicable to formin-induced filaments. Importantly, FL-mDia2 displayed similar convergence of lamellipodial fluorescence into dots, as &#x00394;GBD-mDia2, suggesting that convergence behavior is not entirely due to excessive activity of &#x00394;GBD-mDia2. Initiation of filopodia by &#x00394;GBD-mDia2 was very efficient, whereas the lamellipodia from which the filopodia arose were quite transient. This can be explained by the favorable combination of biochemical activities in mDia2, which may drive the efficient transformation of lamellipodia into filopodia, not only by nucleating and elongating filaments, but also by cross-linking them &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b055">55</xref>&#x0005d; and thus promoting the initiation of filament convergence. A downside of the excessive activity of &#x00394;GBD-mDia2 is that filopodia acquired an abnormal club-like shape, in which the majority of filaments did not extend all the way to the cell body. Based on the known mechanism of formin-mediated nucleation and our data obtained by correlative light microscopy and EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g008">Figure 8</xref>), and by observing GFP-actin dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g006">Figure 6</xref>), we interpret this phenotype as fast depolymerization of mDia2-nucleated filaments from unprotected pointed ends.</p><p>Because of formation of atypical club-like filopodia, we suppose that &#x00394;GBD-mDia2 does not fully recapitulate the physiological pathway of filopodia formation. Based on the structural data, we previously proposed that Arp2/3 complex nucleates filaments for filopodial bundles &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. We have confirmed this idea by a functional siRNA approach showing that Arp2/3 depletion inhibits filopodia (F. Korobova and T. Svitkina, unpublished data. These two sets of data together suggest that Arp2/3 complex and mDia2 may jointly contribute to filopodia formation. In such case, one would expect that the balanced activities of these two nucleators are important for the normal filopodial shape and functions, whereas any imbalance will likely lead to aberrant filopodia. Club-like filopodia induced by constitutive activation of mDia2 may serve as an illustration for this contention. Abnormal filopodia were also formed after depletion of mDia2. However, the relative roles of formins and Arp2/3 complex in filopodia await further investigation.</p><p>In summary, we have shown that mDia2 plays a role in formation of both lamellipodia and filopodia. However, these roles are not separate, but related to each other; mDia2 first participates in lamellipodia formation and then induces filopodia from lamellipodia. A most likely scenario is that mDia2-nucleated actin filaments and/or filaments nucleated by Arp2/3 complex and protected by mDia2 are initially dispersed in the lamellipodial network, and subsequently, they elongate persistently and gradually converge, eventually segregating themselves into filopodial bundles. Although regulation of actin dynamics is the most straightforward way to explain how mDia2 may function in protrusion, we cannot exclude a possibility that other mDia2 activities, such as regulation of microtubule dynamics &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b056">56</xref>&#x0005d;, membrane trafficking &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;, surface blebbing &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b057">57</xref>&#x0005d;, or transcription &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;, also contribute to generation of observed phenotypes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Reagents.</title><p><italic>Plasmids.</italic> Full length mDia2 in a Bluescript cloning vector (Stratagene) and pEFm-EGFP-&#x00394;GBD-mDia2 (amino acids &#x0005b;aa&#x0005d; 258&#x02013;1,171) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d; were gifts of A.
