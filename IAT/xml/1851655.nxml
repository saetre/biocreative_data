We have now identified a family of four homologous human <italic>Mex</italic>-3 genes, called <italic>hMex</italic>-3<italic>A</italic> to -3<italic>D</italic> that encode proteins containing two heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K homology (KH) domains and one carboxy-terminal RING finger module. The hMex-3 are phosphoproteins that bind RNA through their KH domains and shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm via the CRM1-dependent export pathway. Our analysis further revealed that hMex-3A and hMex-3B, but not hMex-3C, colocalize with both the hDcp1a decapping factor and Argonaute (Ago) proteins in processing bodies (P bodies), recently characterized as centers of mRNA turnover. Taken together, these findings indicate that hMex-3 proteins constitute a novel family of evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding proteins, differentially recruited to P bodies and potentially involved in post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cell polarization and asymmetric division are fundamental processes for generating cell diversity. Studies initially developed in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> have led to the identification of six genes, named <italic>par</italic> for partitioning defective, that are conserved across evolution and encode proteins that act as key effectors of cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). However, the mechanisms by which polarity information is connected to cell-fate specification remain elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). PAR molecules are known to regulate both the localization and the activity of several maternal factors which transduce polarity cues in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo and the protein Mex-3 is one of these regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p><p>Mex-3 contains two K homology (KH) domains, initially characterized in heterogeneous nuclear K ribonucleoproteins as a conserved region of 65&#x02013;70 amino acids which interacts with RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Mutations that disrupt the <italic>Mex</italic>-3 locus are embryonic lethal and cause defects in the AB anterior blastomere descendants which inappropriately produce body wall muscle, hence the name <italic>Mex</italic>-3 for <italic>muscle excess</italic> 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). The Mex-3 protein is distributed uniformly in oocytes but becomes asymmetrically enriched in the two anterior blastomeres at the four-cell stage. Furthermore, both Mex-3 mRNA and protein are components of the P granules in germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Previous reports have established that Mex-3 localization is complementary to that of PAL-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog of the Caudal homeoprotein in Drosophila. PAL-1 is expressed in posterior blastomeres but is abnormally present in all blastomeres at the four-cell stage in <italic>Mex</italic>-3 mutants. PAL-1 is required to specify the identity of the posterior blastomere and Mex-3 prevents translation of the <italic>PAL</italic>-1 mRNA in the anterior blastomeres presumably through its binding to the <italic>PAL</italic>-1 3&#x02032;UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). In addition, it has been suggested that Mex-3 controls the spatial repression of <italic>PAL</italic>-1 and relays polarity cues of PAR proteins through the specific interaction with two RNA-binding proteins, Mex-6 and Spn-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>Besides its role in the specification of posterior blastomeres, Mex-3 is also involved in the correct segregation of P granules at the eight-cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). P granules contain maternally contributed mRNAs and these structures are thought to be involved in the determination of the germline, thus suggesting a potential role of Mex-3 in the specification of this cell lineage. Consistent with this idea, disruption of <italic>mex</italic>-3 together with <italic>gld</italic>-1, a gene coding a member of the STAR/KH family of RNA-binding protein, results in the transdifferentiation of germ cells into somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>In the search for human homologs of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> cell-fate determinants, we have identified and characterized a family of four human gene homologs to <italic>Mex</italic>-3 (<italic>hMex</italic>-3) that map to distinct chromosomes. Here, we report that the hMex-3 proteins characterized are related RNA-binding phosphoproteins that shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and that they show differential localization to cytosolic foci recently identified as sites of mRNA storage, translation regulation and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Furthermore, the hMex-3 proteins display distinct modes of association with Ago molecules which are members of a large ribonucleoprotein complex involved in RNA interference (RNAi) and microRNA (miRNA) pathways. These results establish that hMex-3 proteins constitute a novel subfamily of evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding proteins potentially involved in the regulation of post-transcriptional events.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Bioinformatics</title><p>Existence of human and mouse <italic>Mex</italic>-3 gene homologs was determined by comparison of ceMex-3 protein sequence (Genbank accession number AAK73873) with human or mouse genome using Blast (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).

These genes, designated as <italic>hMex</italic>-3<italic>A</italic>, -3<italic>B</italic>, -3<italic>C</italic> and -3<italic>D</italic>, are located on distinct chromosomes at positions 1q22, 15q25.2, 18q21.1 and 19p13.3, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). The four <italic>hMex</italic>-3 genes are composed of two exons and one intron which vary in size from 836&#x02009;bp for <italic>hMex</italic>-3<italic>B</italic> to 18&#x02009;990&#x02009;bp for <italic>hMex</italic>-3<italic>C</italic>. The sequences containing the entire open reading frame were amplified from RNA by RT-PCR and fully sequenced (Genbank accession numbers: AY950677, AY950678, AY950679, AY950680) with the results confirming the <italic>in silico</italic> predictions. The 3&#x02032;-UTR of the <italic>hMex</italic>-3 genes was also predicted by GenScan and then confirmed after a Blast search of the <italic>hMex</italic>-3 genomic regions in a human EST library. A variant form of hMex-3D, called TINO, has been recently cloned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Compared to hMex-3D, TINO is truncated in its N-terminal region, beginning at the first KH domain. This form of hMex-3D also differed at its C-terminal end, with 19 amino acids, encoded by a potential alternative exon, replacing the four last terminal amino acids of hMex-3D.</p><p>Sequence alignment of the hMex-3 proteins with the <italic>C. elegans</italic> Mex-3 protein shows that all proteins contain two highly conserved KH domains presenting 79&#x02013;81% of sequence identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Database searches revealed a RING finger domain in the carboxy-terminal region of the four hMex-3 proteins. This RING finger is lacking in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> Mex-3 but was identified in the Ascidian ortholog pem-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) and was also predicted in the orthologous Drosophila sequence based on <italic>in silico</italic> comparisons (data not shown).</p><p>We have also identified four mouse Mex-3 (mMex-3) genes on chromosomes syntenic to the human chromosomes containing the <italic>hMex</italic>-3 genes (data not shown). The four putative mMex-3 proteins display a strong similarity to their human counterpart, being approximately 95% identical at the amino acid level. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the PhyML method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure. 1</xref>C) which suggests that a unique ancestral <italic>Mex</italic>-3 gene was duplicated after the time of divergence between urochordates and vertebrates.</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue-specific expression of the hMex-3 genes</title><p>To examine the expression pattern of the <italic>hMex</italic>-3 genes, RT-PCR analyses were performed on 8 human cell lines and 20 different human tissues with oligonucleotide specific to each <italic>hMex</italic>-3 transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). <italic>hMex</italic>-3<italic>D</italic> mRNA was found ubiquitously expressed in all the cell lines and tissues tested. The other three <italic>hMex</italic>-3 genes were expressed at varying levels in different tissues, with the highest expression being found in fetal brain and testis. <italic>hMex</italic>-3<italic>A</italic>, -3<italic>B</italic> and -3<italic>C</italic> genes were also expressed in thymus, salivary gland and uterus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). A weak expression of these three hMex-3 genes was also detected in the intestine. </p><p>In order to study the expression of hMex-3 proteins in human tissue, we have analyzed histologically normal colon mucosa and Meckel's diverticulum which gave a weak, but nevertheless reproducible signal in RT-PCR. Using a polyclonal antibody raised in the laboratory, hMex-3B expression was found to be restricted to a subpopulation of intestinal epithelial cells in the colon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B) and in the small intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C), whereas we failed to detect any expression in the lamina propria and the intestinal smooth muscles. The signal was specific for hMex-3B since pre-incubation of the antibody with the corresponding immunogenic peptide eliminated the labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). We noticed that hMex-3B was expressed in a peculiar repeated pattern reminiscent of the distribution of the epithelial cells belonging to the secretory lineage, whereas cells of the absorptive lineage remained unlabeled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B and C). Consistent with this observation, staining of serial sections with an anti-MUC2 antibody, which recognizes a specific marker of goblet cells, showed a distribution similar to that of hMex-3B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, staining with an anti-hMex3B antibody revealed no overlap between hMex-3B-containing cells and either enteroendocrine cells or Paneth cells (distinguished by staining for Chromogranin-A and lysozyme, respectively), thus confirming that the hMex-3B protein is specifically expressed in intestinal mucin-secreting cells. Using sections of mouse testis, we have also obtained evidence that hMex-3B protein is expressed in the epididymal epithelial cells (data not shown). Overall, these results are consistent with the mRNA expression profile and confirm that the endogenous hMex-3B protein is expressed.</p></sec><sec><title>hMex-3 proteins are RNA-binding proteins</title><p>During the course of this study, we cloned the RT-PCR amplified <italic>hMex</italic>-3<italic>A</italic>, -3<italic>B</italic> and -3<italic>C</italic> coding sequences into an eukaryotic expression vector. The three hMex-3 proteins were tagged N-terminally with the c-myc epitope and these constructs transfected into BOSC cells (derived from the human embryonic kidney epithelial cell line 293T). Two days post-transfection, cells were lysed and protein samples were analysed by western blot with an anti-myc monoclonal antibody. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, the myc-hMex-3 fusion proteins range between 60 and 90&#x02009;kDa. The anti-myc monoclonal antibody reacted with several bands from the different protein extracts originating from the transfected cells and these same bands were detected using specific polyclonal sera raised against hMex-3A or hMex-3B (data not shown). The observation of an electrophoretic mobility shift of the three hMex-3 proteins suggests that these proteins could be post-translationally modified. Treatment of protein lysates with &#x003bb;-phosphatase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B) followed by western blotting with the anti-myc antibody resulted in the disappearance of the higher molecular weight bands, thus indicating that the hMex-3 proteins are phosphorylated. To confirm that hMex-3A and hMex-3B are phosphoproteins, we performed an immunokinase assay. hMex-3A and hMex-3B were immunoprecipitated with the anti-myc monoclonal antibody and the resulting immunocomplexes were incubated in the presence of [&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). Autoradiography revealed that hMex-3A and hMex-3B, but not the control protein Bpag1, were phosphorylated under these conditions. </p><p>Next, we explored whether the hMex-3 proteins interact with RNA by measuring the ability of hMex-3A, -3B and -3C to bind agarose beads on which ribonucleotide polymers of poly(A) had been immobilized. hMex-3 proteins, <italic>in vitro</italic> translated in the presence of [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine, were incubated with the beads and the bound proteins eluted and detected by autoradiography. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D, hMex-3A, -3B and -3C are able to bind poly(A) <italic>in vitro</italic>. They most likely bind RNA via their KH domains because a specific mutation in the second KH domain prevents hMex-3B and hMex-3C binding, whereas mutations at conserved residues of the RING finger motif has no effect. Similar results were obtained with ribonucleotide poly(U) (data not shown).</p><p>To confirm that hMex-3 proteins interact with RNA <italic>in vivo</italic>, we used a protocol which relied on an immunopurification step followed by the identification of the RNA co-precipitated by RT-PCR. BOSC cells were transfected with vectors expressing hMex-3A, -3B, -3C as well as various mutants, and 48&#x02009;h post-transfection, cells were lysed and hMex-3 protein&#x02013;RNA complexes were immunoprecipitated with the anti-myc monoclonal antibody. As a positive control, the poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP) was similarly expressed in BOSC cells. The RNA recovered by immunoprecipitation was analysed by RT-PCR using primers specific for the genes coding for the transcription factor Cdx2, &#x003b2;2-microglobulin and the housekeeping enzyme GAPDH. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>E, those mRNAs were detected in hMex-3 and PABP immunoprecipitates, whereas no mRNA was purified with the myc-tagged p62 protein. Furthermore, these mRNAs were not found in association with the KH mutants, whereas no difference was observed with the RING finger mutant. Interpretation of immunoprecipitation analysis must be taken with caution since it is known that RNA-binding proteins may interact with mRNAs subsequent to cell lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), and additional experiments will sort out what the genuine hMex-3 mRNA targets are. However, the above experiments are consistent with the <italic>in vitro</italic> results and confirm that hMex-3 proteins interact with mRNAs via their KH domains.</p></sec><sec><title>Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of hMex-3 proteins</title><p>To examine the subcellular distribution of hMex-3 proteins, we transiently expressed hMex-3A, -3B and -3C into human breast cancer MCF7 cells and carried out indirect immunofluorescence analysis with the anti-myc tag antibody. Confocal microscopy analysis revealed that hMex-3 proteins are located in the cytoplasm and excluded from the nucleus. However, we noticed a clear, specific labeling pattern, with hMex-3A and -3B showing a punctuated staining whereas hMex-3C was distributed more homogenously throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). Strikingly, a mutation in the KH domain eliminated the spotted localization of hMex-3B, while a mutation in the RING finger domain did not modify the topology of the staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). Using our polyclonal antibodies directed against hMex-3A and -3B we observed an expression pattern similar to the one observed with the anti-myc antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A), thus further confirming the specificity of these anti-hMex-3 sera. However, we were unable to detect the endogenous hMex-3 proteins, probably due to their weak expression in MCF7 cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). </p><p>The hMex-3 proteins contain a potential NES consensus sequence in their N-terminal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). To determine whether hMex-3 proteins are nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins, we expressed them in MCF7 cells in the presence or absence of Leptomycin B (LMB), a specific inhibitor of the CRM1-mediated nuclear export of NES-containing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). As a positive control, we observed that upon LMB treatment, a protein containing the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fused to the NES of the protein Rev concentrated in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). LMB treatment of the cells expressing the hMex-3 proteins resulted in the massive accumulation of these proteins in the nucleus, thus indicating that they shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm through the CRM1 export pathway. To confirm these results, we introduced two point mutations at conserved residues within the NES sequence of hMex-3C and transiently expressed this mutant form of hMex-3C (hMex-3C/NES) into MCF7 cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, hMex-3C/NES was mainly detected in the nucleus, thus confirming that hMex-3 proteins are nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins dependent on the N-terminally located NES sequences of the hMex-3 proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>hMex-3A and hMex-3B proteins localize to Dcp-containing bodies</title><p>The recent demonstration that factors involved in mRNA degradation pathways are enriched in cytoplasmic granules, prompted us to study whether the hMex-3A and hMex-3B foci correspond to these structures. Granules known as processing bodies (P bodies) in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), and GW-182 bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) or Dcp-containing bodies in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) are the cellular sites of mRNA turnover (we will refer these structures as P bodies in the rest of the text).</p><p>The human mRNA decapping enzyme, hDcp1a, is concentrated in P bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). MCF7 cells were co-transfected with vectors expressing hMex-3B and a GFP-hDcp1a fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). Indirect immunofluorescence and confocal analyses revealed that hMex-3B colocalized with hDcp1 in cytoplasmic foci, although we repeatedly observed that some of the hMex-3B-containing granules were devoid of hDcp1. hMex-3A, but not hMex-3C, was also found in Dcp-containing granules (data not shown). As suggested by the results displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, the hMex-3B KH mutant was no longer localized in P bodies and this was not due to the disruption of the P bodies&#x02019; integrity, since the punctuate distribution of Dcp1a was not affected by the expression of the hMex-3B KH mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). </p><p>Cell treatment with a translational inhibitor, such as cycloheximide, is known to result in the disappearance of Dcp-containing-foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). MCF7 cells transiently expressing hMex-3B were treated with cycloheximide and stained by indirect immunofluorescence with an anti-myc tag antibody and anti-hDcp1a serum. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B, such treatment led to a near complete loss of P bodies and, concomitantly, to the alteration of the punctuate pattern of hMex-3B expression towards a more uniform cytoplasmic distribution. Consistent with these results, endogenous hMex-3B protein was found concentrated in cytoplasmic granules of duodenal goblet cells, which are morphologically similar to P bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). Overall, these data indicate that hMex-3A and hMex-3B, but not hMex-3C, should be considered as new components of P bodies.</p></sec><sec><title>Interaction of hMex-3 and Ago proteins</title><p>The human Argonautes (Ago) family comprises eight members, four of which (Ago1 to Ago4) constitute a subfamily of highly homologous proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Ago proteins are components of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and Ago2 is endowed with an endonuclease activity involved in the miRNA and siRNA-guided cleavage of target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Consistent with their function in RNA-silencing mechanisms, Ago1 and Ago2 proteins have been localized in P bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30 B31 B32">30&#x02013;32</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether hMex-3 proteins associate with Ago, BOSC cells were transiently transfected with constructs that encode Flag-tagged Ago1 or Ago2 together with vectors expressing hMex-3 proteins. hMex-3 proteins were immunoprecipitated with the anti-myc monoclonal antibody and the co-precipitated proteins were detected by western blot with an anti-Flag antibody. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A and B, Ago1 and Ago2 were co-precipitated with hMex-3A, -3B and -3C proteins as well as with KH and RING finger mutants but not with the myc-p62 control. The interaction between hMex-3A, -3B and Ago1, 2 proteins is most likely indirect and mediated by RNA because RNase treatment of cell lysates prevented co-precipitation of Ago1 or Ago2 by hMex-3 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A and B). In these conditions, the interactions between hMex-3 proteins and PABP were also completely disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A and B). Interestingly, the proteins Ago1 and Ago2 were efficiently co-precipitated by hMex-3C WT and hMex-3B bearing the KH mutation after RNAse treatment. These observations strongly suggest that the two proteins, hMex-3C WT and hMex-3B bearing the KH mutation, directly interact with Ago1 or Ago2 outside the P bodies. In contrast, hMex-3A and -3B WT localized inside the P bodies do not directly interact with Ago1 and Ago2. Accordingly, immunofluorescence analysis showed that hMex-3B and Ago1 colocalized in P bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C). </p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>hMex-3, a novel family of RNA-binding proteins</title><p>In this study, we have reported the characterization of the human homologs of the <italic>C. elegans Mex</italic>-3 gene. The four human genes (called <italic>hMex</italic>-3<italic>A</italic>, -3<italic>B</italic>, -3<italic>C</italic>, -3<italic>D</italic>) are located on distinct chromosomes and encode closely related proteins which contain two tandemly repeated KH domains. A carboxy-terminal RING finger domain, which is lacking in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> Mex-3, is present in an Ascidian ortholog of <italic>Mex</italic>-3, called <italic>pem</italic>-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), as well as in Drosophila ortholog (data not shown). RING fingers function as ubiquitin&#x02013;protein ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>), thus suggesting that hMex-3 proteins may mediate either self-ubiquitination or ubiquitination of target proteins and thus, regulate their stability and/or subcellular localization.</p><p>Using an RT-PCR approach, we showed that <italic>hMex</italic>-3<italic>D</italic> was ubiquitously expressed in human tissues whereas the other three <italic>hMex</italic>-3 genes showed a more heterogeneous expression with the highest levels being found in fetal brain and testis. At the protein level, using a polyclonal serum specific for hMex-3B, we detected this protein in the adult intestinal epithelium, specifically in goblet cells. These results raise the possibility that hMex-3B is either involved in the specification of intestinal progenitor in goblet cells or regulate their mucus &#x02018;secretory&#x02019; phenotype, an observation which warrants further investigation. The characterisation of the protein expression profile of the other three hMex-3 proteins awaits the development of high specificity antibodies but it is possible that they too are present in distinct intestinal epithelial cell types, and this situation might similarly apply to other organs. Alternatively, hMex-3 may be coexpressed in the same cell type and play nonredundant biological functions, as suggested by the distinct cellular localization of hMex-3C and its distinct interaction with Ago proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>hMex-3 are RNA-binding phosphoproteins that shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm</title><p>During this study, we found that hMex-3A, -3B and -3C are proteins which predominantly accumulate in the cytoplasm, and shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus via their NES motif and the CRM1/exportin 1 machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). We further obtained evidence that hMex-3 are phosphoproteins and several potential phosphorylation sites for known protein kinases are predicted on the hMex-3 protein sequences (data not shown). In agreement with these results, we have recently found that hMex-3B specifically interacts with 14-3-3 scaffold proteins in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (data not shown).</p><p>Consistent with the presence of the two KH domains, hMex-3A, -3B and -3C proteins interact <italic>in vitro</italic> with RNA homopolymers and with cellular mRNA. Introduction of a mutation, which results in the replacement of a conserved Gly by an Asp within the second KH domain, eliminates hMex-3 RNA binding. The same mutation was identified in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and found to disrupt the <italic>Mex</italic>-3 gene function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). These results indicate that hMex-3 proteins bind RNA through their KH domains, although we cannot formally exclude that the binding is indirect and mediated by a protein that recognizes RNA and interacts with the KH domains of hMex-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>).</p><p>Donnini and coworkers recently reported that TINO, which corresponds to a shorter form of hMex-3D (see the results section), binds to a sequence containing the AU-rich elements (AREs) of the <italic>BCL</italic>-2 transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). However, the target sequence of hMex-3D/TINO is not precisely defined yet and the recent resolution of the crystallographic structure of the third KH domain of hnRNP K suggests that the core sequence of the KH domain might be as short as a tetranucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). It is thus possible that each KH domain in the hMex-3 proteins interacts with distinct RNA sequences on the same transcript, or alternatively, that both KH domains may contribute to the high-affinity recognition of a single sequence on mRNA as previously exemplified for the Drosophila P-element somatic inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>hMex-3A and -3B are two novel components of P bodies</title><p>Analysis of the cellular distribution of hMex-3 proteins revealed that hMex-3A and -3B colocalize with both the decapping enzyme hDcp1a and Ago1 proteins in P bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). These structures contain factors involved in the 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; degradative pathway of eukaryotic mRNA, such as the hCcr4 deadenylase and the Xrn1 exonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Translation inhibition is known to block mRNA decay and to decrease drastically the number of foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). In agreement with this result, cycloheximide treatment similarly reduced the number of hMex-3 granules. Furthermore, mutation of the KH domain abrogated the accumulation of hMex-3B in cytoplasmic foci, indicating that recruitment to these structures depends on RNA binding. Taken together, our data provide evidence that hMex-3A and hMex-3B are two novel components of P bodies. Of note, hMex-3C did not show the same distribution pattern, an observation which supports the notion that hMex-3 proteins have intrinsically specific properties. Evidence is mounting that P bodies are both the sites of mRNA degradation and of sequestration of nontranslated transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Therefore, the localization of hMex-3A and hMex-3B in P bodies is compatible either with a function in RNA decay, as proposed by Donnini and collaborators for TINO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), or with a role in translational regulation as established for Mex-3 in the nematode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). A role of hMex-3 in translation regulation is not incompatible with a function in the control of RNA stability, and there are several documented examples of RNA-binding proteins involved in both processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Interestingly, we found that hMex-3A and hMex-3B do not form a physical complex with Ago proteins whereas hMex-3B KH mutant, which is located outside the P bodies, interact with Ago. These data suggest that, upon binding to their mRNA targets, Ago and hMex-3A or hMex-3B dissociate and the ribonucleoprotein complex is concomitantly ferried towards P bodies. This hypothesis is supported by the immunofluorescence analysis which showed that hMex-3B and Ago1 colocalized in P bodies.</p><p>Stress granules (SGs), which are cytoplasmic structures whose assembly is induced by the exposure of mammal cells to various environmental stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>) function as a triage center, exporting mRNA destined to be degraded to P bodies or allowing reinitiation of translation on polysomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). It is thus possible that hMex-3 proteins might relocate to these granules under certain conditions, a question which is currently under investigation.</p><p>Interestingly, in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the Mex-3 protein is a constituent of P granules which are ribonucleoprotein particles associated with germ cells. Mex-3 appears to play a role in the correct segregation of these granules in the P4 blastomere which gives rise to the germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Therefore, our data buttress the attracting idea that P granules and P bodies may constitute related structures with similar functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>A conserved role for hMex-3 in the maintenance of stem cell pluripotency?</title><p>Previous studies have established that Mex-3 controls the spatial patterning of PAL-1 in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> early embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>).

Interestingly, Cdx2 represses expression of Oct3/4, a transcription factor which is a critical determinant of the pluripotent stem cell phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). Furthermore, the Ascidian ortholog of Mex-3 is expressed in the blastomere supposed to give rise to the primordial germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that the function of Mex-3 in the maintenance of cells with multiple morphogenetic potentialities, as recently demonstrated for the nematode germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), may have been conserved throughout evolution. The characterization of the human Mex-3 proteins reported here, will allow their contribution to these vital biological processes to be determined and to uncover their interplay with RNA metabolism.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We are grateful to I.
