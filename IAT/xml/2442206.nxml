Recent reports indicate that autophagy can act both as a protector and killer of the cell depending on the stage of the disease or the surrounding cellular environment (for review see Cuervo, A.M. 2004. <italic>Trends Cell Biol.</italic> 14:70&#x02013;77). We found that cytoplasmic vacuoles induced in pancreatic acinar cells by experimental pancreatitis were autophagic in origin, as demonstrated by microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 expression and electron microscopy experiments. To analyze the role of macroautophagy in acute pancreatitis, we produced conditional knockout mice lacking the <italic>autophagy-related 5</italic> gene in acinar cells. Acute pancreatitis was not observed, except for very mild edema in a restricted area, in conditional knockout mice. Unexpectedly, trypsinogen activation was greatly reduced in the absence of autophagy. These results suggest that autophagy exerts devastating effects in pancreatic acinar cells by activation of trypsinogen to trypsin in the early stage of acute pancreatitis through delivering trypsinogen to the lysosome.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>D.

Although autophagy is mostly a nonselective bulk degradation system within cells, chaperone-mediated autophagy is a selective degradation system in which cytoplasmic proteins are refolded and transported into the lysosome lumen across the membrane (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cuervo, 2004</xref>). In microautophagy, only a small portion of cytoplasm is taken up directly by invagination of lysosome membrane into the lumen. As macroautophagy is believed to be the primary means for cytoplasm to lysosome delivery, it is most commonly referred to simply as autophagy. Genetic studies on yeast have identified &#x0003e;20 <italic>autophagy-related</italic> (<italic>ATG</italic>) genes that are required for autophagosome formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Klionsky et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Klionsky, 2005</xref>). Autophagy-defective yeast mutants are not able to survive during nitrogen starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tsukada and Ohsumi, 1993</xref>). Similarly, most of the <italic>Atg5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> and <italic>Atg7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice died within 1 d after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kuma et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Komatsu et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, autophagy is thought to be important for the cellular response to starvation and the normal turnover of cytoplasmic constituents.</p><p>Acute pancreatitis has long been considered to be an autodigestive disorder in which inappropriate activation of trypsinogen to trypsin within pancreatic acinar cells leads to the development of pancreatitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hirota et al., 2006</xref>). However, the mechanisms responsible for intracellular activation of trypsin have not been elucidated with certainty. There are two major hypotheses: the colocalization hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">van Acker et al., 2006</xref>) and the autoactivation hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Leach et al., 1991</xref>). According to the former hypothesis, digestive enzymes become colocalized with lysosomal hydrolases, such as cathepsin B, and activate trypsinogen in cytoplasmic vacuoles of acinar cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Steer and Meldolesi, 1987</xref>). The latter hypothesis suggests that trypsinogen is autoactivated under low pH conditions in the presence of serine protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Leach et al., 1991</xref>). However, the mode of trypsinogen delivery to the lysosomes or cellular compartments has been the subject of investigation. There are three possible mechanisms for delivery of trypsinogen to the cellular compartment where activation occurs. One is fusion of zymogen granules with lysosomes (crinophagy; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Koike et al., 1982</xref>). The second is perturbation of normal intracellular trafficking of zymogen granules and lysosomal hydrolases. The third is endocytic vacuole formation through uptake of secreted digestive enzymes by acinar cells via endocytosis, transportation to endosomes, and fusion of endosomes with lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Sherwood et al., 2007</xref>). One important clue to distinguish between these possibilities is the appearance of cytoplasmic vacuoles within pancreatic acinar cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Watanabe et al., 1984</xref>). This is an early feature of acute pancreatitis. EM and immunohistochemical studies suggested that many vacuoles observed in both experimental and human acute pancreatitis were autophagic in origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Helin et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adler et al., 1985</xref>). Our previous study suggested that autophagy was induced in the acinar cells of mice with experimental pancreatitis induced by cerulein (cholecystokinin [CCK] analogue; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ohmuraya et al., 2005</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that vacuoles are autophagic in origin and that autophagy is somehow involved in the development of pancreatitis.</p><p>In this study, we report that cytoplasmic vacuoles induced in experimental acute pancreatitis are autophagic in origin and that absence of autophagy in the <italic>Atg5</italic> conditional knockout mouse results in greatly reduced acute pancreatitis caused by loss of trypsinogen activation in pancreatic acinar cells. Our results suggest that trypsinogen is delivered to the endosome or lysosome through autophagosome/autolysosome formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>We first analyzed the origin of vacuoles in cerulein-induced experimental pancreatitis. No changes in pancreatic morphology were observed at any time in any sample obtained from saline-injected mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). In contrast, acute pancreatitis was observed in cerulein-injected mice. The severity of acute pancreatitis increased with the number of cerulein injections. With six and nine cerulein injections, mild edema and acinar cell degeneration were observed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>). With 12 cerulein injections, the pancreas showed severe acinar cell degeneration with significant edema and inflammatory cell infiltration in the interstitium (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). In accordance with histological changes, we observed a significant increase in serum amylase activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). The observed increase was proportional to the cerulein dose and the severity of acute pancreatitis. To examine the induction of autophagy, we performed EM examination, which revealed vacuoles containing zymogen granules (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, asterisks) in acinar cells after nine cerulein injections (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Some vacuoles contained both zymogen granules and membrane-bound organelles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, arrows), suggesting nonselective uptake. EM images after 12 cerulein injections were characterized by an increase in vacuoles containing zymogen granules and organelles and by the appearance of large vacuoles with homogeneous material that seemed to be autolysosomes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). There are two forms of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), a mammalian homologue of yeast Atg8. LC3-I is localized in the cytoplasm and is converted into LC3-II, which is associated with the autophagosome membrane in a phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ichimura et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kabeya et al., 2000</xref>). The amount of LC3-II is thus correlated with the extent of autophagosome formation. In control mice, LC3-II was increased slightly by starvation but was virtually unchanged during saline treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). In mice treated with cerulein, a dose-dependent increase in LC3-II level was observed. Autophagy can also be monitored by detection of GFP fluorescence in GFP-LC3 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mizushima et al., 2004</xref>). After 24-h fasting, some dots that represent autophagosomes were detected in the cytoplasm in saline-injected mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). After cerulein injection, many dots were observed, and the number of GFP-LC3 dots from mice receiving 12 cerulein injections was larger than from mice with nine cerulein injections (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Together with EM examination, these results suggest that vacuoles are autophagic in origin.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Autophagy induction in pancreatic acinar cells of cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis.</bold> Overnight-starved mice were treated by saline (A) or cerulein 6 (B), 9 (C), or 12 (D) times, and pancreatic sections were analyzed by H&#x00026;E staining.

Southern blot analysis using genomic DNA from the pancreas showed that recombination occurred in about half of the pancreatic cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref>). As the pancreas contains not only acinar cells but also endocrine and duct cells, this ratio suggests that recombination occurred in most <italic>Atg5<sup>flox</sup></italic> alleles of the acinar cells.

There were no apparent abnormalities in blood biochemistry, such as total protein, glucose, total cholesterol, amylase, and lipase (unpublished data). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E) staining and EM analysis revealed that acinar cells were normal (Fig. S1, B and C). The levels of amylase and trypsinogen were the same in the pancreas of <italic>Atg5<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> and <italic>Atg5<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic>;EL-<italic>Cre2</italic> mice (Fig. S2). In addition, we examined whether the lack of <italic>Atg5</italic> affected CCK-induced calcium signaling in acinar cells. Type 2 and type 3 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3R2 and IP3R3) are the major Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release channels responsible for secretagogue-induced Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> signaling in pancreatic acinar cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Futatsugi et al., 2005</xref>).

Both <italic>Atg5<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> and <italic>Atg5<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic>;EL-<italic>Cre2</italic> mice at 2 mo of age were used in the following experiments.</p><p>Saline injection did not cause any pathological changes in both <italic>Atg5<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> and <italic>Atg5<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic>;EL-<italic>Cre2</italic> mice as revealed by histochemical and EM analyses (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A and C</xref>). We then induced acute pancreatitis by cerulein in <italic>Atg5<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> and <italic>Atg5<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic>;EL-<italic>Cre2</italic> mice. <italic>Atg5<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice showed typical signs of acute pancreatitis, such as severe acinar cell degeneration, edema in connective tissue, and infiltration of inflammatory cells with H&#x00026;E staining (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>).

In contrast, <italic>Atg5<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic>;EL-<italic>Cre2</italic> mice displayed normal histochemical characteristics except very mild edema in a small restricted region (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>).

All of these data suggest that trypsinogen activation is considerably suppressed by reduced autophagy.</p><p>Our findings established that autophagy is induced by supramaximal stimulation of cerulein and is directly related to trypsinogen activation and onset of acute pancreatitis. This is the first example that autophagy plays a destructive role in the early stage of disease development. Although the mechanism for autophagy induction by cerulein is not yet clear, insufficient recruitment of zymogene granule membranes under supramaximal stimulation may account for it. In physiological conditions, digestive enzymes are targeted to the secretory compartment, and mixing of lysosomes with digestive zymogens does not occur in the exocrine pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Gorelick et al., 1992</xref>). In autophagy, autophagosomes containing intracellular components fuse with endosomes and lysosomes to form autolysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Dunn, 1990</xref>). Thus, trypsinogen could be hydrolyzed to trypsin by a lysosomal enzyme such as cathepsin B in autolysosomes. Thus, we propose the autophagy theory for activation of trypsin in acute pancreatitis, and this can explain both the colocalization hypothesis and autoactivation hypothesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cerulein-induced pancreatitis</title><p>After overnight fasting, mice were given hourly intraperitoneal injections of saline or saline containing 50 &#x003bc;g/kg cerulein (Sigma-Aldrich) for 6, 9, and 12 h. 1 h after the last injection, mice were killed, and serum and pancreas samples were rapidly obtained.</p></sec><sec><title>Histological analysis</title><p>Tissue was fixed overnight in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with H&#x00026;E.
