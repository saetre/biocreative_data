Lifespan extension due to DR is conserved across a wide range of species. Recent research has focused upon genetically tractable model organisms such as <italic>C. elegans</italic> to uncover the genetic mechanisms that regulate the response to DR, in the hope that this information will provide insight into the mammalian response and yield potential therapeutic targets. However, no consensus exists as to the best protocol to apply DR to <italic>C. elegans</italic> and potential key regulators of DR are protocol-specific. Here we define a DR method that better fulfills criteria required for an invertebrate DR protocol to mirror mammalian studies. The food intake that maximizes longevity varies for different genotypes and informative epistasis analysis with another intervention is only achievable at this &#x02018;optimal DR&#x02019; level. Importantly therefore, the degree of restriction imposed using our method can easily be adjusted to determine the genotype-specific optimum DR level. We used this protocol to test two previously identified master regulators of DR in the worm. In contrast to previous reports, we find that DR can robustly extend the lifespan of worms lacking the AMP-activated protein kinase catalytic subunit AAK2 or the histone deacetylase SIR-2.1, highlighting the importance of first optimizing DR to identify universal regulators of DR mediated longevity.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Limiting food intake to approximately 60&#x00025; of the amount an organism eats given <italic>ad libitum</italic> access extends lifespan in a variety of species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Weindruch1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon is of medical interest because of the impact DR has on age-related pathology in mammals; DR has been shown to delay the onset and reduce the severity of several diseases including, but not limited to diabetes, auto-immune disease, and many forms of cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Masoro1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. That organisms can alter their longevity in response to changes in diet is thought to be an evolutionary adaptation to survive periods of low food availability in the wild <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Holliday1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. During times of famine the survival rate of an organism's offspring would be diminished. Under these circumstances, the adaptive strategy is to shut down or greatly reduce reproduction and redirect the limited resources available towards somatic maintenance to increase the chances of survival until food is plentiful <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Shanley1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. In accordance with this idea, DR not only increases lifespan but also reduces fecundity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Chippindale1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Holehan1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, subsequently re-fed DR animals can reproduce at advanced ages when chronically control-fed animals are no longer reproductive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Osborne1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>If this evolutionary theory is correct and the existence of a DR effect in diverse organisms is adaptive, the genetic mechanisms regulating this lifespan extension might be conserved between species. Using genetically tractable, short-lived model organisms rather than rodent models to study DR therefore becomes appealing and may lead to the identity of conserved genetic pathways required for increased longevity in response to DR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Mair1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, understanding which genetic pathways regulate the response to DR might facilitate the design of targeted therapeutic compounds that separate the beneficial effects of DR on health from its detrimental effects; although DR increases lifespan and resistance to many age-related diseases it can also have a negative impact on libido, stamina, wound healing ability and cold tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Jolly1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Maintaining a low food intake also imposes a psychological challenge that would be negated by DR mimetics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Jolly1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Over the last decade there has been an increase in the study of DR in genetically tractable model organisms, in particular <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Bishop1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <italic>C. elegans</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Walker1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Partridge1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> resulting in a variety of key nutrient responsive proteins being implicated in the DR pathway. These include but are not limited to components of the insulin/IGF-like growth factor pathway (IIS), the sirtuins, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the target of rapamycin (TOR) and their role in DR in different species has been reviewed comprehensively elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Mair1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Bishop1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Of particular interest are proteins suggested to be &#x02018;master regulators&#x02019; of DR; proteins upon whose presence the DR longevity response is dependant and that therefore lie upstream of the causal mechanisms for the DR effect.</p><p>Reduction in food intake is likely to impact upon a host of nutrient sensing and metabolism-related pathways and as such it seems counter-intuitive that the physiological changes induced by DR should converge upon one single factor. Despite this, there exists in the literature many reported examples of such regulators of DR. These include the histone deacetylase Sir2p <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Lin1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Rogina1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, the protein kinase AMPK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Greer1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, the serine/threonine protein kinase TOR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Hansen1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Kaeberlein1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> and histone deacetylase Rpd-3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Rogina2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, along with the transcription factors PHA-4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Panowski1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, SKN-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Bishop2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> and DAF-16 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Greer1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. However, along with the increase in the study of DR on lower organisms has come debate upon the correct DR protocol to use for different species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Piper1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Further to this, deletion of specific master regulators of DR seems to block lifespan extension in response to certain DR protocols but not to others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Greer1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Easlon1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. This leads to two possible explanations; 1) Different DR protocols impact upon different pathways, each of which are dependent upon specific regulators or 2) sub-optimal DR regimes can result in false-positive identification of potential master regulators.</p><p>With the onset of the comparative &#x02018;omics&#x02019; era, the need to identify which of these two explanations is the case becomes paramount, since much time and research money is invested in mammalian aging research based upon initial findings taken from lower organisms. If different DR protocols in the same species function through distinct regulators, the likelihood that conserved pathways regulate the DR response across the evolutionary ladder perhaps becomes diminished. Alternatively, if using differing and sub-optimal DR protocols can result in false identification of DR regulators, it is important to develop a unified approach that minimizes such occurrences.</p><p>Classical genetic epistasis analysis reasons that if two interventions result in an additive phenotypic response they lie in separate pathways. However, this rule does not hold if the phenotype from either intervention is not maximized. For example, weak hypomorphic mutations in the insulin/IGF-like receptor <italic>daf-2</italic> extend worm lifespan, yet this lifespan extension in further enhanced by <italic>daf-2</italic> RNAi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Yamawaki1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-ArantesOliveira1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. In this case both interventions clearly lie in the same pathway despite there being an additive response when both are applied together.</p><p>To informatively interpret data from classical epistasis analyses testing two interventions that affect longevity, lifespan from one intervention must therefore be maximized before another is added <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Clancy1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. This is especially important when investigating the effect of genetic mutations on environmental perturbations such as DR because lifespan extension by DR is not binary but instead a graded response. For example, as food intake is reduced from <italic>ad libitum</italic> levels, lifespan gradually increases until a food level that maximizes longevity is reached, past which further reduction in food intake begins to shorten lifespan as animals enter starvation. This parabolic response of average lifespan to food intake has been observed in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Kaeberlein2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, worms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Houthoofd1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, flies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Clancy1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> and mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Weindruch2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. By its very nature, the parabolic curve indicates that the same lifespan can result from more than one specific nutritional intake level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004535-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Furthermore, different genotypes can respond to DR differentially such that the food intake that maximizes lifespan for one genotype may not be the same as that which maximizes the lifespan of another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004535-g001">Figure 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Clancy1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Forster1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Magwere1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, disruption to genetic pathways involved in nutrient sensing/signaling is likely to shift this optimal food intake level as the organism is effectively partially dietarily restricted by its genotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Mair1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. It is therefore paramount that DR is first &#x02018;optimized&#x02019; for each genotype tested before epistasis analysis with a second genetic or pharmacological intervention is performed, i.e. the animals must be subjected to a range of food intake levels and that which causes maximum lifespan is set as the DR level for that genotype and used for epistasis studies.</p><fig id="pone-0004535-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004535.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>The importance of optimizing DR for different genotypes before perfoming epistasis analysis.</title><p>Testing only 2 food intake levels can lead to false identification of master regulators of DR. Schematic model of lifespan of wild type animals shows a parabolic response to food intake (red line). If a genetic mutation alters the response of an animal to DR, the position of this curve on the x axis can be shifted (e.g. green line) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Clancy1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. In this situation, using only two food levels based on the wild type's <italic>ad libitum</italic> (WT AL) and dietary restriction (WT DR) position would falsely suggest DR does not increase longevity of the mutant despite the fact it shows a clear lifespan extension when food intake is reduced (green line). Testing a range of food intake levels rather than just two would resolve the green line, revealing a response to DR not seen if only 2 levels were used.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0004535.g001"/></fig><p>If lifespan extension due to DR is dependent upon a single factor, removal of that factor will completely abolish the DR effect. Rather than a parabolic response of longevity to DR there will be no interaction between food intake and lifespan when the DR factor is removed. Longevity will be the same at all food intake levels and plotting average lifespan against food intake would produce a horizontal line across the DR range. Crucially however, testing this hypothesis requires that lifespan be measured across a range of food intake levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004535-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This technique has been used in two recent studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic> to show that two transcription factors, SKN-1 and PHA-4 are both necessary for a dietary restriction response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Panowski1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Bishop2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. In both cases, worms lacking either transcription factor showed the same lifespan across a range of dietary intake levels ranging from near starvation to <italic>ad libitum</italic>.</p><p>In separate studies in the worm, deletion of the gene encoding AAK2, the catalytic subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase, or the gene encoding the histone deacetylase SIR2.1, was reported to block lifespan extension by DR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Wang1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Greer1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. However, in these studies lifespan of the mutant animals was only tested at two food levels; a control level and then either DR imposed by one food dilution or mutation in the gene <italic>eat-2</italic> (which results in decreased food intake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Avery1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Lakowski1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>) respectively, i.e. the DR protocol was not first optimized for the mutant.</p><p>Here we expand upon a protocol for applying DR to <italic>C. elegans</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Klass1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> that meets criteria required for an invertebrate method to be comparable to mammalian DR. Using this method we show that there is no compensation for food intake under DR conditions and that reproductive rate correlates with feeding. We then use this method to test whether mutations in <italic>aak-2</italic> or <italic>sir-2.1</italic> attenuate the lifespan extension seen in <italic>C. elegans</italic> when they are subjected to decreased concentrations of bacterial solution as a food source. Unlike previously published results, mutations in either <italic>aak-2</italic> or <italic>sir-2.1</italic> fail to block lifespan extension by DR using our protocol, which robustly extends lifespan of wild type worms whilst reducing both food intake and reproduction. These results indicate the importance of genotype-specific optimization of DR protocols if we are to obtain consistent results across different species and between different laboratories, and provide an easy DR method to be adopted as the standard for DR studies in the worm.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Defining a DR protocol for epistasis analysis in C. elegans</title><p>DR studies in the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> were first carried out by Klass in 1977 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Klass1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, yet still no consensus exists as to the best methodology to apply DR to worms that is consistent with mammalian DR regimes, and several different methods are used by different laboratories: Klass bacterial dilution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Klass1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, Dillin laboratory bacterial dilution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Panowski1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, Guarente laboratory bacterial dilution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Bishop2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, Brunet laboratory bacterial dilution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Greer1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, Vanfleteren laboratory bacterial dilution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Houthoofd1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, genetic DR surrogate by <italic>eat-2</italic> mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Avery1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, peptone reduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Hosono1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, axenic media <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Houthoofd2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, complete removal of food <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Kaeberlein3">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Lee1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref> and chemical inhibitors of glycolysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Schulz1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, along with unpublished protocols such as every other day feeding and sugar dilution (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004535-t001">Table 1</xref>).

Furthermore, BDR is not a batch culture system of large numbers of worms in liquid culture, but instead uses only 15 worms per/ml food culture, and worms are moved to fresh media twice weekly.

However, it is important to highlight the difference between lifespan extension by DR being dependent upon a gene versus being independent of it, a distinction that is more than simple semantics. Key nutrient-dependent factors such as AMPK and the sirtuins are likely to be involved in part of the DR response and DR cannot be said to be independent of them if altering their activity changes either the level of DR that optimizes lifespan or the lifespan extension that DR generates. Indeed, changing the activity of either SIR2 or the forkhead transcription factor FOXO, both of which were reported to be required for a DR response in studies using two food levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Wang1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Greer1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, was subsequently shown to alter the DR response but not block it when a range of DR levels was examined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Easlon1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004535-Giannakou1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore DR is not independent of either SIR2 or FOXO, despite neither being required for a DR response.</p><p>We have shown that when a robust, optimizable DR method is used, lifespan extension via reduced food intake in the worm does not require either AMPK or the two sirtuins, SIR2.1 and SIR2.3. This is the first example of testing the lifespan of AMPK or sirtuin mutants across a range of food intake levels in the worm and highlights the importance of this strategy if we are to identify potential master regulators of DR. Although both AMPK and the sirtuins may mediate some of the effects of DR in this and other species, neither is responsible for the DR effect in its entirety in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. If only two food intake levels are tested and the lifespan extension seen in wild type animals is weak, the chances of mis-identifying an intervention that alters the DR response as one that blocks it is increased.</p><p>BDR represents a DR method that gives robust lifespan extension and avoids many of the pitfalls associated with other worm DR protocols, as discussed above. Like all invertebrate DR methods, BDR does have experimental limitations. The worms are living in liquid throughout their adult life and it is unclear what proportion of their life-history in the wild is spent in similar conditions. However, this does prevent confounding effects of behavior that pose problems to plate based assays, where interventions may be affecting food intake due to the worms spending differing amounts of time within the bacterial lawn. Our method also requires the use of 5-Fluorodeoxyuridine (FUDR) to prevent progeny from hatching and is also more labor intensive than plate based lifespan assays. As with all worm DR methods using bacteria as a food source, combining BDR with RNAi using standard bacterial feeding approaches likely results in a dilution of the DR effect in the BDR cohorts, although this can be circumnavigated by applying alternative RNAi methods.</p><p>Despite these caveats, we propose that graded response to food levels by BDR better fulfills the requirements of a worm DR protocol to compare to mammalian DR than other methods currently being used. Crucially, we stress the need to optimize DR for each genotype tested before performing epistasis analysis, and therefore that any alternative to BDR should facilitate such an approach.</p><p>In our studies we have attempted to measure additional physiological outcomes of DR in a worm based protocol to ensure as much over lap with mammalian DR as possible. However, until a gene found to be required for longevity in a worm based DR protocol is validated in a bona fide mammalian model of DR, we will not know which worm DR protocol more closely reflects the mammalian condition. Demonstrating such conservation from invertebrates to mammals in the regulation of DR, and in particular showing relevance to human aging and pathology, is the ultimate goal of all aging research on model organisms and one that, if achieved, will facilitate exciting new therapeutic possibilities.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>BDR media preparation</title><p><italic>E.coli</italic> (OP50) was grown in 100 ml LB in a 1 L flask O/N at 37&#x000b0;C and spun down at &#x0223c;4000 rpm for 10 min.
