Taking advantage that this laboratory strain is entirely sequenced and easily accessible to genetic manipulations, we could design a study that allowed deciphering the beneficial effects of pleiotropic mutations during intestinal colonisation.</p><p>The mammalian intestine is a privileged physiological site to study how coevolution between hosts and the trillions of bacteria present in the microbiota has shaped the genome of each partner and promoted the development of mutualistic interactions. Genetic adaptation to the host over the millions years of coevolution has translated into physiological regulatory pathways that are rapidly mobilized in response to intestinal colonization &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040002-b006">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040002-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. In the microbiota, the contrast between the considerable number of species, more than a thousand, and the small number of bacterial divisions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040002-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;, indicates that coevolution has selected bacterial genera possessing the genetic gear to adapt to the host environment, a notion supported by recent evidence that gut habitats in different host species dictate distinctive structures of intestinal bacterial communities &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040002-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. Yet, the intestine is a complex and highly dynamic ecosystem composed of a large diversity of niches that vary in space and time, where bacteria face a permanent adaptive challenge. Furthermore, intestinal bacteria must be able to hurdle between their hosts across the exterior environment and for certain such as <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> to switch between two entirely distinct natural environments. Gnotobiotic animals that offer a simplified albeit relevant model to study reciprocal mechanisms of adaptation between bacteria and their hosts, within a few days, the host can only adapt via physiological changes, whereas bacteria can adapt both by gene regulations and adaptive mutations. Indeed, we have previously demonstrated that adaptive mutations are central for efficient intestinal colonization by <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040002-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;.

The gain of fitness provided by the diverse mutations selected in this global regulator during in vivo colonization results mainly from two distinct and measurable effects on motility and permeability that are both reduced in the mutant strains selected in the gut environment. These findings suggest that evolutionary pressures can put a diverse set of physiological functions facilitating adaptation under the control of one global regulator, and that mutations permit to adjust the scale of the physiological regulation controlled by this regulator in a given environment.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title><named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> Strains Selected during In Vivo Colonisation Exhibit a Reduced Motility Phenotype That Results from Mutations in the EnvZ-OmpR Regulator System</title><p>We have shown that adaptive mutations play a critical role in the success of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> MG1655 strain in colonizing of the mouse gut &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040002-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;.

The ratio of mutant (GFP) to WT (RFP) colonies was defined after culture of the feces and ex vivo induction of the fluorescent marker. Competition experiments using initial ratios of mutant to WT strain of 1:1, 1:100 and 1:1,000 indicated that the SG1 mutation confers a considerable fitness gain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040002-g001">Figure 1</xref>C).

These data explained how adaptive mutations in <italic>envZ,</italic> that are likely to happen at a frequency below 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>, can be very rapidly selected upon colonisation with the WT strain. The selective advantage of the SG1 mutation decreased to approximately 10&#x00025; when the ratio of mutant to WT strain increased over 1:10, indicating that the selective advantage conferred by the mutation is frequence-dependent, consistent with the observation that the WT strain is not entirely displaced in the mono-colonization experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040002-g001">Figure 1</xref>B).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Selected EnvZ-OmpR Mutations Exert Pleiotropic Effects on Bacterial Motility and Permeability</title><p>Importantly, the selected mutants did not exhibit the same motility phenotype as null mutations, since strains deleted for <italic>envZ</italic>, <italic>ompR</italic> or both kept the wild type LS morphotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0040002-sg001">Figure S1</xref>).

Altogether, these results point to a strong impact of flagellin on the selection of EnvZ mutations.

The emergence of distinct point mutations at the same two-component locus in bacterial populations evolving in different colonized mice suggested a comparable impact on the physiological effects mediating the fitness gain due to these mutations. Indeed all mutations resulted in profound repression of flagellin expression and modulation of OmpF versus OmpC porin expression yielding a reduced permeability phenotype. This phenotype is typical of mutations that switch the phosphatase/kinase membrane sensor EnvZ toward a OmpR kinase-dominant state. Indeed several of the missense mutations selected during in vivo colonisation were previously identified by in vitro mutational analysis as turning on this functional state &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040002-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040002-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;.

Indeed, using reporter mutant bacteria carrying a fluorescent protein under the control of the <italic>fliC</italic> promoter, we could clearly demonstrate that the selective advantage conveyed by mutations in <italic>envZ/ompR</italic> resulted from their pleiotropic and additive effects on the repression of flagellin production and OmpF porin expression.

These results suggest a mechanism causing the coexistence of ancestral and evolved form, perhaps because the ancestral phenotype confers some advantage to colonize a specific niche. Work is in progress to address this issue.</p><p>Experiments with microbial populations have been largely used to gain insight into the mechanics of evolution and have pointed to the possible important role of pleiotropic adaptive mutations &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040002-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, finding mutations in regulatory genes is a recurrent observation both in natural populations and during in vitro experimental evolution, that led to postulate that mutations affecting regulators are more likely to promote adaptation and evolution than those improving a single enzymatic step &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040002-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040002-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040002-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. Our results obtained in an in vivo model of bacterial evolution supports this hypothesis. As mutations in global regulators affect the regulation of many genes, they must be pleiotropic and are thus expected to result in the expression not only of beneficial but also of detrimental traits. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the selection of such pleiotropic mutations have therefore remained largely elusive in most systems. A recent study in a simple ecological in vitro model &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040002-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;, has shown that adaptive mutations allow <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. fluorescens</named-content> to occupy a novel ecological niche at the air-liquid interface &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040002-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;.

Drawing analogy with the <italic>che</italic> operon of <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> that encodes proteins homologous to the <italic>wsp</italic> operon, the authors suggested that this protein acts in concert with a putative methyl-transferase to adjust the activity of a kinase. The mutations may thus destroy the capacity of the pathway to fluctuate between activity states, producing instead a steady state output allowing niche specialization. Our results, combined with previous biochemical works &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040002-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;, provide direct evidence that a distinct scenario promotes the in vivo adaptation of an <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> MG1655 to the gut of germ-free mice. In the case of EnvZ/ompR, the two opposed enzymatic activities are exerted by the cytoplasmic domain of EnvZ and are modulated in response to signals sensed by the external domain of the protein. Mutations in EnvZ, that directly affect the balance between two activities, are selected because of their independent and additive effects on genes controlling flagellin expression and membrane permeability. Dissecting the fitness gain due to these independent pathways allowed us to demonstrate that the EnvZ/OmpR global regulator orchestrates the physiological adaptation of <italic>E. coli MG1655</italic> to the gut environment. More generally, the observation that the EnvZ/OmpR system gathers under its control genes central to promote intestinal colonization leads us to suggest that global regulators may have arisen during evolution to optimize the coordination of genes that collaborate to adapt to a given niche. Mutations in such global regulators may provide a complementary genetic tool that allows bacteria to extend the scale of the physiological regulation and promotes their rapid adaptation when confronted to very specific environments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Bacterial strains.</title><p>All strains were derived from the commensal flagellated <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 MG1655 sequenced strain &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040002-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;.
