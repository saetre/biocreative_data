The unwinding of double-helical DNA is catalyzed by a class of enzyme designated DNA helicase. These enzymes accomplish the task by using the energy generated by ATP hydrolysis, so that they retain an intrinsic DNA-dependent ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke504c1">1</xref>).</p><p> A large number of mammalian DNA helicases have been identified, and the functions in cellular metabolism of some have been characterized. Two examples are the DNA helicases functioning in DNA excision repair, ERCC2 and ERCC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke504c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke504c3">3</xref>). These enzymes are also known as subunits of the transcription factor, TFIIH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke504c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke504c5">5</xref>). Recently, a class of mammalian DNA helicases that share similarity with <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RecQ DNA helicase was identified. Five mammalian DNA helicases are classified into this group, and three of five genes encoding RecQ family helicases are found to be responsible for the genetic disorders Bloom syndrome, Werner syndrome and Rothmund&#x02013;Thomson syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke504c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke504c9">9</xref>).</p><p> Mcm proteins were originally identified in a screen for mutations of budding yeast that were defective in replication of minichromosomes. Six Mcm proteins (Mcm2&#x02013;7) are known to be involved in the initiation of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke504c10">10</xref>), and a complex of Mcm4, 6 and 7 possesses DNA helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke504c11">11</xref>). Hence, the DNA helicase activity of the Mcm protein complex is thought to be involved in DNA replication in eukaryotic cells. Although analysis of human genetic disorders and yeast genetics has shed light on the physiological functions of some mammalian DNA helicases, the function of most of those originally identified by biochemical activity remains unknown.</p><p> We have isolated a temperature-sensitive mutant defective in DNA replication, tsFT848, from a mouse mammary carcinoma cell line, FM3A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke504c12">12</xref>). Characterization of tsFT848 cells revealed that a major DNA-dependent ATPase activity in the mutant cells was diminished during incubation at the non-permissive temperature, 39&#x000b0;C. The DNA-dependent ATPase activity was found to be derived from a DNA helicase, DNA helicase B, whose biochemical properties we have characterized in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke504c13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke504c15">15</xref>). DNA helicase B is one of the mammalian proteins first identified as DNA helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke504c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke504c15">15</xref>). The helicase stimulates primer RNA synthesis by DNA primase on M13 single-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke504c16">16</xref>) and supports DNA replication in a model system which consists of plasmid DNA containing an autonomously replicating sequence from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, replication protein A, DNA polymerase &#x003b1;-primase complex and DNA gyrase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke504c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke504c18">18</xref>).</p><p> In this study, we have purified DNA helicase B from FM3A cells, isolated its cDNA and identified a mutation in the DNA helicase B of tsFT848 cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Purification of DNA helicase B from mouse FM3A cells</title><p>FM3A cells were grown in the abdominal cavity of ddY mice and harvested.

Prior to loading of the gel piece, 2 &#x000b5;g of Achromobacter protease I (Lysyl Endopeptidase, Wako) was made to migrate into the stacking gel with a constant current at 65 mA for 10 min using a second stacking buffer for the cathode buffer. The gel piece was applied onto the polyacrylamide gel containing Achromobacter protease I and electrophoresed with a constant current at 30 mA until both the 130 kDa protein and the protease had migrated to the boundary between the stacking gel and the separating gel.

SDS&#x02013;PAGE was performed according to Laemmli&#x02019;s method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke504c19">19</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Purification of mouse DNA helicase B</title><p>DNA helicase B was purified from 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>11</sup> mouse FM3A cells by sequential column chromatography using DNA-dependent ATPase activity as an index. The elution profile for ATPase activity on the second MonoQ column, the last column used in the purification, is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke504f1">1</xref>A. The ATPase activity was eluted in fractions 68 to 78 with a peak at &#x0223c;280 mM KCl and was markedly stimulated by the addition of heat-denatured calf thymus DNA, indicating that the activity was DNA-dependent. The purified fraction contained 280 800 U of DNA-dependent ATPase activity and 331 &#x000b5;g of protein (848 441 U&#x0002f;mg). The specific activity of the DNA-dependent ATPase in the final fraction was increased 3270-fold as compared with that of the crude extract; however, the increase in the purity of DNA helicase B was not clear because of the existence of multiple ATPases in the crude extract.

Although several bands were detected on the gel, only one protein band at 130 kDa showed a good correlation to the activities of DNA-dependent ATPase and DNA helicase. In addition, SDS&#x02013;PAGE of a fraction obtained by a similar purification process showed a clear 130 kDa band with fewer contaminating bands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke504c16">16</xref>). We presumed that the 130 kDa protein was DNA helicase B, and proceeded to determine partial amino acid sequences of the protein as described in Materials and Methods. Three partial amino acid sequences were determined (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke504f2">2</xref>, dots) and the longest one (Ile-Lys-Gln-Asp-Phe-Glu-Ser-Ser-Thr-Arg-Leu-X-Asn-Gly-Glu-Ile-Phe-Phe) was used to synthesize DNA probes for screening a cDNA library.</p></sec><sec><title>Molecular cloning of cDNA encoding mouse DNA helicase B</title><p>Possible nucleotide sequences corresponding to the middle of the determined amino acid sequence (Ser-Ser-Thr-Arg-Leu-X) were so diverse that we sequenced this region by RT&#x02013;PCR using total RNA from FM3A cells. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides encoding six amino acids from the N-terminus (5&#x02032;-ATI AAA&#x0002f;G CAA&#x0002f;G GAT&#x0002f;C TTT&#x0002f;C GA-3&#x02032;, where I indicates inosine) and nucleotide sequences in the complementary strand encoding six amino acids from the C-terminus (5&#x02032;-AAA&#x0002f;G AAI ATT&#x0002f;C TCI CCA&#x0002f;G TT-3&#x02032;) were synthesized and used for PCR primers.

The cDNA inserts of these clones were subcloned into pUC19 plasmid. Sequencing of these cDNA clones revealed that one clone was a part of the other clone. The longer clone (clone 1) consisted of 3232 bp, and the N-terminus of the protein was not encoded by this cDNA. To obtain cDNA encoding the N-terminus of the protein, DNA was amplified by PCR from the fetal mouse brain cDNA library using a primer corresponding to nucleotides 67 to 84 of clone 1 (5&#x02032;-TCT GCA TTT GCG ACG TGT-3&#x02032;) and a primer of 24 nt corresponding to the cloning site of &#x003bb;gt10 (5&#x02032;-CTT ATG AGT ATT TCT TCC AGG GTA-3&#x02032;). PCR was performed again using a primer corresponding to nucleotides 38 to 55 of clone 1 (5&#x02032;-TCT AAC ATG GTC ATC GCC-3&#x02032;) and the &#x003bb;gt10 primer used in the first PCR.

The largest positive band was subcloned into pUC19 and the DNA sequence was analyzed.</p><p> We finally cloned a 4464 bp cDNA with an open reading frame of 3222 bp. The result of DNA sequence analysis was confirmed more than three times with DNA products amplified by PCR from the cDNA library or by RT&#x02013;PCR of FM3A mRNA. The amino acid sequence deduced from the open reading frame is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke504f2">2</xref>. The open reading frame encodes a protein of 1074 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 121&#x000a0;483.5. All of the three determined partial amino acid sequences are contained in the amino acid sequence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke504f2">2</xref>, dots), indicating that the cDNA clone encodes the 130 kDa protein that we purified.</p><p> A search of amino acid sequence databases indicated that the protein had similarity to the YrrC protein of <italic>Bacillus subtilis </italic>and the &#x003b1; subunit of exodeoxyribonuclease V of several prokaryotes including <italic>E.coli</italic> RecD protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke504f2">2</xref>), although no significant similarity was detected with known yeast proteins. The identity and similarity of amino acid sequences between mouse DNA helicase B and <italic>E.coli</italic> RecD protein are 11.1 and 16.9&#x00025;, respectively, while between mouse DNA helicase B and <italic>B.subtilis</italic> YrrC protein they are 16.5 and 26.0&#x00025;, respectively. The similarity revealed seven conserved helicase motifs, I, Ia, II, III, IV, V and VI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke504c20">20</xref>), in the deduced amino acid sequence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke504f2">2</xref>, underlined), suggesting that the protein encoded by the isolated cDNA possessed DNA&#x0002f;RNA helicase activity. Accordingly, we concluded that the cDNA is the one encoding DNA helicase B. The motifs in mouse DNA helicase B are 46.8&#x00025; identical and 66.1&#x00025; similar to the motifs in <italic>E.coli</italic> RecD protein, and 42.7&#x00025; identical and 71.0&#x00025; similar to the motifs in <italic>B.subtilis</italic> YrrC protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of a mutation site of DNA helicase B in tsFT848 cells</title><p>We previously reported that partially purified DNA helicase B from tsFT848 cells, a temperature-sensitive mutant of mouse FM3A cells, was more heat-labile than wild-type enzyme at the non-permissive temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke504c12">12</xref>). Thus, we next investigated the mutation site(s) of DNA helicase B of the mutant cell.

The charts obtained with the automated DNA sequencer are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke504f3">3</xref>B. The thymine residue at 2199 in wild-type DNA helicase B cDNA was changed to guanine, resulting in the conversion of phenylalanine at 724 to cysteine.

The isolated cDNA was 4464 bp long and contained a 3222 bp open reading frame encoding a 1074 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 121&#x000a0;483.5. The amino acid sequence deduced from the open reading frame contained the three partial sequences and seven motifs conserved in the DNA&#x0002f;RNA helicase superfamily, indicating that the cDNA actually encodes DNA helicase B.</p><p> A search of protein sequence databases revealed that the helicase motifs of DNA helicase B share remarkably high homology with those of the YrrC protein of <italic>B.subtilis </italic>and the &#x003b1; subunit of exodeoxyribonuclease V of various prokaryotes including <italic>E.coli</italic>. Although the homology is mainly observed in the helicase motifs, several homologous regions can be seen outside the motifs. Since helicase motifs share only limited homology between DNA&#x0002f;RNA helicases in general, it seems likely that DNA helicase B and the &#x003b1; subunit of exonuclease V in prokaryotes are structural homologs that have evolved from the same ancestor. On the other hand, it cannot plausibly be argued that mouse DNA helicase B is a functional homolog of <italic>E.coli</italic> RecD, because it acts as a DNA helicase without forming a hetero-complex with other proteins such as RecB or RecC. It is important to reveal the necessity of a DNA helicase containing a RecD-like structure in higher eukaryotes.</p><p> DNA helicase B in tsFT848 cells was inactivated by incubating cells at a non-permissive temperature, and a partially purified form from the mutant cells was inactivated more rapidly than that from wild-type cells upon incubation at 40&#x000b0;C. Thus, we assumed that DNA helicase B of the mutant cells carried a mutation and this mutation was responsible for the defect in DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke504c12">12</xref>). Molecular cloning of the cDNA encoding the helicase allowed us to identify mutation points in tsFT848 cells. The mutation point of the DNA helicase B of tsFT848 cells was located in the sequence between motifs IV and V. Since this intervening sequence is very long compared with other intervening sequences, it seems likely that this region plays an important role in maintaining the spatial relationship between DNA helicase motifs I&#x02013;IV and motifs V&#x02013;VI, and at a non-permissive temperature, the spatial relationship is destroyed due to the mutation.</p><p> The physiological function of DNA helicase B seems to be related to DNA replication, but is still unknown. To obtain more information about the function of DNA helicase B, we analyzed the arrest point of the mutant cells in the cell cycle by immunostaining of chromatin-bound Mcm4, the staining patterns of which are gradually changed as S-phase proceeds. The result indicated that tsFT848 cells were arrested at early S-phase at a non-permissive temperature, suggesting that the helicase functions in the early stage of S-phase (Y.Kusa, T.Kobayashi, M.Seki, S.Tada and T.Enomoto, unpublished observation). One possible role of the enzyme is to function as a replicative helicase that unwinds double-stranded DNA ahead of the replication machinery. The MCM complex is known to be important in some aspects of DNA replication and to have DNA helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke504c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke504c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke504c22">22</xref>), suggesting that the protein complex acts as a replicative DNA helicase. Nevertheless, it is possible that there are other DNA helicases that move ahead of the DNA replication forks, because the processivity of the helicase in the MCM complex is low. Our preliminary results, however, indicated that DNA helicase B was not necessarily localized to replication sites as revealed by staining with an anti-BrdU antibody (T.Kobayashi, M.Seki, S.Tada and T.Enomoto, unpublished observation).</p><p> Another possible function for the helicase is to remove barriers ahead of the DNA replication machinery, which may include nucleosome structures. Indeed, the RecBCD complex from <italic>E.coli</italic> was reported to be able to unwind DNA with a nucleosomal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke504c23">23</xref>). T4 Dda, which is a DNA helicase with similarities to <italic>E.coli</italic> RecD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke504c24">24</xref>), was able to overcome the inhibitory function of nucleosomes in the T4 bacteriophage DNA replication system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke504c25">25</xref>). In addition, a T4 bacteriophage with a mutation in the <italic>dda</italic> gene is defective in DNA replication despite the fact that the replicative DNA helicase of the bacteriophage is not Dda but the gene41 product. Thus, because of the similarity of DNA helicase B to RecD, it is conceivable that DNA helicase B functions to remove barriers ahead of the DNA replication machinery.</p><p> There are a number of possible stages during S-phase in which the DNA helicase could be involved. It also cannot be ruled out that the enzyme is involved in the resolution of duplicated chromosomes together with DNA topoisomerases. We believe that elucidation of the function of DNA helicase B will uncover a new aspect of DNA metabolism that employs DNA helicase with significant structural similarity to prokaryotic proteins.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gke504f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Purification of DNA helicase B.
