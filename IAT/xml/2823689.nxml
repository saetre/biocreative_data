Syt research dates back to 1981, when the first Syt was identified as an integral protein of synaptic vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Since then, much effort has gone into discovering the function and the detailed mechanism of action of this protein, Syt1. Numerous experimental approaches have shown that Syt1 is crucially involved in fast neurotransmitter release at synapses [reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]]. Syt1 binds calcium, serving as the calcium sensor which triggers synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Syt1 also binds to the neuronal SNARE proteins which are required for membrane fusion, as well as to membranes directly. The primary structure of Syt1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] revealed three important features: an N-terminal transmembrane (TM) domain, which serves to anchor the protein in the synaptic vesicle, plus two, tandem, C-terminal, cytoplasmic C2 domains (C2A and C2B) which specify the calcium, SNARE and membrane binding properties. Crystallographic studies of some Syt C2 domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] have revealed the exact nature of their calcium binding abilities. Structural bioinformatics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] has shown that C2 domains are very common in the eukaryotic protein repertoire, but not all act to bind calcium. C2 domains can occur singly or as multiple copies in a given protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The particular domain organisation of Syt1 is important for its role in synaptic vesicle exocytosis. The TM domain tethers the protein to the membrane. The C2A and C2B domains, endowed with individual capacities to bind calcium, SNARE proteins, other accessory proteins and phospholipids, act both independently and synergistically, at different stages during the life cycle of the synaptic vesicle, to promote or inhibit fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>After the genetic code for Syt1 was discovered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] genes similar to <italic>Syt1 </italic>were sought and found. Biochemical methods which were employed initially, led to an increase in the size of the rodent <italic>Syt </italic>family, from one member to thirteen members and beyond. <italic>Syt </italic>relatives were also identified and studied in <italic>D. melanogaster </italic>and <italic>C. elegans</italic>. All of these homologous <italic>Syt </italic>genes were found to encode proteins with a common domain architecture: an N-terminal TM domain connected by a variable length, poorly conserved linker sequence, to well conserved, tandem, C-terminal C2A and C2B domains and this domain architecture was taken to define the family. Functional studies with the proteins <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro</italic>, indicate that some respond to calcium but others do not. Whether or not they respond to calcium, Syt proteins are able to regulate membrane fusion due to common properties of their C2 domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Studies of the anatomical expression patterns of <italic>Syt </italic>genes show that <italic>Syt1 </italic>is abundantly expressed in nervous tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In <italic>D. melanogaster, Syt1 </italic>expression is neuron specific but other <italic>Syt </italic>genes are expressed elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In rodents, most <italic>Syt </italic>genes are expressed in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>With the publication of whole genome sequences from multicellular organisms, it became possible to identify and compare complete genome complements of <italic>Syt </italic>genes using computational methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The phylogeny of these genes could be examined by comparing sequences from different organisms. Seventeen <italic>Syt </italic>homologues were found in each of the complete <italic>H. sapiens </italic>and <italic>M. musculus </italic>genome sequences. These were named <italic>SYT1 </italic>(<italic>Syt1</italic>) to <italic>SYT17 </italic>(<italic>Syt17</italic>) according to the nomenclature conventions of the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] (and the Mouse Genome Informatics Database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]). Some of these genes however, encode Syt proteins which lack the requisite domain architecture for inclusion in a Syt family defined by domain structure. The complete genome sequences of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>D. melanogaster </italic>and <italic>A. thaliana </italic>were analysed, together with draft genome sequences from other eukaryotes, to assess their Syt coding potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Proteins which share the stereotypical Syt domain architecture, are encoded by distinct (not phylogenetically homologous) gene families in plants and in animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] further confounding the notion of a homologous Syt family defined in terms of domain architecture. Functional similarity between plant and animal Syt proteins, at the level of calcium and membrane binding, has been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] in keeping with the notion that protein form specifies function. Proteins have been classified as Syt family members by the presence or absence of suitable characteristics in terms of protein form and function [eg. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]] without studious regard to gene ancestry. Legitimately but confusingly, family membership can be defined in different ways: in terms of descent from a common ancestor (homology) or in terms of the common possession of distinguishing features. Since it is not straightforward to demonstrate that homology is the cause of the similarity between biological entities such as proteins, it is often just assumed, leading to the confusion of two different notions of a protein family. Please see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] for explanations of the terminology of homology. Examination of the genomic specification of eukaryotic proteins can help to reveal their phylogenetic relationships because the evolutionary conservation of gene structure provides additional information on which to base an inference of homology. Families may thereby be resolved as those related by homology and those otherwise related. Ambiguity still remains however, because depending on the exact biological context, members of a family, however defined, can sometimes be considered as functionally interchangeable and thus worthy of a common functional identity. Thus, genes and proteins can acquire multiple identities depending on the perspective from which they are considered. Universal agreement about nomenclature for genes and proteins which is suitably clear and meaningful is a challenge for the future, but norms for gene nomenclature according to phylogenetic relationships are established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>It may be the case (as is often assumed for an orthologous family group) that members of a gene family related by heredity, share a common functional role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. However, due to the dynamics of eukaryotic genome evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] the functional attributes of gene relatives can diverge. It is also possible, that separate start points, through advantageous gain of function, can lead through selection, to convergence upon a common form and function. While it is practicable to assign family membership to genes or proteins based on their apparent hereditary relationships, the functional implications of family membership cannot simply be deduced. More than a decade of research effort has been aimed at understanding how Syt1 works. Considerable effort has also been directed at understanding the functions of other Syt proteins. Current understanding however, is insufficient to predict the functions of a whole genome complement of Syt proteins, or indeed to predict what a genome complement of Syt proteins might consist of.</p><p>To help improve this lack of understanding, I have put together an open access resource intended to serve future research aimed at understanding the biological meaning of the hereditary and functional relationships among some of the metazoan Syt-like proteins. I have collected and compiled manually, information about homologous <italic>Syt</italic>, <italic>Esyt</italic>, <italic>Rph3a, Rph3al</italic>, <italic>Doc2 </italic>and <italic>Dblc2 </italic>genes from 46 metazoan genome sequences spanning a wide evolutionary range. I have not attempted to collect all genes capable of encoding proteins with similarity on any level to Syt proteins. Such a collection would ultimately include perhaps, all eukaryotic C2 domain proteins. My collection is restricted to homologous <italic>Syt </italic>genes plus a small group of genes already identified as similar but not homologous to <italic>Syt </italic>genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The collection does include a new group of homologous genes (<italic>Dblc2</italic>) which are present in the genomes of marine invertebrates and encode proteins similar to Syt proteins. The information in this collection may interest investigators in the field of evolutionary biology, with examples of dynamic genome evolution including whole gene duplication, partial duplication, gene fission, acquisition of novel coding exons, gene inactivation, extreme sequence divergence, intron mobilization and a variety of routes to the expression of altered gene products. For experimentalists who want to understand how Syt proteins act to effect the biology of animal nervous systems, the collection provides a utility with great evolutionary depth. In order to make progress in neuroscience, appropriate model organisms must be chosen. The choice of model organism is fundamental to the type of science which can be pursued. The range of organisms and genes in this collection, offer novel possibilities for future descriptive, comparative and hypothesis driven research.</p><p>In order to make the large amount of information described by this paper available for public scrutiny, it is available as 50 additional files which can be accessed online.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>Origin of this gene collection</title><p>The origin of this manual gene curation project lay in an attempt to annotate some of the plant <italic>NTMC2 </italic>genes I had identified previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. I chose the unique <italic>NTMC2 </italic>nomenclature to emphasise the phylogenetic relationships among these plant genes and to distinguish them from animal <italic>Syt </italic>genes. Plant <italic>NTMC2T1</italic>, <italic>NTMC2T2 </italic>and <italic>NTMC2T3 </italic>genes resemble animal <italic>Syt </italic>genes in having the same domain architecture. That this shared domain architecture implies functions in common, has now been demonstrated experimentally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The <italic>A. thaliana </italic>NTMC2T1.1 protein (also known as SYT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]) possesses calcium and membrane binding activities which allow it to function in a plasma membrane repair pathway induced by stress. While using the annotation facilities at DOE-JGI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] I realised that the evolutionary range of genome sequences available for inspection at DOE-JGI, could be used to search for earlier origins of the embryophyte <italic>NTMC2 </italic>genes and metazoan <italic>Syt </italic>genes. The genome sequence of <italic>M. brevicollis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] has demonstrated that, as theorised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] the evolutionary transition from unicellularity to multicellularity involved abundant domain shuffling in proteins. <italic>M. brevicollis</italic>, a unicellular protist, closely related but basal to metazoans, does not possess <italic>Syt </italic>genes. It does have a gene with a degree of gene structure similarity, domain architecture similarity and amino acid sequence similarity to plant NTMC2 and animal Esyt proteins <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="XM_001748216">XM_001748216</ext-link>. Proteins with similarity to NTMC2 and Esyt proteins (but without similarity at the gene structure level) are present in other unicellular eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. It seems reasonable therefore, to propose that while <italic>NTMC2 </italic>and <italic>Esyt </italic>genes could ultimately be homologous, having attained their current forms through descent from a unicellular ancestor, <italic>Syt </italic>genes, distinguished by their conserved gene structure, more likely represent a metazoan novelty.</p><p>On finding uniquely metazoan <italic>Syt </italic>homologues, with their characteristic gene structures, in the genomes of <italic>T. adhaerens </italic>and <italic>N. vectensis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] I decided to compile afresh, the <italic>Syt </italic>repertoire of the currently available genomes of evolutionary significance. In addition to <italic>Syt </italic>genes, I set out to gather <italic>Esyt</italic>, <italic>Rph3a</italic>, <italic>Rph3al </italic>and <italic>Doc2 </italic>homologues. These gene families, while clearly distinct from the <italic>Syt </italic>family at the gene structure level, encode proteins with high level sequence similarity to the tandem C2 domain region of Syt (<italic>Rph3a </italic>and <italic>Doc2</italic>) or with similarity, in common with NTMC2 proteins, at a more crude domain architecture level (<italic>Esyt</italic>). Because of these similarities in form, there will be common functions. A collection like this can be used to further define these functions, by revealing the patterns of sequence conservation (indicating selection and functional importance) and sequence divergence, apparent in: 1. the individual domains of an orthologous group of proteins, 2. the equivalent domain in different groups, not necessarily homologous. Such knowledge can provide clues about how these proteins function as molecular machines in cells and about how these functions have developed over evolutionary time. I used the annotation facilities at DOE-JGI to create and annotate gene models where possible.

I employed a variety of methods, first to identify, then to piece together, gene sequences for homologues of <italic>Syt</italic>, <italic>Esyt</italic>, <italic>Rph3a</italic>,<italic>Rph3al </italic>and <italic>Doc2</italic>. These are generally large, multi-exon genes which encompass regions of high (the C2 domain region of Syt proteins for example) and low (the N-terminal portion of Syt proteins for example) levels of sequence conservation. As a first step, I used blatp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] or tblastn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>] with amino acid sequence probes representing already known homologues, to identify genomic loci with potential to encode a similar protein. I then examined a 3-frame translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] of the genomic region to look at the possible exon-intron structure. Intron positions and phases are generally well conserved among these genes and serve as a useful diagnostic tool. In cases where the draft genome sequence was highly fragmented, homologues were pieced together exon by exon. Where sequence conservation between amino acid probe and novel genomic locus was high, it was straightforward to identify exons and introns. Where sequence conservation was low, the conservation of intron position and phase could serve as a guide to judge possible exon boundaries. In all cases, when transcript sequences from the locus under examination, or from a homologous locus in a closely related organism, were available, these were used to help identify exons. Occasionally, trace archive reads were sought to confirm exon sequences, where there was a gap or where there appeared to be frameshift errors in a section of draft sequence for example. Details of such instances are noted in additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>.</p><p>Where transcript sequences indicated the expression of alternative variants, I collected the variants. In the case of <italic>M. musculus </italic>and <italic>H. sapiens</italic>, where there is abundant transcript variation, particularly at certain genomic loci, I collected only those variants indicated by two or more transcript sequences. Where evidence of alternative splicing exists but is not represented by full length transcripts (the majority of cases) the resultant gene predictions require validation, as do all gene predictions for which no transcript evidence exists. For genomic loci with conserved variant exons, which could be employed to extend the length of the encoded protein but where transcript evidence was lacking, the gene prediction includes all of the conserved exons. Transcript evidence for the gene predictions is listed in additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>.</p><p>Once I had gathered a set of crude gene predictions, I compared the sequences in order to refine the predictions. Exon-intron junctions, gaps, novel regions of sequence conservation useful as probes to fill gaps, were all carefully examined using multiple alignments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. In this way, it was possible to extend and improve the gene predictions significantly. Many of the gene predictions in this collection are still incomplete, at the N-terminal region of Syt proteins in particular. When there was no transcript coverage and no detectable sequence conservation or very short coding exons, it was not possible to make a prediction. All incomplete predictions are noted in additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Sequence comparison: global comparison and nomenclature</title><p>Having collected 711 genes from 46 genomes, I used clustalw2 at EBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>] to compare subsets of amino acid sequences, in order to examine their relationships of similarity overall. I compared sets which excluded expressed variants but which included one sequence per gene, whether complete or not. Comparisons of invertebrate sequences (additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>) vertebrate sequences (additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>) invertebrate (one representative per genus) plus mammalian sequences (additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>) and invertebrate (one representative per genus) plus a subset of vertebrate sequences (additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>) were used to examine relationships and assign a suitable name to each gene. I assigned a common name to those genes which clustered together in conserved groups. When a conserved group included a homologue from <italic>M. musculus</italic>/<italic>H. sapiens</italic>, the assigned name was chosen to be consistent with that in <italic>M. musculus</italic>/<italic>H. sapiens</italic>. For those <italic>Syt </italic>genes which did not consistently cluster together and are not conserved among different organisms, I assigned them numbers upward from the last conserved group. This process led to the identification of 22 conserved groups of <italic>Syt </italic>genes plus a further 35 unique <italic>Syt </italic>genes named with the <italic>Syt </italic>stem symbol plus a number identifier, in order to provide a recognisable name (albeit provisional) for each. This naming system allows further sampling of the tree of life by gene sequencing to reveal: 1. more unique <italic>Syt </italic>genes, from <italic>Syt58 </italic>upwards, all members of a recognisably homologous family and 2. previously unrecognisable patterns of conservation among <italic>Syt </italic>genes, from <italic>Syt22 </italic>upwards. I contacted the relevant organism nomenclature authorities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>] to discuss this nomenclature. This wide consultation led to agreement to change <italic>FAM62</italic>, a temporary HGNC symbol for this poorly characterised gene family, to <italic>Esyt </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. Where current approved nomenclature is discordant with that proposed here, the approved nomenclature is indicated within brackets, in additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref> and figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. There is inconsistency in the application of my naming rationale in <italic>Drosophila </italic>and <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic>, where it was more practical to stick with the approved nomenclature than propose new names. As yet, and in comparison to vertebrates, invertebrates are poorly represented by organised gene nomenclature authorities. My proposed nomenclature for a large number of genes in this collection, therefore, awaits sanction. Note that due to differing nomenclature conventions, the gene symbols in different organisms, range from having no capital letters to all capital letters. The generic form, which I have used to label the genes from organisms outside the purview of nomenclature authorities, is first letter in capitals. This designation will be used here, to describe the gene in general, without reference to a specific organism.</p><p>Deciding whether relationships of orthology or some other kind exist among a group of similar genes, can be complicated. The processes of duplication, deletion, and rearrangement of genes, plus the action of selection or absence of selection on gene sequences, can obscure relationships. Whether absence from a genome assembly reflects true absence, or incompleteness of the assembly, presents a further problem of some seriousness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. In <italic>M. musculus </italic>and <italic>H. sapiens </italic>there are several groups of duplicated <italic>Syt </italic>genes: group 1 [<italic>Syt1</italic>, <italic>Syt2</italic>, <italic>Syt5</italic>, <italic>Syt8</italic>] group 2 [<italic>Syt4</italic>, <italic>Syt11</italic>] group 3 [<italic>Syt3</italic>, <italic>Syt6</italic>, <italic>Syt9</italic>, <italic>Syt10</italic>] and group 4 [<italic>Syt14</italic>, <italic>Syt16</italic>].

The parental gene of group 2 is <italic>Syt4</italic>, that of group 3 is <italic>Syt9 </italic>and that of group 4 is <italic>Syt16</italic>. In each of these cases, the parental gene is more similar to a gene present in an evolutionarily more ancient genome than it is to another member of the mammalian group, which is to say, orthologous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Orthologous genes in different organisms, are related by vertical descent from a common ancestor. Relevant pairwise comparison scores are listed in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>. It is worthwhile trying to determine the phylogenetic relationships between the <italic>Syt </italic>genes of mammals and those of other animals because it is the rodent Syt proteins which are best characterised functionally. However, because mammalian organisms and their brains in particular, represent biological systems of such complexity, modelling these systems by using simpler systems is essential.

Neither of these groups are well conserved, both genes having diverged significantly over time. The <italic>Syt18 </italic>group ranges from members encoding: tandem C2 domains (<italic>S. purpuratus</italic>, <italic>B. floridae</italic>, <italic>A. carolinensis</italic>) a single C2B domain (<italic>L. gigantea</italic>, <italic>X. tropicalis</italic>, the fish genomes) or no C2 domains at all (the <italic>Syt18b </italic>duplicates in the fish genomes). <italic>Syt20 </italic>appears in only two hexapod species in this collection. The other <italic>Syt </italic>groups absent in vertebrates, are <italic>Sytalpha </italic>and <italic>Syt21</italic>.

Most of these encode stereotypical Syt proteins, but some have only one C2 domain and some lack a TM domain (as noted in additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). The <italic>Caenorhabditis Syt </italic>repertoire, in common with many others in this collection, demonstrates that variant Syt proteins which lack the TM domain, are usually included.

I have included potential Doc2g products from the human gene locus. Although spliced transcripts are produced from this locus, they cannot encode full length proteins and it is not known whether protein products are translated from these transcripts.

The collection includes 141 genes from the genome sequences of 9 marine invertebrates (additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>) 215 genes from the genome sequences of 24 ecdysozoans, including the 12 <italic>Drosophila </italic>and 5 <italic>Caenorhabditis </italic>genomes (additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>) plus 355 genes from 13 vertebrate genomes (additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). When viewed overall (figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) the collection implies that particular homologues which are always present in the genome repertoire, serve to specify functions required for animal life. The basis for this view is that these genes have not been lost, but have been retained and conserved, over the long period of metazoan evolution. Such a view about the essentiality of gene function, differs from a synthetic biology view, which considers the genes necessary to specify an operable system which functions outside the natural world. It differs too, from a reductionist molecular biology view where, if a gene can be deleted in the laboratory setting, without killing the organism, it is not considered essential. Such gene deletion experiments have been done with <italic>Syt1 </italic>in different organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B94">94</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B96">96</xref>] and according this view, <italic>Syt1 </italic>is not strictly essential to animal life because <italic>snt-1 </italic>null mutants are not lethal in <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic>. In <italic>Drosophila </italic>and <italic>Mus </italic>however, <italic>Syt1 </italic>null mutants are indeed lethal as they cannot survive to reproduce as adults. While my previous genomic comparison of <italic>Syt </italic>genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] could have been interpreted as indicating a correlation between increased numbers of <italic>Syt </italic>genes and increased organism complexity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] the analysis here, which is much more comprehensive, definitively rules that conclusion out. This collection of genes offers prospects for fruitful speculation about the functional roles of the <italic>Syt </italic>repertoires of different animals and includes a great range of biological complexity. The conclusions drawn from evolutionary genomics approaches are always provisional, because they depend on the quality of information available (draft or 'complete' genome sequence, availability of transcript information) and are thus subject to review when better information becomes available. Conclusions drawn from reassembled and reannotated genomes will inevitably be more accurate than those drawn from the first draft. The <italic>D. rerio </italic>genome being repeat rich, is taking time to assemble into a complete version. Among the genomes in this collection, the draft <italic>D. rerio </italic>genome ranks first in terms of gene number. <italic>D. rerio </italic>surely presents a useful model system with which to investigate the functional divergence of close paralogues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>Currently, it is the rodent Syt proteins and, with the advent of transgenic mouse studies, their respective genes, which garner most interest and have been best characterised. Work with <italic>Syt </italic>genes in other animal species has provided information supporting hypotheses about how <italic>Syt </italic>genes fulfil their functional roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B94">94</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B95">95</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">97</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B98">98</xref>]. To date, these studies indicate a primary role for <italic>Syt1 </italic>in specifying a neuron specific synaptic vesicle protein which serves to trigger exocytosis. The genomic specification of <italic>Syt1 </italic>expression patterns, has been investigated and utilised in ascidian species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B99">99</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B102">102</xref>]. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the anatomical expression patterns of the mutually exclusive alternative exon variants of Syt1 have been mapped [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B103">103</xref>]. This gene collection shows that such mutually exclusive exon deployment has arisen on a number of occasions in invertebrates, altering C2 domains in Syt1, Syt34 and Esyt2 proteins (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>). The repeated evolution of this type of C2 domain alteration, suggests that careful comparison of the altered forms might prove a useful focus for investigations aimed at understanding how these C2 domains operate as molecular machines. The feature most widely shared among the great diversity of Syt proteins in this collection, is sequence conservation of the C-terminal C2B region, which suggests that a defining function of Syt proteins is located here.</p><p>The regulatory machinery controlling variant expression can be illuminated by comparative analyses of genomic sequences, as was done to investigate the RNA editing of <italic>Syt1 </italic>which occurs in hexapods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B104">104</xref>]. Another comparative analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B105">105</xref>] examining the genomic specification of alternative splicing of <italic>Syt1</italic>, concluded that splice variants expressed in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>C. pipiens</italic>, <italic>B. mori</italic>, <italic>T. castaneum </italic>and <italic>P. humanus </italic>depend on correctly coded intronic, <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory sequences acting on the requisite splice donor/acceptor sequences.

These sequences may aid future efforts to identify the <italic>cis</italic>-sequences involved in transcript processing. The biochemical understanding of transcript production and processing, acquired at great pains over many years [see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]] is not quite up to the task of extracting the full meaning from the flood of new transcript data from high throughput sequencing. An enormous amount of experimental work will need to be done to understand the varied roles of transcripts in complex organisms. The problem of identifying and annotating different kinds of transcript sequences is discussed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B106">106</xref>]. Work to assess the functional significance of alternatively expressed <italic>Syt </italic>genes has barely begun [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B103">103</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B107">107</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B112">112</xref>] so it is difficult at present, to judge the importance of the transcript variants listed in this collection. Evolutionary conservation of variant production, probably argues for functional significance. New developments in mass spectrometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B113">113</xref>] are bound to aid attempts to examine complex mixtures of proteins such as synaptic vesicle preparations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B114">114</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B115">115</xref>].

A single point mutation to inactivate this intron acceptor dinucleotide would be predicted to have devastating consequences for the expression of the host gene.

Community deposition of a variety of types of biological data into appropriate databases, database efforts to curate, update and integrate this data with relevant data in other databases, will if pursued successfully, lead to great progress in biology in the years ahead.
