Rb absence impairs cell cycle exit and triggers death of some neurons, so differentiation defects may well be indirect. Indeed, we show that abnormalities in both differentiation and light-evoked electrophysiological responses in Rb-deficient retinal cells are rescued when ectopic division and apoptosis are blocked specifically by deleting E2f transcription factor (E2f) 1. However, comprehensive cell-type analysis of the rescued double-null retina exposed cell-cycle&#x02013;independent differentiation defects specifically in starburst amacrine cells (SACs), cholinergic interneurons critical in direction selectivity and developmentally important rhythmic bursts. Typically, Rb is thought to block division by repressing E2fs, but to promote differentiation by potentiating tissue-specific factors. Remarkably, however, Rb promotes SAC differentiation by inhibiting E2f3 activity. Two E2f3 isoforms exist, and we find both in the developing retina, although intriguingly they show distinct subcellular distribution. E2f3b is thought to mediate Rb function in quiescent cells. However, in what is to our knowledge the first work to dissect E2f isoform function in vivo we show that Rb promotes SAC differentiation through E2f3a. These data reveal a mechanism through which Rb regulates neural differentiation directly, and, unexpectedly, it involves inhibition of E2f3a, not potentiation of tissue-specific factors.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>The retinoblastoma protein (Rb), an important tumor suppressor, blocks division and death by inhibiting the E2f transcription factor family. In contrast, Rb is thought to promote differentiation by potentiating tissue-specific transcription factors, although differentiation defects in Rb null cells could be an indirect consequence of E2f-driven division and death. Here, we resolve different mechanisms by which Rb controls division, death, and differentiation in the retina. Removing E2f1 rescues aberrant division of differentiating Rb-deficient retinal neurons, as well as death in cells prone to apoptosis, and restores both normal differentiation and function of major cell types, such as photoreceptors. However, Rb-deficient starburst amacrine neurons differentiate abnormally even when E2f1 is removed, providing an unequivocal example of a direct role for Rb in neuronal differentiation. Rather than potentiating a cell-specific factor, Rb promotes starburst cell differentiation by inhibiting another E2f, E2f3a.

This process of RTC &#x0201c;birth&#x0201d; requires coupling of differentiation and cell cycle exit. Once born, post-mitotic RTCs migrate and form different retinal layers. Rods and cones make up the outer nuclear layer (ONL); horizontal, bipolar, and amacrine cells, as well as M&#x000fc;ller glia cell bodies, reside in the inner nuclear layer (INL); and ganglion and displaced amacrine cells form the ganglion cell layer (GCL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050179-g001">Figure 1</xref>A).

Thus, it is controversial whether E2f3 is required for apoptosis of any <italic>Rb</italic> KO cell type.

However, prior work could not exclude the possibility that differentiation defects are simply an indirect consequence of abnormal division and death. If Rb does regulate differentiation directly it is unclear whether it does so in all or a subset of neurons. Moreover, the mechanism has never been solved. In other cell types where Rb may promote differentiation directly, such as muscle and bone, it seems to do so through E2f-independent means by potentiating tissue-specific transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050179-g001">Figure 1</xref>B) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050179-b030">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050179-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. In the retina, others have noted abnormally shaped <italic>Rb</italic> KO rods and have suggested Rb may directly promote their morphogenesis by activating retina-specific factors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050179-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;. However, differentiation defects in any <italic>Rb</italic> KO neuron could be an indirect effect of ectopic division and/or apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050179-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Thus, it is critical to study differentiation of <italic>Rb</italic> KO cells in the absence of ectopic proliferation and death.</p><p>Here, we establish that Rb suppresses RTC division and death by inhibiting E2f1, not E2f2 or E2f3. When these defects were rescued, most retinal neurons, including rods, survived, differentiated, and functioned normally. Thus, unexpectedly, retina-specific differentiation factors function independently of Rb. However, comprehensive assessment of the <italic>Rb</italic>/<italic>E2f1</italic> double-null rescued retina revealed a differentiation defect in cholinergic starburst amacrine cells (SACs). Recent breakthroughs have revealed that these interneurons are critical for direction selectivity and developmentally important rhythmic bursts &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050179-b034">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050179-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. However, their differentiation is poorly understood. Contrary to the prevailing view that Rb promotes differentiation through E2f-independent tissue-specific transcription factors, we show that Rb facilitates SAC development through E2f3. Defects in <italic>Rb</italic> null SACs correlated with specific E2f3 expression in these cells, and E2f3 expression was absent in neurons that differentiated without Rb. E2f3 is also present in a specific subset of other CNS neurons, implying that this may be a general mechanism by which Rb facilitates neurogenesis. To define the mechanism in even more detail, we determined which E2f3 isoform Rb targets to control SAC differentiation. E2f3b mediates Rb function in quiescent fibroblasts &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050179-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;, yet no prior studies to our knowledge have dissected E2f3a or E2f3b functions in vivo. Using an isoform-specific null mouse we show that Rb drives SAC differentiation through E2f3a. Thus, independent of E2f1-mediated effects on division and death, Rb does regulate neuronal differentiation, but only in specific neurons and, unexpectedly, through E2f3a, not tissue-specific differentiation factors.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Rb Regulates Division and Death through E2f1</title><p>We used the <italic>&#x003b1;-Cre</italic> transgene to delete floxed <italic>Rb</italic> exon 19 at embryonic day (E) 10 in peripheral retina &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050179-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>Rb<sup>loxP/loxP</sup>;&#x003b1;-Cre</italic> mice were bred with strains lacking <italic>E2f1</italic> or <italic>E2f2</italic> in the germ line, or a strain carrying a floxed <italic>E2f3</italic> allele &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050179-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>Rb<sup>loxP/loxP</sup>;E2f1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> and <italic>Rb<sup>loxP/loxP</sup>;E2f1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup>;&#x003b1;-Cre</italic> mice were bred to produce <italic>Rb<sup>loxP/loxP</sup>;E2f1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>;&#x003b1;-Cre</italic> mice at a frequency of 1/8 and littermate controls at the same or higher (1/4) frequency.

Separate from its role in driving ectopic division of <italic>Rb</italic> KO RTCs, E2f1 also promotes normal RPC division since in its absence RPC proliferation drops ~2-fold (D. C. and R.

This modest reduction of RPC numbers in the absence of <italic>E2f1</italic> accounts for the slight reduction in the number of ganglion cells at P0, in the number of bipolar cells at P18 or P30, and in the thickness of the ONL at P18 or P30 in the <italic>E2f1</italic> KO and <italic>Rb/E2f1</italic> DKO retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050179-g002">Figure 2</xref>B&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050179-g002">2</xref>D).

The photopic response in <italic>E2f1</italic> KO mice was slightly reduced relative to WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050179-sg005">Figure S5</xref>B), possibly because E2f1 is required for maximal expansion of embryonic RPCs, and the <italic>E2f1</italic> KO retina has, as noted earlier, slightly fewer cells than the WT retina, although cell type proportions are unaffected (D.

Thus, marginally subnormal photopic responses in the <italic>Rb/E2f1</italic> DKO retina can be attributed to both a reduction of cone numbers in <italic>E2f1</italic> KO mice alone, and a &#x0201c;genuine&#x0201d; slight reduction in cone function attributable to <italic>Rb</italic> loss relative to WT. This slight effect may relate to a true differentiation defect in a subset of amacrine cells discussed below.

Camk2a marks both SACs and ganglion cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050179-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;, but because ganglion cells are eliminated in the <italic>Rb</italic> KO retina, Camk2a is a specific SAC marker in this context.

Thus, Rb is not required for SAC survival or for process outgrowth, but rather it seems to regulate the expression and/or stability of Calb2, Calb1, Chat, Slc18a3, Sv2c, Kcnc1b, Kcnc2, and GABA in SACs, but leaves Camk2a expression virtually unaffected. The presence of Chat in some cell bodies but never in processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050179-g003">Figure 3</xref>B) also suggests a transport defect. The developmental pattern of Slc18a3 expression also supported this notion. In mature WT SACs Slc18a3 is only in processes, but in early postnatal SACs, it is found in the cell body, and moves into emerging processes at approximately P4&#x02013;P6.

Early overexpression studies in vitro suggested Rb might temper expansion of cycling cells, but KO studies in vivo indicate that its major role is to block division in terminally differentiating cells.
