However, the post-operative subconjunctival scarring response which blocks filtration efficiency is a major hurdle to the achievement of long-term surgical success. Current application of anti-proliferatives to modulate the scarring response is not ideal as these often give rise to sight-threatening complications. SPARC (<underline>s</underline>ecreted <underline>p</underline>rotein, <underline>a</underline>cidic and <underline>r</underline>ich in <underline>c</underline>ysteine) is a matricellular protein involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) production and organization. In this study, we investigated post-operative surgical wound survival in an experimental glaucoma filtration model in SPARC-null mice. Loss of SPARC resulted in a marked (87.5&#x00025;) surgical wound survival rate compared to 0&#x00025; in wild-type (WT) counterparts. The larger SPARC-null wounds implied that aqueous filtration through the subconjunctival space was more efficient in comparison to WT wounds. The pronounced increase in both surgical survival and filtration efficiency was associated with a less collagenous ECM, smaller collagen fibril diameter, and a loosely-organized subconjunctival matrix in the SPARC-null wounds. In contrast, WT wounds exhibited a densely packed collagenous ECM with no evidence of filtration capacity. Immunolocalization assays confirmed the accumulation of ECM proteins in the WT but not in the SPARC-null wounds. The observations <italic>in vivo</italic> were corroborated by complementary data performed on WT and SPARC-null conjunctival fibroblasts <italic>in vitro</italic>. These findings indicate that depletion of SPARC bestows an inherent change in post-operative ECM remodeling to favor wound maintenance. The evidence presented in this report is strongly supportive for the targeting of SPARC to increase the success of glaucoma filtration surgery.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Glaucoma is the most common cause of irreversible blindness worldwide.

The number of people affected worldwide with glaucoma is predicted to be 79.6 million by 2020, of which over 8 million will suffer from bilateral blindness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009415-Quigley1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is the most important modifiable risk factor for the development and progression of glaucomatous optic neuropathy, which can lead to blindness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009415-The1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Surgery in the form of filtration surgery is considered the most effective method of achieving a consistently desirable low IOP when topical medications are ineffective. This surgery involves the formation of a fistula to maintain blood and aqueous humour flow. A major complication of this surgery, leading to an increased risk of surgical failure and morbidity, is the post-operative wound healing response via obstruction of the fistula by excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009415-Reddick1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. To limit the post-operative scarring response, physicians often employ anti-proliferative agents to improve surgical outcomes. Mitomycin C (MMC) and 5-fluorouracil (5 FU) are currently used to improve surgical outcomes in glaucoma filtration surgery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009415-The2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009415-Skuta1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

Therefore, the quest to find an alternative, safe, effective, and targeted anti-fibrotic is ongoing.</p><p>SPARC (<underline>s</underline>ecreted <underline>p</underline>rotein, <underline>a</underline>cidic and <underline>r</underline>ich in <underline>c</underline>ysteine), also known as osteonectin and BM-40, is a 32 kDa calcium-binding matricellular protein that modulates cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions without contributing structurally to the ECM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009415-Brekken1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009415-Bornstein1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. There is a strong association between elevated expression of SPARC and tissue scarring and fibrosis.

Conversely, the SPARC-null (SPARC&#x02212;/&#x02212;) mouse exhibited diminished bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009415-Strandjord1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> in addition to other characteristics indicative of a compromised maturation and assembly of the ECM. These reports strongly implicate SPARC as a protein involved in tissue remodeling and repair via modulation of ECM organization. However, the targeting of SPARC to reduce not only fibrosis but, more importantly, to preserve wound function that is surgically induced to alleviate a disease condition, has not been described.</p><p>In the present study, we show <italic>in vitro</italic> that SPARC&#x02212;/&#x02212; conjunctival fibroblasts do not respond to TGF-&#x003b2;2 via increased expression of ECM proteins. Moreover, SPARC&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells display lower MMP-2 activity that corresponds to a reduction in the rate of collagen gel contraction. We further demonstrate <italic>in vivo</italic>, by the use of a murine model of glaucoma filtration surgery, that SPARC deficiency can maintain the surgically-induced wound for a longer period of time compared to WT. Specifically, at 14 days post-surgery, 87.5&#x00025; of the operated SPARC&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice retained the blebs compared to 0&#x00025; of the operated WT mice. We conclude that this observed phenomenon is due to an altered ECM composition in the SPARC&#x02212;/&#x02212; wounds which contained less collagen I relative to the WT counterparts. We have therefore provided evidence for the first time of a novel role for SPARC depletion as a promising effective therapeutic method for preservation of wound filtering function in glaucoma filtration surgery.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cell Culture</title><p>SPARC-null (SPARC&#x02212;/&#x02212;) mice and their corresponding WT counterparts (C57Bl6/J) have been described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009415-Bradshaw1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

To evaluate the response of SPARC&#x02212;/&#x02212; conjunctival fibroblasts to TGF-&#x003b2;2, we examined the expressions of collagen I and fibronectin. The effect of SPARC depletion on the synthesis of collagen I was striking. First, SPARC&#x02212;/&#x02212; fibroblasts appeared intrinsically to produce 1.6-fold lower levels of collagen I in comparison to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009415-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Second, collagen I was not enhanced by TGF-&#x003b2;2 in the SPARC&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells, whereas WT conjunctival fibroblasts exhibited a 1.3-fold spike in collagen I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009415-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Similarly, TGF-&#x003b2;2 induced a markedly enhanced production of fibronectin by WT cells (1.5-fold, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009415-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).

We therefore examined the activity of MMPs secreted by the mouse fibroblasts seeded in the contracted collagen matrices. Conditioned media were collected from the contracted matrices on day 5 and evaluated by gelatin zymography. Bands of proteolytic activity corresponding to MMP-9 and to pro- and active MMP-2 were detected in all samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009415-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The level of active MMP-2 in the conditioned media from the SPARC&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells was reduced in comparison to that from the WT cells, in stark contrast to the level of MMP-9 activity, which was not obviously different between the two cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009415-g002">Figure 2B, left panel</xref>). Hence, the inhibitory effect of SPARC depletion on MMP activity appears to be selective for MMP-2.

We observed that the thinner conjunctiva in the SPARC&#x02212;/&#x02212; mouse was associated with a corresponding thinner collagen layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009415-g006">Figure 6D, iii</xref>), whilst the thicker WT conjunctiva contained densely staining collagen fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009415-g006">Figure 6D, i</xref>). At the 14 day-old wound site, the WT conjunctiva appeared to be densely compacted with thick, well-aligned collagen fibers resembling a scar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009415-g006">Figure 6D, ii</xref>). This arrangement contrasted distinctly with the mechanically efficient basketweave meshwork of collagen in normal conjunctiva (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009415-g006">Figure 6D, i</xref>). On the other hand, the day-14 bleb in the SPARC&#x02212;/&#x02212; eyes contained thin, loosely assembled collagen fibers in an expanded non-collagenous subconjunctival space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009415-g006">Figure 6D</xref>, iv). Ultrastructural analysis confirmed that the unoperated WT conjunctiva consisted of tightly-packed collagen fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009415-g006">Figure 6E, i</xref>) that accumulated with the absence of conspicuous gaps between fibers after surgical wounding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009415-g006">Figure 6E, ii</xref>). In contrast, the unwounded SPARC&#x02212;/&#x02212; conjunctiva featured loosely-organized fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009415-g006">Figure 6E, iii</xref>) that were interspersed with areas of loose connective tissue in the bleb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009415-g006">Figure 6E, iv</xref>). Measurement of the collagen fibrils indicated that the WT conjunctiva contained thicker collagen fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009415-g006">Figure 6E, i, inset</xref>), with a mean fibril diameter of 122.72&#x000b1;29.33 nm, in comparison to SPARC&#x02212;/&#x02212; conjunctiva, which contained two-fold thinner collagen fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009415-g006">Figure 6E, iii, inset</xref>) with a mean diameter of 59.50&#x000b1;9.34 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009415-g006">Figure 6F</xref>). Thus, it appears that the prolonged bleb survival in the SPARC&#x02212;/&#x02212; eyes is related, at least in part, to the deposition of thinner, fewer, and more loosely-organized collagen fibrils. Conversely, the apparently flattened wounds in the WT eyes that consisted of dense, parallel bundles of collagen fibrils is reminiscent of scar formation and is likely to be the cause of fistula obstruction with impediment of aqueous outflow leading to bleb failure.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Expression of ECM Components Is Generally Suppressed in SPARC&#x02212;/&#x02212; Wounds</title><p>To identify ECM components in the wounds, we performed immunofluorescence on normal and wounded mouse conjunctiva.

Furthermore, we describe here for the first time a murine model of experimental glaucoma filtration surgery. This model illustrates that SPARC plays a pivotal role in ECM organization that is crucial to the maintenance and function of surgically-induced fistula. Beyond its potential application for the evaluation of new therapeutics for glaucoma filtration surgery, this model could be important for the evaluation of post-operative wound healing, with two advantages: (i) the eye is accessible to experimental surgery or application of therapeutics, and (ii), the post-surgical outcome can be easily observed and readily quantified by a variety of available, well-established, and independent imaging techniques, all of which are currently used in the clinical setting such that data generated <italic>in vivo</italic> can be directly compared with those in humans.</p><p>Our model has validated previous concepts of wound closure and supports the hypothesis that the primary mechanism of wound closure occurs via connective tissue matrix deposition, that is, by newly-synthesized collagen and other ECM and matricellular proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009415-Diegelmann1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, the surgical effect of the model in WT eyes reflected the predicted post-surgical outcome of glaucoma filtration surgery in the absence of anti-proliferative agents. Indeed, bleb failure from wound obstruction in glaucoma filtration surgery has been attributed mainly to the accumulation of collagen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009415-Esson1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, an effect that is demonstrated in our model.</p><p>We have shown in the current study that bleb failure on WT eyes occurred most likely as a result of aqueous outflow obstruction from excessive deposition and organization of ECM in the subconjunctival space. Moreover, the organization of the collagen I fibrils appeared to be mechanically inefficient and likely to contribute further to bleb failure. Hence, our findings support the notion that bleb failure in the WT mice is a result of a massive induction and disorganized deposition of collagenous ECM.</p><p>In contrast, the SPARC&#x02212;/&#x02212; wound which appeared &#x0201c;open&#x0201d; and filtering, was associated with a reduction in collagen I fibers that were assembled as a loose stromal network in the subconjunctival space. The smaller collagen fibril diameters in the SPARC&#x02212;/&#x02212; conjunctiva are also likely to contribute to the &#x0201c;open&#x0201d; wound phenotype. This notion is supported by previous observations in SPARC&#x02212;/&#x02212; skin, in which collagen fibril diameters were also reported to be smaller <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009415-Bradshaw1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009415-Rentz1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, a deficiency that likely contributes to the delayed cutaneous healing observed in another study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009415-Basu1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, altered collagen assembly in SPARC&#x02212;/&#x02212; wounds has been correlated with less efficient wound healing in myocardial infarcts, a condition leading to increased incidences of cardiac rupture and failure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009415-Schellings1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Our complementary experiments <italic>in vitro</italic> verified that, in the absence of SPARC, TGF-&#x003b2;2-induced collagen I mRNA was attenuated. Therefore, bleb survival in the SPARC&#x02212;/&#x02212; eye can be attributed, at least in part, to diminished collagen I deposition due to a lack of response to TGF-&#x003b2;2 upon wounding.</p><p>Several mechanisms have been put forward to explain the reduced expression of collagen I in SPARC&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells. One idea is the requirement for SPARC in the post-translational processing of collagen, where it acts as a molecular chaperone to ensure its stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009415-Martinek1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, SPARC has been shown to regulate procollagen I processing and collagen fibrillogenesis in skin fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009415-Rentz1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. This activity could account for collagen stability at the post-translational level and perhaps even for the altered assembly of collagen fibril units in the absence of SPARC. Given our finding that collagen I mRNA levels were perturbed in the SPARC&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells, we propose that other mechanism(s) must also be invoked. One possibility is the function of SPARC in the regulation of signaling pathways affecting collagen I expression. Both platelet-derived growth factor and fibroblast growth factor-2 modulate collagen I expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009415-Ramirez1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009415-Ko1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, and SPARC is known to affect the activities of these growth factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009415-Brekken1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The canonical TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathway involving Smads <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009415-Shi1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref> is known to be involved in the regulation of collagen and fibronectin mRNA transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009415-Ramirez1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009415-Itoh1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Our observation that SPARC&#x02212;/&#x02212; conjunctival fibroblasts failed to increase collagen I expression upon the addition of exogenous TGF-&#x003b2;2 <italic>in vitro</italic> indicates a central involvement of SPARC in the TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathway. Indeed, expression of TGF-&#x003b2; and SPARC has been shown to be regulated in a reciprocal fashion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009415-Schiemann1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. The sustained ability of SPARC&#x02212;/&#x02212; to respond to TGF-&#x003b2;2 by inducing &#x003b1;-SMA mRNA <italic>in vitro</italic>, points to a role for SPARC in selectively regulating the intracellular canonical TGF-&#x003b2;-induced signaling pathway(s) involved in collagen I and fibronectin expressions in conjunctival fibroblasts.</p><p>SPARC is a crucial player in collagen regulation since we found the inhibitory effect of SPARC deficiency on collagen expression was consistently observed in both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments. This was not so for fibronectin, where we observed an enhancement of expression in the SPARC&#x02212;/&#x02212; wounds <italic>in vivo</italic>, in apparent contradiction to the <italic>in vitro</italic> failure to upregulate its expression in response to TGF-&#x003b2;2. This suggests that the <italic>in vivo</italic> upregulation of fibronectin is a wound response unrelated to TGF-&#x003b2;2 induction. Our observation may also be a reflection of the diverse regulatory pathways involved in regulating fibronectin deposition where SPARC may be dispensible. For instance, fibronectin may be deposited in the wound ECM from the systemic plasma pool <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009415-Moretti1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that inhibition of collagen I deposition in response to conjunctival injury is sufficient to delay or inhibit wound closure.</p><p>That SPARC has been shown to regulate MMP activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009415-McClung1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref> supports our data showing that the lack of SPARC is associated with a reduction in MMP-2 activity, concomitant with a decrease in MT1-MMP expression in conjunctival SPARC&#x02212;/&#x02212; fibroblasts seeded in the 3D collagen gels. MMPs are known to play critical roles in mediating ECM contraction via its degradation to facilitate the migration of cells and remodel new ECM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009415-Sato1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009415-Seltzer1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009415-Deryugina1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, less MMP activity in SPARC&#x02212;/&#x02212; fibroblasts is likely to be a primary cause for the slower rate of collagen gel contraction that we observed in this study. Since contraction enhances wound closure, a slower rate of contraction in the absence of SPARC would in turn delay closure. Moreover, MMP-2 is known to regulate cell migration and angiogenesis, both of which contribute to the development of fibrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009415-Wynn1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence, reduced MMP-2 expression and activity are likely to help preserve SPARC&#x02212;/&#x02212; wound functionality by a delay in wound contraction and inhibition of fibrotic wound healing.</p><p>In conclusion, this is the first study demonstrating that SPARC plays a pivotal role in post-operative subconjunctival scarring and that its loss can preserve the presence of a filtering bleb. Inhibition of SPARC expression should be considered as a therapeutic tool to improve glaucoma filtration surgical outcome. Our future work involves employing the gene silencing technology through the application of SPARC-targeting small interfering RNA (siRNA) to reduce SPARC expression in the surgical wound. We believe that this method will be more effective than using SPARC neutralizing antibodies since our data suggests that the mode of action of SPARC is intracellular rather than extracellular, at least where interruption with TGF-&#x003b2;2-mediated induction of ECM production is concerned. SPARC is probably not involved in regulating the availability of secreted TGF-&#x003b2;2 to its receptors as was suggested previously for TGF-&#x003b2;1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009415-Schiemann1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref> since that would result in a curtailment of all TGF-&#x003b2;2 signaling in SPARC&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells. The selective inhibition of TGF-&#x003b2;2-induced expression of collagen I and fibronectin but not &#x003b1;-SMA implies that SPARC affects TGF-&#x003b2;2 signaling intracellularly and that diverging pathways are involved in the regulation of collagen I and fibronectin expressions versus &#x003b1;-SMA expression. Hence, future work involves the development of effective SPARC siRNA(s) as well as efficient delivery systems for it so as to improve the survival of the filtering bleb without the need for anti-proliferatives in glaucoma filtration surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0009415.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Primers used with real-time PCR.</p><p>(0.02 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0009415.s001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Sia Wey Yeo (Singapore Eye Research Institute) for assistance with the mouse model.
