Our previous work has demonstrated S-phase kinase-associated protein-2 (Skp2), an F-box subunit of SCF<sup>Skp2</sup> ubiquitin ligase, as an important mediator and common final pathway for growth factors, extracellular matrices, and cyclic-nucleotides to regulate VSMC proliferation in vitro. However, whether alteration of Skp2 function also regulates VSMC proliferation in vivo and neointimal thickening postvascular injury remains unclear.

Secondly, to further identify a local rather than a systemic effect of Skp2 alteration, we demonstrated that adenovirus-mediated expression of dominant-negative Skp2 in the balloon-injured rat carotid artery significantly increased medial p27<sup>Kip1</sup> levels, inhibited VSMC proliferation, and the subsequent neointimal thickening. Lastly, to determine if Skp2 alone is sufficient to drive VSMC proliferation and lesion development in vivo, we demonstrated that adenovirus-delivery of wild-type Skp2 to the minimally-injured rat carotids is sufficient to downregulate p27<sup>Kip1</sup> protein levels, enhanced medial VSMC proliferation, and the neointimal thickening.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This data provides, we believe for the first time, a more comprehensive understanding of Skp2 in the regulation of VSMC proliferation and neointimal formation and suggests that Skp2 is a promising target in the treatment of vasculoproliferative diseases.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="editor"><title>Clinical Relevance</title><p>This manuscript describes our latest work investigating the role of the Skp2, an F-box protein component of the SCF<sup>skp2</sup> ubiquitin-ligase, in promoting VSMC proliferation, and neointima formation in response to vascular injury in vivo. Our previous work has identified a major role for Skp2 as a key target for numerous positive and negative growth regulatory signals in vitro. These signals converge to regulate the expression of Skp2, which then controls cell-cycle progression by promoting degradation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p27<sup>Kip1</sup>. Until now, there has been no data in the literature on the role played by Skp2 in the regulation of VSMC proliferation and neointima formation in vivo. Our current manuscript describes, we believe for the first time, the important role played by Skp2 in these processes, using both mouse and rat arterial injury models. This is important because proliferation of VSMCs underlies the development of postangioplasty or post-stenting restenosis, venous graft failure, and transplant arteriosclerosis. Our work demonstrates for the first time that Skp2 is a major regulator of VSMC proliferation and neointimal thickening in vivo in response to vascular injury and highlights Skp2 as a potential target for future strategies designed to combat vasculoproliferative diseases.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation is rare in normal adult arteries but increases during atherosclerosis. The resulting fibrous cap is vital in protecting the plaque from rupture and subsequent myocardial infarction. On the other hand, excessive VSMC proliferation underlies the development of postangioplasty or post-stenting restenosis, venous graft failure, and transplant arteriosclerosis. Tight regulation of VSMC proliferation is therefore essential. Although a myriad of factors are able to regulate VSMC proliferation, cell-cycle activation is the final common pathway,<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> and targeting cell-cycle regulation has emerged as a promising strategy in the treatment of vasculoproliferative diseases.</p><p>Progression through the G1 phase of the cell-cycle is regulated by phosphorylation and inactivation of retinoblastoma (Rb) proteins. This is promoted by the cyclins (cyclin A, D, and E), which associate with and activate the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6). These CDK:cyclin complexes are subject to negative regulation by the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs), such as the Cip/Kip family of CDKIs (p21<sup>Cip1</sup>, p27<sup>Kip1</sup>, and p57<sup>Kip2</sup>). Downregulation of CDKIs during late G1 after addition of growth factors in vitro or balloon injury in vivo is a critical step in allowing activation of cyclin:CDK complexes and subsequent G1/S phase transition.<xref rid="bib2 bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2,3</sup></xref> Skp2 is an F-box component of SCF<sup>Skp2</sup> ubiquitin ligase, implicated in the polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of many cell-cycle regulators,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> including p27<sup>Kip1</sup>.<xref rid="bib5 bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5,6</sup></xref> Although many cell-cycle proteins are potential substrates of Skp2, p27<sup>Kip1</sup> is considered most important,<xref rid="bib7 bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7,8</sup></xref> because it accumulates in Skp2-null cells and the phenotypic and histologic abnormalities in Skp2-null mice are almost completely reversed in Skp2/p27<sup>Kip1</sup> doubly-null mice.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref></p><p>Increased Skp2 expression along with the related p27<sup>Kip1</sup> deregulation has been deemed a marker of poor prognosis in cancer disease.<xref rid="bib9 bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9,10</sup></xref> However, the role of Skp2 in vascular disease is less well established.

Impaired lesion formation in these mice is consistent with previous reports of reduced rates of cellular proliferation.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> It is important to note that impaired lesion formation in Skp2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice could be explained in part by actions of Skp2 in other cells, such as bone marrow progenitor cells, inflammatory cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells, all of which may interact with VSMC and contribute significantly to the final neointimal thickening.<xref rid="bib29 bib30 bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29-31</sup></xref> To more specifically pinpoint the effects of Skp2 inhibition on local VSMC and neointimal thickening, DN-Skp2 was expressed in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries via adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. The expression of DN-Skp2 resulted in elevated levels of the CDKI p27<sup>Kip1</sup>, which is normally rapidly downregulated soon after vascular injury.<xref rid="bib32 bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32,33</sup></xref> These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that injury-induced expression of Skp2 is responsible for the downregulation of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> after vascular injury. Downregulation of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> is thought to be an important step in removing the brake on proliferation, because forced expression of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> inhibits S-phase entry and neointima formation after balloon injury<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> and p27<sup>Kip1</sup>-null mice display a hyper-proliferative phenotype and exaggerated responses to vascular injury. We showed here that expression of DN-Skp2 prevented downregulation of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> and resulted in significantly reduced levels of hyperphosphorylated Rb protein, a marker of G1-S transition, reduced rates of VSMC proliferation and smaller neointimal lesions. Expression of DN-Skp2 did not, however, significantly effect the expression of p21<sup>Cip1</sup>, even though our previous data demonstrated that Skp2 regulates p21<sup>Cip1</sup> levels in VSMC in vitro.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> However, p21<sup>Cip1</sup> regulation seems to be more complicated than that of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> in these cells. The p21<sup>Cip1</sup> levels actually increase in response to mitogen stimulation, coordinately with increases in Skp2, which functions to maintain p21<sup>Cip1</sup> within growth permissive levels.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> This complex pattern of regulation may account for the lack of a significant change in p21<sup>Cip1</sup> in this study. Importantly, apoptosis rates were not increased in vessels expressing DN-Skp2, indicating that reduced lesion formation was due to inhibition of proliferation rather than increased cell death. Likewise, expression of DN-Skp2 in VSMC in vitro does not result in increased rate of apoptosis (unpublished data). Taken together with our observations from Skp2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, our data demonstrates that injury-induced expression of Skp2 is a major mechanism regulating p27<sup>Kip1</sup> levels and is essential for VSMC proliferation and the final neointimal thickening.</p><p>We previously demonstrated that exogenous expression of Skp2 is able to force VSMC to enter S-phase in the uninjured rat aorta in organ cultures.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> In the present study, we asked whether increased Skp2 expression would be sufficient to induce VSMC proliferation and neointimal lesion development, in the absence of major medial injury in vivo. Consistent with previous reports,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> we showed that filament de-endothelialization of rat carotid artery caused minimal levels of VSMC proliferation and neointimal thickening, and only a small increase in Skp2 expression. However, forced expression of wild-type Skp2 resulted in a remarkable reduction of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> expression and a transmedial increase of BrdU-labeled cells. This demonstrates that Skp2 alone is sufficient to promote p27<sup>Kip1</sup> downregulation and VSMC proliferation in the absence of major medial injury.</p><p>Taken together, our data provides the first direct and robust evidence that Skp2 plays an important role in promoting VSMC proliferation and neointimal thickening in vivo in response to vascular injury. These results suggest that Skp2 may represent an attractive target for future gene or pharmacologic-based therapies to combat vasculoproliferative diseases. Targeting Skp2 in this way may be more effective than approaches designed to block the activity of single downstream cell-cycle regulators, such as p27<sup>Kip1</sup>, because Skp2 regulates the levels and activity of multiple cell-cycle proteins. However, more work is required to elucidate the role and regulation of Skp2 in other vascular cells, particularly endothelial cells, before this may become a reality.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Author contributions</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>Conception and design: MB, AN</p></list-item><list-item><p>Analysis and interpretation: YW, MB</p></list-item><list-item><p>Data collection: YW, GS, KS, KIN, KN, HY, MB</p></list-item><list-item><p>Writing the article: YW, AN, MB</p></list-item><list-item><p>Critical revision of the article: YW, MB</p></list-item><list-item><p>Final approval of the article: MB</p></list-item><list-item><p>Statistical analysis: YW, MB</p></list-item><list-item><p>Obtained funding: MB, AN</p></list-item><list-item><p>Overall responsibility: MB</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Appendix</title><p><italic>Additional material for this article may be found online at</italic><ext-link xlink:href="http://www.jvascsurg.org" ext-link-type="uri"><italic>www.jvascsurg.org</italic></ext-link>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec7"><title>Supplementary data</title><p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="mmc1"><caption><title>Fig E1, online only</title></caption><p>TUNEL analysis of apoptosis in Ad:&#x003b2;Gal and Ad:DN-Skp2 infected rat carotid arteries.
