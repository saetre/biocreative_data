Specifically, HDAC proteins remove the acetyl group of acetyl-lysine residues on histones, which can result in nucleosomal remodelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Due to their governing role in gene expression, HDAC proteins are associated with a variety of cellular events, including cell cycle regulation, cell proliferation, differentiation and cancer development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In fact, HDAC inhibitors reduce tumour growth in various human tissues, including lung, stomach, breast, and prostrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. As a result, small molecule inhibitors of HDAC enzymatic activity are currently being exploited as potential cancer drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The study of HDAC proteins in cancer is complicated by the identification of eleven human HDAC proteins that are sensitive to small molecule inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Although it is unclear which of the eleven HDAC proteins is involved in cancer formation, the activity of HDAC1 has been linked to cell proliferation, a hallmark of cancer. Particularly, mammalian cells with knock down of HDAC1 expression using siRNA were antiproliferative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. While the knock out mouse of HDAC1 was embryonic lethal, the resulting stem cells displayed altered cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Mouse cells overexpressing HDAC1 demonstrated a lengthening of G<sub>2 </sub>and M phases and reduced growth rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Therefore, the reported data implicate HDAC1 in cell cycle regulation and cell proliferation.</p><p>To further elucidate HDAC1 function <italic>in vivo</italic>, HDAC1 associated proteins have been characterized by biochemical purification. HDAC1 exists in at least three distinct biochemical complexes. The NuRD complex includes a core complex comprised of HDAC1, HDAC2, retinoblastoma associated protein 46 (RbAp46), RbAp48, as well as Mi2, methyl CpG binding domain 3 (MBD3) and metastasis associated protein 2 (MTA2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The fact that the NuRD complex contains MTA2, which is associated with cancer metastasis, provides further evidence that HDAC1 may play a role in cancer development. The Sin3 complex comprises the core complex as well as mSin3, Sin3 associated protein 18 (SAP18), SAP30, and SDS3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Finally, the CoREST complex is less well characterized and contains HDAC1, HDAC2, CoREST, and p110 (KIAA0601) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The presence of associated proteins promotes the enzymatic activity of HDAC1. Specifically, coexpression of MTA2 of the NuRD complex with the core HDAC1-containing complex resulted in augmented deacetylase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Most recently, knockdown of SDS3 of the Sin3 complex resulted in reduced deacetylase activity of HDAC1 immunoprecipitates in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>HDAC1 protein association and activity are also promoted by phosphorylation. HDAC1 is phosphorylated at S421 and S423 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], although additional phosphorylated sites are also possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Single or double mutation of S421 and S423 disrupted HDAC1 interactions with members of the Sin3, NuRD, and CoREST complexes, including RbAp46, mSin3A, MTA2, and CoREST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In addition, single or double mutation of S421 and S423 reduced deacetylase activity. While single or double mutants of HDAC1 appear functionally similar, the evidence suggests that HDAC1 is phosphorylated at both S421 and S423 <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Additional experiments are necessary to reveal the functional significance of double phosphorylation of HDAC1.</p><p>To explore the role of phosphorylation in promoting HDAC1 activity and protein association, we have performed a limited trypsin proteolysis of HDAC1. Because the conformation and/or protein associations of HDAC1 are likely related to proteolysis sensitivity, we hypothesized that concentration-dependent trypsin digestion will change as a function of phosphorylation state. We found that HDAC1 mutants lacking phosphorylation at both S421 and S423 displayed different proteolysis sensitivities than wild type HDAC1. Interestingly, HDAC1 mutants lacking only one phosphorylated residue displayed proteolysis sensitivities similar to wild type HDAC1. The limited proteolysis study suggests that phosphorylation of S421 and S423 individually contribute to HDAC1 function.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Limited trypsin digestion of endogenous HDAC1</title><p>As a first step towards characterizing the protease sensitivity of HDAC1, endogenous HDAC1 from human Jurkat cells was immunoprecipitated and incubated with increasing concentrations of trypsin (0.000625-0.01 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;L). The trypsin digestion products were separated using SDS-PAGE and HDAC1 was visualized using an anti-HDAC1 antibody recognizing the C-terminus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). For clarity, the lowest concentration of trypsin (0.000625 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;L) is indicated as 1X and, accordingly, the highest concentration (0.01 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;L) as 16X. A trypsin concentration of 80X (0.5 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;L) was also used to digest HDAC1 completely, as a positive control. Endogenous HDAC1 showed concentration-dependent cleavage by trypsin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The concentration of trypsin required to degrade roughly half of the full-length protein was 4X (0.0025 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;L). Interestingly, western blot analysis did not show a protease fragmentation pattern with endogenous HDAC1; only full length HDAC1 was observed with all concentrations of trypsin. Because the HDAC1 antibody only recognizes the C-terminus of the protein, we also analyzed the reactions products by silver staining. Again, no protein fragments associated with HDAC1 degradation were observed (data not shown). Additional conditions including varying temperatures (4&#x000b0;C and 25&#x000b0;C) and varying reaction times (10 seconds to 30 minutes) were tested with only full length HDAC1 observed (data not shown). The results suggest that HDAC1 is digested by trypsin to short peptide fragments, which are not identifiable by gel methods.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Limited proteolysis of endogenous and transiently expressed HDAC1</bold>.

Immunoprecipitated HDAC1-F was treated with increasing concentrations of trypsin, as described for endogenous HDAC1. Like endogenous HDAC1, roughly half of the protein was degraded with 4X concentration of trypsin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Therefore, the data revealed that HDAC1-F demonstrated similar concentration-dependent cleavage by trypsin as endogenous HDAC1.</p><p>To allow a more rigorous comparison of the concentration-dependent cleavage, the amount of full-length protein present after incubation with each concentration of trypsin was quantified and compared to the amount of protein present in the absence of trypsin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Consistent with visual observations, 44 &#x000b1; 14% of endogenous HDAC1 and 42 &#x000b1; 9.3% of expressed HDAC1-F remained in the presence of 4X trypsin [see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">Additional File 2</xref>]. The quantitative analysis reinforces the conclusion that endogenous HDAC1 and expressed HDAC1-F display similar concentration-dependent degradation by trypsin.</p><p>Like with endogenous HDAC1, no proteolytic fragments of HDAC1-F were observed in these studies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), consistent with the production of small peptides upon degradation. To corroborate the possibility that complete HDAC1 degradation occurs with proteolysis, we assessed the enzymatic activity of HDAC1 after incubation with increasing concentrations of trypsin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Like the proteolysis experiments, HDAC1 enzymatic activity was reduced in a trypsin concentration-dependent manner. The linear relationship between trypsin proteolysis and enzymatic activity (see inset in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>) is consistent with the scenario that HDAC1 degrades to small peptide fragments in the presence of trypsin.</p></sec><sec><title>Limited trypsin digests of HDAC1 phosphorylation site double mutants</title><p>To probe the influence of HDAC1 phosphorylation on trypsin sensitivities, two HDAC1 mutants with disrupted phosphorylation at S421 and S423 were tested- the HDAC1 S421A/S423A double mutant lacks the serine hydroxyl groups that are phosphorylated and the HDAC1 E424A/E426A double mutant lacks the CK2 recognition sequence required for phosphorylation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Previous work showed that the HDAC1 S421A/S423A and HDAC1 E424A/E426A mutants behave similarly; both mutants are unable to interact with RbAp48, Sin3A, MTA2, and CoREST and are catalytically inactive, demonstrating 22.9 &#x000b1; 3.1 % and 30.9 &#x000b1; 1.6 % of wild type activity, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Transiently expressed HDAC1 S421A/S423A and HDAC1 E424A/E426A mutants were incubated with increasing concentrations of trypsin, as described for the HDAC1-F (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).

Crystallography of human HDAC8 and two HDAC homologs from bacteria (HDLP and HDAH) have implicated a metal ion along with two conserved histidines in HDAC catalytic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].

Although the H141A mutant is catalytically inactive, it maintains full binding to RbAp48 and mSin3. To determine if trypsin sensitivities are altered by catalytic amino acid mutation, we tested the concentration-dependent trypsin digestion of the HDAC1 H141A mutant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>).

NMR, CD, or crystallographic characterization have been challenging due to the low quantities and contamination with associated proteins typical of mammalian cell-derived HDAC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In addition, most HDAC proteins, including HDAC1, cannot be isolated in active form from bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Unlike other methods, limited proteolysis assays allow analysis of HDAC1 from mammalian sources because low concentrations and the presence of associated proteins are tolerated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In addition, HDAC1 isolated from mammalian cells can be probed in its natural state <italic>in vivo</italic>, including its various states of post-translational modification and activity. Limited proteolysis has been used previously to distinguish structurally accessible from inaccessible conformations of proteins, revealing function domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], and to assess protein stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Despite the utility of the method, no report to date has explored the limited proteolysis of HDAC1.</p><p>We sought to investigate limited proteolysis as a means of characterizing HDAC1 structure. As a first step, we performed digestions with increasing concentrations of trypsin using HDAC1 isolated from human Jurkat cells. While HDAC1 was degraded by trypsin, no evidence of distinct fragments was detected under any reaction conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Presumably, HDAC1 degraded to small peptides undetectable by gel electrophoresis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Because HDAC1 degraded without production of discrete fragments, the data suggest that the HDAC1 structure lacks distinct domains of protease-resistance. Rather, the data are consistent with a model where HDAC1 comprises inter-related regions that cooperate to maintain overall structure and function. This model is corroborated by previous work documenting the temperature sensitivity of HDAC1 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies with human SIRT3 and maize Zm-Hda1 demonstrated that post-translational proteolysis gave rise to enzymatically active forms of the proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Because HDAC1 proteolysis by trypsin did not produce discrete fragments, the results suggest that HDAC1 is not subjected to the same proteolytic processing as SIRT3 and Zm-Hda1. However, it is possible that alternative proteases are required for HDAC1 proteolysis <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Because no discrete protease fragments were detected with HDAC1, we focused the studies on analyzing the concentration-dependent degradation of HDAC1 by trypsin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Since HDAC1 phosphorylation promotes HDAC1 enzymatic activity and protein associations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], we studied HDAC1 mutants lacking phosphorylation sites. We hypothesized that unphosphorylated HDAC1 mutants would give different concentration-dependent degradation than wild-type HDAC1 if interaction with associated proteins or enzymatic inactivity govern proteolysis susceptibility. We found that HDAC1 phosphorylation site mutants were significantly more sensitive to trypsin digestion compared to wild type HDAC1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), suggesting that HDAC1 trypsin sensitivity correlates with the interaction with associated proteins, enzymatic activity, or both.</p><p>To decipher whether sensitivity to trypsin correlates with HDAC1 enzymatic activity and/or protein association, we performed trypsin digestion experiments with a variety of single point mutants- S421A, S423A, E424A, E426A, and H141A. Because each of the single point mutants has a differing enzymatic activity and propensity to interact with associated protein, the combined data was expected to reveal the factors governing trypsin sensitivities. Multiple experiments indicate that the trypsin sensitivity of HDAC1 is not correlated with enzymatic activity. While all single point mutants are less active than wild-type HDAC1, they all demonstrated similar trypsin digestion to wild-type HDAC1. Most significantly, the HDAC1 H141A mutant is inactive due to mutation of a catalytic histidine, yet it displays identical trypsin digestion compared to wild-type HDAC1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Therefore, the data suggest that the heightened susceptibility of the HDAC1 S421A/S423A mutant to trypsin digestion does not correlate with enzymatic inactivity.</p><p>The experiments with the single point mutants are also helpful in illuminating the role of protein association in governing trypsin digestion susceptibilities. Unlike wild type HDAC1, all of the phosphorylation site single point mutants have reduced ability to interact with RbAp48, mSin3, MTA2, and CoREST. Consequently, if associations with RbAp48, mSin3, MTA2, and CoREST dictate trypsin susceptibility, the expectation was that the wild type and single point mutants would display significantly different sensitivities to trypsin. The data indicated that the single point mutants displayed trypsin sensitivities similar to wild type HDAC1-F, with only a modest difference with 1X concentration of trypsin. While differences in trypsin sensitivities at 1X concentration may result from association with RbAp48, mSin3, MTA2, and CoREST, the data indicate that vulnerability to trypsin digestion is independent of RbAp48, mSin3, MTA2, and CoREST at high concentrations of trypsin.</p><p>Previous work found that binding with Sin3, RbAp48, MTA2, and CoREST was lost whether HDAC1 was singly or doubly mutated at S421 and S423, conjuring the possibility that phosphorylation at either site is functionally redundant <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. If singly and doubly phosphorylated HDAC1 proteins are functionally indistinguishable, the expectation was that their trypsin sensitivities would be similar as well. The data indicated that the single and double phosphorylation site mutants demonstrated significant differences in proteolysis sensitivities at all trypsin concentration tested. The fact that the single and double point mutants differ in their protease susceptibilities suggests a model where each phosphorylation event individually contributes to HDAC1 activity. Because HDAC1 associates <italic>in vivo </italic>with multiple proteins, it is attractive to hypothesize that unphosphorylated HDAC (double mutant) is distinguished from singly phosphorylated HDAC1 via differing protein interactions. For example, in addition to interaction with proteins in the Sin3, NuRD, and CoREST complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], HDAC1 directly interacts with transcription factors, such as retinoblastoma protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], estrogen receptor alpha [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], and Sp1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. While additional studies are necessary to unambiguously identify the phosphorylation-dependent events that correlate with proteolysis susceptibility, the limited proteolysis studies provide evidence that singly phosphorylated HDAC1 is distinguishable from unphosphorylated HDAC1.</p><p>The limited proteolysis provides a secondary assay to confirm that mutagenesis does not result in the global instability and unfolding of the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. For example, the limited proteolysis demonstrated that HDAC1 S421A and HDAC1 S423A maintain similar sensitivities to proteolysis compared to wild type HDAC1 even though they are catalytically inactive and unable to interact with associated proteins. Therefore, limited proteolysis analysis provides a general assay for assessing HDAC1 protein stability.</p><p>Previous work showed that phosphorylation at S421 and S423 promotes the full enzymatic activity and protein associations of HDAC1. Explaining these results, two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses were proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. The first hypothesis suggests that phosphorylation at S421 and S423 causes a conformational change, which promotes protein association and augments enzymatic activity. The second hypothesis posits that HDAC1-dependent phosphorylation promotes protein associations, which results in augmented enzymatic activity. While it is formally possible that phosphorylation may result in subtle structural rearrangements undetectable by limited proteolysis, the data are consistent with the possibility that protein associations promote HDAC1 enzymatic activity. A model of associated protein-promoted HDAC1 activity is strengthened by experiments where coexpression of MTA2 with the HDAC1/HDAC2 core complex resulted in augmented deacetylase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Therefore, the results with limited proteolysis reinforce the close relationship between protein association and enzymatic activity in regulating HDAC1 function.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Limited proteolysis experiments were performed with HDAC1 for the first time. Because discrete HDAC1 fragments were not observed upon degradation with trypsin, the data suggest that HDAC1 contains a contiguous structure cooperating to maintain activity. Concentration-dependent proteolysis with HDAC1 phosphorylation site mutants demonstrated that trypsin sensitivities vary with extent of phosphorylation. As a result, these studies provide the first evidence that phosphorylation of S421 or S423 individually contribute to HDAC1 function. Finally, the data are consistent with a model where HDAC1 catalytic activity is promoted by protein associations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>T-Ag Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI containing phenol red indicator, 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotic (Gibco).

Due to the inhomogeneity of nonspecific antibody staining, a visual inspection of each background correction was necessary to ensure accuracy. To quantify the extent of trypsin digestion, the intensity of full length HDAC1 incubated in the presence of trypsin was divided by the intensity of HDAC1 in the absence of trypsin to yield the percentage of full-length protein. The percentage of full-length protein was plotted versus concentration of trypsin for each tested protein to produce the histogram.

Lower concentrations of trypsin were used in these reactions (0.00007.8-0.0050 mg/mL or 1.4&#x02013;90 units/mL) because the trypsin inhibitor did not immediately stop the reaction, as was the case with SDS quenching.
