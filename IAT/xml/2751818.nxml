In vertebrates, mature oocytes are arrested at metaphase II until fertilization, because of the presence of cytostatic factor (CSF) in their cytoplasm. By analogy, we hypothesized the presence of CSF in male germ cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>We show here, that Mos, Emi2, cyclin E and Cdk2, the four proteins of CSF, and their respective mRNAs, are present in male rat meiotic cells; this was assessed by using Western blotting, immunocytochemistry and reverse transcriptase PCR. We measured the relative cellular levels of Mos, Emi2, Cyclin E and Cdk2 in the meiotic cells by flow cytometry and found that the four proteins increased throughout the first meiotic prophase, reaching their highest levels in middle to late pachytene spermatocytes, then decreased following the meiotic divisions. In co-cultures of pachytene spermatocytes with Sertoli cells, &#x003b2;-NGF increased the number of metaphases II, while enhancing Mos and Emi2 levels in middle to late pachytene spermatocytes, pachytene spermatocytes in division and secondary spermatocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion/Significance</title><p>Our results suggest that CSF is not restricted to the oocyte. In addition, they reinforce the view that NGF, by enhancing Mos in late spermatocytes, is one of the intra-testicular factors which adjusts the number of round spermatids that can be supported by Sertoli cells.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Spermatogenesis is a complex process during which diploid spermatogonia divide mitotically to provide a population of spermatocytes that proceed through meiosis to haploid spermatids which differenciate into spermatozoa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007237-Parvinen1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

We have previously shown that &#x003b2;-Nerve growth factor (&#x003b2;-NGF) participates in the regulation of spermatocyte differentiation by blocking secondary spermatocytes (SII) in metaphase (MPII) leading to a reduction of round spermatid (RS) formation in co-cultures of pachytene spermatocytes (PS) with Sertoli cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007237-Perrard1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Masui and Market <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007237-Masui1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> postulated the presence of a specific factor in the cytoplasm of the oocyte blocked in MPII, and named this factor &#x0201c;cytostatic factor&#x0201d; (CSF). Sagata et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007237-Sagata1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> proposed that the proto-oncogene Mos, a germ-cell-specific protein kinase uniquely induced at the beginning of oocyte maturation, was responsible for this CSF arrest in Xenopus eggs. Subsequently, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway comprising the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Erk) 1/2 were identified as the downstream mediators of Mos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007237-Tunquist1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, it has been shown that one early mitotic inhibitor (Emi) protein, Emi2/Fbxo43 is required for both the establishment and maintenance of CSF arrest in Xenopus and mice eggs and that the Mos-MAPK pathway is directly linked to Emi2 for both CSF establishment and maintenance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007237-Inoue1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007237-Shoji1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.

Therefore, we hypothesized the presence of CSF in male germ cells, which could be, at least in part, responsible for the &#x003b2;-NGF induced blockage of SII in MPII observed in co-cultures of PS with Sertoli cells. We have shown previously, that both ERK1 and ERK2 are detected in meiotic cells, from young PS to RS, present in co-culture of PS with Sertoli cells, as in freshly isolated germ cell populations. Moreover, their activated (phosphorylated) forms increased during meiotic progression, suggesting a role of MAPKs in this process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007237-Godet1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

Subsequently, Mos mRNA and/or protein were found in rodent and frog PS and rodent RS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007237-vanderHoorn1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007237-Ferrara1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> and in rat late PS in culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007237-Nagao1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. However, in disagreement with our results, van der Hoorn et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007237-vanderHoorn1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> saw the 43kD c-Mos protein only in rat PS cells, but not in RS. No definite explanation can be given for this discrepancy, but it has to be underlined that the RS fractions used in the present study were, at more than 8O&#x00025;, composed of 1C cells (RS cells) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">materials and methods</xref> section). Moreover, the presence of Mos in cell-sorted RS (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007237-g004">fig. 4a</xref>) fits our western blot results. We observed that Mos was present throughout the long prophase of meiosis I (MI) and that its level culminated in middle to late PS, then decreased after the first meiotic division. Our results appear therefore in agreement with Nagao <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007237-Nagao2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> who observed that a gradual increase of spermatid formation occured a few days after the beginning of the c-Mos protein expression in vitro and suggested that the 43kD c-Mos protein has a role in spermatogenic cells that are close to meiotic division. However, these changes appear rather different from those observed in Xenopus oocytes, in which Mos is synthesized around the time of completion of MI and is at its maximal level during meiosis II (MII) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007237-Nishiyama1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">discussion</xref> below).</p><p>To our knowledge, Emi2 and its mRNA have been described before only in the whole mouse testis, and their quantities were found to be higher in the testis than in the ovary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007237-Shoji1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. This difference might be due to the presence of Emi2 and its mRNA in a larger number of meiotic cells in the testis than in the ovary. Indeed, our results showed the presence of Emi2 in all rat testis meiotic cells with the highest level in middle to late PS, whereas in the oocyte, Emi2 is only synthesized around the end of MI, just before interkinesis, and it is present at a high level only during MII <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007237-Ohe1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Cyclin E and Cdk2 were co-localized in PS and RS, and these two proteins were already present in young PS with their levels culminating in middle to late PS, just before the first meiotic division. Our data are in agreement with previous studies showing the presence of Cdk2 in mouse spermatogonia and spermatocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007237-Ashley1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007237-Ravnik1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> and Cyclin E in rat PS and RS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007237-Musa1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. However, Ravnik and Wolgemuth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007237-Ravnik1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> did not detect the presence of Cdk2 in mouse RS. This might be explained by a species-specific staining pattern or, more likely, by the difference of sensitivity of the method used for the antibody revelation: DAB staining and observation on a microscope under bright-field optics in the work of Ravnik and Wolgemuth, scanning fluorescence using a confocal laser unit in our work. Indeed, it appears from our flow cytometric analysis that the levels of Cdk2 are rather low in RS. Our results showed the presence of Cyclin E and Cdk2 in all meiotic cells; this is different from those described in Xenopus oocytes, in which Cyclin E/Cdk2 were present at very low levels during MI and increased markedly just before MII <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007237-Tunquist1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Taken together our results indicate that the components of CSF are present at high levels in rat spermatocytes at earlier stages of meiosis than in the oocyte. The presence of these four proteins throughout the long prophase of MI might compensate the short duration of MII (stage XIV lasts only 14 hours) which would not be sufficient for the establishment of a CSF-like arrest. A second explanation could be the different fates of the oocyte and of the SII, both blocked in MPII. Whereas in the oocyte, the establishment of CSF activity at the end of MI and its maintenance during prometaphase II and MPII make the oocyte staying alive and blocked until fertilization (at least 48 hours), the blocked SII will probably die quickly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007237-Shiratsuchi1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007237-SinhaHikim1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, stopping RS formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007237-Perrard1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>A further interesting issue is how the meiotic arrest can be achieved at MPII but not at metaphase of meiosis I (MPI) under these conditions. No clear answer can be given at the present time, but it has to be noted that also in the oocyte, many components of the Mos pathway are present and active at MPI. For example, Mos, MAPK, p90rsk (the 90-kD ribosomal protein S6 kinase) and Bub1 (budding uninhibited by benz-imidazole 1) are essential for suppressing the S phase between the first and the second meiotic divisions, yet do not block eggs at MPI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007237-Madgwick1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Cellular contents in Mos and Emi2 are enhanced by &#x003b2;-NGF in late spermatocytes</title><p>Under our culture conditions, &#x003b2;-NGF induced a decrease in the yield of MII by blocking SII in MPII together with an increase of Mos in middle to late PS, PS in division and SII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007237-Perrard1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> and present results). It should be emphasized that the relatively high standard errors of the mean levels of Mos observed sometimes, both in basal and treated cultures, were due to variations between the different experiments (this is not unexpected as it was a relative quantification: see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">materials &#x00026; methods</xref> section). Indeed, in all five experiments performed in the presence of &#x003b2;-NGF, all exhibited increased levels of Mos in middle to late PS, PS in division and SII as compared to their corresponding cells under basal condition, resulting therefore in statistical significant differences.</p><p>Even under basal condition (no &#x003b2;-NGF added), some middle to late PS, PS in division and SII (roughly 30&#x02013;40&#x00025; of the total populations) exhibited high level of Mos (close to those expressed by most of the cells cultured in the presence of &#x003b2;-NGF; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007237-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). This resulted most likely from the action of &#x0201c;endogenous&#x0201d; &#x003b2;-NGF which is produced by (and acts on) the meiotic cells in co-cultures of PS with Sertoli cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007237-Perrard1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, the relatively high levels of Mos observed in freshly prepared middle to late PS (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007237-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>) would be due to &#x003b2;-NGF produced by meiotic cells in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007237-Perrard1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

This fits with our previous results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007237-Perrard1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> demonstrating that under the same conditions (a maximal concentration of &#x003b2;-NGF) the number of RS formed in vitro is decreased at most two fold as compared to cultures performed under basal conditions.</p><p>Overexpression of the proto-oncogene v-mos (pp39<sup>v-mos</sup>) during male meiosis results in a &#x0201c;CSF-like arrest&#x0201d; at MPI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007237-Rosenberg1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.

Conversely Cyclin E and Cdk2 are not likely involved in the blockage of SII as neither protein was increased under &#x003b2;-NGF treatment.
