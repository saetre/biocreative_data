Many of these proteins are conserved in yeast yet lack observable mutant phenotypes, which suggests that yeast endocytosis may be subject to different regulatory mechanisms. Here, we have systematically defined genes required for internalization using a quantitative genome-wide screen that monitors localization of the yeast vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)/synaptobrevin homologue Snc1. Genetic interaction mapping was used to place these genes into functional modules containing known and novel endocytic regulators, and cargo selectivity was evaluated by an array-based comparative analysis. We demonstrate that clathrin and the yeast AP180 clathrin adaptor proteins have a cargo-specific role in Snc1 internalization. We additionally identify <italic>low dye binding 17</italic> (<italic>LDB17</italic>) as a novel conserved component of the endocytic machinery. Ldb17 is recruited to cortical actin patches before actin polymerization and regulates normal coat dynamics and actin assembly. Our findings highlight the conserved machinery and reveal novel mechanisms that underlie endocytic internalization.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Clathrin-mediated endocytosis selects proteins at the plasma membrane for internalization in membrane-bound vesicles. In mammalian cells, cargo is initially concentrated at endocytic sites by adaptor proteins that promote clathrin recruitment and assembly. A variety of adaptors, such AP2, AP180/clathrin assembly lymphoid myeloid leukemia (CALM), epsins, arrestins, and Dab2, recognize different endocytic motifs and select distinct classes of cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maldonado-B&#x000e1;ez and Wendland, 2006</xref>). The subsequent recruitment of accessory factors including Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP), dynamin, and amphiphysin stimulates actin polymerization, which results in membrane deformation and vesicle scission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Smythe and Ayscough, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Studies in yeast have demonstrated that conserved endocytic modules are recruited to sites of internalization in a similar temporal sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kaksonen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Newpher et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Perrais and Merrifield, 2005</xref>). Clathrin and adaptors are part of the early coat module that establishes the initial site of uptake, whereas the late coat module (Sla1/Sla2/End3/Pan1) couples coat formation to actin polymerization through recruitment and stimulation of yeast WASP (Las17) and Myo5. This activates the Arp2/3 complex to form an actin network that, stabilized by the actin regulatory module (Cap1/2, Sac6, Abp1), promotes rapid inward movement of the internalizing vesicle. Finally, the amphiphysins Rvs161/167 are thought to drive scission of endocytic vesicles from the plasma membrane. Recycling of the endocytic machinery by vesicle uncoating requires additional proteins, including the synaptojanin homologue Inp52.</p><p>This sequence of events, defined by live cell imaging studies, suggests that endocytic processes are largely conserved. However, striking differences in the functional requirements for certain regulatory proteins argue that internalization may be differentially regulated in yeast and mammalian cells. For example, the dynamic regulation of actin polymerization is essential for uptake in yeast but not in most mammalian cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Engqvist-Goldstein and Drubin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Smythe and Ayscough, 2006</xref>). Conversely, clathrin has an important role in higher cells, yet loss of yeast clathrin causes only a partial reduction in receptor internalization, and yeast homologues of major clathrin adaptor proteins such as AP2 and AP180 are not required for the uptake of known cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wendland and Emr, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 1999</xref>). Several other yeast genes are homologous to components of the mammalian endocytic machinery, yet do not lead to observable endocytosis defects when mutated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Engqvist-Goldstein and Drubin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kaksonen et al., 2005</xref>). Some of these factors may have functionally redundant homologues, or have cargo-specific roles. Additional, unrecognized factors may also regulate cargo uptake in yeast. To better understand the endocytic process in both yeast and mammalian cells, it will be important to identify the complete set of structural and regulatory proteins, and systematically define their specific roles.</p><p>The yeast vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)/synaptobrevin homologue Snc1, which regulates the fusion of exocytic vesicles at the cell surface, is a widely studied endocytic cargo protein. After delivery to the plasma membrane of the growing bud, it is rapidly internalized and transported to endosomal and Golgi compartments, where it is incorporated into new secretory vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lewis et al., 2000</xref>). Here, we perform a genome-wide analysis of Snc1 localization in yeast to uncover genes with functional roles in endocytosis, and quantify their relative contribution to this process. We identify functions for known and novel proteins not previously shown to be required for uptake, and demonstrate that the yeast AP180 homologues and clathrin have a cargo-specific role in Snc1 internalization. In addition, we describe an endocytic function for the previously uncharacterized protein low dye binding 17 (Ldb17).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>A Snc1-based quantitative assay for endocytic recycling</title><p>To quantify defects in endocytosis on a genome-wide scale, we developed an enzymatic assay based on the cell surface localization of a Snc1 reporter. The enzyme invertase (encoded by <italic>SUC2</italic>) was fused to the extracellular C terminus of Snc1, and GFP was appended to its intracellular N terminus, creating the chimeric protein GSS (GFP-Snc1-Suc2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Cell-surface GSS levels can be determined by a colorimetric invertase activity assay using cell-impermeant reagents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Darsow et al., 2000</xref>). By fluorescence microscopy, GSS displayed a polarized distribution at the plasma membrane of small buds similar to Snc1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lewis et al., 2000</xref>), which has been attributed to a cycle of localized exocytosis followed by rapid endocytosis that prevents diffusion away from the site of new growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Valdez-Taubas and Pelham, 2003</xref>). In support of this model, when the Snc1 endocytosis signal was mutated, the polarization of GSS was lost and the level of invertase activity at the plasma membrane was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref> and not depicted). Both Snc1 and GSS were mislocalized to the vacuole in <italic>vps51&#x00394;</italic> mutants (not depicted), demonstrating that they follow a similar recycling pathway back to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Conibear et al., 2003</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Genome-wide screen for endocytic recycling mutants.</bold> (A) Schematic of the GFP-Snc1-Suc2 (GSS) reporter.

To functionally dissect these processes, we analyzed GSS surface levels in 374 top-scoring deletion mutants in pairwise combination with a panel of 81 deletion mutants that affect a variety of protein trafficking pathways. Genes that cofunction within individual complexes and pathways can be identified in large scale genetic interaction analyses based on two characteristic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schuldiner et al., 2006</xref>). When loss of one gene disrupts a pathway or complex, loss of a second gene in the same pathway has no further effect, and the double mutant phenotype is less than would be expected under an additive model of genetic interaction. In addition, genes with related functions share similar patterns of genetic interactions and can be identified by cluster analysis.</p><p>In typical applications, such as synthetic lethal analysis, the double mutant array is analyzed using cell viability as the phenotypic readout. Here, we quantified the GSS surface distribution to analyze the &#x0223c;30,000 double mutants of our 374 &#x000d7; 81 array.

The resulting network connects genes that share similar patterns of genetic interaction, and thus may represent components of pathways and complexes. Physical interaction networks were then created for the same set of genes, where edges represent interactions observed in high throughput yeast two-hybrid or mass spectrometry experiments. Highly connected sets of genes in each network were identified and integrated, and significant gene clusters were assigned to subcellular compartments based on the localization of their constituent proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huh et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The resulting map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>) provides a visual representation of the processes contributing to GSS localization and an indication of their relative importance. The size of each node is proportional to the phenotype of the corresponding deletion mutant, whereas edges represent either a physical interaction or a genetic correlation extracted from genome-wide data. Four major clusters, containing a total of 20 genes, mapped to the plasma membrane. The largest of these groupings was enriched for genes with known or predicted roles in endocytosis (<italic>SLA1</italic>, <italic>ABP1</italic>, <italic>INP52</italic>, <italic>EDE1</italic>, <italic>YAP1802</italic>, <italic>RVS161</italic>, <italic>RVS167</italic>, <italic>CRN1</italic>, and the <italic>INP52</italic>-overlapping open reading frame [ORF] <italic>YNL105W</italic>). Additional genes implicated in endocytosis or actin regulation were found in three other clusters at the plasma membrane.

Ldb17 is transiently recruited to Sla1-containing cortical patches shortly before the onset of actin polymerization, and its membrane association is stabilized by interactions between its PRD and the Sla1 SH3 domain. The aberrant actin assembly and increased lifetime of Sla1 patches in <italic>ldb17</italic> mutants suggest that Ldb17 helps trigger the dynamic actin rearrangements that precede coat disassembly.</p><p>Ldb17 may link coat assembly to the activation of the Arp2/3 complex through interactions with Sla1 and Arp2/3 activators, or act more directly. The C-terminal region of SPIN90 most similar to Ldb17 is sufficient to promote the WASP-independent activation of Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2007</xref>). The Arp2/3 and actin-binding motifs present in SPIN90 are only partially conserved in Ldb17, and we did not observe binding of Ldb17 to the Arp2/3 complex and the yeast WASP homologue Las17 in vivo (unpublished data). However, we identified an interaction between the Ldb17 PRD and the Bzz1 SH3 domain that mirrors the PRD-dependent binding of the Ldb17-related protein SPIN90 to the mammalian Bzz1 homologue syndapin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2006</xref>). The conserved interaction of syndapin-like proteins with proline-rich regions in Ldb17 and SPIN90, despite the different placement of the interacting domains, suggests that these proteins may fulfill related roles. Further work will be needed to clarify the function of these conserved proteins in regulating actin polymerization and endocytosis.</p><p>Overall, our results suggest that endocytic processes are generally more similar in yeast and higher cells than previously believed, and underscore Snc1 transport in yeast as a model for synaptobrevin recycling at the synapse. Characterization of other genes identified in our screen may yield additional endocytosis factors. Because of the functional redundancy of the endocytic machinery in all eukaryotes, many regulatory proteins are likely to have weak mutant phenotypes that can only be discovered by more sensitive and quantitative approaches. Future application of our genome-wide analysis to different reporter proteins may identify alternative cargo-specific machinery and further define the complexity of endocytic systems.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Construction of plasmids and yeast strains</title><p>Plasmids and yeast strains constructed for this study, and details of their construction, are listed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200811116/DC1">Table S2</ext-link>.

The <italic>MATa</italic> yeast strain BY4741 and its gene deletion derivatives were obtained through Thermo Fisher Scientific. Unless otherwise stated, gene disruptions and tagging of genomic ORFs were performed by transformation of a PCR product containing a drug selection marker, flanked by 50&#x02013;55 bp of homology to the region of interest. Additional strains and plasmids were obtained from C. Boone (University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, CAN), S. Fields (University of Washington, Seattle, WA), and S.

Query strains containing the GSS reporter and a gene deletion marked with NAT<sup>R</sup> were mated to a 384-colony knockout array that contained 374 mutants identified in the genome-wide analysis (top 402 hits minus 28 mitochondrial mutants) and controls (wild type, blank, <italic>ent3</italic>, and <italic>rvs161</italic>). Double mutant haploid strains containing the GSS reporter were selected on &#x02013;LEU &#x02013;URA +G418 +clonNAT plates.</p><p>Manipulation and screening of the resulting colony arrays was performed essentially as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burston et al., 2008</xref>). Colony arrays on 384-array stock plates were pinned four times to YPF plates, creating 1,536 arrays using a Virtek automated colony arrayer (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Digital images of colony arrays subjected to the invertase overlay assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Darsow et al., 2000</xref>) were acquired using a flat-bed scanner (2400; Epson). Local normalization was performed using National Institutes of Health ImageJ software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>) with the local normalization plugin (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="bigwww.epfl.ch/sage/soft/localnormalization">bigwww.epfl.ch/sage/soft/localnormalization</ext-link>) to correct for differences in intensity resulting from uneven distribution of reagents. Densitometry on corrected images used the spot-finding program GridGrinder (gridgrinder.sourceforge.net), and values were subjected to background subtraction and filtered to eliminate absent or very slow-growing strains. Densitometry values are inversely correlated with the cell surface levels of the reporter. Therefore, these values were subtracted from the median value for all strains to give a score where a high value represents a high level of the reporter. The invertase overlay assay was performed twice on each knockout collection; mean values were used to generate the final ranking.</p></sec><sec><title>Genetic interaction and network analysis</title><p>In an additive model of genetic interaction, the phenotype of the double mutant strain (P<sub>XY</sub>) can be expressed as: P<sub>XY</sub> = P<sub>WT</sub> + E<sub>X</sub> + E<sub>Y</sub> + E<sub>GI</sub>, where P<sub>WT</sub> is the wild-type phenotype, E<sub>X</sub> is the effect of the first mutation, E<sub>Y</sub> is the effect of the second mutation, and E<sub>GI</sub> is the genetic interaction effect. In a genetic interaction matrix, all double mutants in a given row or column have a mutation in the same &#x0201c;array&#x0201d; gene (row) or &#x0201c;query&#x0201d; gene (column). Assuming genetic interactions are rare, and positive and negative interactions are equally common, dividing double mutant phenotype values (P<sub>XY</sub>) in each column by the mean of that column removes the effect of the query mutation (P<sub>wt</sub> + E<sub>Y</sub>). Subsequently dividing values in each row by the row-wise mean removes the effect of the array mutation (E<sub>X</sub>), leaving only the genetic interaction effect, E<sub>GI</sub>.</p><p>We applied a modified version of this data preprocessing strategy to the matrix of raw double mutant invertase activity values. Rows with &#x0003e;20% missing observations were removed. Remaining values were divided by row- and column-wise medians, and values in each row and column were scaled so the sum of the squares of the values in each row or column was 1.0. Although these manipulations do not preserve the numerical value of E<sub>GI</sub>, they optimize clustering of functionally related groups by emphasizing patterns of genetic interactions. Cluster 3.0 software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bonsai.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~mdehoon/software/cluster/software.htm">http://bonsai.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/&#x0223c;mdehoon/software/cluster/software.htm</ext-link>) was used to perform average linkage hierarchical clustering using an uncentered correlation similarity metric on both horizontal and vertical axes, and results were presented using Java Treeview (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jtreeview.sourceforge.net/">http://jtreeview.sourceforge.net/</ext-link>), where ordering of genes on both axes reflects the similarity of their genetic interaction profiles, and cluster relationships are indicated by trees. The resulting heat map (Fig. S1) does not provide a true quantitative measure of genetic interaction, but instead approximates the direction of the genetic interaction effect for each double mutant, where yellow is negative (less than expected under the additive null model) and blue is positive (greater than expected).</p><p>A network of correlated genetic interaction profiles was generated using the ARACNE algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Margolin et al., 2006</xref>) with a threshold of 0.015.
