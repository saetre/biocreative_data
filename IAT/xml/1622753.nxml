Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a causative retrovirus of ATL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. HTLV-1 immortalizes human CD4+ T-cells <italic>in vitro </italic>and probably does so <italic>in vivo</italic>, but such immortalization is not sufficient for the development of ATL, since only 3&#x02013;5% of HTLV-1 infection causes ATL after long-latent period of 60&#x02013;70 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Multiple genetic and epigenetic changes in HTLV-1-infected cells and deterioration of host immune system during the latent period, are thought to be prerequisite for the development of ATL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>HTLV-1 Tax1 is a key player, involved in both T-cell immortalization as well as the leukemogenesis, and it shows transforming activities in various systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Transduction of the <italic>tax1 </italic>gene into peripheral blood mononuclear cells using viral vectors induces interleukin(IL)-2-dependent immortalization of CD4+ T-cells <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. <italic>In vivo</italic>, Tax1-transgenic animals develop various tumors including pre-T-cell leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Tax1 also perturbs cellular gene expression, in part, through activation of transcription factors such as NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B, serum response factor, and AP-1, thereby inducing the expression of genes encoding cytokines, cytokine receptors, chemokines, and anti-apoptotic factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>HTLV Type 2 (HTLV-2) is a retrovirus that is similar in many respects to HTLV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. For instance, HTLV-2 establishes life-long persistent infection in humans and immortalizes human T-cells in an efficiency equivalent to HTLV-1 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Interestingly, HTLV-2 is not, associated with ATL or related malignancies and has been associated with only a few cases of lymphoproliferative disorders. Recent evidence suggested that the PDZ protein binding motif (PBM) at the C-terminus of Tax1, which is missing in HTLV-2 Tax2, plays a crucial role in the distinct pathogenesis between HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. For instance, the transforming ability of Tax1 is much greater than Tax2 in a mouse T-cell line (CTLL-2), and this difference appears to be determined by the PBM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. A recombinant HTLV-1 with a deletion of the PBM (HTLV-1&#x00394;PBM) failed to establish persistent infection in rabbits, as measured by the lack of antibody responses against HTLV-1 and the absence of HTLV-1 proviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Interestingly, HTLV-1&#x00394;PBM can transform human T-cells, although in a less efficient manner than the wild type virus, suggesting that the Tax1 PBM is essential for persistent infection <italic>in viv</italic>o, but dispensable for the transformation of human T-cells.</p><p>The PBM of HTLV-1 Tax1 interacts with several PDZ proteins such as Dlg1, the precursor of IL-16, and MAGI-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Among these, Dlg1 is an attractive candidate associated with the transforming activity of Tax1. Dlg originally was isolated from Drosophila and was shown to be a tumor suppressor gene. Loss-of-function mutations in Dlg1 in Drosophila resulted in the neoplastic overgrowth of imaginal disc epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Dlg1 also is a tumor suppressor gene in mice, such that Dlg1 heterozygous mice develop B-cell or NK cell lymphomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Moreover, over-expression of Dlg1 induced cell cycle arrest of a mouse fibroblast cell line NIH3T3, and the arrest was rescued by Tax1 in a PBM-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>CTLL-2 is a mouse T-cell line, the growth of which is dependent on IL-2. We previously showed that Tax1 abrogates the IL-2-dependent growth phenotype of CTLL-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Whereas expression of Tax1 often induces cell growth arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], CTLL-2 is resistant to such Tax1 activity, thereby being a useful tool to examine the transforming activity of Tax1 toward T-cells. In the study reported here, knockdown of D1g1 with RNA interference (RNAi) enhanced the ability of Tax1 to induce IL-2 independence in CTLL-2 cells. Moreover, Dlg1 expression was significantly less in all HTLV-1-transformed T-cell lines compared to HTLV-1-negative cell lines, suggesting that inactivation of Dlg1 is a critical step for transforming activity of Tax1. We will discuss these findings in the context of T-cell transformation by HTLV-1.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Dlg1 knockdown augments the ability of Tax1 to induce IL-2-independent growth in CTLL-2 cells</title><p>To examine the roles of Dlg1 protein in Tax1-induced IL-2-independent growth of CTLL-2 cells, we established CTLL-2 cells expressing reduced amount of Dlg1 using RNA interference (RNAi). We first constructed lentivirus vectors expressing short hairpin (sh)RNA specific to mouse dlg1 sequences (Dlg1-1, Dlg1-3). Dlg1-1 and Dlg1-3 target distinct sequences of mouse Dlg1 RNA. Two control shRNAs were constructed to target bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) and renilla luciferase (LUC) genes, both of which are not expressed normally in mouse T-cells. These viruses were used to infect CTLL-2 cells, and the infected cells were selected by blasticidin for more than 10 days. The established cell lines then were examined for the expression of Dlg1 protein by Western blotting analysis with anti-Dlg1 antibody (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Two Dlg1 knockdown cell lines (Dlg1-1, Dlg1-3) expressed a reduced amount of Dlg1 protein relative to two control cell lines (CAT, LUC). These four cell lines grew at equivalent rates in the presence of IL-2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), and died without IL-2 with similar kinetics (data not shown). Thus, the reduction of Dlg1 expression in CTLL-2 cells did not affect apparent cell growth phenotypes. To examine the effect of Dlg1 knockdown on Tax1-induced IL-2-independent growth, these characterized Dlg1 knockdown cell lines were infected with a lentivirus expressing Tax1 (Tax1-virus) and cultured in the presence of IL-2 for 48 h. Subsequently, the cells were seeded into 96-well plates, followed by further culturing in the absence of IL-2. After more than two weeks, the number of wells with outgrowing CTLL-2 cells was counted using a microscope. All CTLL-2 cells infected with a control lentivirus died within two weeks and did not induce any outgrowing cells (data not shown). Conversely, there was an outgrowth of control CTLL-2 infected with the Tax1-virus (CAT/Tax1, LUC/Tax1) at 7&#x02013;11% of wells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Similarly, Dlg1 knockdown cells infected with the Tax1-virus (Dlg1-1, Dlg1-3) also had outgrowth with three to six-folds more wells than the controls (CAT/Tax1, LUC/Tax1). The observed differences were not due to reduced Tax1 expression in the control cells, since all four cell lines expressed equivalent amounts of Tax1 protein after the infection as shown by Western analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The augmented Tax1 activity was reproducibly observed in at least nine independent experiments (data not shown). The Dlg1-1 and Dlg1-3 cell lines established by independent experiments also reproduced the high sensitivity to Tax1 transformation relative to control cells (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that the reduction of Dlg1 protein in CTLL-2 augmented the ability of Tax1 to induce IL-2 independent growth.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Dlg1 knockdown in CTLL-2 does not affect the cell growth phenotypes</bold>.

These results suggest that wild type Tax1 inhibits the tumor suppressor-like activity of Dlg1 through direct binding via the PBM while Tax1&#x00394;C cannot, resulting in the reduced transforming activity. Therefore, we examined whether Dlg1 knockdown could rescue the transforming activity of Tax1&#x00394;C. Tax1&#x00394;C also induced the outgrowth of control CTLL-2 cells (CAT), but the number of positive wells was much less than that of Tax1, which was consistent with the previous result [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. It should be noted that 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>CTLL-2 cells infected with Tax1&#x00394;C-virus or 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>2 </sup>cells with Tax1-virus were seeded per well, indicating that the actual transforming activity of Tax1 versus Tax1&#x00394;C in CTLL-2 cells was much greater than the observed relative difference. Tax1&#x00394;C in the Dlg1 knockdown cells also induced outgrowth, and the number of positive wells was similar to that of the control cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). These results suggest that inactivation of Dlg1 alone does not explain the difference in transforming activity between Tax1 and Tax1&#x00394;.

Western blot analysis with anti-Dlg1 antibody demonstrated reduced expression of Dlg1 in the Dlg1 knockdown cells (Dlg1-1, Dlg1-3) even after IL-2-independent transformation by Tax1 or Tax1&#x00394;C (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Interestingly, IL-2-independent control cells (CAT, LUC) transformed either by Tax1&#x00394;C or Tax1 expressed less Dlg1 compared to the parental non-transformed cells, and the reduction of Dlg1 was much more prominent in Tax1&#x00394;C cells relative to Tax1. These results support a hypothesis that IL-2-independent transformation of CTLL-2 cells by Tax1&#x00394;C requires reduction of Dlg1 expression. In the above experiments, we used bulk (non-clonal) CTLL-2 cells transformed by Tax1&#x00394;C or Tax1, which were established in culture flasks. To examine this hypothesis further, we evaluated five independent clonal CTLL-2 cell lines transformed either by Tax1&#x00394;C or Tax1 established in 96-well plates and compared the expression level of Dlg1 protein in these cloned cells (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). All five IL-2-independent Tax1&#x00394;C clones expressed reduced amounts of Dlg1, whereas two out of five Tax1 clones expressed Dlg1 at a level similar to Tax1&#x00394;C. The expression of Syntrophin &#x003b2;, another PDZ protein suggested to interact with Tax1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], was expressed equivalently in these cell lines, indicating that reduced expression of Dlg1 in Tax1&#x00394;C is specific. These data lend additional support to the hypothesis that reduced expression of Dlg1 protein is a factor required for Tax1&#x00394;C-induced IL-2-independent transformation of CTLL-2 cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Low Dlg1 expression in IL-2-independent Tax1&#x00394;C clones</bold>.

However, it has been unclear whether and how Dlg1 plays a role in Tax1-mediated cellular transformation. Two lines of evidence suggested that inactivation of Dlg1 is a critical step for the transforming activity of Tax1, and Tax1 through PBM inactivates inhibitory activity of Dlg1 to induce transformation of CTLL-2 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). First, Dlg1 knockdown in CTLL-2 cells increased their ability to be transformed by Tax1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Second, Tax1&#x00394;C-transformed cells, which were extremely rare to emerge, expressed less Dlg1 than non-transformed cells or Tax1-transformed cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p><p>All HTLV-1-transformed T-cell lines expressed low levels of Dlg1 relative to control T-cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). However, it is unlikely that reduced Dlg1 expression could be due to Tax1-induced degradation. First, unlike human papilloma virus (HPV) E6, Tax1 expression in the kidney cell line 293T did not induce degradation of Dlg1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Moreover, a human T-cell line transformed by recombinant HTLV-1&#x00394;PBM containing Tax1&#x00394;C also possessed a low level of Dlg1 protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Taken together with the findings in CTLL-2 cells, these results suggested that Dlg1 is an inhibitory protein for HTLV-1-induced transformation of human T-cells, and low-Dlg1 expression is preferential for the HTLV-1 Tax1 function.</p><p>Dlg1 knockdown in CTLL-2 cells increased the frequency of IL-2-independent transformation induced by Tax1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Given that Tax1 through the PBM can inactivate Dlg1 function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], these results indicated that only cells expressing high amounts of Tax1 or reduced amounts of Dlg1 acquire IL-2 independent phenotype (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>). This is consistent with the observation that some Tax1-transformed CTLL-2 cells expressed reduced amounts of Dlg1 relative to parental CTLL-2 cells. In addition, this explains why all the human T-cells transformed by HTLV-1 Tax1 with an intact PBM expressed relatively low amounts of Dlg1.</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>A model of Tax1 induced transformation</bold>. A) At least two PDZ proteins, Dlg1 and a putative protein X, should be inactivated by Tax1 for the transformation of CTLL2 cells. B) Tax1 inactivates X more efficiently in Dlg1 knockdown cells than in CTLL-2 cells, resulting in the higher transformation rate. C, D) Tax1&#x00394;C selectively transforms CTLL2 expressing low amount of both Dlg1 and X. In this case, cells expressing low amount of X always express low amount of Dlg1.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1742-4690-3-71-8"/></fig><p>It is unclear how Dlg1 inhibits the transforming activity of Tax1 in CTLL-2 cells, and how such Dlg1 function is inactivated by Tax1. Previous results showed that over-expression of Dlg1 inhibited cell cycle transition from G1 to S phase in the mouse fibroblast cell line NIH3T3, which was overcome by Tax1 in a PBM-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. On the other hand, Tax1 changes subcellular localization of Dlg1 from detergent soluble fraction to detergent insoluble fraction in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines and 293T cells, suggesting that Tax1 inactivates Dlg1 function through altering the localization in cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Together, one possible scenario is that Dlg1 inhibits cell cycle progression of CTLL-2/Tax1, but Tax1 through altering localization of Dlg1 in cells, overcome the cell cycle inhibition to initiate IL-2-independent transformation.</p><p>Dlg1 knockdown did not increase transforming activity of Tax1&#x00394;C toward CTLL-2 cells. This finding was initially disappointing to us, since Dlg1 was a major PDZ protein interacting with Tax1 in T-cells (data not shown). This finding, however, suggested that PDZ protein(s) other than Dlg1 inhibits transformation of CTLL-2 by Tax1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). At least two more Tax1-interacting PDZ proteins other than Dlg1 are needed to explain the present data. As discussed above, inactivation of one of the two PDZ proteins should be essential for IL-2-independent transformation of CTLL-2 by Tax1, since Dlg1 knockdown did not enhance the frequency of cells transformed by Tax1&#x00394;C (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The other PDZ protein likely influences the rate of proliferation of IL-2-independent Tax1 cells, since IL-2-independent Tax1&#x00394;C cells grew more slowly than IL-2-independent Tax1 cells (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). However, it should be noted that transformed Tax1&#x00394;C cells exhibited more cell death than transformed Tax1 cells (data not shown). Thus, the latter PDZ protein might regulate apoptosis of T-cells expressing Tax1. There are several Tax1-interacting PDZ proteins, such as MAGI-3 and the precursor of IL-16 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In addition, there are three Dlg1 family members, such as Chapsyn-110 (PSD-93), NE-Dlg (SAP102), and PSD-95 (SAP90) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], although it is unclear whether they are expressed in T-cells. Therefore, the identification of PDZ proteins other than Dlg1 that are involved in Tax1 function is crucial to elucidate the mechanism of T-cell transformation by HTLV-1.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The Tax1 PBM is conserved in all known HTLV-1 isolates but not in HTLV-2 isolates. Similarly, the E6 oncoprotein derived from high-risk HPVs, but not low-risk HPVs, has a PBM and interacts with Dlg1. These results strongly suggest that the PBM and the interacting protein(s) play crucial roles in oncogenesis by these viruses. Approximately 12% of Dlg1 heterozygous mice developed B-cell or NK lymphomas, which suggests that Dlg1 is involved in lymphomagenesis, even when its expression is half of that of wild-type mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Thus, Dlg1 is an attractive candidate regulating not only human T-cell transformation but also ATL leukemogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cells and cell growth assay</title><p>CTLL-2 is a mouse cytotoxic T-cell line that grows in an IL-2-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].
