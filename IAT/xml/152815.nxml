The U3 snoRNP complex is required for the early cleavage steps in pre-rRNA processing. We have cloned cDNAs encoding the human and mouse homologs of the yeast U3 snoRNP-associated proteins Imp3 and Imp4. Both human proteins localize to nucleoli and interact with the U3 snoRNA. The results of complementation experiments show that, in contrast to mouse Imp4, mouse Imp3 can partially alleviate the growth defect of the corresponding yeast null strain, indicating that the role of Imp3 in pre-rRNA processing is evolutionarily conserved. The results of density gradient centrifugation experiments show that, in contrast to hU3-55K, the human Imp3 and Imp4 proteins predominantly interact with the U3 snoRNA in 60&#x02013;80S ribonucleoprotein complexes. In addition, we have found that hImp3, hImp4 and hMpp10 can form a stable hetero-trimeric complex <italic>in vitro</italic>, which is generated by direct interactions of both hImp3 and hImp4 with hMpp10. The analysis of hImp3 and hImp4 mutants indicated that their binding to hMpp10 correlates with their nucleolar accumulation, strongly suggesting that the formation of the ternary complex of hImp3, hImp4 and hMpp10 is required for their association with nucleolar components.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The U3 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA), a box C&#x0002f;D type snoRNA, is required for the early cleavage steps in pre-rRNA processing, which are essential for the formation of the small ribosomal subunit RNA (18S rRNA) in both fungi and vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c3">3</xref>). In yeast, the U3 snoRNA is essential for processing at sites A<sub>0</sub>, A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c4">4</xref>). Base-pairing interactions of the U3 snoRNA with the 5&#x02032; external transcribed spacer (5&#x02032;ETS) of the precursor ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) and the 5&#x02032; terminal region of the 18S rRNA have been demonstrated to play an essential role in this process.</p><p>The U3 snoRNA contains several evolutionarily conserved sequence elements, designated box GAC, A, A&#x02032;, B, C, C&#x02032; and D. The box GAC, box A and box A&#x02032; display sequence complementarity to regions of the 5&#x02032;ETS and 18S rRNA sequences within the pre-rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c14">14</xref>). The boxes B&#x0002f;C and C&#x02032;&#x0002f;D are located in the 3&#x02032; part of the U3 snoRNA and function as protein binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c16">16</xref>).</p><p>The U3 snoRNA interacts with proteins that are common to all box C&#x0002f;D snoRNPs: 15.5K (Snu13p in yeast), Nop56, Nop58 and fibrillarin (Nop1p) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c24">24</xref>). In addition, a number of proteins have been identified in a yeast system that specifically associate with the U3 snoRNA: Rrp9p (hU3-55K in human), Dhr1p, Lcp5p, Rcl1p, Sof1p, Imp3p, Imp4p and Mpp10p (hMpp10 in human) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c25">25</xref>).</p><p>Purification of the yeast &#x0223c;80S SSU processome has led to the identification of a vast number of novel proteins that interact with the U3 snoRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c26">26</xref>). With the exception of Rcl1p and Lcp5p, these complexes contained all U3 snoRNA-associated proteins mentioned above and a large number of other non-ribosomal proteins that are associated with the U3 snoRNA. It has been proposed that the U3 snoRNA, together with the proteins that are associated with U3 in the SSU processome, is required to assist in the proper folding of the pre-rRNA.</p><p>The human U3 snoRNA is associated with both 12S and 60&#x02013;80S complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c28">28</xref>). Nop56, Nop58, 15.5K, fibrillarin and hU3-55K are most likely to be the first proteins to interact with the U3 snoRNA during its assembly and together may constitute the 12S U3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c18">18</xref>). Base-pairing interactions of the U3 snoRNA with pre-rRNA, which may require a number of auxiliary factors, may lead to the formation of 60&#x02013;80S complexes, equivalent to the SSU processome described in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c26">26</xref>).</p><p>Imp3p and Imp4p were identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen using yeast Mpp10p as a bait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c29">29</xref>). Both the human and yeast Mpp10 proteins contain several putative coiled-coil regions that have been suggested to mediate intramolecular and&#x0002f;or intermolecular interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c32">32</xref>). Imp3p contains a putative S4 RNA binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c29">29</xref>). Imp4p is a member of the Imp4 superfamily of proteins, which are characterized by the &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>-like motif, a sequence motif first identified in the &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> family of prokaryotic transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c33">33</xref>). Interestingly, the &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>-like motif in the eukaryotic Imp4 superfamily confers binding to RNA and all the proteins in this family interact with pre-rRNA processing intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c33">33</xref>). In contrast to other members of this family, Imp4p associates with the U3 snoRNA and is required for the early cleavage steps in pre-rRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c33">33</xref>). In this study we have addressed the question whether the Mpp10-Imp3-Imp4 complex also exists in human cells and we have investigated its association with the human U3 snoRNP. For these studies cDNAs encoding the human homologs of the yeast Imp3 and Imp4 proteins were cloned and characterized. Besides data on their association with U3 snoRNA-containing complexes, details on their interactions with the human Mpp10 protein will be presented.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Oligonucleotides used in this study</title><p>mImp3A: 5&#x02032;-GCGAGATCTCTCGAGATGGTGCGGAAGCTTAAGTTC-3&#x02032;; hImp3: 5&#x02032;-GCGAGATCTAGGCCTCTAGCTAGCGGCTTCTAGATCAAAGTCATC-3&#x02032;; hImp4a: 5&#x02032;-GCGAGATCTCTCGAGATGCTGCGCCGCGAGGCCCGC-3&#x02032;; hImp4b: 5&#x02032;-GCGAGATCTAGGCCTTCAGCTAGCCTCGGTGCTCAGGAAGCATCT-3&#x02032;; hImp3DS4: 5&#x02032;-GCGAGATCTAGGCTTCTAGCTAGCGGCGGGGTCGGTGACCAC-3&#x02032;; hImp3DCCRev: 5&#x02032;-CGAAGCGCGCACGCGGAACTGCAGCCGGTAACGCCCGCAGCAC-3&#x02032;; hImp4 DCCFor: 5&#x02032;-GCGCTCGAGCGCCTGATTCCCACTGAGTTA-3&#x02032;; hImp4D&#x003c3;70For: 5&#x02032;-AAGAAGACAGACCACCGCAACCTGGGCACGCTGGAGCAGGAG-3&#x02032;; hImp4&#x003c3;70ERAA: 5&#x02032;-GTGGAGCTCACTGCGGTCGGGCCCGCGTTTG AGCTGAAGCTGTACATG-3&#x02032;; hImp4TFAAFor: 5&#x02032;-AGCCACCTGCCCTTTGGTCCTGCGGCCTACGCGACGCTGTGCAATGTGGTCATG-3&#x02032;; hImp4TFAARev: 5&#x02032;-CATGA CCACATTGCACAGCGTCGCGTAGGCCGCAGGACCAAAGGGCAGGTGGCT-3&#x02032;; mImp3Bam: 5&#x02032;-CGCGGATCCATGGTGCGGAAGCTTAAGTTC-3&#x02032;.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA manipulations</title><p>The human Imp3 and Imp4 cDNAs were cloned by PCR using a teratocarcinoma cDNA library and oligonucleotides mImp3a and hImp3, hImp4a and hImp4b, respectively.

HEp-2 cells were transfected with constructs encoding GFP-fusion proteins of hImp3 and hImp4 and after 18 h the subcellular localization of the GFP-tagged proteins was examined by fluorescence microscopy. The results show that both fusion proteins accumulate in the nucleoli (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg300f2">2</xref>A). Thus, the subcellular localization of hImp3 and hImp4 is consistent with U3 snoRNP association and a role in ribosomal RNA maturation. To investigate whether these proteins indeed associate with U3, immunoprecipitations were performed with anti-hImp3 and anti-hImp4 antibodies on HEp-2 total cell extracts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg300f2">2</xref>B, lanes 3 and 4). As controls anti-hMpp10, anti-hU3-55K, anti-fibrillarin and anti-(tri)methylguanosine cap antibodies were used (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg300f2">2</xref>B, lanes 4&#x02013;7). After immunoprecipitation, co-precipitated RNAs were analyzed by northern blot hybridization using various riboprobes. We observed U3 snoRNA co-precipitation with both the anti-hImp3 and anti-hImp4 antibodies, although the amounts were reproducibly low (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg300f2">2</xref>B, lanes 2 and 3). Co-precipitation of U3 with the anti-hImp4 antibodies was always more efficient than with anti-hImp3 antibodies. As expected, the U3 snoRNA efficiently co-precipitated with the anti-fibrillarin and anti-cap antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg300f2">2</xref>B, lanes 6 and 7).</p></sec><sec><title>The mouse Imp3 protein partially complements a yeast <italic>imp3</italic> null strain</title><p>The association of hImp3 and hImp4 with the U3 snoRNP complex and their subcellular localization suggests that these proteins are involved in pre-rRNA processing and thus indeed represent functional counterparts of the respective yeast proteins. To substantiate this, we investigated whether the expression of the mammalian Imp3 and Imp4 proteins in yeast could complement the respective yeast null alleles. As evident from Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg300f3">3</xref>A, the expression of mouse Imp3 (mImp3) partially complemented an <italic>imp3</italic> null allele in yeast at 22&#x000b0;C, whereas mouse Imp4 (mImp4) did not complement the <italic>imp4</italic> null allele.</p><p>Interestingly, the growth defect conferred by mImp3 could be partially alleviated by over-expressing other members of the yeast SSU processome, including Mpp10p and the yeast U3 snoRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg300f3">3</xref>B). Homologs of Mpp10p from different species and the U3 snoRNA were over-expressed at different levels in a yeast strain expressing either mImp3 or yeast Imp3. Most notably, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> Mpp10 (dMpp10p) suppressed the growth defect the best at both 22 and 30&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg300f3">3</xref>B). This is most likely due to the fact that dMpp10p and yeast Mpp10p share a higher degree of conservation than yeast and mouse Mpp10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c33">33</xref>). Over-expression of the U3 snoRNA also alleviated the growth defect of the yeast mImp3 strain, although to a lesser extent than dMpp10p. Very high levels of Mpp10p (expressed from p425GPD) had a negative effect on growth suggesting that the Mpp10p must be tightly regulated. Likewise depletion of Mpp10p in yeast leads to a decrease of Imp3p and Imp4p protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c33">33</xref>) and over-expression of Mpp10p also increases the levels of Imp3p and Imp4p (S.Wormsley and S.J.Baserga, unpublished). Co-over expression of all three is lethal (data not shown) suggesting that this dominant negative affect could be due to dilution of other factors associated with these proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>hImp3, hImp4 and hMpp10 sediment at 60&#x02013;80S in glycerol gradients</title><p>The human U3 snoRNA is associated with 12S and 60&#x02013;80S complexes of which the latter probably represent the U3 snoRNA associated with pre-rRNA processing complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c42">42</xref>).

Since yeast Imp3p and Imp4p interact with Mpp10p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c29">29</xref>), we included the human Mpp10 protein in these analyses. In addition, the sedimentation of hU3-55K, a U3 snoRNP specific protein, was investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c44">44</xref>). HEp-2 cell extracts were fractionated in 10&#x02013;30&#x00025; glycerol gradients. Northern blotting revealed that the bulk of the U3 snoRNA sedimented at 12S and 60&#x02013;80S, in agreement with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c28">28</xref>). The U3-specific protein hU3-55K co-sedimented with the U3 snoRNA, and peaked with the U3 snoRNA in fractions 5&#x02013;6 (&#x0223c;12S) and fractions 17&#x02013;19 (&#x0223c;70S). Interestingly, the bulk of hImp3, hImp4 and hMpp10, co-sedimented with the U3 snoRNA at 60&#x02013;80S (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg300f4">4</xref>A, fractions 17&#x02013;19), whereas only very small amounts sedimented near 12S (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg300f4">4</xref>A, fractions 4&#x02013;7). These results suggested that, in contrast to hU3-55K, the hImp3, hImp4 and Mpp10 proteins are not associated with the 12S U3 complex, but that they only interact with the larger, 60&#x02013;80S U3 snoRNA-containing complexes. Immunoprecipitation experiments performed with anti-hU3-55K, anti-hMpp10 and anti-hImp4 antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg300f4">4</xref>B, lanes 7&#x02013;9) confirmed the interaction between these proteins and the U3 snoRNA in the 60&#x02013;80S fractions. Furthermore, only very low amounts of U3 snoRNA were co-precipitated by anti-hImp4 and anti-hMpp10 antibodies from 12S fractions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg300f4">4</xref>B, lanes 3&#x02013;5).</p></sec><sec><title>hMpp10, hImp3 and hImp4 form a hetero-trimeric complex <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>In yeast, the Imp3p and Imp4p proteins were identified by virtue of their interaction with Mpp10p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c29">29</xref>).

Deletion of either the putative coiled-coil domain of hImp3 or the C-terminal region including part of the S4 domain abrogated the interaction with hMpp10 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg300f7">7</xref>B, lanes 6 and 7). Deletion of the putative coiled-coil region of hImp4 did not affect its interaction with hMpp10 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg300f7">7</xref>C, lane 6). However, deletion of the &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>-like motif abrogated its interaction with hMpp10 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg300f7">7</xref>C, lane 7). These data indicate that the deletion of spatially separated regions of hImp3 interfere with its binding to hMpp10 and that the &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>-like motif of hImp4 is required for its association with hMpp10. To substantiate the importance of the &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>-like motif for this interaction and to investigate the possibility that (also) the Imp4 domain plays a role in this interaction, we generated amino acid substitution mutants. Two highly conserved amino acids in the &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>-like motif (E246 and R250) or the Imp4 domain (T159 and F162) were substituted by alanines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg300f7">7</xref>A, hImp4&#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>ERAA and hImp4TFAA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c40">40</xref>).

These results suggest that the interaction of hImp3 and hImp4 with hMpp10 is required for their entry into the nucleolus.</p><p>The analysis of the GFPhMpp10 fusion proteins suggested that also hMpp10 requires the interaction with hImp3, and possibly hImp4, for nucleolar localization. The wild-type protein (GFPhMpp10), the N-terminal deletion mutant (GFPhMpp10&#x00394;N58) and the internal deletion mutant (GFPhMpp10&#x00394;103&#x02013;326) accumulated in nucleoli (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg300f8">8</xref>J&#x02013;L). Thus a large portion of the N-terminal part of hMpp10 can be deleted without affecting its subcellular distribution. Interestingly, a C-terminal deletion of 116 amino acids (GFPhMp10&#x00394;C565) resulted in both nucleolar and cytoplasmic accumulation, while only weak staining was observed in the nucleoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg300f8">8</xref>M). The most pronounced nucleolar accumulation with this mutant was observed in cells expressing relatively low levels of the fusion protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg300f8">8</xref>M; indicated by an arrow). The cytoplasmic accumulation might be related to the amino acid composition of the region that was deleted, which contains clusters of basic amino acids that might be involved in nuclear import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c32">32</xref>). The larger C-terminal deletion mutant GFPhMpp10&#x00394;C456 predominantly accumulated in the cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg300f8">8</xref>N), whereas only very small amounts appeared to reside in the nucleoplasm. Similar observations were made with the GFPhMpp10&#x00394;C325 mutant (data not shown). With these mutants no significant staining was observed in the nucleoli. Taken together, these results suggest that the region in hMpp10 that is important for binding hImp3 (amino acids 456&#x02013;565) is also required for nucleolar localization, while the C-terminal region comprising amino acids 565&#x02013;681 is required for nuclear import.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this paper we describe the cloning and characterization of mammalian Imp3p and Imp4p homologs.

Furthermore, they indicate that hImp3, hImp4 and hMpp10 predominantly associate with the U3 snoRNA in 60&#x02013;80S complexes, which are likely to represent pre-ribosomal complexes. The results obtained with hImp3, hImp4 and hMpp10 mutants suggest that the nucleolar accumulation of these proteins is dependent on formation of the ternary complex.</p><sec><title>hImp3 and hImp4 interact with the U3 snoRNA in 60&#x02013;80S U3 snoRNA-containing particles</title><p>Previously it has been shown that the yeast Imp3p and Imp4p proteins specifically interact with the U3 snoRNP complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c29">29</xref>). Our immunoprecipitation data indicate that this also occurs in the human system. Despite the fact that a considerable amount of U3 snoRNA co-sedimented with hImp3 and hImp4 in glycerol gradients, we reproducibly observed a relatively inefficient U3 snoRNA co-precipitation, indicating that only a small amount of U3 snoRNA is stably associated with these proteins in HEp-2 cells. We obtained similar results with anti-GFP immunoprecipitations using extracts prepared from transiently transfected HEp-2 cells expressing GFP-tagged hImp3 or hImp4 (data not shown). The possibility that the inefficient co-precipitation was due to a poor accessibility of the hImp3 and hImp4 proteins for the antibodies in the 60&#x02013;80S U3 complexes cannot be excluded.</p><p>The results of gradient sedimentation analyses suggested that hImp3, hImp4 and hMpp10 are efficiently associated with 60&#x02013;80S complexes, at least part of which also contain the U3 snoRNA. U3-containing complexes with a similar sedimentation behavior have been reported by Tyc and Steitz using HeLa cell extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c28">28</xref>). Components of the yeast &#x0223c;80S SSU processome are associated with pre-rRNA (J.E.G.Gallagher and S.J.Baserga, unpublished results) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c42">42</xref>) and these complexes have been suggested to represent the terminal balls seen on nascent pre-rRNA transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c47">47</xref>). Attempts to demonstrate the association of pre-rRNA by immunoprecipitation with anti-hImp and anti-hMpp10 antibodies from 60&#x02013;80S gradient fractions were not successful. This is most likely due to the low abundance of these precursors in the cell and low stability of these RNAs. However, based on recent studies performed in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c42">42</xref>), it is likely that the human U3 complexes sedimenting at 60&#x02013;80S are associated with pre-rRNA precursors.</p><p>Our results are consistent with the formation of a relatively stable trimeric complex of Imp3, Imp4 and Mpp10, which interacts with the U3 snoRNA only when it is associated with higher order complexes. The formation of such a trimeric complex is supported by affinity-purifications using tagged Mpp10p expressed in yeast cells, which yielded Mpp10p, Imp3p and Imp4p and no other SSU processome components (F.Dragon, S.Wormsley and S.J.Baserga, unpublished observations). The efficient association of hImp3, hImp4 and hMpp10 with large complexes suggests a model in which U3 is recruited to the pre-rRNA by virtue of its interaction with this trimeric complex. Alternatively, the association of U3 with pre-rRNA may create or expose the binding site for the hImp3-hImp4-hMpp10 complex.</p><p>Mpp10 association with U3 snoRNA requires sequence elements that are important for base pairing with the 5&#x02032; ETS of the pre-rRNA (S.Granneman, N.J.Watkins, J.Vogelzangs, R.L&#x000fc;hrmann, W.J.van Venrooij and G.J.M.Pruijn, manuscript in preparation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c34">34</xref>). In addition, a C-terminal truncation of the yeast Mpp10p led to cold sensitivity and pre-rRNA processing defects at A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c45">45</xref>). A similar processing defect and growth phenotype has been observed in a yeast strain bearing mutations in box A that block base-pairing with 18S rRNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c13">13</xref>). Thus hMpp10, together with hImp3 and hImp4, might function by facilitating or stabilizing base-pairing interactions between U3 snoRNA and the pre-rRNA.</p><p>Imp3 is believed to mediate the association of the heterotrimeric complex with the U3 snoRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c36">36</xref>). A possible explanation for the partial complementation of the yeast <italic>imp3</italic> null allele by mImp3 would be that this mouse protein is incapable of interacting with the yeast Mpp10p. However, mImp3 interacts in a two-hybrid system with yeast Mpp10p to the same degree as yeast Imp3p (data not shown). The observation that over-expression of the yeast U3 snoRNA also partially alleviated the growth defect indicates that the interactions between mImp3 and the yeast U3 snoRNA may be inefficient, resulting in a growth defect at permissive temperatures.</p></sec><sec><title>Formation of the hImp3-hMpp10-hImp4 complex correlates with the nucleolar localization of these proteins</title><p>Surprisingly, the analysis of deletion mutants showed that the putative RNA binding domains of hImp3 (S4 domain) and hImp4 (&#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>-like motif) are required for their binding to hMpp10 <italic>in vitro</italic>.

Like in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c48">48</xref>), the hU3-55K and the common box C&#x0002f;D snoRNP proteins are associated with the human 12S U3 complex (this work; S.Granneman, N.J.Watkins, J.Vogelzangs, R.L&#x000fc;hrmann, W.J.van Venrooij and G.J.M.Pruijn, manuscript in preparation). However, the majority of the U3-specific proteins in yeast, including Imp3p, Imp4p and Mpp10p, seem to be preferentially or exclusively associated with the U3 snoRNA in higher order complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg300c49">49</xref>).
