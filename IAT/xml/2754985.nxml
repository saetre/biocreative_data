HTLV-1 Tax1 transformed a T-cell line from interleukin (IL)-2-dependent growth to IL-2-independent growth, with an activity that was much more potent in comparison to HTLV-2 Tax2. This distinction was mediated by at least two Tax1 specific functions, an interaction with host cellular factors through the PDZ domain binding motif (PBM) and the activation of NF-kappaB2 (NF-&#x003ba;B2)/p100.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Using a series of Tax1 chimeric proteins with Tax2, we found that amino acids 225-232 of Tax1, the Tax1(225-232) region, was essential for the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B2 as well as for the high transforming activity. The strict amino acid conservation of Tax1(225-232) among HTLV-1 and simian T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (STLV-1), but not HTLV-2 and STLV-2, indicates that function(s) through the Tax1(225-232) region are biologically significant. Interestingly, another HTLV-1 relative, HTLV-3, has a PBM, but does not conserve the Tax1(225-232) motif in Tax3, thus indicating that these two motifs classify the three HTLVs into the separate groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These results suggest that the combinatory functions through Tax1(225-232) and PBM play crucial roles in the distinct biological properties of the three HTLVs, perhaps also including their pathogenesis.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and HTLV-2 are onco-retroviruses, which immortalize human T-cells <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. These immortalizations establish life-long persistent infections in the host. However, only the HTLV-1 infection, but not the HTLV-2 infection, leads to adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), characterized by a massive clonal expansion of the T-cells infected with HTLV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Since only a fraction of HTLV-1 infected individuals (approximately 5%) suffer ATL after a long latency period (60 years on average), the genetic and/or epigenetic changes in the HTLV-1 infected T-cells as well as the deterioration of the host immunity are thought to be prerequisites for ATL development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Therefore, HTLV-2 infection cannot promote some step(s) in these late event(s).</p><p>HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 encode the transforming proteins, Tax1 and Tax2, respectively, whose expression plays a central role in the immortalizations of infected T-cells and their persistent infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Tax1 has multiple functions in T cells, including the activation of cellular genes through the transcription factors NF-&#x003ba;B, AP-1, SRF, and CREB/ATF, and in the inactivation of several tumor suppressor genes, such as p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, these functions do not explain the HTLV-1 specific leukemogenesis, because Tax2 shares them equivalently.</p><p>There is one striking difference between Tax1 and Tax2. Tax1 transforms a mouse T-cell line (CTLL-2) from interleukin(IL)-2 dependent growth to independent growth, and the activity was much more potent in comparison to Tax2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Such activity requires the Tax1-specific activation of the non-canonical NF-&#x003ba;B pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. NF-&#x003ba;B is a family of transcription factors that share the DNA binding Rel homology domain. It includes p105/p50, p65, c-Rel, p100/p52 and RelB. They are generally classified into two groups, the canonical NF-&#x003ba;B (p105/p50, p65, c-Rel) or the non-canonical NF-&#x003ba;B (p100/p52, RelB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The canonical NF-&#x003ba;B pathway is typically activated by inflammatory cytokines such as TNF&#x003b1; and IL-1, thus playing roles in inflammation as well as in apoptosis. In comparison, the non-canonical NF-&#x003ba;B pathway is activated by lymphotoxin &#x003b2;, BAFF, and CD40 ligand, thus playing roles in the development and organogenesis of the lymphoid system. Moreover, both pathways are aberrantly activated in various malignancies, including leukemia and lymphoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>By using a series of Tax1 chimeric proteins with Tax2, we herein show that the Tax1(225-232) region plays a crucial role in the increased transforming activity seen with Tax1 relative to Tax2, mostly through the activation of the non-canonical NF-&#x003ba;B/p100 pathway. Taking into account the fact that the amino acid sequence of Tax1(225-232) is strictly conserved between HTLV-1 and simian T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (STLV-1) but not with HTLV-2 nor STLV-2, these results suggest that function(s) through Tax1(225-232) play crucial roles in the pathogenicity of HTLV-1.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of Tax1 domains responsible for p100 processing</title><p>HTLV-1 Tax1, but not HTLV-2 Tax2, through the processing of NF-&#x003ba;B2/p100 into p52, activates the non-canonical NF-&#x003ba;B pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In order to delineate the domain of Tax1 responsible for NF-&#x003ba;B2/p100 activation, lentiviral vectors expressing a series of Tax1 chimeric proteins with Tax2 subtype B (Tax2B) were used to infect a human T-cell line Jurkat (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). After the normalization of the infections using enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP), which was simultaneously expressed from a bicistronic transcript encoding the <italic>tax1 </italic>genes, the amounts of NF-&#x003ba;B2/p100 and its processed product p52 in the infected cell lysates were determined by Western blot analysis using an anti-p100/p52 antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Tax1 in the Jurkat cells efficiently induced p100 as well as p52 expression relative to the control (EGFP) cells, whereas Tax2 induced only p100 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, lane 2 and lane 10). It should be noted that the induction of p100 by Tax1 and Tax2 are mediated through the canonical NF-&#x003ba;B pathway as discussed previously, and the activities were equivalent to each other (lane 2 and lane 10) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The chimeric Tax1 proteins showed different p100 processing activities and identified two critical regions of Tax1 which are responsible for p100 processing; the first region is located in the Tax1 amino acids 1-154, Tax1(1-154) (compare lane 2 and lane 3), and the second region is located in the Tax1(225-232) region (compare lane 5 and lane 6). All these chimeric proteins, except for Tax2B, were equivalently detected by an anti-Tax1 antibody in Jurkat cells, and they exhibited an equivalent p100 induction. In addition, anti-Tax2B detected the equivalent expression of Tax2B and Tax300 in Jurkat cells (data not shown) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. After processing from p100 into p52, the p52 protein next translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus and then either activates or represses transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. We, thereafter, examined whether Tax1 induces the translocation of p52 into the nucleus by subcellular fractionation assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Tax1, but not Tax2B, was thus found to induce the expression of p52 in the nucleus, and the aforementioned two regions of Tax1, Tax1(1-154) and Tax1(225-232), played crucial roles in the translocation of p52.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>NF-&#x003ba;B2/p100 processing activities of Tax1 chimeric proteins with Tax2</bold>.

In this region, Tax1 has five amino acids that are distinct from Tax2B (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Therefore, they were entirely or partly exchanged with those of Tax2B. The substitution of all five amino acids in Tax1, Tax1<sup>225-232</sup>, prominently reduced the p100 processing activity, and the level was equivalent to that of Tax300 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). However, the substitutions of only the first three or the last two minimally and partially reduced the activities, respectively, although the amount of Tax1<sup>231-232</sup> was reproducibly less in comparison to those of Tax1 or Tax1<sup>225-227</sup>. A subcellular fractionation assay showed that the substitution of all five amino acids in the Tax1(225-232) region prominently decreased the nuclear expression of p52 relative to Tax1. The nuclear expression of p52 induced by Tax1<sup>225-227</sup> and Tax1<sup>231-232</sup> was also less than that seen with Tax1, but this was more than that observed for Tax1<sup>225-232</sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). These results suggested that both Tax1(225-227) and Tax1(231-232) are involved in the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B2/p100.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Tax1(225-232) is involved in the p100 processing</bold>.

Therefore, Tax1 or the indicated mutant plasmids together with the p100 plasmid were co-transfected into an embryonic kidney cell line 293T. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using an anti-p100 antibody, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were characterized with an anti-Tax1 antibody. Consistent with the previous finding, Tax1 but not Tax300 efficiently interacted with p100 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Similar to Tax1, all three Tax1 mutants in the Tax1(225-232) region were efficiently bound to p100, and the affinities were equivalent to that of Tax1, thus indicating that a function in Tax1(225-232) is required for p100 processing and p52 nuclear translocation which is distinct from the interaction with p100.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Tax1 mutants in the Tax1(225-232) region interact with p100</bold>.

We previously showed that Tax1 transformed CTLL-2 and induced IL-2-independent growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and that the activity was severely diminished by reducing the NF-&#x003ba;B2/p100 protein through RNA interference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In order to examine the role of the Tax1(225-232) region in the transforming activity, CTLL-2 cells were transduced with the lentivirus vectors encoding the Tax1 mutants used above (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>), and they were cultured in the absence of IL-2 for four weeks.

On the other hand, the transforming activities of all three mutants in the Tax1(225-232) region were much lower in comparison to Tax1.

Tax154 and Tax184 showed a much higher transforming activity in comparison to Tax300. However, the activity was reproducibly lower in comparison to Tax1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). On the other hand, Tax207, with an equivalent p100 processing activity to Tax154 or Tax184, exhibited a deteriorated transforming activity, thus suggesting that Tax1 amino acid 185-207 represents another distinction from Tax2B in the transformation process. To clarify this issue, the amino acids 185-207 in Tax1 were exchanged with those of Tax2B, and the transforming activity was examined (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Unexpectedly, all three Tax1 mutants in this region exhibited transforming activities that were higher in comparison to Tax1. These results suggest that the simultaneous exchange of the Tax1(1-184) and Tax1(185-207) regions with those of the Tax2B regions, but not the exchange of either one, reduces the transforming activity, and that the Tax1(185-207) region by itself has a negative function for the transforming activity. The amino acid sequences of Tax1(185-207) resemble the leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES). The Tax1 mutants of this motif did not alter the subcellular localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. However, they were found to localize exclusively in the cytoplasm after the deletion of the C-terminal regions to this motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Based on this information, we changed Tax1 amino acid Leu200 to Ala, which abrogated the cryptic NES function in the previous study (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Similar to Tax1<sup>185-207</sup> and Tax1<sup>198-207</sup>, Tax1(Leu<sup>200</sup>-Ala) also exhibited greater transforming activity in comparison to the wild-type protein. Unfortunately, Tax1(L<sup>191-195</sup>-A) was unstable in CTLL-2, and was excluded from consideration. Taken together, these results suggest that the Tax1(185-227) region negatively regulates the transforming activity of Tax1, and the activity might be associated with the cryptic NES function.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>The transforming activities of the Tax1 chimeric proteins with Tax2B</bold>.

Since the amino acid sequence of Tax1(225-232) is strictly conserved in HTLV-1 and STLV-1, but not in HTLV-2 and STLV-2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9A</xref>), the present study indicates that the function(s) observed in the Tax1(225-232) region, such as NF-&#x003ba;B2/p100 activation play significant roles in the distinct transforming activity of Tax1 compared to Tax2B, and could thus influence the pathogenesis of HTLV-1.</p><fig position="float" id="F9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p><bold>(A) The amino acid sequences of the Tax(224-243) region from HTLVs and STLVs</bold>.

The amino acid sequences were obtained from a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. (B) The amino acid sequences in the C-terminal ends of the respective Tax protein are shown. The PBMs are surrounded by squares.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1742-4690-6-83-9"/></fig><p>We initially expected that Tax1(225-232) was involved in the interaction with p100. However, this hypothesis was not supported (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Therefore, it is unclear precisely what role Tax1(225-232) plays in the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B2. We believed that further analyses will provide better insights into the mechanism by which Tax1 activates the alternative NF-&#x003ba;B pathway.</p><p>Tax207 exhibited a much reduced transforming activity in CTLL-2 than Tax184 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>), thus suggesting that the Tax1(185-207) region plays a positive role in cellular transformation. However, Tax1<sup>185-207</sup>, a Tax1 mutant with the Tax2B(185-207) region, exhibited slightly higher transforming activity than Tax1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Therefore, it is unclear how the Tax1(1-207) region in the context of Tax1 has a positive function for cellular transformation. Alternatively, the Tax2B(1-207) region in the context of Tax207 might possess an inhibitory activity against cellular transformation.</p><p>A previous study showed that the Tax1 mutation (L<sup>200</sup>-A) abrogated the cryptic NES activity, which was observed only after the deletion of the C-terminal Tax1 region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The same mutant exhibited a transforming activity higher than wild-type Tax1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). In addition, three Tax1 chimeric proteins with Tax2B in this NES region also augmented the transforming activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Since Tax2 also has the cryptic NES in this region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], it is unlikely that the NES activity by itself has an inhibitory activity toward the transforming activity. Although the mechanism is unclear in the present study, one feasible explanation is that the cellular factors regulating the Tax1-specific cryptic NES activity has a negative function for the transformation. However, a further analysis is required to establish this mechanism.</p><p>Tax2B transforms a rat fibroblast cell line Rat-1, thus causing it to induce colonies in soft agar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], but this activity was lower in comparison to that of Tax1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. However, unlike CTLL-2, a Tax2B fusion with Tax1 PBM or Tax300 transformed Rat-1 with an equivalent efficiency to Tax1. Therefore, the functions through the Tax1(225-232) region may be constitutively active in Rat-1, or they may not be needed in the transformation of Rat-1. In support of the former hypothesis, NF-&#x003ba;B2/p100 in Rat-1 was found to be constitutively active without Tax1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>Recently, novel HTLV family members HTLV-3 and HTLV-4 were isolated in Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], although it is unclear whether HTLV-3 and HTLV-4 are associated with any particular disease such as leukemia. The amino acid sequence and the functional analysis of HTLV-3 Tax3 showed that Tax3 has a functional PBM, and is capable of interacting with a PDZ domain protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Interestingly, the Tax3(225-232) regions of HTLV-3 as well as simian T-cell leukemia virus type 3 did not show any similarity to that of Tax1, and they were more similar to that of Tax2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). On the other hand, HTLV-4 Tax4 does not have a PBM, while it also shows a higher amino acid similarity to Tax2 in the Tax(225-241) region than others. Therefore, the PBM and the Tax1(225-241) motif can classify the four HTLVs into three or four separate groups. We believe that the characterizations of these two motifs of Tax will unveil the functions associated with the respective pathogenesis of the different viruses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cells and cell culture conditions</title><p>CTLL-2 is a mouse cytotoxic T-cell line, the growth of which is dependent on interleukin-2 (IL-2).
