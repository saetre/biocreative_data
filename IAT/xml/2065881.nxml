To study the role of NRs in development, it is critically important to know when and where individual genes are expressed. Although systematic expression studies using reverse transcriptase PCR and/or DNA microarrays have been performed in classical model systems such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mouse, no systematic atlas describing NR involvement during embryonic development on a global scale has been assembled. Adopting a systems biology approach, we conducted a systematic analysis of the dynamic spatiotemporal expression of all NR genes as well as their main transcriptional coregulators during zebrafish development (101 genes) using whole-mount in situ hybridization. This extensive dataset establishes overlapping expression patterns among NRs and coregulators, indicating hierarchical transcriptional networks. This complete developmental profiling provides an unprecedented examination of expression of NRs during embryogenesis, uncovering their potential function during central nervous system and retina formation. Moreover, our study reveals that tissue specificity of hormone action is conferred more by the receptors than by their coregulators. Finally, further evolutionary analyses of this global resource led us to propose that neofunctionalization of duplicated genes occurs at the levels of both protein sequence and RNA expression patterns. Altogether, this expression database of NRs provides novel routes for leading investigation into the biological function of each individual NR as well as for the study of their combinatorial regulatory circuitry within the superfamily.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>NRs are key molecules controlling development, metabolism, and reproduction in metazoans. Since NRs are implicated in many human diseases such as cancer, metabolic syndrome, and hormone resistance, they are important pharmaceutical targets and are under intense scrutiny to better understand their biological functions. In the present study, we determined the expression patterns of all NR genes as well as their main transcriptional coregulators during zebrafish development. We used zebrafish because the transparency of its embryo allows us to perform whole-mount in situ hybridization from early development to late organogenesis. This complete developmental profiling offers an unprecedented view of NR expression during embryogenesis, uncovering their potential function during central nervous system and retina formation. We observed that in contrast to NR genes, only a few coregulators exhibit a restricted expression pattern, suggesting that tissue specificity of hormone action is conferred more by the receptors than by their coregulators. Lastly, by evolutionary analysis of expression pattern divergence of duplicated genes, we observed that neofunctionalization occurs at the levels of both protein sequence and mRNA expression patterns. Taken together, our data provide the starting point for functional analysis of an entire gene family during development and call for the study of the intersection between metabolism and development.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Bertrand S, Thisse B, Tavares R, Sachs L, Chaumot A, et al.

Several small lipophilic molecules, including steroids, thyroid hormones, and retinoids, function by binding members of this superfamily.

With a few exceptions, such as DAX and SHP in vertebrates, all NRs show a common structural organization with a highly conserved DNA-binding domain, and a less conserved ligand-binding domain.

However, for studying the implications of NRs in development, it is critically important to know when and where individual genes are expressed. This is why we have established the complete spatiotemporal profiles of the expression of all NR genes during embryonic development using the zebrafish as a model system, because the optical transparancy of its embryo allows studies of gene expression with a cellular resolution using whole-mount in situ hybridization &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Other studies have been performed on NR expression during embryonic development in vertebrates, mainly in mouse, rat, chicken, and <italic>Xenopus</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. However, most of them are partial and only describe expression by northern blot analysis or by in situ hybridization restricted to one organ or a few developmental stages for a limited number of genes. Moreover, for many NRs, expression during development was only studied regarding their roles in the adult, therefore introducing a bias in the interpretation of the data.</p><p>To carry out this large-scale project, we isolated all 70 NR genes in zebrafish plus 31 of their coactivators and corepressors. We analyzed the expression of these 101 genes from gastrula to early larval stages by whole-mount in situ hybridization. This allowed us to detect extensive correlation of expression between NR genes and their coregulators. Our results reinforce the notion that NRs are mainly expressed during organogenesis, with few of them expressed at early developmental stages. Our most unexpected finding is that the large majority of NR genes are expressed during central nervous system (CNS) and retina development, since classically, the primary role NRs was thought to be metabolism control in endodermal derivatives &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;.

An ortholog of RAR&#x003b2; was found in the complete pufferfish genomes but was apparently lost in zebrafish. Thus far, neither LXR&#x003b2; nor CAR has been described in any fish. Because it is always difficult to decide on the absence of a gene in a given genome, especially when the complete genome sequence is not published, we performed additional RT-PCR and PCR experiments on various tissues and/or DNA preparations with several primer pairs for these genes. We nevertheless cannot formally rule out that we artifactually missed a specific duplicate.</p><p>It is now clearly established that actinopterygians underwent a complete genome duplication &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;.

Eighty percent of these duplications are shared with pufferfish. For clarity, we name these duplicates with capital letters after the gene name: PPAR&#x003b1;-A and PPAR&#x003b1;-B are thus the two duplicates of PPAR&#x003b1;. Our phylogenetic analysis also reveals five NR paralogues that have no counterparts in mammals. These genes are Rev-erb&#x003b3;, COUP-TF&#x003b3;, ERR&#x003b4;, FF1C, a member of the FTZ-F1 family, and HNF4&#x003b2;.

In addition, all genes expressed in the retina, except for TR&#x003b2;, are also expressed in the brain and/or in the anterior spinal cord.</p><fig id="pgen-0030188-g003" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Expression of NR genes in the CNS</title><p>(A&#x02013;D) Expression in retina, optic tectum, and hindbrain of RAR&#x003b1;-A, Reverb&#x003b1;, Reverb&#x003b2;, and Reverb&#x003b3;-B, respectively.

COUPTF&#x003b1;-A is expressed in the ventral part of the diencephalon, in forebrain ventricular zone, in tegmentum, and hindbrain (K), COUPTF&#x003b2; displays a similar expression with additional expression in the dorsal half of the diencephalon (L).

NURR1 is expressed in part of the telencephalon, in a nucleus in anterior diencephalon, in posterior diencephalon and anterior tegmentum, and in the ventral anterior part of rhombencephalon (S). NOR1 is expressed weakly in ventral telencephalon, tegmentum, and hindbrain and strongly in the habenula (T), SF1-A, LRH1, and SF1-B are expressed strongly in the ventral diencephalon (U&#x02013;W).

We found 40&#x00025; to 54&#x00025; of these genes expressed in the CNS between 24 and 48hpf, whereas for NR genes, this percentage rose to 71&#x00025;. Eleven percent to 37&#x00025; of genes were expressed in the retina, whereas 30&#x00025; to 59&#x00025; NR genes were expressed in the same organ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030188-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Therefore, even if many genes are indeed expressed in CNS and retina, NR genes tend to be expressed more often than expected in these organs.</p><p>In contrast, some organs or tissues express very few NR genes in a restricted manner. This is the case for the lens, blood, somites, and heart, even if these organs express the NRs that show a ubiquitous expression pattern. Phenotypic analyses of mouse knockouts, as well as studies on the implication of NRs in human diseases, have suggested a major role for NRs in the control of homeostasis, and specifically in lipid metabolism, including cholesterol and steroid metabolism (see &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d; for a review). These processes occur in organs such as liver, intestine, pancreas, and adipose tissue, all of which are endodermal derivatives, as well as in the adrenal gland, which is derived from neural crest cells. Looking at NR expression in these organs, we found, at various stages, VDR-B, EAR2-B, and FF1C expressed in the intestinal bulb, whereas FXR&#x003b1;, ER&#x003b2;-A, and LRH1 were found in the liver. In addition, three genes, PPAR&#x003b2;-A, PXR and HNF4&#x003b1;, were detected in both organs. Therefore, we are confident that we did not miss expression of NR genes in endodermal tissues before 5 d of development. The case of PXR, which in mammals is restricted to endodermal derivatives, nicely illustrates this point. In zebrafish, we found this gene expressed at 24 hpf in the pituitary and at 36 hpf with a complex pattern in the telencephalon and diencephalon (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030188-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). At 48 hpf, expression remains in the CNS but is also found at a relatively low level in intestine and liver. This demonstrates the power of whole-mount in situ screens in revealing heretofore unsuspected expression patterns. Recently, two analyses of genes of the NR2E, RAR, and RXR groups also revealed extensive expression in retina and CNS, globally supporting our findings &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Another well-known target of NRs in mammals is the sexual organs. Sex determination is a complex and late event in zebrafish and sexual organs are not yet differentiated at the stages examined by whole-mount in situ hybridization. We thus cannot discuss the eventual implication of NRs genes in differentiation of sexual organs in this species and this may account for the lack of expression of AR, PR, and ER&#x003b1; that we noticed in our study. However, at the studied stages, primordial germ cells are present in the embryo and migrate along the body axis, but we did not detect specific NR expression (e.g., GCNFs) in these cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Differential Expression of NR Genes in the Retina</title><p>Because we found frequent and complex restricted expression in the developing retina, we performed high-resolution analysis at 72 hpf, when the retina is already well differentiated.

At 72 hpf, the retina is divided into three main layers: the outer nuclear layer (ONL) containing cell bodies of photoreceptors, the inner nuclear layer (INL) which contains four classes of interneurons (amacrine, bipolar, horizontal and interplexiform) as well as M&#x000fc;ller glia, and finally the ganglion cell layer (GCL), which contains ganglion cells.</p><fig id="pgen-0030188-g004" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Expression of NR Genes in Retina at 72 hpf</title><p>(A) Schematic of a zebrafish eye at 72 hpf showing the characteristic multilayered structure.

TR&#x003b2;, PNR, COUP-TF&#x003b1;-B are only expressed in the ONL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030188-g004">Figure 4</xref>B).

COUP-TF&#x003b2; and EAR2-B are expressed in an asymmetric manner in the dorsal part of the INL and the ONL, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030188-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). COUP-TF&#x003b3; shows expression in the ventral part of these two layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030188-g004">Figure 4</xref>E). TLL expression is not restricted to a specific layer of the retina, but is associated with cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030188-g004">Figure 4</xref>F) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. Finally, the remaining 15 NRs are expressed in more than one layer and often ubiquitously. All these data highlight a diversity of NR gene expression in the retina suggesting that these genes may be implicated in a wide variety of processes.</p><p>The fact that the retina expresses a large proportion of the members of the NR superfamily has not been noticed in other vertebrates. This may be due to the fact that no global spatiotemporal expression pattern study of this superfamily has been performed with whole-mount in situ hybridization in mammals or <italic>Xenopus</italic>, or that there are specific differences between mammals and zebrafish concerning NR gene expression in the retina. We thus specifically verified if the genes that are expressed in the zebrafish retina are implicated in retinal development in other vertebrates. By an extensive survey of the literature, we found that among the ten genes that express in specific cell layers or cell types in the retina, four (TR&#x003b2;, PNR, ROR&#x003b2;, and TLL) are known to be important for retina development in mammals. Indeed, retinal phenotypes in knockout mice and mutations in human diseases have been associated with these genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b033">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, expression in the retina has been observed in other vertebrates for five more genes: NURR1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b036">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;, ERR&#x003b3; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;, COUP-TF&#x003b3;, COUP-TF&#x003b2;, and EAR2 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b040">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. Finally only one of these genes, COUP-TF&#x003b1;-B is expressed in zebrafish retina, while its mammalian counterpart is not &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;. We noticed that some genes ubiquitously expressed in the zebrafish retina (Rev-erb and ROR) have also been described as expressed in the mammalian retina &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;. Taken together, our data strongly suggest that some receptors have a conserved role in vertebrate retinal development and that the importance of this organ for the study of NR biological functions has been largely overlooked. This nicely illustrates the power of large expression screens, such as the one we performed here, in unraveling potential functions of NRs in specific organs.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Expression of Coregulators</title><p>In striking contrast with NR genes, most of the CoA/CoR we studied show ubiquitous expression (CBP-A, CBP-B, P300-A, P300-B, BRG1, PCAF, NCoA6, Baf 53, SRC1, SRC2, NCoA4, Baf 60, N-CoR, Alien, Sin3A, HDAC1, HDAC3, and TIF1&#x003b1;) or do not display embryonic expression that could be detected by whole-mount in situ hybridization (TRAP220, MYST-HAT2, TRIP13, and ARA54) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030188-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). In fact, only 30&#x00025; of the coregulators (SRC3, RIP140-A, RIP140-B, PGC1, TRIP7, TIF1&#x003b3;, Cited3, CARM1, SMRT, and HDAC4) show a spatially restricted expression pattern, suggesting that tissue specificity of hormone action is conferred more by the receptors than by their coregulators. Apart from TIF1&#x003b3;, which is expressed in ventral hematopoietic mesoderm &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;, all other spatially restricted coregulator genes are expressed in the CNS, stressing again the importance of NR signaling in this organ.</p><p>Among the ten spatially restricted coregulators, we found expression territories that do not correlate with expression of spatially restricted NRs. For example, HDAC4 is expressed in trigeminal ganglia and PGC1 and RIP140-A are expressed in several cranial ganglia, whereas RIP140-B is specifically expressed in the habenula. Some of the coregulators, namely HDAC4, Cited3, CARM1, SMRT, and RIP140-B, also show restricted expression in the retina. It should be noted that TRIP7 is expressed in the lens, where only EAR2-B is expressed in a restricted manner. We also observe expression of SMRT at 5 dpf in the thymus, where we did not find any expression of spatially restricted NR genes. These data support in vivo the notion that coregulators mediate the action of transcription factors other than NRs.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Identification of Overlapping Expression Patterns</title><p>Our systematic analysis revealed extensive similarities of expression patterns between NRs and their coregulators. For example, in the p160 family, which contains three members (SRC1, SCR2, and SRC3), SRC3 shows a restricted expression that is reminiscent of that of RXRs and RARs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030188-sg005">Figure S5</xref>) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. This gene is mainly expressed in anterior spinal cord, posterior branchial arches, and tail bud, suggesting possible RAR/RXR interactions with SRC3 in these territories.</p><p>PGC1 is another coactivator showing a striking correlation of expression with certain NR genes. This gene was identified by its direct interaction with PPAR&#x003b3; and was later shown to be important for other NRs, including ERR&#x003b1;, TRs, and RXRs (for a review, see &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;). In zebrafish, PGC1 shows a very specific expression pattern in adaxial cells, pronephric ducts, and mucous cells during somitogenesis, and in the epiphysis, olfactory bulb, diencephalic nuclei, hindbrain, heart, pronephric ducts, mucous cells, and slow muscle fibers at 24 hpf. Overall, this expression pattern overlaps extensively with those of the ERR genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030188-g005">Figure 5</xref>). During somitogenesis stages, ERR&#x003b1; is expressed in adaxial cells, pronephric ducts, and mucous cells, ERR&#x003b2; and ERR&#x003b3; are expressed in pronephric ducts, while ERR&#x003b2;/&#x003b3; is expressed in mucous cells. At 24 hpf, PGC1 expression overlaps with that of ERR&#x003b1; in pronephric ducts, in slow muscle fibers, of ERR&#x003b2; in pronephric ducts, epiphysis and in diencephalic nucleus, of ERR&#x003b3; in epiphysis and diencephalic nucleus and of ERR&#x003b2;/&#x003b3; in the mucous cells.

Similarly, cluster II can be divided into an early nervous system (IIa) and an early non-nervous system organs (IIb) subcluster.

We compared the protein sequences of the 19 NR gene pairs to the protein sequence of a nonduplicated outgroup (<named-content content-type="genus-species">Homo sapiens</named-content>) and found that the ratios of the evolution rates of the duplicated proteins varied from 1.01 (i.e., similar rates) to 6.1. Because the outgroup is very distant, only strong differences in the evolution rate can be detected and evaluated as statistically significant, making our results conservative. We found a significant acceleration of the protein evolution rate (i.e., a ratio significantly different from 1), relative to the nonduplicated sequence of the outgroup, for eight out of the 19 gene pairs (<italic>p</italic>-values &#x0003c; 0.01 in seven out of the eight cases and a <italic>p</italic>-value &#x0003d; 0.03 in the remaining one). An alternative explanation for the asymmetry in the evolution rates would be the genomic context, as proposed by Zhang and Kishino &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b063">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b064">64</xref>&#x0005d;. When two copies have different recombination rates, the copy in the low recombination context accumulates deleterious substitutions because of Hill&#x02013;Robertson effects (degeneration) and thus will evolve faster than the copy in the high recombination context. We have controlled for this effect by estimating, when possible, the recombination rates of the two genes in each pair (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030188-st004">Table S4</xref>). The recombination rates were estimated by comparing genetic and physical maps of the zebrafish genome (A. Popa, personal communication). In three out of the eight cases of asymmetrical evolution rates between duplicates, this estimation was not possible at least for one of the genes. Out of the five remaining pairs, only one presented a difference in the recombination rates of the duplicates compatible with the asymmetry in their evolution rates (SHP-A/SHP-B), which suggests that the vast majority of the asymmetrically evolving pairs truly evolved through the neofunctionalization model.</p><p>We then looked further into this asymmetric evolution of the duplicates by evaluating their expression pattern divergence. Doing this in a quantitative manner allowed us to investigate if there was any correlation between sequence evolution and the evolution of the expression patterns after duplication. The divergence of the expression patterns of the duplicates varied from 0 (same expression pattern found for both genes, e.g., RXR&#x003b2;, an almost ubiquitously expressed pair detected in 162 out of 165 organs considered in the analysis or PPAR&#x003b1;, a nondetected pair) to 1 (almost completely different expression patterns of the two genes; e.g., SHP-A is detected in only four of the 165 organs and SHP-B is not detected, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030188-st002">Table S2</xref>). We computed the sequence divergence between duplicates by calculating the ratio between nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (Ka/Ks) between the coding sequences. The Ka/Ks ratio can only be calculated for 17 of the 19 pairs of genes because in two cases (SHP and ROR&#x003b3;) the Ks was saturated. Because all the gene duplicates are from the same duplication event (fish-specific genome duplication), differences in Ks values reflect different mutation rates within the genome. By dividing Ka by Ks we corrected for the influence of these mutation rate differences in the evolution of the coding sequence.</p><p>Strikingly, we observed a significant positive correlation (Pearson correlation factor <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> &#x0003d; 0.69 and <italic>p</italic>-value &#x0003d; 0.04) between the expression divergence and the sequence divergence of the duplicates belonging to the pairs (six) where a neofunctionalization is suggested by the asymmetrical evolutionary rates of the proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030188-g007">Figure 7</xref>B). This means that the divergence of the coding sequence was accompanied by a divergence of the regulatory sequences. No significant correlation between the expression divergence and the sequence divergence was found for the pairs (11) with similar evolutionary rates (a positive but nonsignificant correlation may be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030188-g007">Figure 7</xref>B).</p><fig id="pgen-0030188-g007" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Relative Rates of Protein Evolution, Coding Sequence Divergence, and Expression Pattern Divergence of the Fish-Specific NR Duplicates</title><p>(A) Phylogenetic view of the relative evolutionary rates of the zebrafish duplicates.

Sullivan and Thummel &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d; have conducted a northern blot analysis of all 21 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila melanogaster</named-content> NRs from egg to adulthood. A systematic quantitative PCR analysis of expression of 49 NR genes in 39 adult tissues and at several circadian times has been reported in the mouse &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. These studies revealed NR gene coordinated transcriptional programs in developmental and physiological pathways. Analyzing transcript expression at the tissue level with quantitative PCR or northern blots has the advantage of providing a quantitative measure of transcript abundance. Coupled with hierarchical clustering of the data, this allowed the division of the NR regulatory network in the mouse into two main processes: reproduction, development, and growth on the one hand, and nutrient uptake, metabolism, and excretion on the other. Our analysis of embryonic and larval expression patterns, studied by whole-mount in situ hybridization, allows a direct visualization of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the NR superfamily during development. Our study thus nicely complements these previous global analyses by providing, with unprecedented details, a complete dataset of the embryonic territories where NR-mediated regulation is likely to be deployed.</p><p>Our data also allow the definition at the global scale of groups of genes expressed in similar locations at several developmental stages and thus highlight the potential transcriptional hierarchies of NRs and coregulators that occur during development. Clustering of the tissues expressing NR and coregulator genes into three main groups according to developmental timing and nature (neural/nonneural) of the tissue supports the notion that NR regulation is used differently during embryonic development. There is no extensive overlap between the seven clusters we defined and those found by Bookhout and colleagues &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. This suggests that the underlying logic of NR deployment during embryonic development in zebrafish and in the adult mouse is different. Nevertheless, one should keep in mind that the two datasets are different (qualitative versus quantitative data and embryonic versus adult stages) and are thus difficult to compare. The detection of groups of coexpressed genes suggests that some crossregulation might occur between NR genes and/or their coregulators. The ERR-PGC1 and RAR-RXR-SRC3 groups provide good examples of these potential hubs. Future comparison of the expression patterns reported here with those issued from large-scale gene expression analyses will undoubtedly provide relevant information on NR-regulated networks that control embryonic development.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Implication for Human Diseases</title><p>Our exhaustive expression screen reveals that many NRs known to be tightly linked to the control of metabolism in adults are expressed during embryogenesis (e.g., PXR, HNF4&#x003b1;, RXRs, COUP-TFs, and ERRs as well as several coactivators such as PGC1, CITED3, and RIP140).</p><p>It is important to stress that most of the expression patterns we describe here are conserved in vertebrates. Given that the methods used to determine expression during development differ from one model organism to another (e.g., tissue sections in mouse, whole-mount in situ in zebrafish, and <italic>Xenopus</italic>), and that only a minority of these NR genes have been studied in several organisms, an exhaustive global comparative analysis of the expression patterns is not yet feasible. Nevertheless, of 26 genes for which data are available, we found 22 cases of complete (TR&#x003b1;-A, TR&#x003b1;-B, PPAR&#x003b2;-A, PPAR&#x003b2;-B, VDR, HNF4&#x003b1;, RXR&#x003b2;-A, RXR&#x003b2;-B, TLL, NURR1, SF1-A, SF1-B, LRH1, and GCNF-A) or partial (TR&#x003b2;, RAR&#x003b1;-A, RAR&#x003b1;-B, RAR&#x003b3;-A, RAR&#x003b3;-B, RXR&#x003b1;-A, RXR&#x003b1;-B, and COUP-TF&#x003b2;) conservation of expression, whereas in only four cases (PPAR&#x003b1;-A, PPAR&#x003b1;-B, PXR, and RXR&#x003b3;) we found very different expression patterns between zebrafish and other vertebrates. Therefore, we are confident that most of the data we generated will be transferable to mammals and will thus be relevant for the study of human diseases.</p><p>Both epidemiological and clinical evidence suggests that prenatal factors play a role in the origin of the metabolic syndrome and its components: hypertension, insulin resistance, obesity, and dyslipidemia (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b065">65</xref>&#x0005d;). Experimental studies demonstrate that an adverse embryonic or fetal environment can induce structural and functional abnormalities in pancreatic islet cells and can lead to permanent changes in insulin sensitivity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b066">66</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, any developmental perturbation that would affect NR expression and/or the production of NR ligands may be transferred to the NR gene regulatory hierarchy and may impact embryonic development and later on adult physiology and metabolism. Indeed, it is easy to induce insulin resistance and symptoms of the metabolic syndrome by manipulating maternal nutrition (an event that could easily affect NR ligand production) or by exposing the mother to synthetic glucocorticoids &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b067">67</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b069">69</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore, relating the embryonic expression of NRs, including classical pharmacological targets like TR, RAR, RXR, and PXR, to specific developmental processes will help to better understand the mechanisms of the development of metabolic syndrome. Our data provide a unique basis from which to begin such an analysis.</p><p>Our expression analysis can also be used to identify roles of certain NR or coregulator genes in specific human diseases. For example, since an unexpected number of them are expressed in retina, it could be fruitful to search for their implication in the development of retinal diseases. There are still a large number of mapped but unidentified Mendelian human retinal diseases, some of which match to the chromosomal location of the NR genes, which we found expressed in the retina. For example, we found both RXR&#x003b1; and Rev-erb&#x003b1; in the retina and both have a chromosomal location in humans (17q) that corresponds to the one detected for a specific retina disease, CORD4 (Cone Rod Dystrophy 4) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b070">70</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In sum, this expression screen, performed on a species that resembles humans on the level of organization and physiology and on a protein superfamily that can easily be targeted by drugs, will provide important new information for the identification of interesting targets for drug discovery.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Analysis of NR Gene Duplication</title><p>The importance of neofunctionalization following gene duplication has been continuously discussed in the literature since Ohno proposed that it was the main mechanism allowing phenotypic diversity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b071">71</xref>&#x0005d;.

Here, our analysis revealed that 42&#x00025; of the 19 NR gene pairs analyzed evolved at different rates (when compared with an orthologous single copy outgroup). Furthermore, the retention of gene duplicates among the NR family (36&#x00025;) is also higher than the one estimated for the whole genome after the fish whole-genome duplication (15&#x00025; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b074">74</xref>&#x0005d;). This is consistent with a higher gene retention after duplication and the presence of neofunctionalization, both of which have been reported in regulatory/development-implicated gene families &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b074">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b076">76</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b078">78</xref>&#x0005d; (e.g., NRs) compared with other functional classes of genes.</p><p>Finally, we also observed a significant positive correlation between coding sequence divergence and expression pattern divergence for the asymmetrical evolving gene pairs. Coupled evolution between coding and regulatory sequences was previously found for single-copy genes, between orthologs of <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. yakuba</named-content> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b079">79</xref>&#x0005d; and of <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. briggsae</named-content> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b080">80</xref>&#x0005d;. In our case, this parallel evolution between coding and regulatory sequences suggests that neofunctionalization affected both the protein function and the expression pattern of the gene. For instance, the evolution rate of GCNF-B is more than two times that of GCNF-A, suggesting that GCNF-B evolved under positive selection, thus acquiring a new function. This is consistent with the divergence of GCNF-B expression patterns suggestive of neofunctionalization: as is the case for the protein sequence, it seems that GCNF-A has kept the ancestral expression pattern, whereas GCNF-B has acquired a new one. It can be hypothesized that following expression divergence of a pair of duplicated genes, the gene that is expressed in novel embryonic territories will accumulate mutations in its coding region more rapidly, because the cognate protein will be exposed to a novel set of interaction partners.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Metabolism and Development</title><p>One of the striking results of our screen is the widespread expression of NR genes in the nervous system: at 36 hpf, 70&#x00025; of the spatially restricted NRs are expressed in the CNS, whereas 40&#x00025; of them are expressed in the retina. This represents an underestimation, because ubiquitously expressed NR genes may also play an important role in these organs. Indeed, the expression of the zebrafish HDAC1 gene is widespread in the embryo at all stages of development, whereas this gene plays an important role in the anterior CNS by maintaining neurogenesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b081">81</xref>&#x0005d;. The developmental role played by these genes is perhaps not connected to their adult function in regulating metabolism, but it has to be emphasized that many other observations focus on an unanticipated link between the control of metabolism and nervous system development. In fact, several large-scale expression screens have revealed expression of metabolic enzymes, cholesterol and fatty acid transport proteins, and hormonal receptors in embryos, even during early embryogenesis. In zebrafish, the brain-type fatty acid binding proteins FABP7a and FABP7b, which intracellularly bind to docosahexaneoic acid (DHA), an RXR ligand &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b082">82</xref>&#x0005d;, are distributed in the early developing CNS, retina, pharynx, and swim bladder &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b083">83</xref>&#x0005d;. Similarly, a fatty acid hydroxylase (FA2H) is expressed in enveloping layer, pronephric ducts, nose, pharynx, liver, and gut during embryonic development &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b084">84</xref>&#x0005d;. In a recent genome-scale analysis of genes expressed during mouse retina development, prominent expression of metabolic enzymes has been observed in specific cell types, such as the M&#x000fc;ller glia &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030188-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. The reasons for such a widespread spatiotemporal control of metabolic genes may be linked to a variable metabolic demand of developing organs or cell compartments related to differential proliferation or differentiation. Alternatively, metabolic proteins could play a specific developmental role. In the case of NR genes, we have at present no specific indication that, for example, the restricted expression of PXR in specific areas of the zebrafish CNS is linked to its detoxification function in adult liver. Another possibility is that metabolic enzymes may be implicated in the production or delivery of signaling molecules. This is of course the case for the CYP26, retinaldehyde dehydrogenases, CRBP, and CRABP, the molecules implicated in retinoid metabolism and transport in vertebrate embryos. Clearly, the evidence that continues to accumulate from various experimental model systems suggests that metabolism should no longer be disconnected from the study of embryonic development.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Isolation of NR and coregulator partial cDNAs.</title><p>Given the unknown expression patterns of most of NR genes in zebrafish, we used total RNA extracted from various adult tissues (muscle, gills, liver, etc.) as well as from embryos at different developmental stages.

NRs are represented bound to their response element in the promoter region of a target gene. The coregulators can be associated in three main types of complexes, namely the SWI/SNF complex, which remodels chromatin structure; the CBP/P300-PCAF complex, which possesses histone deacetylase activity; and the TRAP/DRIP/SMCC complex, also called the mediator complex, which interacts with the basal transcription machinery. In addition, the figure depicts the NCoR/SMRT corepressor complex, which harbors histone deacetylase activity. The other coregulators implicated in mediating NR activity that are not part of one of these complexes but have also been incorporated in this study are presented at the bottom left of the figure.</p><p>(223 KB JPG)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.0030188.sg002.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen-0030188-sg003"><label>Figure S3</label><caption><title>Spatiotemporal Expression Pattern of All Members of the NR superfamily (70 Genes) and of Their Main Coregulators (31 Genes)</title><p>Expression patterns of these 101 genes are described on each panel by a full annotation of the anatomical structures expressing these genes at the different developmental stages.
