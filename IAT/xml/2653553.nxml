We report a strong PrP loss-of-function phenotype in zebrafish embryos, characterized by the loss of embryonic cell adhesion and arrested gastrulation. Zebrafish and mouse PrP mRNAs can partially rescue this knockdown phenotype, indicating conserved PrP functions. Using zebrafish, mouse, and <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, we show that PrP: (1) mediates Ca<sup>&#x0002b;2</sup>-independent homophilic cell adhesion and signaling; and (2) modulates Ca<sup>&#x0002b;2</sup>-dependent cell adhesion by regulating the delivery of E-cadherin to the plasma membrane. In vivo time-lapse analyses reveal that the arrested gastrulation in PrP knockdown embryos is due to deficient morphogenetic cell movements, which rely on E-cadherin&#x02013;based adhesion. Cell-transplantation experiments indicate that the regulation of embryonic cell adhesion by PrP is cell-autonomous. Moreover, we find that the local accumulation of PrP at cell contact sites is concomitant with the activation of Src-related kinases, the recruitment of reggie/flotillin microdomains, and the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, consistent with a role of PrP in the modulation of cell adhesion via signaling. Altogether, our data uncover evolutionarily conserved roles of PrP in cell communication, which ultimately impinge on the stability of adherens cell junctions during embryonic development.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Unlike conventional pathogens, prions are infectious particles devoid of nucleic acids and composed entirely of a misfolded host protein, PrP. It is widely assumed that the neurodegeneration observed in prion disorders may be related to an aberrant function of PrP in the misfolded state. However, the normal physiological function of PrP remains poorly understood, mainly owing to the absence of clear phenotypes in mice lacking PrP. Here, we show that when PrP is depleted in zebrafish embryos, dramatic phenotypes ensue, severely affecting the development of early and late (neural) structures. We examined the mechanisms responsible for some of these defects, and found that fish and mammalian PrPs play conserved roles in cell&#x02013;cell communication, by directly mediating cell adhesion and by triggering cellular signals that further modulate the function of other adhesion molecules. In the early zebrafish embryo, these activities control not only tissue integrity and cell morphology, but also the complex cellular movements that give rise to germ layers. This study describes&#x02014;to our knowledge&#x02014;the first known in vivo function of PrP and its molecular cellular basis, which may provide helpful insights into the role of PrP in the adult brain and its proposed connections to prion-induced neurotoxicity.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Knockdown experiments in zebrafish embryos reveal that prion proteins, otherwise known for their involvement in lethal neurodegenerative disease, play important roles in cell-cell adhesion and signaling during embryonic development.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>M&#x000e1;laga-Trillo E, Solis GP, Schrock Y, Geiss C, Luncz L, et al.

For the last 17 years, this lack of in vivo phenotypes has precluded PrP from genetic functional analysis, raising the intriguing question of whether its unknown physiological function is necessary or dispensable for the organism, and also whether prion neurotoxicity may be a consequence of PrP mis- or loss-of-function.

However, these potential PrP functions do not seem to share a common molecular basis, and their in vivo relevance remains to be clarified.</p><p>Here, we show that early down-regulation of PrP impairs cell adhesion in the zebrafish embryo, disrupting morphogenetic cell movements and ultimately causing developmental arrest. Using aggregation assays, we established that PrP subserves complex roles in both Ca<sup>&#x0002b;2</sup>-independent and Ca<sup>&#x0002b;2</sup>-dependent cell adhesion. Our analyses of morphant embryonic cells revealed that PrP is required for the proper membrane localization of E-cadherin adhesion complexes. We also carried out experiments in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells to demonstrate that PrP itself induces homophilic cell adhesion, and that its accumulation at cell contacts leads to the recruitment of microdomain-associated proteins, eliciting signal transduction and rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton. Finally, we found that the roles of PrP in cell adhesion and signaling are conserved across vertebrate classes, and that PrP interactions can take place even between mouse and fish orthologs. Our results contribute novel molecular and cellular aspects of PrP function in vitro and in vivo, which may be of relevance to understanding its long-sought physiological roles in the mammalian brain, as well as the potential link between PrP loss-of-function and prion-induced neurodegeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>PrP Expression during Zebrafish Development</title><p>Because zebrafish contain duplicated <italic>PrP</italic> genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;, <italic>PrP-1</italic> and <italic>-2</italic>, we assessed their degree of functional overlap by examining their patterns of embryonic expression.

PrP accumulation at N2a cell contacts could also be observed by immunostaining endogenous PrP with a specific monoclonal antibody (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000055-sg002">Figure S2</xref>B), as well as by using DsRed-monomer constructs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000055-sg002">Figure S2</xref>C&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000055-sg002">S2</xref>H), and in HeLa cells (data not shown).

Similar to their mammalian counterparts, attachment of zebrafish PrPs to N2a cell membranes via GPI-anchors was greatly reduced by PI-PLC treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000055-sg002">Figure S2</xref>I and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000055-sg002">S2</xref>J); likewise, N-glycosylation could be demonstrated by PNGase F digestion (see Western blots in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000055-sg002">Figure S2</xref>K). We also generated mutant constructs for PrP-1 and PrP-2 in which the putative N-glycosylation residues were point mutated to glutamine. Western blot analysis of these constructs confirmed that, like mammalian PrPs, zebrafish PrP-1 and -2 are mono- and di-glycosylated at the expected residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g003">Figure 3</xref>L).

Given the relative simplicity and ease of manipulation of the early zebrafish embryo, we focused our analysis on the cellular and molecular characterization of the PrP-1 phenotype. Morphological examination of PrP-1 knockdown embryos at 6 hpf revealed that the developmental arrest was preceded by a marked decrease in tissue integrity and compactness; as they detached, deep cells in the morphant embryo lost their otherwise polygonal shape and became round (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g004">Figure 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g004">4</xref>B). The progressive loss of cell adhesion was clearly not a consequence of cell death, as in control embryos, death at this stage usually leads to generalized cell lysis within a few minutes. In contrast, round morphant cells survived at least until 12 hpf. Moreover, TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling) and DAPI stainings of 6-hpf PrP-1 morphant embryos showed no signs of apoptotic DNA fragmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g004">Figures 4</xref>D&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g004">4</xref>F and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000055-sg003">S3</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000055-sg003">S3</xref>D).

When the assay was performed in the Ca<sup>&#x0002b;2</sup>-containing medium, PrP-1 morphant cells underwent a significant decrease in the number of large (&#x0003e;10 cells) and small (&#x0003c;10 cells) aggregates (100&#x00025;, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.0004; and 36&#x00025; reduction, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.003, respectively), compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g005">Figure 5</xref>D, &#x0002b; bars). The same relative effect was observed when the assay was performed in Ca<sup>&#x0002b;2</sup>-free medium, indicating that PrP-1 is required for the formation of Ca<sup>&#x0002b;2</sup>-independent cell clusters, mostly of small size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g005">Figure 5</xref>D, &#x02212; bars). On the other hand, aggregation of PrP-1 morphant cells in the presence or absence of Ca<sup>&#x0002b;2</sup> showed no significant differences, implying that the formation of large clusters is mediated by cadherins and controlled by PrP-1. Interestingly, when the assay was performed with PrP-1 overexpressing cells in the presence of Ca<sup>&#x0002b;2</sup>, a dramatic increase in the number of large clusters was recorded (200&#x00025; increase, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g005">Figure 5</xref>D, &#x0002b; bars); in the absence of Ca<sup>&#x0002b;2</sup>, PrP-1 overexpressing cells virtually formed no large clusters (as expected), and the number of small clusters was larger than that of PrP-1 knockdown cells, and comparable to that of control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g005">Figure 5</xref>D, &#x02212; bars). These results are consistent with a complex role of PrP-1 in the maintenance of embryonic cell adhesion via cell-autonomous interactions at the plasma membrane. To test for cell autonomy, we transplanted small groups of deep cells from 4-hpf blastulae treated with <italic>PrP-1</italic> and control morpholinos into 4-hpf control blastulae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g005">Figure 5</xref>G).

In contrast, PrP-1 morphant cells remained round and loose within the control host embryo (10 out of 10 experiments, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g005">Figure 5</xref>F). Thus, the adhesion defect in PrP-1 morphant cells is cell-autonomous and cannot be corrected by the cellular environment of the control host embryo. Unfortunately, transplantation of control cells into a morphant host was not informative because PrP-1 morphant embryos did not withstand manipulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>PrP-1 and the Regulation of E-cadherin&#x02013;Mediated Cell Adhesion</title><p>Our aggregation assays indicated that PrP-1 can modulate Ca<sup>&#x0002b;2</sup>-dependent cell adhesion in the embryo. Therefore, we investigated whether PrP-1 knockdown would affect the expression and subcellular localization of E-cadherin. Since cadherin homophilic interactions are anchored to the actin cytoskeleton via catenins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;, we also analyzed PrP-1&#x02013;mediated changes in the distribution of &#x003b2;-catenin and F-actin. Antibody and phalloidin stainings revealed the typical cell surface localization of these molecules in 6-hpf control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g006">Figure 6</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g006">6</xref>C). In contrast, E-cadherin and &#x003b2;-catenin appeared largely intracellular in PrP-1 morphant cells, and the distribution of F-actin was disorganized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g006">Figure 6</xref>D&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g006">6</xref>F). This apparent intracellular accumulation of E-cadherin could be due to increased E-cadherin endocytosis and/or degradation, or to deficient trafficking to the plasma membrane. To address these possibilities, we first carried out Western blot analysis on cell extracts from 6-hpf control and PrP-1 morphant embryos. Notably, PrP-1 morphant cells showed an almost complete reduction in the levels of the 120-kDa polypeptide reported to be the active membrane-bound form of E-cadherin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;, as well as a slight increase in the levels of the 140-kDa immature form of E-cadherin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;, thought to be abundantly stored in intracellular compartments &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g006">Figure 6</xref>G). Previous studies have identified the recycling endosome, with its associated small GTPase Rab11, as an intermediate compartment that regulates post-Golgi trafficking and exocytosis of E-cadherin to the plasma membrane &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. We reasoned that if the increased intracellular distribution of E-cadherin in PrP-1 morphant cells was due at least in part to deficient delivery of E-cadherin to the plasma membrane, then E-cadherin would be seen to accumulate in Rab11-positive intermediate compartments. Therefore, we analyzed the subcellular distribution of E-cadherin and Rab11 in 6-hpf embryos by double immunostainings, and quantitatively assessed changes in their degree of colocalization upon PrP-1 knockdown. We found that the marked intracellular distribution of E-cadherin in morphant embryos was accompanied by a significant increase (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) in the number of E-cadherin/Rab11 double-positive vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g006">Figure 6</xref>H&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g006">6</xref>N).

We asked next whether the regulatory role of PrP-1 over E-cadherin could be further confirmed by showing that the two molecules interact at the genetic level. To test for synergistic interactions, we microinjected embryos with low doses of PrP-1 morpholino, E-cadherin morpholino, or the two morpholinos together, and scored the number of embryos with arrested gastrulation at 6 hpf.

These data strongly suggest that PrP-1 and E-cadherin act synergistically to regulate embryonic cell adhesion.</p><p>Kane et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d; have demonstrated that E-cadherin mutants fail to carry out epiboly because radial intercalation&#x02014;a morphogenetic cell movement crucial for the spreading of the blastoderm over the yolk cell&#x02014;is impaired. In these mutants, cells from the interior layer of the epiblast move normally to the exterior layer but fail to integrate and become restricted, thereby blocking the expansion of the blastoderm. Because E-cadherin adhesion is affected in PrP-1 morphants, we hypothesized that their epibolic arrest could be explained by defective radial intercalation. To confirm this, we carried out time-lapse recordings of cell behavior in the epiblast. In control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g007">Figure 7</xref>A), intercalating cells (in blue) entered the exterior layer and flattened out within approximately 20 min, effectively increasing their area. During this process, cells from the exterior layer that were initially in contact with the intercalating cell (in green), or that established new contacts with it (in red), remained in stable contact. In PrP-1 morphant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g007">Figure 7</xref>B), intercalating cells entered the exterior layer and increased their area, but did not completely flatten out: after approximately 10 min, they eventually reduced their area and left the exterior layer (deintercalation). Moreover, not all exterior cells that were in contact with the intercalating cell remained in contact with it (see green cells 2 and 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g007">Figure 7</xref>), and other cells that became in contact with it (red cells) did not maintain stable cell contacts. Overall, deintercalation events occurred frequently in morphant embryos but were not observed in control embryos, suggesting that the developmental basis for the epibolic arrest of PrP-1 morphant embryos is the impairment of morphogenetic cell movements directly controlled by E-cadherin. In agreement with this, the corresponding time-lapse videos show that PrP-1 morphant cells have a reduced ability to maintain tissue cohesion and to migrate in a coordinated fashion (compare <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000055-sv001">Videos S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000055-sv002">S2</xref>). Interestingly, and despite these defects, morphant cells seemed quite active in generating processes. To further clarify this issue, we made time-lapse recordings of single dissociated blastomeres (8 hpf), which show that their intrinsic motility is not affected by PrP-1 knockdown (compare <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000055-sv003">Videos S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000055-sv004">S4</xref>). To assess whether PrP-1 knockdown might affect other cellular events relying on proper cell&#x02013;cell communication, we also controlled for changes in mitosis rates upon PrP-1 knockdown. Interestingly, we found a partial reduction in the numbers of dividing blastomeres in morphant embryos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000055-sg003">Figure S3</xref>E); however, neither cell size nor overall cell density appeared to be significantly compromised in these embryos.</p><fig id="pbio-1000055-g007" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Radial Intercalation in Control and PrP-1 Morphant Embryos</title><p>Cell movements in lateral regions of the epiblast (8 hpf) were imaged over 20 min using Nomarski optics.

Similarly, the PrP-1 adhesion phenotype reported here appears restricted to deep cells, supporting the notion that PrP-1 modulates E-cadherin function, and that cell adhesion in the EVL may be controlled by additional mechanisms, such as the use of different types of cellular junctions. To further investigate this, we studied the distribution of markers for adherens and tight junctions in the EVL at 6 hpf.

Our experiments reveal important roles of PrP during zebrafish development, PrP-1 regulating embryonic cell adhesion during gastrulation, and PrP-2 affecting later stages of neural development. Interestingly, the developmental expression and cellular localization patterns of PrP-2 suggest that it might play a role closer to that of mammalian PrP in the nervous system. In fact, mouse PrP is expressed throughout the developing nervous system in a pattern analogous to that of zebrafish PrP-2 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. Nevertheless, the differences in expression patterns and knockdown phenotypes between PrP-1 and &#x02212;2 are most likely of transcriptional regulatory nature, because both proteins share important biological properties with mouse PrP, such as membrane anchorage, posttranslational processing, subcellular localization, and the ability to revert the PrP-1 knockdown phenotype. The strength of the PrP knockdown phenotypes in zebrafish is in sharp contrast with the lack of significant defects in PrP knockout mice. This striking difference may be due to the activation of gene compensatory mechanisms in the embryonic stem (ES) cells selected to derive the mouse knockouts &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;.

In particular, we show that PrP-1&#x02013;mediated signaling influences proper processing and/or trafficking of E-cadherin from storage vesicles to adherens junctions at the plasma membrane. This upstream regulatory role of PrP-1 over of E-cadherin is underscored by the remarkable similarities between the developmental roles of these two molecules. For instance, zebrafish E-cadherin is maternally expressed at adherens junctions and required to regulate embryonic cell adhesion of deep but not EVL cells; mutation or knockdown of E-cadherin induce epibolic arrest and disaggregation of blastodermal cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. In this study, we further strengthened the functional connection between PrP-1 and E-cadherin, by showing that they interact genetically to control distinct cell morphogenetic movements required for zebrafish gastrulation.</p><p>Our experiments suggest that the regulation of E-cadherin by PrP-1 is likely to occur indirectly via signal transduction, and not through direct physical interaction.

Likewise, the different embryonic localization patterns of PrP-1 (in discrete membrane patches) and E-cadherin (along entire cell&#x02013;cell contacts) argue against a necessary physical interaction between the two.
