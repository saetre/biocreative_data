The loss of CHFR mRNA expression is a consequence of promoter methylation, suggesting a tumor suppressor role for this gene in gastrointestinal carcinogenesis. In terms of the biological functions of CHFR, it has been shown to activate cell cycle checkpoint when cells are treated with microtubule depolymerizing agents. Furthermore, CHFR was reported to have E3 ligase activity and promote ubiquitination and degradation of oncogenic proteins such as Aurora A and polo-like kinase 1. However, molecular pathways involved in the tumor suppressive function of CHFR are not yet clear since the two established roles of this protein are likely to inhibit cell growth. In this study, we have identified that the FHA domain of CHFR protein is critical for growth suppressive properties, whereas the RF and cysteine rich domains (Cys) are not required for this function. In contrast, the RF and Cys domains are essential for E3 ligase activity of CHFR. By the use of a cell cycle checkpoint assay, we also confirmed that the FHA domain of CHFR plays an important role in initiating a cell cycle arrest at G2/M, indicating a functional link exists between the anti-proliferative effects and checkpoint function of this tumor suppressor protein via this domain. Collectively, our data show that the checkpoint function of the FHA domain of CHFR is a core component of anti-proliferative properties against the gastrointestinal carcinogenesis.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>CHFR (Checkpoint protein with Forkhead associated and Ring finger domain) was first isolated by a homology screening of EST cDNA clones harboring an FHA domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001776-Scolnick1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

The functional loss of these checkpoint proteins is likely to disrupt the cell cycle arrest response to cellular stress, thus leading to the accumulation of mutations and replication errors in the genome, a prerequisite for malignant transformation.</p><p>The RING-finger domain is a characteristic feature of the E3 ligase proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001776-Scolnick1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> and is thought to determine the substrate specificity for ubiquitination reactions. As an example, the RING-finger protein cdc20 is known to serve as an E3 ligase for the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001776-Visintin1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, and Cyclin B is also one of its substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001776-Visintin1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Cyclin B proteins that have been polyubiquitinated by cdc20 are rapidly transferred to the proteasome and degraded. CHFR was shown to play a role as E3 ligase for the polyubiqutination of Aurora A and Polo-like-kinase 1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001776-Yu1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001776-Kang1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, possibly resulting in the degradation of these proteins.

The inactivation of CHFR may thus cause the up-regulation of these proteins, which are known mitotic kinases and are frequently observed to be overexpressed in various types of human malignant tumors, such as bladder and colon cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001776-Strebhardt1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001776-Nigg1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.

The functional loss of CHFR could therefore result in the accumulation of oncogenic proteins (Aurora A and Plk1) and induce genomic instability.</p><p>To date, two possible molecular pathways have been considered as the mechanisms underlying the tumor suppressor function of CHFR. These are the checkpoint regulation and E3 ligase functions of this protein. However, it is difficult to draw any conclusions from the findings of previous studies about which of these roles is the most critical for growth suppression, since functional analyses of the checkpoint and E3 ligase activity of CHFR have only been performed independently of each other thus far <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001776-Scolnick1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001776-Kang1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001776-Ogi1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001776-Bothos1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.

The expression of wild-type, &#x00394;RF and &#x00394;Cys proteins resulted in a significant decrease in the number of G418-resistant colonies in this experiment compared with the vector control (p&#x0003c;0.01), whereas &#x00394;FHA expressing cells did not show any reduction in colony number.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001776-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, no major differences could be observed in the retrovirus copy number between the wild-type and mutant CHFR retrovirus producer cells. We therefore concluded that the growth suppressive effects of CHFR that we observed in these analyses are not due to any differences in the titers of the producer cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Detection of wild-type and mutant CHFR proteins under stable expression conditions</title><p>During their initial passages, significant growth suppression was observed in HCT116 cells expressing exogenous wild-type, &#x00394;RF and &#x00394;Cys CHFR, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001776-g002">Figures 2A&#x02013;C</xref>. However, this growth suppression becomes almost undetectable by passage 3. The protein levels of each of these introduced CHFR products were thus analyzed in these cells at passage 4 by western blotting. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001776-g002">Figure 2E</xref>, the levels of the wild-type, &#x00394;RF and &#x00394;Cys products were remarkably low when compared with &#x00394;FHA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001776-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>, left panel). The same analysis was undertaken in RKO cells and produced essentially identical results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001776-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>, right panel). A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that elevated levels of wild-type, &#x00394;RF and &#x00394;Cys proteins may cause a substantial growth disadvantage, and thus cell populations which express these introduced proteins at low levels undergo positive selection with passage in culture.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>The E3 ligase activity of CHFR requires the RF and Cys domains, but not the FHA domain</title><p>A series of <italic>in vivo</italic> ubiquitination assays were conducted using HCT116 cell populations that transiently expressed the wild-type and mutant CHFR proteins at similar levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001776-g003">Fig 3</xref>, left panel).

Since in this case the CHFR and EGFP protein products are translated from the same mRNA, EGFP fluorescence can be used as a marker of recombinant CHFR protein expression.

The accurate and quantitative evaluation of the impact of the &#x00394;FHA mutant on cell growth is difficult to undertake in the presence of endogenous protein because of the dominant-negative properties of this mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001776-Scolnick1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, we detected that the expression of these mutant CHFR proteins had a completely different result upon the growth of HeLa cells, which express endogenous CHFR, compared with HCT116 and RKO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001776-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). In these experiments, the expression of &#x00394;FHA induced a significant increase in colony number whereas the wild-type, &#x00394;RF and &#x00394;Cys CHFR species did not show any effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001776-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, Right panel). A previous study has indicated that the &#x00394;FHA mutant of CHFR acts as a dominant-negative and can disrupt the checkpoint function of the wild type protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001776-Scolnick1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence, we speculated that the increase in the colony number in HeLa cells by &#x00394;FHA was caused by the dominant-negative effects of this mutant upon the endogenous wild type CHFR protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001776-Scolnick1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The reported existence of a splicing variant form of CHFR that lacks the FHA domain and acts in a dominant-negative manner further supports our contention <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001776-Toyota1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. It has not yet been reported until this manuscript to evaluate the effect of FHA domain against cell proliferation under the two conditions, the existence and non-existence of endogenous CHFR. We therefore conclude that our current study is the first report that precisely identifies the functional domain responsible for the anti-proliferative function of CHFR.</p><p>We show from our analysis that the loss of the RF domain and its associated E3 ligase activity did not disrupt the anti-proliferative effects of CHFR, suggesting that the E3 ligase activity of this protein is not essential for its tumor suppressor function. From previous functional analysis of CHFR knockout mice, however, Yu <italic>et al</italic> concluded that the tumor suppressor function of CHFR is conferred by its E3 ligase activity toward the Aurora A protein, a predicted oncogenic kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001776-Yu1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. There is therefore some disagreement regarding the precise role of the E3 ligase activity of CHFR, but possible explanation can be considered. We need to pay attention to the tissue specificity of CHFR to induce the degradation of Aurora A. Elevated protein levels of Aurora A are frequently observed in both human colon and mammary cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001776-Bischoff1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001776-Zhou1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, but the inactivation of CHFR is limited to cases of colon cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001776-Bertholon1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001776-Tokunaga1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. High levels of Aurora A in mammary cancers cannot therefore be explained by a loss of function of CHFR. These findings indicate the existence of degradation pathways for Aurora A that are independent of CHFR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001776-Bertholon1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. In this regard, Cdh1 is a strong candidate as an alternative E3 ligase for Aurora A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001776-Littlepage1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001776-Crane1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. The exogenous introduction of a dominant-negative form of Cdh1 was reported to induce elevated levels of Aurora A protein in HeLa cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001776-Crane1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence, there may be several molecular pathways that promote the degradation of Aurora A but that are tissue- or organ-specific. The protein levels of Aurora A did not change after the expression of any form of CHFR in HCT116 colon cancer cells in our current experiments (data not shown). The differences between the findings of this and other studies might thus be due to the cell-type specificity of the degradation pathways for Aurora A.</p><p>With regards to the E3 ligase activity of CHFR, we found that the RF and Cys domains are essential. These results are consistent with previously reported findings, which show that CHFR binds to its substrates through its Cys domain, and forms a protein complex with APC/C through its RF domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001776-Yu1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Some E3 ligases have also been reported to have self-ubiquitination activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001776-Kawai1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001776-Kawai2">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, but we did not detect this in the case of CHFR. In contrast, Kang <italic>et al</italic> have reported strong self-ubiquitination activity for CHFR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001776-Kang1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. One possibility to be taken into consideration when evaluating these discrepancies is the difference of their GST protein tag and our HA tag. The self ubiquitination activity affected by the protein tag has reported with MBP protein tag in case of Rma1, EL5 and Perkin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001776-Takai2">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001776-Matsuda2">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, further experiments with other protein tags would be needed to get the conclusion about the self ubiquitination activity of CHFR protein.</p><p>The results of our current study also show that the expression of CHFR arrests the cell cycle prior to entry into mitosis in the presence of microtubule depolymerizing reagents, which is consistent with previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001776-Scolnick1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001776-Toyota1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001776-Kang1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001776-Ogi1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001776-Chaturvedi1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. A growth advantage will be conferred upon cells which have lost the checkpoint machinery that functions under mitotic stress conditions. In agreement with this idea, shRNA knock down of CHFR recently reported to induce the increased cell proliferation during the preparation of this manuscript <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001776-Privette1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Since the promoter methylation of the <italic>CHFR</italic> gene was detected in non-invasive adenoma lesions of colon epithelia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001776-Morioka1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, the associated loss of the checkpoint function of CHFR in these cells may have a significant impact upon the early stages of colon carcinogenesis. To gain further supportive evidence that the FHA domain of CHFR is important for its growth inhibition properties, we have recently put a considerable amount of effort into establishing a conditional expression system for this protein using the Cre-loxP recombination system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001776-Fukuda1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> to evaluate tumor formation activity <italic>in vivo</italic> (e.g. nude mice). Unfortunately, we have yet to establish an efficient conditional system due to the toxicity of Cre-expressing adenovirus in HCT116 colon cancer cells. Although it is not direct evidence, a remarkably high protein level of the &#x00394;FHA mutant, compared with that of the wild-type and other mutant forms of CHFR, suggests that the FHA domain has an important role in suppressing tumor formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001776-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). The FHA domain is expected to work as the binding motif for phosphorylated proteins. We are currently working on the experiments to isolate the binding partner of FHA domain of CHFR protein. There is a possibility that the detail of anti-proliferative effect can be explained with the binding of new candidates and CHFR. These information will help us to gain further insights in understanding how a functional loss of this gene leads to increased cell proliferation during gastrointestinal carcinogenesis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Noriyuki Matsuda and Yukiko Yoshida (Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Sciences, Tokyo, Japan), Mitsuyasu Kato and Hiroyuki Suzuki (University of Tsukuba, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences) for their helpful advice and discussions, providing the FLAG-Ubiquitin expression plasmid.
