Whereas the rise of cytosolic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentrations in muscles of <italic>mdx</italic> mouse, an animal model of DMD, has been extensively documented, little is known about the mechanisms causing alterations in Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> concentrations. Here we show that the skeletal muscle isoform of the voltage-gated sodium channel, Na<sub>v</sub>1.4, which represents over 90% of voltage-gated sodium channels in muscle, plays an important role in development of abnormally high Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> concentrations found in muscle from <italic>mdx</italic> mice. The absence of dystrophin modifies the expression level and gating properties of Na<sub>v</sub>1.4, leading to an increased Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> concentration under the sarcolemma. Moreover, the distribution of Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 is altered in <italic>mdx</italic> muscle while maintaining the colocalization with one of the dystrophin-associated proteins, syntrophin &#x003b1;-1, thus suggesting that syntrophin is an important linker between dystrophin and Na<sub>v</sub>1.4. Additionally, we show that these modifications of Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 gating properties and increased Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> concentrations are strongly correlated with increased cell death in <italic>mdx</italic> fibers and that both cell death and Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> overload can be reversed by 3 nM tetrodotoxin, a specific Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 blocker.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>C.

Mutations in the p21 region of the X chromosome lead to an absence of dystrophin, a 427-kD protein located beneath the plasma membrane, which is associated with the cytoskeleton via actin, and with the extracellular matrix via a dystrophin&#x02013;glycoprotein complex (DGC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blake et al., 2002</xref>). Because of its key localization, dystrophin is thought to play multiple roles such as maintaining mechanical stability of the muscle architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Koenig et al., 1988</xref>) or regulating the function of sarcolemmal components, for example, cation channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fong et al., 1990</xref>). The mechanisms leading to increased muscle cell death are still unclear; however, it is generally accepted that an elevated cytosolic calcium concentration occurring when muscle is stretched is an important link between the absence of dystrophin and muscle degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gailly, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ruegg et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>This increase in the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration is not the only alteration in dystrophin-lacking cells. Thus, it has been shown that the intracellular sodium concentration ([Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) is also elevated in skeletal muscle of <italic>mdx</italic> mice, an animal model of DMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dunn et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen, 2004</xref>). Additionally, an increase in Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ATPase activity has been reported in <italic>mdx</italic> mice, suggesting an impairment in Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dunn et al., 1995</xref>). It has also been shown that fibers from <italic>mdx</italic> muscle are more susceptible to stretch-induced damage and that there is an associated rise in [Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, which could be attenuated by unspecific cation channel blocker Gd<sup>3&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Yeung et al., 2003</xref>). Nonetheless, the cause of the increased [Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> is still unknown.</p><p>Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) are transmembrane proteins responsible for propagating the action potentials along the muscle fibers and initiating contraction. VGSCs are composed of a pore-forming &#x003b1;-subunit and a smaller &#x003b2;-subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Catterall, 1988</xref>). Two isoforms have been described in muscle: Na<sub>v</sub>1.4, the skeletal muscle isoform that represents &#x0003e;90% of VGSCs expressed in skeletal muscle, and Na<sub>v</sub>1.5, the fetal or cardiac isoform.</p><p>Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 is highly expressed at the endplate of skeletal muscle fibers, but its detailed localization in the extrajunctional sarcolemma has not been studied extensively. Both isoforms contain the consensus sequence SXV-COOH, which binds directly to the PDZ domain of &#x003b1;1-syntrophin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gee et al., 1998</xref>), a cytoplasmic protein belonging to the DGC. The distribution of dystrophin and syntrophin at the sarcolemma remains controversial, although results favor costameric and intercostameric localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Williams and Bloch, 1999a</xref>). Moreover, it has been shown that in the heart, DGC is required for the proper expression and function of the Na<sub>v</sub>1.5 isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gavillet et al., 2006</xref>). These observations prompted us to test whether the absence of dystrophin could alter the expression and function of Na<sub>v</sub>1.4, and whether the changes can account for the increase in [Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dunn et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen, 2004</xref>).</p><p>We found that the absence of dystrophin modifies the expression level, distribution, and gating properties of Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 in skeletal muscle. At the measured resting membrane potential, changes in gating properties and inactivation threshold are sufficient to support an observed twofold higher level of Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> under the sarcolemma in <italic>mdx</italic> muscle. This [Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> elevation likely contributes to an elevated rate of cell death in dystrophic muscle, and both these effects can be reversed by tetrodotoxin (TTX) treatment at concentrations that specifically block the Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 channel.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Male C57BL/6J (control) and <italic>mdx<sup>5cv</sup></italic> mice were age matched to be 12&#x02013;16 wk old.

After extraction, both muscles were incubated in DMEM supplemented with glutamax (GIBCO BRL), 2 mg/ml of collagenase type I-A (Sigma-Aldrich C-2674), and 10 &#x003bc;g/ml ciproxine (Bayer) for 1 h at 37&#x000b0;C. They were then rinsed three times with DMEM-glutamax and were dissociated by passing them repeatedly through wide-mouthed fire-polished Pasteur pipettes of decreasing size in DMEM until single intact fibers were obtained. The dissociated fibers were plated on coverslips coated with 400 &#x003bc;g/ml Matrigel (Becton Dickinson). For survival tests 50&#x02013;100 fibers per well were plated in Matrigel-coated 48-well plates and treated with TTX (Alexis) at various concentrations in DMEM-glutamax (2 wells by concentration). Fiber survival was quantified daily by performing a blind count of living fibers, as judged by shape and light refraction using phase contrast optics under an inverted microscope (Nikon). No spontaneous contractile activity was observed in cultures of dissociated and denervated fibers.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunostaining of Isolated Fibers and Confocal Imaging</title><p>Freshly isolated fibers plated on coverslips (Labtek) were fixed in 1.5% solution of formaldehyde in PBS, washed twice in cold PBS, and then permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. The samples were incubated in 10% normal goat serum in PBS followed by an overnight incubation at 4&#x000b0;C with the primary antibody (1:500 dilution) in PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100. After extensive washing, fibers were incubated with a fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody (1:500 dilution, Molecular Probes) in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Finally slides were mounted in Mowiol (Calbiochem). Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 was labeled using an anti-SkM1 mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich S9568) and &#x003b1;1 syntrophins with an anti-&#x003b1;1-syntrophin rabbit polyclonal antibody (provided by M.

Secondary antibodies were AlexaFluor 488&#x02013;labeled monoclonal goat anti-rabbit, and Texas red&#x02013;labeled monoclonal goat anti-mouse.</p><p>Confocal images were obtained using a Leica SP2 confocal microscope with a 40&#x000d7; oil immersed objective with 1.4 numerical aperture. The pixel dimensions were 0.2 &#x000d7; 0.2 &#x003bc;m in the focal plane, and the z sections were 0.1&#x02013;0.4 &#x003bc;m. The same settings were used for all images.

Triton-X was added to a final concentration of 1% and homogenates were incubated 10 min on ice. After centrifugation (12,000 <italic>g</italic>, 4&#x000b0;C, 20 min), supernatants were collected. Protein concentration was determined using the BC assay method (Optima). 5 &#x003bc;g of protein were resolved on a gradient gel (5&#x02013;10% of acrylamide) at 80 V. Proteins were transferred onto 0.45-&#x003bc;m nitrocellulose membranes for 2 h at 100 V at 4&#x000b0;C (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc. Miniprotean III apparatus). Transfer efficiency was verified by staining with Ponceau S (Sigma-Aldrich).</p><p>Membranes were blocked in saturation solution (TBST containing 3% BSA) for 1 h and incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with a primary antibody (anti-SkM1, Sigma S-9568, 1:5,000) in saturation solution. After extensive washing, membranes were exposed to secondary antibodies (HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody, Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., 1:50,000) for 1 h. Proteins were detected by chemiluminescence using the ECL plus kit (Amersham Biosciences) on Fuji x-ray film, and were quantified using the Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc. scanner (Universal Hood II, Quantity one analysis software) and normalized to expression level of SERCA1. Western blot analysis of SERCA1 expression was performed using mouse anti-SERCA1 antibody (Affinity Bioreagents 1:1,000).

Fibers were immersed in a relaxing, high K solution (in mM: 10 NaCl, 142 KCl, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 glucose, 0.5 EGTA, 10 HEPES; pH 7.3) containing additionally 30 &#x003bc;M <italic>N</italic>-benzyl-p-toluene sulphonamide (BTS) to inhibit contractions. Cells immersed in this solution had their resting membrane potentials within 2 mV of zero. Patch pipettes contained a Tyrode solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 0.5 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 6 glucose, 10 HEPES; pH 7.3) with 2 mM TEA and 10 &#x003bc;M 4,4&#x02032;-diisothiocyanato-stilbene-2,2&#x02032;-disulphonic acid (DIDS) added to inhibit K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> currents. Resting membrane potential measurements were performed in control and <italic>mdx</italic> fibers immersed in the physiological Tyrode solution with sharp pipettes filled with 3 M KCl. Pipettes were pulled using the horizontal puller P2000 (Sutter Instrument) and had a resistance consistently lying in the range of 4&#x02013;6 MOhm for patch pipettes and 6&#x02013;7 MOhm for sharp electrodes. Electric currents were acquired and low-pass filtered at 10 kHz with a HEKA EPC-7 amplifier (HEKA Elektronik), and then digitized with a Digidata 1322 digitizer (Molecular Devices) at 100 kHz. Patch-clamp currents were normalized per the area of the patch by multiplying currents by the resistance of the corresponding pipette and then dividing by the average pipette resistance.</p><p>Stimulation protocols used to study activation and inactivation properties of VGSCs are shown on the insets of <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>. In short, patches were held at &#x02212;100 mV between stimulation applications. The inactivation-recovery prepulses to &#x02212;120 mV were applied for 30 ms and then potential was stepped up to voltages ranging from &#x02212;70 to &#x0002b;40 mV or, during the determination of Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> reversal potential, to &#x0002b;100 mV in steps of 10 mV for 20 ms. To study inactivation properties, the patches were held for 500 ms at voltages ranging from &#x02212;120 to &#x02212;10 mV in steps of 10 mV and currents were sampled at 10 mV for 50 ms. For the purpose of leak subtraction, the stimulation protocols were extended by a 20-ms step from the holding potential of &#x02212;100 mV to &#x02212;80 mV. Additionally, after performing recordings as described, currents were acquired using the online leak subtraction as implemented in Clampex program (pClamp-9 suite, Axon Instruments). Both methods allowed equivalently good removal of leakage currents during the study of activation properties of Nav1.4 channels. Only online leak subtraction was used to study the inactivation properties of these channels.</p><p>Individual responses at every sampling potential were extracted and fit with the Hodgkin-Huxley model with the help of custom made software, which can be downloaded at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.unige.ch/sciences/pharm/fagie/software/elphys_utils-20080407.tar.bz2">http://www.unige.ch/sciences/pharm/fagie/software/elphys_utils-20080407.tar.bz2</ext-link>. Fit convergence was verified by recalculating the peak currents from the obtained fit parameters and comparing them with the apparent peak currents, as well as by fitting only tail regions of VGSC responses using Clampfit 9 software (pClamp-9 suite) and comparing the resulting inactivation rates <italic>(&#x003c4;<sub>i</sub></italic>). Averages were computed by first calculating per patch means of the corresponding individual values and then establishing the overall averages. Typically, three recordings were performed for every patch. Patches where a significant rundown of signal or nonspecific activity was detected were discarded. Reversal potential for Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> was determined by fitting tails of individual IV curves in the region where the tails were linear (typically 10&#x02013;30 or, for patches with large currents, 40 mV) and averaging the calculated intersections with I &#x0003d; 0 first per patch and then for all patches. These data analyses were supplemented by traces with the sampling voltage steps extended to 100 mV, in order to perform control measurements of zero-current crossings. Details of these data analyses can be found in online supplemental material. Statistical modeling and composition of histograms (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>) were performed with the help of the R project for statistical computing (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org/">http://www.r-project.org/</ext-link>).

The observed basal Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> influx in C57BL/6J FDB muscle was 31.5 &#x000b1; 4.4 cpm/mg and was taken as 100%.

However, the mechanisms involved in this elevation have not been investigated so far. We report here that deregulation of Na<sub>v</sub>1.4, the VGSC isoform that accounts for the bulk of Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels expressed in the sarcolemma of skeletal muscle, significantly affects Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> influx in <italic>mdx</italic> muscle fibers and can, at least partially, explain this increased [Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. While increased Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> entry in stimulated <italic>mdx</italic> muscle, in association with up-regulated activity of stretch-activated channels has been known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Yeung et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen, 2004</xref>), the alteration of Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 gating properties reported in this paper appears to be important for both basal and stimulated Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> entry and likely plays no less important a role in causing excessive Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> entry in <italic>mdx</italic> muscle fibers.</p><p>We observed that Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> entry in dystrophic fibers, as assessed by <sup>22</sup>Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> uptake, was increased by 20% over that of control fibers. Incubating the cells with a concentration of TTX that specifically blocks the skeletal (Na<sub>v</sub>1.4), but not the cardiac (Na<sub>v</sub>1.5), isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goldin, 2001</xref>) produced no significant effect on control fibers, while it reduced the influx in <italic>mdx<sup>5cv</sup></italic> muscle to the control level. In agreement with this, fiber survival was significantly worsened in the case of <italic>mdx<sup>5cv</sup></italic> cells, but could also be restored to the levels observed in control fibers by application of TTX (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 C</xref>). Taking into account that currents in cell-attached patches were completely blocked by TTX, we confirm that Nav1.4 is the primary isoform expressed in the sarcolemma of both dystrophic and control fibers and that the up-regulated activity of Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 channels is primarily responsible for the increase in Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> influx in dystrophin-deficient muscle cells, significantly affecting their survival.</p><p>Similar effect of TTX has been reported in neurons, where it reduced neuronal death and blocked Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> entry during hypoxia, improving survival of cultured neocortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banasiak et al., 2004</xref>). In that case, TTX attenuated apoptotic neuronal death via a reduction in caspase-3 activation. Moreover, veratridine, a stimulator of VGSC activity, induced Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> overload, leading to increased cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Koike et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, it can be argued that maintaining a proper Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> balance is important for optimal muscle survival and function. In particular, Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> overload in <italic>mdx<sup>5cv</sup></italic> fibers significantly contributes to cell degradation and early death.</p><p>One possible explanation for the increase in Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> influx is that it is caused by overexpression of Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 in <italic>mdx</italic> muscles. However, our Western blot measurements, as well as estimates of expression levels of Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 channels in patch pipettes together with a higher incidence of empty patches showed that this was not the case. Furthermore, we investigated whether the distribution of Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels in the sarcolemma was disturbed in dystrophin-deficient cells. Analysis using confocal imaging of isolated FDB fibers allowed an accurate localization of the protein. Channels were observed exclusively at the membrane and showed an unusual longitudinally oriented pattern likely corresponding to the longitudinal (L) domains oriented in parallel to the long axis of the muscle fiber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bloch et al., 2002</xref>). These L domains, while present universally in normal fibers, were often distorted in <italic>mdx</italic> myofibers due to disorganized costamers. It seems that Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 protein is directly attached to an L domain in normal muscle, and the absence of dystrophin leads to irregularities in its anchorage, implying that the DGC is required for proper localization and function of the VGSCs.</p><p>Interestingly, Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 in our experiments with skeletal muscle colocalized with syntrophin, similarly to what has been described for the cardiac isoform Na<sub>v</sub>1.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gee et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gavillet et al., 2006</xref>). Syntrophins are costameric proteins known to interact directly with both types of muscle VGSCs, however they also show an intercostameric pattern, responsible for the longitudinal strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Williams and Bloch, 1999a</xref>,b). In <italic>mdx</italic> muscle their expression is lower than in control muscle and their distribution shows a broad range of disrupted patterns, similarly to what we observed for Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bloch et al., 2002</xref>). Moreover Gee and coworkers observed, in vitro, that the C-terminal biotinylated peptide of Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 binds syntrophin via its PDZ domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gee et al., 1998</xref>). Taken together with our observations this suggests that &#x003b1;1-syntrophin is the main link between dystrophin and Na<sub>v</sub>1.4. and that dystrophin deficiency leads to disruption of distribution of both of these proteins. Work is in progress to assess the role and the distribution of Na<sub>v</sub>1.5, as well as the interaction of &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b2;2 syntrophins with Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 in dystrophin-deficient muscle cells.</p><p>The observation of an altered distribution pattern of Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 channels in <italic>mdx<sup>5cv</sup></italic> fibers, which in itself involves important considerations, cannot fully explain the increase in Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> influx in view of the smaller amount of the protein in sarcolemma. To resolve this ambiguity we turned to patch-clamp measurements of Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> currents to study how the gating properties of Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 are modified in dystrophin-deficient cells. Unfortunately, differences in overall currents and amplitude parameters, while not small, were masked by the high patch to patch variability due to nonuniform distribution of channels. Nonetheless it is interesting to note that mean currents were larger in <italic>mdx<sup>5cv</sup></italic> fibers while amplitudes, representing the expression level of Na<sub>v</sub>1.4, were smaller. On the other hand, the finding that inactivation times were consistently and by a big margin larger in <italic>mdx<sup>5cv</sup></italic> cells enables to explain the increased stimulated inward Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> current in spite of the decreased Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 expression levels.</p><p>Another important observation, producing even more significant effect on basal Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> entry, is the shift of the inactivation threshold by &#x0223c;10 mV toward less negative potentials. While resting membrane potentials were not affected by the absence of dystrophin, the shift in the inactivation curve itself is sufficient to cause an approximately twofold higher activity of Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 channels at the measured V<sub>rest</sub> of approximately &#x02212;50 mV. It is important to note that this up-regulation of basal VGSC activity is not specific for this exact value of V<sub>rest</sub>. Window currents are similarly up-regulated by a factor of two to four in the whole range of physiologically sensible resting membrane potentials, i.e., between &#x02212;50 and &#x02212;90 mV. Therefore, while it may be likely that the measured value of V<sub>rest</sub> is specific to the particular genetic background of these mice or the investigated muscle type, and indeed estimates of V<sub>rest</sub> vary widely in literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Head, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Woods et al., 2005</xref>), the end effect of significantly higher basal VGSC activity should hold in the majority of cases.</p><p>These observations of longer open dwell times and greater basal activity of Na<sub>v</sub>1.4s produce a good ground for explaining the observed approximately twofold increase in [Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>] under the sarcolemma of <italic>mdx<sup>5cv</sup></italic> fibers. Indeed, combining the 1.5 factor of longer open dwell times with the 2&#x000d7; higher frequency of openings at the V<sub>rest</sub> of &#x02212;50 mV, or even 3&#x000d7; at V<sub>rest</sub> of &#x02212;75 mV, we arrive at &#x0223c;3&#x000d7; or even 5&#x000d7; greater forcing of Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> entry by the Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 channels at the corresponding resting membrane potentials, sufficient to sustain elevated [Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> even in view of an &#x0223c;20% smaller driving force for Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> in <italic>mdx</italic> cells at rest. Such an increase is in good agreement with measurements reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Yeung et al., 2003</xref>), performed using Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> green fluorescence. Thus, it can be argued that changes in Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 gating properties significantly affect the Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> balance in FBD muscle fibers, producing an important long-term effect even in nonexercised muscle.</p><p>It is interesting to note that no significant changes in Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> currents in <italic>mdx</italic>-deficient EDL fibers were reported by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mathes et al., 1991</xref>). One apparent difference that could account for this discrepancy is the different type of muscle investigated; however there are other avenues to investigate. In our study, mice were age matched (12&#x02013;16 wk old), corresponding, in <italic>mdx<sup>5cv</sup></italic> mice, to the phase of slow chronic disease after full recovery from the initial massive necrosis episode. Using mice of that age may have been an important factor, maximizing the differences between control and <italic>mdx</italic>-deficient fibers. Moreover, careful examination of the figure in Mathes et al. suggests that these authors, similarly to us, may have been faced with significant patch-to-patch variability, possibly masking the difference between control and <italic>mdx</italic> fibers, with steady-state inactivation thresholds being slightly, but not significantly, shifted toward positive potentials, and <italic>&#x003c4;<sub>i</sub></italic>'s being slightly longer in <italic>mdx</italic> cells.</p><p>Deregulation, by the absence of dystrophin, of Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 activity leading to Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> overload is likely connected with multiple other changes reported in <italic>mdx</italic> fibers. Thus, the reduced expression levels of Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 channels might be explained by a compensatory mechanism down-regulating, via the E box motif, their expression in response to the increase in Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> influx via VGSCs. This motif plays a critical role in regulating Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 expression through binding to a complex of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kraner et al., 1998</xref>). Another compensatory mechanism may be causing an increased activity and expression of the Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>ATPase in order to counteract the [Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> overload in <italic>mdx</italic> muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dunn et al., 1995</xref>). Alternatively, an elevated Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> influx in skeletal muscle as well as in neurons, might lead directly either to caspase-3 activation, or to a subsequent Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> entry, due to the Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> exchanger, which in its reverse mode induces Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banasiak et al., 2004</xref>). Another possibility is that other proteins might be involved in skeletal muscle dysfunction. For example, the &#x003b2;-subunit of the channel, thought to have a regulatory function, may be altered by the absence of dystrophin. Such a dysfunction of the &#x003b2;-subunit could be responsible for the decreased inactivation rate observed in <italic>mdx<sup>5cv</sup></italic> fibers. Work is in progress to determine events downstream of Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> overload leading to increased cell death in <italic>mdx<sup>5cv</sup></italic> fibers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplemental Material Index</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="jgp.200810024_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="jgp.200810024_1.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="jgp.200810024_JGP_200810024_FS1.jpg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="jgp.200810024_JGP_200810024_FS1-01.jpg"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank M.
