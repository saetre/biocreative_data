Importantly, expression of uPAR is associated with the acquisition of a motile, invasive tumor cell phenotype, a process thought to be crucial for cancer metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vial et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lester et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Madsen et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>GPI-anchored uPAR localizes to the leading edge of migrating cells, and complexes of uPA&#x02013;uPAR are thought to promote cell motility by activating the plasminogen system to degrade ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blasi and Carmeliet, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dano et al., 2005</xref>). In addition to its roles in the regulation of pericellular proteolysis, a large body of evidence has identified uPAR as a signaling receptor that activates intracellular pathways. Activation of the Rho family small GTPase Rac has emerged as an important event in the promotion of motility and invasion by uPAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kjoller and Hall, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vial et al., 2003</xref>). Ectopic uPAR expression results in Rac-dependent lamellipodial protrusion and cell motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kjoller and Hall, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jo et al., 2003</xref>), and inhibiting endogenous uPAR expression inactivates Rac and strongly inhibits lamellipodial protrusion and cell motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ma et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vial et al., 2003</xref>). Rac activation by uPAR can occur in the absence of uPA, but depends on binding to vitronectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kjoller and Hall, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ma et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Madsen et al., 2007</xref>). However, uPA binding may contribute to signaling by increasing the affinity of uPAR for vitronectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sidenius et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Madsen et al., 2007</xref>). Because the vitronectin-binding site is located on the opposite side of the molecule from the uPA-binding cleft, multimeric complexes containing all three molecules may form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Llinas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Madsen et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Being GPI anchored and lacking transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, uPAR relies on transmembrane coreceptors for intracellular signaling. Potential coreceptors for uPAR include G protein&#x02013; coupled receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Resnati et al., 2002</xref>), tetraspanins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bass et al., 2005</xref>), low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Czekay et al., 2001</xref>), and Endo180/UPARAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Behrendt et al., 2000</xref>). In particular, several studies suggest that integrins are involved in uPAR signaling. Expression of uPAR results in integrin-associated signaling events such as phosphorylation of FAK and Src family kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguirre Ghiso, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wei et al., 2007</xref>). uPAR&#x02013;integrin interactions have been shown by coimmunoprecipitation of uPAR with leukocyte integrin Mac-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Simon et al., 1996</xref>), fibronectin receptors &#x003b1;<sub>3</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b1;<sub>5</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wei et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wei et al., 2005</xref>), and vitronectin receptors &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> and &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>5</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carriero et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Degryse et al., 2005</xref>). The formation of these uPAR&#x02013;integrin interactions may depend both on integrin subunit expression and composition of the ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xue et al., 1997</xref>). Association of uPAR with integrins has been proposed to alter integrin conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wei et al., 2005</xref>). However, the existence of direct uPAR&#x02013;integrin binding remains controversial, as a recent study has shown that the putative integrin-binding residues in uPAR are dispensable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Madsen et al., 2007</xref>). These authors proposed that uPAR interacts indirectly with integrins by increasing cell matrix adhesion through uPAR&#x02013;vitronectin binding, therefore facilitating integrin binding to ligands.</p><p>Of particular interest in the context of cell motility is how uPAR signals to Rac activation. Cycling of small GTPases between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound forms is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bos et.al. 2007</xref>), and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), which stimulate the intrinsic GTPase activity (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jaffe and Hall, 2005</xref>). Because many studies link uPAR to integrin signaling, we used a candidate approach to identify integrin-associated GEFs that might be required for Rac activation in uPAR-expressing cell lines. These studies identified DOCK180 as the GEF involved in uPAR-mediated Rac activation. We then investigated how uPAR influences signaling to DOCK180.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>DOCK180 is required for uPAR-driven Rac activation and invasion</title><p>Because uPAR may signal together with integrins, we examined the role of GEFs that have been linked to integrin signaling to identify GEFs that may function downstream of uPAR. A literature search identified &#x003b1;-PIX, &#x003b2;-PIX, DOCK180, Sos1, Tiam1, Tiam2, Vav1, Vav2, and Vav3 as potential Rac GEFs downstream of integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kiyokawa et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Moores et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Marignani and Carpenter, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Matsuo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rosenberger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arthur et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gakidis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Faccio et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hamelers et al., 2005</xref>). We used RNAi to silence expression of these GEFs (apart from &#x003b1;-PIX, Vav1, and Vav3 for which no expression was detected) in the colon carcinoma cell line BE. BE cells endogenously express uPAR and exhibit a bipolar mesenchymal morphology with abundant membrane ruffling and lamellipodia shown by phalloidin staining to be F-actin rich (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). This characteristic morphology, together with extensive random migration, is abrogated by silencing uPAR or Rac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vial et al., 2003</xref>). We used this easily scorable phenotype to search for GEFs whose silencing mimicked the effects of silencing uPAR. DOCK180 was the only GEF for which silencing resulted in similar effects to abrogating uPAR expression, resulting in flattening, loss of ruffles and lamellipodia, more pronounced cortical actin staining, and occasional stress fibers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref> and Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712050/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712050/DC1</ext-link>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOCK180 is required for uPAR-driven membrane ruffling and Rac activation.</bold> (A) BE colon carcinoma cells transfected with indicated siRNAs were plated on vitronectin-coated coverslips for 12 h, fixed, and stained with Texas red&#x02013;conjugated phalloidin.

Strikingly, this stimulation was lost when uPAR was expressed in HEK 293T cells in which DOCK180 expression had been abrogated with either of two different siRNAs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>). Significantly, in empty vector controls, DOCK180 silencing had no effect on Rac activity, showing basal Rac activity in HEK 293T cells does not require DOCK180. Therefore, in this system DOCK180 is required for uPAR-driven Rac activation rather than basal levels of Rac activity.</p><p>To examine whether DOCK180 is required for Rac activation in tumor cell lines expressing uPAR, we used BE, MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells, and SNB19 glioblastoma cells in which endogenous uPAR signaling is required for cell motility or invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mohan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sturge et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vial et al., 2003</xref>). We silenced DOCK180 expression in these cell lines using a panel of siRNA oligonucleotides, including an ON-TARGET SMART pool that incorporates technology designed to reduce &#x0201c;off-target&#x0201d; effects. Each siRNA treatment abrogating DOCK180 expression significantly reduced Rac activation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>).

As well as reducing Rac activation, siRNA treatments against either DOCK180 or uPAR elicited similar morphological changes in the three cell lines with reduced membrane ruffling and lamellipodial protrusion (Fig. S1 B and not depicted), demonstrating that the effects are a true consequence of silencing these genes rather than a nonspecific or off-target effect.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>DOCK180 is required for Rac activation and invasion in uPAR-expressing tumor cell lines.</bold> (A) BE (closed bars), MDA-MB-231 (open bars), and SNB19 (shaded bars) cells were transfected with siRNAs.

The regulation of DOCK180 by integrin signaling involves protein&#x02013;protein interactions where the N-terminal SH3 domain of the adaptor protein Crk binds to a proline-rich region in DOCK180 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Matsuda et al., 1996</xref>) and the SH2 domain of Crk binds to phosphotyrosine residues in the substrate domain (SD) of the adaptor p130Cas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sakai et al., 1994</xref>). The p130Cas&#x02013;Crk&#x02013;DOCK180 module associates with integrins via binding of p130Cas to FAK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Polte and Hanks, 1995</xref>). To investigate whether uPAR influences p130Cas SD tyrosine phosphorylation and recruitment of Crk, we first examined the effects of ectopic uPAR expression in HEK 293T cells. Expression of uPAR results in an &#x0223c;50% increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of the p130Cas SD (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Increased tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas was associated with a dramatic induction of the p130Cas&#x02013;Crk complex, as determined by coimmunoprecipitation of Crk and p130Cas (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). These results show that ectopic expression of uPAR drives formation of the p130Cas&#x02013;Crk complex. As the p130Cas SD has been shown to be phosphorylated by Src family kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vuori et al., 1996</xref>), and as uPAR has been linked to c-Src activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>), we investigated whether uPAR-dependent Rac activation required c-Src activity. Ectopic expression of uPAR in HEK 293T cells led to increased c-Src phosphorylation on the Y416 activation site and treatment with the Src inhibitors PP1 or PP2 or the structurally unrelated SU6656 blocked Rac activation, whereas PP3, the inactive stereoisomer of PP2, had no effect (Fig. S3 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712050/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712050/DC1</ext-link>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>uPAR expression drives p130Cas SD phosphorylation and formation of the p130Cas&#x02013;CrkII complex.</bold> (A) p130Cas SD tyrosine phosphorylation in uPAR- or vector-transfected (Vec) HEK 293T cells.

We show for the first time that in both ectopic and endogenous systems uPAR expression results in activation of Rac via the GEF DOCK180. DOCK180 has been shown to have a role in cell motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Klemke et al., 1998</xref>) and developmental processes such as myoblast fusion, dorsal closure, and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nolan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wu and Horvitz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moore et al., 2007</xref>). Our data show that uPAR signaling to DOCK180 results in the induction of tumor cell motility and invasion. In several systems, ELMO has been linked to DOCK180 function possibly through acting as a cofactor for GEF activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gumienny et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brugnera et al., 2002</xref>). Whether it is involved in uPAR-driven Rac activation will be an interesting topic for future investigation.</p><p>Having identified DOCK180 as a Rac GEF regulated by uPAR, we examined how DOCK180 is activated downstream of uPAR. Previous work in other systems shows that integrin signaling recruits DOCK180 to the plasma membrane via the formation of a p130Cas&#x02013;Crk&#x02013;DOCK180 complex. Key to the formation of this complex is tyrosine phosphorylation of the p130Cas SD that recruits Crk&#x02013;DOCK180 complexes via the SH2 domain of Crk. We show that uPAR, expressed endogenously by tumor cells or ectopically in HEK 293T cells, drives the tyrosine phosphorylation of the p130Cas SD and formation of the p130Cas&#x02013;Crk complex. For Rac activation by uPAR, uPA does not seem to be essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kjoller and Hall 2001</xref>) and is not expressed by HEK 293T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wei et al., 1994</xref>). However, uPA&#x02013;uPAR interactions may play an important role in other systems or in tumor cell invasion in vivo, whether by enhancing uPAR binding to vitronectin or through mechanisms such as focused ECM proteolysis at the leading edge or enhancing local availability of growth factors. Consistent with uPAR signaling through the p130Cas&#x02013;Crk complex, we find that p130Cas and Crk are required for Rac activation by uPAR and for the invasion of uPAR-expressing tumor cells.</p><p>p130Cas is a multifunctional adaptor protein required for embryonic development and oncogenic signal transduction in tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Auvinen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nievers et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Honda et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kirsch et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cabodi et al., 2006</xref>). It is also an important regulator of cell migration, and in particular its association with Crk constitutes a molecular switch vital for cell motility by recruiting DOCK180 to integrin-containing adhesion complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Klemke et al., 1998</xref>). These complexes also serve a mechanosensory function allowing the cell to sense the physical properties, such as rigidity, of the ECM (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bershadsky et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, in vitro data suggests that p130Cas can function as a transducer of mechanical signals, with the SD adopting an extended conformation permissive for phosphorylation in response to increased physical force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sawada et al., 2006</xref>). This could promote Rac-driven migration in response to physical cues in the extracellular environment. As we have shown that uPAR stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of the p130Cas SD, the role of uPAR in integrin-mediated mechanotransduction is an interesting subject for future investigation. In addition, it is well known that p130Cas and Crk can interact with other partners besides DOCK180. Therefore, promotion of p130Cas SD tyrosine phosphorylation and p130Cas&#x02013;CrkII complex assembly by uPAR may regulate a variety of other signaling pathways.</p><p>The identification of DOCK180, an integrin-associated GEF, in uPAR-Rac signaling is in keeping with a large body of evidence implicating integrins as the signaling partners of uPAR. A relatively large array of integrin heterodimers have been shown to interact with uPAR, but whether any of these are specifically required for uPAR to activate Rac in tumor cells had not been previously investigated. In the tumor cell lines we examined, &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> but not &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin was required for uPAR&#x02013;DOCK180 signaling to Rac activation. In HEK 293T cells, &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> as well as &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin are required for uPAR-stimulated Rac activation, but in these cells the role of &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin appears to be to provide the ERK activation (Aguirre-Ghiso et al., 1999) necessary for surface expression of &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>. Thus, in some cells uPAR&#x02013;&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin signaling to ERK-dependent surface expression of &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> cooperates with uPAR&#x02013;&#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> signaling for Rac activation, whereas in other cells uPAR&#x02013;&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin drives Rac activation but ERK activation does not seem to require uPAR or &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin signaling.</p><p>Several papers have emphasized the importance of vitronectin in membrane protrusion and cell motility induced by uPAR expression, and both integrin signaling and direct binding of uPAR to vitronectin were recently shown to be required for stimulation of membrane ruffling and lamellipodial protrusion by ectopic uPAR expression in HEK 293T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kjoller and Hall, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Madsen et al., 2007</xref>). We have shown that uPAR and &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin are required for Rac activation in tumor cells cultured on vitronectin or in the presence of serum, which is an abundant source of vitronectin with concentrations in the range of 200 to 400 &#x003bc;g/ml (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schvartz et al., 1999</xref>). In the collagen-1&#x02013;based three-dimensional invasion assay we have used, a function-blocking antivitronectin antibody inhibits serum-stimulated invasion, demonstrating that invasion is dependent on vitronectin. Consistent with its role in uPAR-driven Rac activation in the presence of vitronectin, silencing &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin expression also inhibits serum-stimulated invasion.</p><p>These data suggest that uPAR and &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin engage vitronectin to promote Rac activity and tumor cell invasion. The nature of uPAR&#x02013;integrin interactions is controversial. Although many studies have shown uPAR&#x02013;integrin coimmunoprecipitation, this does not prove the existence of direct binding. Immunoprecipitation under gentle conditions may result in the detection of many proteins associated with detergent-resistant lipid rafts, including uPAR and integrins. The study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Madsen et al. (2007)</xref> has cast doubt on the role of specific uPAR residues in mediating binding to integrins, although it does not rule out direct interactions involving multiple residues over a large binding surface. Our data are consistent with a model where both uPAR and &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin coordinately engage vitronectin. This could affect signaling in several ways, for example, by facilitation of integrin&#x02013;ligand interaction, effects on integrin clustering, or modification of integrin conformation by lateral uPAR&#x02013;integrin interactions. Interestingly, silencing uPAR expression or blocking uPAR function using an antibody that recognizes the vitronectin-binding site had no effect on the adhesion of tumor cells to vitronectin (Fig. S5, A&#x02013;C). Significantly, while this paper was in preparation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wei et al. (2008)</xref> have demonstrated that uPAR expression leads to the activation of &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrins in the murine kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wei et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, our data show that &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin silencing causes a severe cell motility phenotype in uPAR-expressing tumor cell lines, without affecting Rac activation but causing a delocalization of membrane ruffling and lamellipodia. &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin signaling may affect tumor cell polarity, for example, by regulating Cdc42, which is a major regulator of polarized migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Etienne-Manneville, 2004</xref>). Also by inhibiting internalization of lipid rafts, which contain both uPAR and binding sites for activated Rac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">del Pozo et al., 2004</xref>), and by regulating interactions with RhoGDI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Del Pozo et al., 2002</xref>), &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin may affect spatial control of Rac-driven protrusion and motility.</p><p>Determination of the molecular mechanisms underlying uPAR signaling, such as the Rac activation pathway described here, is essential to provide insight into the well-established role of uPAR in tumor cell invasion. Understanding these pathways will provide new therapeutic targets for the prevention of human tumor metastasis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies and reagents</title><p>The following antibodies were used: anti-Rac1 (clone 23A8; Fitzgerald), anti-uPAR (R&#x00026;D Systems), anti-GAPDH (Novus Biologicals), anti-DOCK180, anti&#x02013;&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>integrin, anti&#x02013;&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>integrin (clone P5D2; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti&#x02013;&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin (clone JB1a), anti&#x02013;&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin rabbit polyclonal, anti-&#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> (LM609), anti-&#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>5</sub> (P1F6), antivitronectin (clone BV2; Millipore), anti-p130Cas, anti-Crk, anti-FAK (BD Biosciences), anti&#x02013;&#x003b1;-tubulin, anti-total, phosphoERK (Sigma-Aldrich), anti-p130Cas phosphotyrosine 410 (Cell Signaling Technology), anti&#x02013;c-Src (clone GD11; Millipore), anti-Src phosphoY416 (Invitrogen), anti-FAK phosphoY397 (Affinity BioReagents), and mouse IgG isotype controls (R&#x00026;D systems).
