All members of the RecA family of recombinases polymerize on DNA to form helical nucleoprotein filaments, which is the active form of the protein. Here we compare the filament structures of the Rad51 and Dmc1 proteins from both human and budding yeast. Previous studies of Dmc1 filaments suggested that they might be structurally distinct from filaments of other members of the RecA family, including Rad51. The data presented here indicate that Rad51 and Dmc1 filaments are essentially identical with respect to several structural parameters, including persistence length, helical pitch, filament diameter, DNA base pairs per helical turn and helical handedness. These data, together with previous studies demonstrating similar <italic>in vitro</italic> recombinase activity for Dmc1 and Rad51, support the view that differences in the meiotic function of Rad51 and Dmc1 are more likely to result from the influence of distinct sets of accessory proteins than from intrinsic differences in filament structure.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>During meiosis, recombination ensures the proper segregation of chromosomes by establishing a physical connection between homologs, thus providing the tension required by the meiotic spindle to accurately separate paired chromosomes. The process of meiotic recombination is initiated by the programmed formation of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA. These DSBs are sites of assembly for the two RecA homologs present in most eukaryotes, the Rad51 recombinase, which functions during mitosis and meiosis and the meiosis-specific recombinase, Dmc1. The RecA homologs form helical filaments on overhanging 3' single-strand DNA ends produced by 5&#x02032; nucleolytic resection at DSBs. These nucleoprotein filaments then catalyse strand invasion and exchange between homologous chromosomes during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).</p><p>During recombination in diploid cells, a nucleoprotein recombinase filament can recombine with either a sister chromatid or one of the two homologous chromatids. During mitosis, when Rad51 is the only recombinase expressed, recombination occurs predominantly between sisters. In contrast, during meiosis when both Rad51 and Dmc1 are expressed, the majority of recombination occurs between homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>in vivo</italic> activities of Rad51 and Dmc1 are regulated by distinct sets of accessory factors. The ability of Dmc1 to contribute to meiotic recombination is influenced by its interactions with accessory factor proteins, including Mei5-Sae3, Hop2-Mnd1 and Tid1/Rdh54. While some of these proteins may interact with Rad51, the primary Rad51 accessory factors include Rad52, Rad55-Rad57 and Rad54. In addition to the unique regulation of Dmc1 by accessory factors during meiosis, a meiotic block to intersister recombination is established by abundant chromosome-associated structural proteins such as Red1 and Hop1 and by the meiosis-specific kinase Mek1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6 B7 B8 B9">4&#x02013;9</xref>).</p><p>A comparison of joint molecule formation by 2D gel analysis of <italic>dmc1</italic> and <italic>rad51</italic> mutants provided evidence that Dmc1 specifically promotes interhomolog recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). This study used a <italic>red1</italic> background in which the block to intersister recombination is defective and in which Dmc1-independent joints form. In the <italic>red1</italic> background, deletion of <italic>RAD51</italic> had no effect on the yield of interhomolog interactions but deletion of <italic>DMC1</italic> eliminated such interactions, leaving only intersister connections. These findings indicate that Dmc1 protein possesses an interhomolog-specific activity that Rad51 lacks. It is unclear to what extent, if any, the observed difference in interhomolog activity results from an intrinsic difference between Rad51 and Dmc1 proteins.</p><p>Rad51 and Dmc1 share 54% amino acid identity in humans and 45% amino acid identity in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Both Rad51 and Dmc1 have been found to be capable of catalyzing the key steps of recombination, as detected by the strand exchange and strand assimilation (D-loop) assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13 B14">11&#x02013;14</xref>). The optimal conditions for Dmc1 activity appear to be slightly different than those for Rad51 although overall the activities are strikingly similar. On the other hand, previous studies led to the suggestion that Dmc1 and Rad51 forms polymers that are structurally distinct.</p><p>Dmc1 differs from Rad51 in that it has a strong tendency to form octomeric rings <italic>in vitro</italic> and can bind DNA as stacked rings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17">15&#x02013;17</xref>). This led to the proposal that Dmc1 might promote recombination by a unique ring-based mechanism dramatically different from that of Rad51 and RecA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). However, it was subsequently shown that conditions which stimulate Dmc1 recombinase activity also stimulate its ability to form filaments that are similar to those formed by Rad51 and RecA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18 B19 B20 B21">18&#x02013;21</xref>). These findings strongly support the view that the functional form of Dmc1, at least for <italic>in vitro</italic> recombination reactions, is the helical filament. Whether or not the toroid form of Dmc1 plays a role <italic>in vivo</italic> remains to be determined.</p><p>Two recent papers suggested that helical nucleoprotein filaments formed by the budding yeast Dmc1 (ScDmc1) differed from those formed by other members of the RecA family including Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). These two studies used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to generate images of ScDmc1 filaments. Analysis of these images indicated that filaments had a helical pitch of 13.4 &#x000b1; 2.5 nm and a filament width of 13.5 &#x000b1; 0.8 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). A second study by the same group reported a helical pitch of 16.3 &#x000b1; 0.8 nm with a width of 14.9 &#x000b1; 1 nm for filaments formed by the same protein as that used in the first study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). These values are in contrast to those reported for Rad51 and RecA filaments, which have respective average pitches of 9.9 nm and 9.2 nm and widths of &#x0223c;10&#x02013;11 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). In the first of the two AFM studies, a determination of the number of striations for apparently full-length filaments on an 872 bp linear DNA substrate resulted in an estimate of 24 &#x000b1; 2 nucleotides per helical turn of the ScDmc1 filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Assuming that each protomer in the filament binds three nucleotides, this finding suggested that there could be eight protomers per helical turn in the filament. Alternatively, if Dmc1 binds with six protomers per turn like RecA and Rad51, the value of 24 &#x000b1; 2 nucleotides per turn would indicate a DNA binding ratio of 1:4 monomers per nucleotide. The second of the two AFM papers on ScDmc1 also reported that the protein can form left-handed helical filaments on DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), in contrast to previous reports on RecA and Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). In addition to the reported differences between Dmc1 and Rad51, published AFM images of Dmc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) raised the possibility that the meiosis-specific protein forms straighter, more rigid, filaments than those seen by AFM of Rad51, RadA or RecA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27 B28 B29 B30 B31">27&#x02013;31</xref>). The possibility that Dmc1 might form more rigid filaments than Rad51 was of interest to us because intrinsic or imposed structural rigidity of recombinase filaments could cause those filaments to extend away from the axial elements that organize sister chromatids into loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Such extended structures could act to prevent intersister recombination and promote interhomolog recombination.</p><p>In order to better characterize the structure of Dmc1 filaments and compare them to Rad51 filaments we used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) following negative staining with uranyl acetate to compare the structural features of filaments side-by-side. We analyzed Rad51 and Dmc1 filaments from both the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and human. We also generated a reconstruction of the human Dmc1 (HsDmc1) filament as well as collecting measurements of persistence length, helical pitch, diameter and base pairs per turn for Dmc1 in parallel with Rad51. The helical handedness of Dmc1 was also determined. The data presented indicate the filaments formed by Dmc1 and Rad51 from either yeast or human are strikingly similar to one another and to those formed by their bacterial relative, RecA. Possible explanations for the unusual characteristics of the previously reported AFM images of ScDmc1 filaments are discussed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>DNA substrates</title><p>Single-stranded DNA substrates were created by purification of denatured PCR products.

The structures of ScDmc1- and ScRad51-ssDNA complexes were examined by TEM after negative staining with 1% uranyl acetate. These recombinase-coated DNA molecules were measured for end-to-end distance (R) and for contour length (L). The parameter used to describe filament stiffness is persistence length (&#x003bb;); a lower value for &#x003bb; indicates a more flexible filament. The persistence length of filaments observed by TEM was calculated as described in <sc>Materials and Methods</sc> section. To avoid misunderstanding, we note that different definitions of persistence lengths have been used in different studies. The equation used here and in some previous studies gives a value of the persistence length twice that given by the method used by Rivetti <italic>et al</italic>.

RecA filaments were formed under the same conditions with the exception of using ATP&#x003b3;S as the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog in place of AMP-PNP. The persistence length of ScDmc1 was determined to be 507 &#x000b1; 45.2 nm and that of ScRad51 543 &#x000b1; 45.3 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The persistence length of RecA was also quite similar to the two eukaryotic proteins, 464 &#x000b1; 42.2 nm. The relative values of Rad51 and Dmc1 persistence length indicate that there is no significant difference in filament stiffness between these recombinase filaments under the conditions examined. A recently reported HsRad51 persistence length value of 190 &#x000b1; 12 nm, while lower than the values we have determined for the yeast proteins, is still consistent with our findings due to the fact that the filaments examined by magnetic tweezer analysis do not fully saturate the DNA substrate on which they were formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Persistence length of ScRad51 and ScDmc1 filaments.

To further examine these parameters, we conducted a side-by-side comparison of Rad51 and Dmc1 using both yeast and human protein, with respect to filament pitch and diameter. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, the measurements of Dmc1- and Rad51-ssDNA filaments formed in the presence of AMP-PNP and Mg<sup>+2</sup> indicate that the distributions of pitch values are the same for all four proteins. The average pitch values for the yeast proteins were 10.2 &#x000b1; 0.8 nm for Rad51 and 10.4 &#x000b1; 0.8 nm for Dmc1. The average pitch values for the human proteins were 10.1 &#x000b1; 0.7 nm for Rad51 and 10.1 &#x000b1; 0.7 nm for Dmc1.

The canonical helical stoichiometry of six protomers per turn predicts &#x0223c;9 turns/180 bp, &#x0223c;7 turns/140 bp and &#x0223c;5 turns/100 bp (indicated by the black arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) while a stoichiometry of 24 bp/turn predicts &#x0223c;7.5 turns/180 bp, &#x0223c;5.8 turns/140 bp and &#x0223c;4.2 turns/100 bp (indicated by grey arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). The samples of ScRad51 and ScDmc1 filaments formed on these three linear substrates were used to compare the distribution of striation number and filament lengths of each protein, allowing for a relative comparison of helical stoichiometry. The striation number averages for ScDmc1 filaments (7.6 &#x000b1; 2.4 turns/180 bp, 6.0 &#x000b1; 1.9 turns/140 bp and 4.5 &#x000b1; 1.7 turns/180 bp) were lower than the ScRad51 striation numbers (9.2 &#x000b1; 2.7 turns/180 bp, 7.2 &#x000b1; 1.5 turns/140 bp, 6.1 &#x000b1; 2.7 turns/bp). This appears to be due to a tendency of our preparations of ScDmc1 to form shorter filaments that do not saturate the substrate. Importantly, the distributions displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> have identical peaks for both ScRad51 and ScDmc1 on all three substrates (9 turns/180 bp, 7 turns/140 bp, 5 turns/100 bp). We interpret the filaments having the peak value to be those in which the DNA substrate is saturated. This conclusion is supported by concordance of the &#x0223c;19 bp/striation value obtained from ScRad51 filaments formed on all three small linear DNAs and the circular DNA substrate. Interestingly, the detection of a small number of very long filaments raises the possibility that the recombinase filaments may be capable of extending beyond the end of the DNA substrate. Regardless, all filaments formed were of the predicted length for the given filament's striation number, providing further support of conserved pitch length as evidenced by the linear distribution of each sample (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn352/DC1">Supplementary Figure 1</ext-link>). The helical stoichiometry of ScDmc1 binding at saturation to each of the three linear molecules gives the predicted values for filaments with &#x0223c;19 bp/turn. These numbers indicate that ScDmc1 filaments unwind the DNA substrate to which they are bound to the same extent as ScRad51, HsDmc1 and all other RecA-like protein filaments. <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Distribution of helical turns for ScDmc1 and ScRad51 filaments.

The molecular structure of the ATPase domain of HsDmc1 is accommodated by the volume of the large lobe of protomers in the filament reconstruction. In light of similarity to the Rad51 filament, the HsDmc1 reconstruction suggests that the smaller lobes are N-terminal domains. Both the HsRad51 and HsDmc1 reconstructions suggest they have an average of &#x0223c;6 protomers per helical turn. In the case of HsDmc1 this finding is supported by the fact that alternate reconstructions, including one that assumed eight protomers per turn, cannot accommodate the volume of the ATPase domain crystal structure. Although the consensus structure appears to be &#x0223c;6 protomers per turn, the pitch and twist of Dmc1 filaments are quite variable. This finding makes it likely that regions of the coil can contain either more or fewer than six protomers per turn.</p><p>The helical stoichiometry of both yeast and HsDmc1 filaments has been shown here to be approximately 19 bp/helical turn. This comparison demonstrated the same base pair per helical turn ratio for each protein and therefore suggests the same monomer to DNA binding ratio. By extension, these data indicate that all four proteins, including ScDmc1, bind to DNA with the same helical stoichiometry. Although the current data do not represent a direct determination of the stoichiometry of DNA binding per protomer, the observation of filaments with &#x0223c;19bp/turn and goodness of fit of the six-protomer-per-turn reconstruction makes it highly likely that Dmc1 binds to DNA at a ratio of 1 protomer to 3 bp.</p><p>Our investigation of the helicity of yeast Dmc1 detected only right-handed filaments RecA and Rad51 as has been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Two previous AFM studies of RadA proteins reported different results on filament helicity with one study finding only right-handed filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) and a second reporting both right- and left-handed filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). As mentioned above, another report included an AFM image that appears to be a left-handed filament of Dmc1 on DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). An explanation for the apparent discrepancy is provided below.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with observations by AFM</title><p>In the published images of ScDmc1 from AFM studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), filaments are particularly straight, in contrast to virtually all EM analyses of other recombinase proteins, including HsDmc1, HsRad51, ScRad51 and RecA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>) and in contrast to AFM images of Rad51, RadA and RecA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27 B28 B29 B30 B31">27&#x02013;31</xref>). However, our persistence length calculations for long ScDmc1 and ScRad51 filaments showed no difference in the rigidity of these filaments. An examination of the previously published Dmc1 AFM images reveals what appears to be irregularities in the mica upon which the filaments were deposited and the parallel alignment of multiple filaments within a single field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). It is possible that these irregularities are the result of lattice steps in the mica substrate acting to trap filaments along straight lines (C. Wyman, personal communication).</p><p>The alignment of filaments may also be due to the movement of the air&#x02013;liquid interface (meniscus) along the mica surface during preparation of samples for AFM analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49 B50 B51 B52 B53 B54 B55">49&#x02013;55</xref>). Large pitch values obtained by AFM could have resulted from the stretching of the filaments by meniscus movement or they could reflect tip diameter as has been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). We therefore suspect that, if the striations seen by AFM reflect helical turns, such striations were from a subset of filaments that were stretched during sample preparation. It is possible, therefore, that the unusual properties of the filaments seen in these images reflect filament elasticity rather than structural differences between ScDmc1 and other members of this protein family.</p><p>Although tip diameter and sample deposition effects might explain most discrepancies between previous AFM analyses and the present TEM study, they do not explain the observation of left-handed helical filaments. We examined the helicity of over 60 ssDNA filaments and more than 80 dsDNA filaments formed in the presence of calcium and ATP, the same conditions in which Chen <italic>et al</italic>. report left-handed helices of Dmc1. Our observations indicate that if Dmc1 can form left-handed helices, it does so only rarely under these conditions. An alternative explanation for the source of the AFM image interpreted as showing left handedness (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn352/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1A</ext-link> in ref. 22 for Dmc1 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> of ref. 48 for SsoRadA) is filament bundling. Filament bundling results in formation of both left- and right-handed structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>). We therefore argue that there is no clear evidence at present for left-handed nucleoprotein filament formation of any RecA-like recombinase. In this context it is important to note that one member of this protein family has been crystallized as a left-handed helix with four protomers per turn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). However, this form was obtained in the absence of DNA and its biological relevance remains to be determined. The ability of RadA to form right- and left-handed helices as well as toroids demonstrates the structural flexibility of this class of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Implications of structural and functional conservation</title><p>The helical structure of the RecA-like recombinases is very highly conserved. These proteins significantly underwind and extend the DNA substrate within the filament. It is this distortion of the DNA that has been proposed to be the essential structural condition for the pairing and exchange reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). All available data, including those presented here indicate that this requirement is met by the meiosis-specific Dmc1 filament.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, there is little difference between the biochemical activities of Rad51 and Dmc1.

While there are some distinctions in optimal <italic>in vitro</italic> reaction conditions, it is not clear to what extent these differences are biologically relevant.</p><p>In light of the conserved filament structure and the growing body of data indicating conserved intrinsic biochemical activity for Dmc1 and Rad51, it seems likely that the factors that differentiate these proteins <italic>in vivo</italic> are their distinct protein&#x02013;protein interactions. In particular, these data provide no evidence for any intrinsic difference in filament rigidity between Rad51 and Dmc1. This result argues against the possibility that this intrinsic rigidity underlies the difference in the ability of Rad51 and Dmc1 to promote interhomolog as opposed to intersister recombination. Nonetheless, it is still possible that Dmc1's interhomolog preference involves projection of filaments away from axial elements. For example, projection from axial element may require Dmc1-specific interactions with one or more accessory factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Further study of the structure of recombination complexes <italic>in vivo</italic> will be required to determine how interhomolog recombination preference is achieved.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn352/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="gkn352_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="gkn352_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Phoebe Rice for helpful advice as well as for the ScRad51 expression plasmid and ScRad51 purification protocol, Phillip P.
