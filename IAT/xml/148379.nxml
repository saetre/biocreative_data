These masked paternal mRNAs are stored and translated at specific times of germ cell development. Little is known about the mammalian testicular mRNA masking proteins bound to non-polysomal mRNAs. In this report, the major proteins binding to non-polysomal testicular mRNAs were isolated and analyzed. The two predominant proteins identified were: a Y-box protein (MSY2), the mammalian homolog to the Xenopus oocyte masking protein FRGY2/mRNP3+4, and a poly(A) binding protein. A kinase activity was also found associated with these non-polysomal RNAs. The kinase co-immunoprecipitates with MSY2 and phosphorylates MSY2 in vitro. The MSY2 associated kinase is not casein kinase 2, the kinase believed to phosphorylate mRNP3+4 in oocytes, but a yet unidentified kinase. MSY2 was found to be phosphorylated in vivo and MSY2 dephosphorylation led to a decrease in its affinity to bind RNA as judged by northwestern blotting. Therefore, testicular masked mRNAs may be regulated by the phosphorylation state of MSY2. Reconstitution experiments in which non-polysomal mRNA-binding proteins are dissociated from their RNAs and allowed to bind to exogenous mRNAs suggest that MSY2 binds RNA in a sequence-independent fashion. Furthermore, association of the non-polysomal derived proteins to exogenous non-specific mRNAs led to their translational repression in vitro.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
