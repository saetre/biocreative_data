The cdc10+ gene encodes a component of the DSC1Sp/MBF transcription complex, which is required for cell-cycle regulated expression at G1-S of several genes via cis-acting MCB (MIuI cell cycle box) elements. At permissive temperatures cdc10-C4 causes expression of MCB-regulated genes through the whole cell cycle, which in asynchronously dividing cells is manifested in overall higher expression levels. This overexpression phenotype is cold sensitive: in cdc10-C4 cells, MCB genes are expressed offprogressively higher levels at lower temperatures. In heterozygous cdc10-C4/cdc10+ diploid strains, MCB-regulated genes are not overexpressed, suggesting that loss, rather than alteration, of function of the cdc10-C4 gene product is the reason for unregulated target gene expression. Consistent with this, the cdc10-C4 mutant allele is known to encode a truncated protein. We have also overexpressed the region of the cdc10 protein absent in cdc10-C4 under the control of an inducible promoter. This induces a G1 delay, and additionally causes a reduction of the overexpression of MCB genes in cdc10-C4 strains. These results suggest that DSC1Sp/MBF represses, as well as activates, MCB gene expression during the cell cycle.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00023-0029-a" xlink:role="4763"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00023-0029-b" xlink:role="4763"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00023-0030-a" xlink:role="4764"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00023-0031-a" xlink:role="4765"/></fig><fig id="F5"><graphic xlink:href="nar00023-0032-a" xlink:role="4766"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00023-0027.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4761"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00023-0028.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4762"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00023-0029.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4763"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00023-0030.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4764"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00023-0031.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4765"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00023-0032.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4766"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00023-0033.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4767"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00023-0034.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4768"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
