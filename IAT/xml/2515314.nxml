In this study, peptidase activities, activation profiles, and the subunit composition of the 20S proteasome purified from the <italic>rpt6-1 </italic>mutant was characterized.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The 20S proteasome purified from <italic>rpt6-1 </italic>exhibited low levels of peptidase activities in the absence of activators, but nearly same activated activities in the presence of activators, suggesting a gating defect in the proteasome channel. Detailed analyses of the composition of the 20S proteasome through separation of all subunits by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by identification of each subunit using MALDI-TOF-MS revealed that two subunits, &#x003b1;1 and &#x003b1;7, differed from those of wild-type cells in both electrophoretic mobility and p<italic>I </italic>values. The changes in these two &#x003b1;-subunits were apparent at the permissive temperature, but disappeared during stress response at the restrictive temperature. Interestingly, upon disappearance of these changes, the levels of peptidase activity of the 20S proteasome in the <italic>rpt6-1 </italic>mutant were restored as the wild-type. These results suggest that two different forms of the &#x003b1;-subunits, &#x003b1;1 and &#x003b1;7, block the proteasome channel in the <italic>rpt6-1 </italic>mutant.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Two &#x003b1;-subunits (&#x003b1;1 and &#x003b1;7) of the 20S proteasome in the <italic>rpt6-1 </italic>mutant differed from their wild-type counterparts and peptidase activities were found to be lower in the mutant than in the wild-type strain.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The 26S proteasome is an essential enzyme found in all eukaryotic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] consisting of a cylinder-shaped multimeric complex, the 20S proteasome core particle, capped at each end by another multimeric complex, the 19S regulatory unit. The ATPase ring of the regulatory unit comprising six ATPase subunits (Rpt1-Rpt6) associates directly with the 20S proteasome and is thought to play multiple roles within the complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The 20S proteasome degrades unfolded substrate proteins in an ATP- and ubiquitin-independent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. It has been proposed that both unfolding and translocation of substrates are mediated by the six ATPases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Crystallographic structural analysis shows that the ends of the 20S proteasome are in a closed state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. It has also been postulated that the ATPases can open the proteasome channel leading to the proteolytic chamber within the 20S proteasome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The 20S proteasome functions as the catalytic center of the 26S proteasome that can cleave peptides on the carboxyl side of hydrophobic, basic, and acidic amino acids <italic>in vitro </italic>that have been designated as chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and PGPH activities, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>The entrance to the 20S proteasome cavity is closed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The N-terminal tails of the different &#x003b1;-subunits adopt different conformations in the closed state and point inwards to block access through the proteasome channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Due to the narrow entrance of the 20S proteasome, access is restricted. It is thought that channel gating is regulated by the ATPase subunits in the 19S regulatory unit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Little is known about this process in eukaryotic proteasomes. The closed channel of the eukaryotic 20S proteasome can be stimulated by a variety of means; one of which is mild chemical treatment, such as the exposure to low concentrations of SDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The stimulation may reflect opening of the proteasome channel that allows greater access of protein substrates to the proteolytic chamber. The N-terminal segments of various &#x003b1;-subunits that seal the central channel are generally rearranged to yield the activated form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>rpt6-1 Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>mutant is temperature-sensitive for growth, being able to grow at 25&#x000b0;C but not at 37&#x000b0;C with cell division arrested in G2/Metaphase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Normally, traffic through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is greatly increased in cells at an elevated temperature due to the abundance of misfolded or partially denatured protein substrates that must be removed. The defective proteasome in the <italic>rpt6-1 </italic>mutant is unable to process the increased protein traffic properly and cells eventually die due to the deleterious effects of accumulated misfolded proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>rpt6-1 </italic>deletion mutant has been used previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In this study, we isolated the 20S proteasome from the <italic>rpt6-1 </italic>mutant and compared its peptidase activities to those of the wild-type strain. Surprisingly, distinct changes in peptidase activities and in subunit composition were observed in the 20S proteasome. A detailed comparative analysis using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry was then undertaken to investigate the molecular mechanism(s) responsible for the observed changes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Chemicals</title><p>The peptide substrates, Suc-LLVY-MCA, Boc-LRR-MCA, and Z-LLE-MCA, were purchased from Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan).

The diluted sample was applied to a hydroxyapatite column (1.6 &#x000d7; 7.5 cm) previously equilibrated with buffer B (60 mM K-phosphate, pH 7.5, and 10% glycerol). The column was washed with the same buffer and eluted with a gradient of 60&#x02013;300 mM K-phosphate containing 10% glycerol. The proteasome eluted at ~200 mM K-phosphate. Active fractions were combined and concentrated by ultrafiltration using an AMICON YM30 membrane (Millipore Corporation, USA). The concentrated sample was applied to a Superose-6 column (1.6 &#x000d7; 50 cm) and eluted with buffer A excluding DTT. The active fractions were combined, concentrated, and stored at -20&#x000b0;C prior to use. All preparative steps were carried out at 4&#x000b0;C.

In yeast, the 20S proteasome is auto-inhibited by the N-terminal segments of &#x003b1;-subunits in the center of the heptameric &#x003b1;-ring. The 20S proteasome is usually purified in a latent state having low levels of peptidase activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] that can be subsequently activated by a mild chaotropic agent, such as SDS or linolenic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. These agents selectively denature the N-terminal region and open the &#x003b1;-channel of the 20S proteasome cavity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. By use of an enzymatic approach, peptidase activities of the 20S proteasome purified from the <italic>rpt6-1 </italic>mutant (20S<sub>r </sub>proteasome) and activation profiles were compared to those of the wild-type strain towards three peptidyl substrates; Suc-LLVY-MCA for chymotrypsin-like activity (hereafter termed LLVY-activity), Z-LLE-MCA for PGPH activity (LLE-activity), and Boc-LRR-MCA for trypsin-like activity (LRR-activity). Relative to the 20S proteasome purified from the wild-type strain (20S<sub>w </sub>proteasome), 20S<sub>r </sub>proteasome exhibited weak peptidase activities in the absence of SDS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Optimal activities were found at 0.01% SDS in both yeast strains as reported by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and that seemed to reflect a convergence (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The SDS appeared to inactivate LRR-activity as previously found by Thomas <italic>et al</italic>. (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Trypsin-like activity and its SDS-mediated profile in the 20S<sub>r </sub>proteasome was evaluated using the peptidyl substrate Boc-LRR-MCA even though this type of peptidase is inactivated by SDS. In the absence of SDS, the 20S<sub>r </sub>proteasome hydrolyzed less peptidyl substrate than the 20S<sub>w </sub>proteasome, but both were almost equally active in its presence. This result suggests that the entrance of the &#x003b1;-channel in the 20S<sub>r </sub>proteasome is too narrow to allow passage of a peptidyl substrate to the catalytic chamber.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>SDS-mediated activation profile</bold>.

However, the linolenic acid-mediated optimal activities were found at ~50 &#x003bc;g/ml linolenic acid in both strains under the experimental conditions.
