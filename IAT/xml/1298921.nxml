This factor is expressed during the immediate-early stage of the lytic cycle to activate the genes required for EBV lytic development. Although transcription activation by Rta is frequently associated with the binding of Rta to the Rta-response element (RRE) in promoters, Rta sometimes activates promoters without an RRE. Here we show that Rta interacts with an Sp1-interacting protein, MBD1-containing chromatin-associated factor 1 (MCAF1). This interaction is critical to the formation of an Sp1&#x02013;MCAF1&#x02013;Rta complex at Sp1 sites. Therefore, following lytic induction and the expression of Rta, Rta increases Sp1-mediated transcription. The genes that are thus activated include <italic>p16</italic>, <italic>p21</italic>, <italic>SNRPN</italic> and BRLF1. However, the binding of Rta to RRE prevents the interaction between Rta and MCAF1; therefore, transcription activation by RRE depends only on Rta, and not on MCAF1 or Sp1. Furthermore, this study finds that MCAF1 promotes the expression of Rta and Zta from EBV, indicating that MCAF1 participates EBV lytic activation. Our study documents the critical role of Rta in regulating the transcription of the genes that are mediated by Sp1.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Rta, encoded by BRLF1, is a transcription factor expressed by Epstein&#x02013;Barr virus (EBV) during the immediate-early stage of the lytic cycle. This factor often cooperates with another EBV immediate-early protein, Zta, to activate synergistically the transcription of EBV lytic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). These two immediate-early proteins are crucial to EBV lytic activation because mutants that do not produce either one of these two proteins do not produce infectious EBV particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Earlier studies have established that Rta frequently activates transcription by binding to a 17 bp <italic>cis</italic> sequence, the Rta-response element (RRE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). The EBV genes that are activated in this way include BMRF1, BHRF1, BHLF1 and BMLF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). However, Rta also activates the transcription of BRLF1, BZLF1, BALF5 and BNLF1 of EBV, which lack an RRE in their promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). Although exactly how Rta activates these promoters is unclear, an earlier work demonstrated that the Sp1 sites in the BRLF1 promoter (Rp) are critical to the activation by Rta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). However, Rta does not appear to interact directly with Sp1 to activate the transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>).</p><p>MBD1-containing chromatin-associated factor 1 (MCAF1), a human homolog of murine ATFa-associated modulator, is a transcription factor of 1270 amino acids with a transcriptional repression activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). MCAF1 enhances SETDB1/ESET-mediated histone H3 methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>) to promote the formation of heterochromatin domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). MCAF1 also interacts with MBD1 and Sp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). The interaction between MCAF1 and MBD1 is crucial to MBD1-dependent transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>); when it binds to MBD1, MCAF1 forms a repressive complex with MBD1 to prevent transcription from a methylated promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). However, when binding to Sp1, MCAF1 becomes a coactivator to enhance Sp1-mediated transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). This work finds that Rta interacts with MCAF1, which facilitates the formation of an Sp1&#x02013;MCAF1&#x02013;Rta complex on the Sp1-binding site to autoregulate the transcription of BRLF1 and regulate the host genes in EBV-infected cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell lines and EBV lytic induction</title><p>P3HR1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium that contained 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). 293T and 293 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. P3HR1 cells were treated with 3 ng/ml of 12-<italic>O</italic>-tetradecanoylphobol-13-acetate (TPA) and 3 mM sodium butyrate to activate the EBV lytic cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>).

Plasmids pcDNA-MCAF1, pHA-Rta, pRRE, pRp-luc, pCMV-R(K213A) and pET-Rta were described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Plasmid pGEX-4T1, which expresses GST, was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Hong Kong). The DNA fragment that encodes p621 (amino acids 650&#x02013;1270 of MCAF1) was isolated from pcDNA-MCAF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>) by HpaI&#x02013;XhoI digestion and inserted into the SmaI and XhoI sites to yield plasmid pGST-621. The Sp1 gene was amplified by PCR, using GST-Sp1 (5&#x02032;-CCGGAATTCATGGATGAAATGACAGCTGTG) and Sp1-His (5&#x02032;-ACGCGTCGACAAGCCATTGCCACTGATA) as primers, and plasmid pCMV-Sp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>), which was obtained from Guntram Suske, as a template. The fragment was inserted into the EcoRV and SalI sites of pET32a or pGEX-4T1 to form plasmid pET-Sp1 or pGST-Sp1, respectively. Plasmid pR-Sp1 was constructed by inserting a double-stranded oligonucleotide that contained a sequence that covers the region between &#x02212;53 and +4 of Rta, into the SmaI site of pGL2-Basic (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). In this sequence (5&#x02032;-GTC<underline>CCGCCC</underline>ATGCCA<underline>GATATCCATAAAA</underline>GACCAGTAATCCATGTCAGCCGGCCTTT), a ZRE sequence and a nucleotide residue that precedes the sequence was mutated from 5&#x02032;-ATGGCTCA to 5&#x02032;-GATATCCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). The Sp1 site (5&#x02032;-CCGCCC), the mutated ZRE sequence and the TATA sequence (5-ATAAAA) are underlined. Plasmid pR-mSp1 includes the same sequence as pR-Sp1, except in that the Sp1 site, 5&#x02032;-CCGCCC, was changed to 5&#x02032;-ATTAAT. R-TATA (5&#x02032;-CATAAAAGACCAGTAATCCATGTCAGCCGGCCTTT), which contains a sequence from the region from &#x02212;32 to +4 in Rp, was inserted into the SmaI site of pGL2-Basic to construct plasmid pTA. Plasmid pSp1-luc contains four of the six Sp1-binding sites from the promoter of <italic>p21</italic> upstream of the firefly luciferase gene (<italic>luc</italic>) in pTA. Plasmid pFlag-Rta that expresses full-length Flag-tagged Rta was constructed by inserting a PCR-amplified BRLF1 fragment into pCMV-Tag2A (Stratagene) at the EcoRI and XhoI sites. The same approach was employed to produce deletions in Flag-tagged Rta (Flag-Stu, Flag-HincII, Flag-HinfI and Flag-EcoRII), which lacked the regions between amino acids 1 and 190, 1 and 254, 1 and 290, and 1 and 360, respectively. Plasmid pEGFP-MCAF1-N, which contains the N-terminal 561 amino acids of MCAF1, was constructed by inserting a PCR-amplified fragment into the HindIII and SmaI sites of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). Plasmids pEGFP-MCAF1-D1 and pEGFP-MCAF1-D2 were also constructed using the same strategy. An Rta deletion mutant, HA-RN290 that contains the N-terminal 290 amino acids of Rta was constructed by inserting a PCR fragment into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3-HA. Plasmid pEGFP-R255/290, which encodes the region between amino acid 255 and 290 in Rta fused with green fluorescence protein (GFP), was constructed by inserting a PCR-amplified fragment into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pEGFP-C1. Plasmid pp21-luc was obtained from W.-C. Hung.

A biotin-labeled probe that contained an RRE sequence (5&#x02032;-CATGTCCCTCTATCATGGCGCAGAC) from the BMLF1 promoter was utilized to demonstrate the binding of Rta to RRE. A cell lysate prepared from P3HR1 cells treated with TPA/sodium butyrate or 293T cells transfected with pCMV-R was mixed with 0.2 &#x000b5;g of a biotin-labeled probe in a binding buffer that contained 60 mM KCl, 12 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 4 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT and 10 &#x000b5;g/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin and 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride.

GST or GST&#x02013;p621 bound to glutathione&#x02013;Sepharose beads were added to the lysate that had been prepared from P3HR1 cells treated with TPA and sodium butyrate.

P3HR1 cells were cotransfected with pcDNA-MCAF1, pCMV-R and pR-Sp1. After the cells were treated with formaldehyde to cross-link DNA and proteins, DNA was isolated, sonicated and immunoprecipitated with anti-Sp1, anti-MCAF1 and anti-Rta antibody. PCR amplification of immunoprecipitated DNA with primers that are complementary to the vector sequences that flank the Rp segment in pR-Sp1 demonstrated that these three antibodies immunoprecipitated the Rp segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, lanes 3&#x02013;5). The DNA fragment was not amplified by PCR if anti-IgG antibody was utilized to immunoprecipitate DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, lane 2). The Rp sequence was undetected when pR-mSp1 was cotransfected into the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, lanes 7&#x02013;10). In this work, the ZRE sequence in Rp in both pR-Sp1 and pR-mSp1 was purposely mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Mutating this ZRE sequence was necessary to detect the binding of Sp1, MCAF1 and Rta to the Sp1 site by CHIP analysis, because according to our unpublished results, MCAF1 and Rta interact with Zta and form a complex on ZRE.</p></sec><sec><title>Mapping the interaction domains in MCAF1 and Rta</title><p>Plasmids that expressed Rta and derivatives of MCAF1 fused to GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) were cotransfected into 293T cells. Immunoblot analysis revealed that a GFP fusion protein, which contained the region between amino acids 562 and 981 of MCAF1 (GFP-MCAF1-D1), was coimmunoprecipitated with Rta by anti-Rta antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, lane 7). However, GFP alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, lane 5) and a GFP fusion protein that contained the region from amino acid 1 to 561 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, lane 6) or from 982 to 1270 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, lane 8) in MCAF1 were not coimmunoprecipitated by anti-Rta antibody. Thus, the region between amino acid 562 and 981 in MCAF1 interacts with Rta. Additionally, GST&#x02013;p621, which contains the region between amino acid 650 and 1270 in MCAF1, binds to Rta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), indicating that the region between amino acid 650 and 981 in MCAF1 interacts with Rta. We performed a similar study using Flag-tagged Rta, HA-tagged Rta and GFP&#x02013;Rta fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) to identify the regions in Rta that interact with MCAF1. Coimmunoprecipitation with anti-MCAF1 antibody revealed that full-length Rta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, lanes 2, 8 and 11), the N-terminal 290 amino acid region (HA-RN290) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, lane 9), Rta without the N-terminal 190 amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, lane 3) and Rta without the N-terminal 254 amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, lane 4), interact with MCAF1. Further deleting Rta into the C-terminal region prevented the proteins from being coimmunoprecipitated by anti-MCAF1 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, lanes 5 and 6), indicating that the region between amino acids 255 and 290 in Rta interacts with MCAF1. Furthermore, immunoblot analysis revealed that a faint band, which migrated to a position slightly higher than that of the 62 kDa marker, was nonspecifically detected by anti-Rta antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, lanes 5 and 6). To confirm that the 255&#x02013;290 amino acid region indeed interacted with MCAF1, a plasmid, which expresses a protein that contains a GFP sequence in the N-terminal region fused with the amino acid 255&#x02013;290 region of Rta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, lane 12), was transfected into cells.

Meanwhile, cotransfecting 1 &#x000b5;g of pcDNA-MCAF1 had little effect on the transcription of <italic>luc</italic> from the reporter plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). However, as expected, transfecting pCMV-R activated the transcription of <italic>luc</italic> from the reporter plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Furthermore, transfecting pcDNA-MCAF1 enhanced the transcription of the luciferase gene activated by Rta in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). The activity increased to &#x0223c;130, 180 and 300% of the original value when 1, 3 and 5 &#x000b5;g of pcDNA-MCAF1 were cotransfected, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Similar results were obtained when another reporter plasmid, pR-Sp1, which contained the region between &#x02212;53 and +8 in Rp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), was transfected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>).

However, although transfecting pCMV-R activated an RRE-reporter plasmid, pRRE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), cotransfecting pcDNA-MCAF1 did not further increase the transcription activity in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), indicating that MCAF1 cannot increase the activity of Rta on RRE. Rta also activated an RRE promoter (pRRE) to a level of &#x0223c;1.5 times that of an Sp1 promoter (pR-Sp1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>), indicating that Rta activates an Sp1 promoter almost as efficiently as it does an RRE promoter.</p></sec><sec><title>Activation of Rta expression and the EBV lytic cycle by MCAF1</title><p>To examine how MCAF1 influences the expression of Rta, 20 &#x000b5;g of pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA-MCAF1 was transfected into 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> of P3HR1 cells. Immunoblot analysis with anti-Rta antibody did not detect the expression of Rta at 48 h after the transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, lanes 2 and 3). Cotransfecting the cells with 0.5 &#x000b5;g of pCMV-R and 1 or 5 &#x000b5;g of pcDNA-MCAF1 also did not result in the synthesis of Rta at a level detectable by IB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, lane 4 and 5). However, Rta was detected if the cells were cotransfected with 0.5 &#x000b5;g of pCMV-R and &#x0003e;10 &#x000b5;g of pcDNA-MCAF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, lanes 6 and 7). A similar study was also performed in 293 cells that were infected with maxi-EBV. Because EBV expresses Rta constitutively in epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, lane 2), a low level of Rta expression was detected in the cells that were transfected with an empty vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, lanes 3 and 4). However, the expression of Rta was markedly higher 1 and 2 days after the cells had been transfected with 20 &#x000b5;g of pcDNA-MCAF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, lanes 5 and 6). Meanwhile, the transfection also led to the expression of another EBV immediate-early protein, Zta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, lanes 5 and 6). Meanwhile, pcDNA-MCAF1, pCMV-R and pRRE were also transfected into 293T cells. Transfecting pcDNA-MCAF1 did not increase the capacity of pCMV-R to activate pRRE (data not shown), suggesting that MCAF1 did not activate the expression of Rta from the CMV promoter (data not shown). This finding shows that the increased Rta expression observed in this study is caused by the autoregulation of BRLF1 transcription rather than the activation of the CMV promoter by MCAF1.</p></sec><sec><title>Activation of an RRE promoter by Rta is independent of MCAF1 and Sp1</title><p>Transfecting pcDNA-MCAF1 had little effect on the activation of an RRE-reporter plasmid by Rta, so we tested whether the Rta&#x02013;MCAF1&#x02013;Sp1 complex could bind to RRE. A DAPA experiment with a biotin-labeled RRE probe showed that streptavidin beads could capture Rta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>, lane 2). The beads did not capture Rta when a mutant probe (mRRE), in which the RRE sequence was mutated, was utilized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>, lane 3), indicating that Rta binds to RRE. However, although Rta binds to MCAF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), MCAF1 was not retained by the RRE probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>, lane 2). Additionally, by testing a panel of mutations in the DNA-binding domain in Rta, we found that the K213 residue in Rta was critical to its binding to RRE; a lysine to alanine substitution of this residue (K213A) eliminated the binding capacity of Rta to RRE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>, lane 7). This site was outside the MCAF1-binding domain, so this mutant protein could be used to establish that activating an Sp1 promoter was independent of DNA binding. In a transient transfection study, both Rta and Rta(K213A) activated pR-Sp1 and pSp1-luc in 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). However, Rta(K213A) activated an RRE-reporter plasmid at a level &#x0223c;60% lower than that activated by Rta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). Furthermore, cotransfecting pcDNA-MCAF1 did not affect the ability of HA, HA-R and Rta(K213A) to activate the pRRE promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Activation of Sp1-mediated transcription by Rta</title><p>We also tested whether Rta activates cellular promoters that are activated by Sp1, including the promoters of <italic>p16</italic>, <italic>p21</italic> and <italic>SNRPN</italic>, in an epithelial cell line, 293T.

However, as well as regulating the EBV genes, Rta binds to Rb to release E2F1 from Rb to affect the cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). Rta also modulates the phosphorylation of p38 and c-Jun-N-terminal kinases, ultimately affecting gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>), indicating that Rta affects not only the expression of EBV but also the functions of cellular genes. Expression of Rta may be especially important to epithelial cells since Rta is constitutively expressed by EBV in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). Ragoczy <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>) established already that Rta activates the transcription of BRLF1 through two Sp1 sites in Rp. Sp1 is a crucial transcription factor that regulates many cellular genes, including those involved in housekeeping functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>), cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>), methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>) and oncogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). Hence, if Rta influences Sp1-mediated transcription, then the expression of Rta may profoundly affect the expression of cellular genes. Accordingly, the ultimate goals of this work are to explore whether and how Rta affects the transcription of the genes that are activated by Sp1.</p><p>A yeast two-hybrid screen was performed and revealed that an Sp1-binding protein, MCAF1, interacts with Rta. The interaction was then verified <italic>in vitro</italic> with bacterially expressed proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and <italic>in vivo</italic> by immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Additionally, CHIP analysis revealed the formation of an Sp1&#x02013;MCAF1&#x02013;Rta complex on an Sp1 site in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This work also verifies the results of Ragoczy <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>), who noted that binding of Rta to Sp1 on an Sp1 probe could not be detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, perhaps because the protein complex is large. The putative protein&#x02013;DNA complex might not enter the gel or might have dissociated during electrophoresis. We therefore used DAPA to search for binding of the protein complex to a biotin-labeled Sp1 probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Additionally, a CHIP assay was performed to verify the binding of these proteins to the Sp1 site in Rp <italic>in vivo.</italic> This investigation was originally conducted in P3HR1 cells following EBV lytic induction. The results indicated that MCAF1, Rta and Sp1 bind to Rp (data not shown). However, our subsequent investigations showed that MCAF1 and Rta also form a complex on ZRE (L.-K. Chang and S.-T. Liu, unpublished data). Only 7 nt separate the Sp1 site and ZRE in Rp, making it extremely difficult to distinguish the binding of MCAF1 to the Sp1 site or ZRE by CHIP analysis. Therefore, CHIP assay was conducted by immunoprecipitating the proteins at the Sp1 site in Rp in pR-Sp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), in which the ZRE was mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>We mapped the Rta-binding domain on MCAF1 in the region between amino acids 650 and 981 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). An earlier work revealed that the domains in MCAF1 that interact with Sp1 are located in D1 and D2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). We determined that excess Rta does not affect the binding of MCAF1 to Sp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), indicating that although the Sp1- and Rta-binding regions overlap on MCAF1, Rta does not interfere with the binding of Sp1 to MCAF1. A lysine to alanine substitution on the K213 residue eliminated the capacity of Rta to bind to RRE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>) and reduced the capacity of Rta to activate an RRE-reporter plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). The fact that K213 is located outside of the MCAF1-binding domain and the K213A mutation transactivates pR-Sp1 and pSp1-luc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>) verifies that the transactivation of Rp by Rta is independent of RRE binding.</p><p>Rta contains an RRE-binding domain located between amino acids 1 and 320 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), so the Rta&#x02013;MCAF1&#x02013;Sp1 complex might also bind to an RRE. However, our DAPA study indicates that this is not the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). Additionally, transfecting pcDNA-MCAF1 has little effect on the activation of an RRE-reporter plasmid by Rta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), further indicating that MCAF1 does not participate in that activation. The lack of activation may be attributed to the fact that the RRE-binding domain and the MCAF1-binding domain overlap on Rta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>); the binding of Rta to RRE may prevent the binding of Rta to MCAF1.</p><p>We find that Rta activates Rp through Sp1, suggesting that the expression of Rta may also influence the transcription of the cellular genes that are regulated by Sp1. We chose three important regulating genes, <italic>p16</italic>, <italic>p21</italic> and <italic>SNRPN</italic>, that contain Sp1 sites to study the capacity of Rta to activate Sp1-mediated transcription. <italic>p16</italic> is a tumor suppressor gene that contains aberrantly hypermethylated CpG islands in its promoter in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). <italic>p21</italic> is known to regulate cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>); <italic>SNRPN</italic> is an imprinted gene, typically unmethylated and heavily methylated on the active paternal and inactive maternal alleles, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). pCMV-R activates the promoters of these three cellular genes 10- to 15-fold in transfection experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). A reporter plasmid that contains four of the six Sp1 sites in the <italic>p21</italic> promoter, pSp1-luc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), is also strongly activated by Rta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). The BNLF1 promoters contain several Sp1 sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>); the transcription activation of this gene by Rta probably involves the binding of the Sp1&#x02013;MCAF1&#x02013;Rta complex to these sites. Furthermore, Rta activates the transcription of <italic>c-myc</italic> proto-oncogene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). The promoter of this gene lacks an RRE but contains several Sp1 sites near the TATA sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). These findings indicate the crucial role of Rta in regulating Sp1-mediated transcription. Moreover, EBV lytic promoters are typically hypermethylated during viral latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). Additionally, MCAF1 binds to MBD1 on CpG sequences to repress gene transcription, so this laboratory is currently studying how the interaction between Rta and MCAF1 affects CpG methylation during EBV latent-lytic switching.</p><p>One of the important questions addressed herein concerns the effect of the interactions among Sp1, MCAF1 and Rta on the activation of the EBV lytic cycle. As is generally known, BRLF1 is not transcribed during EBV latency in B cells but is transcribed in epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). Therefore, if MCAF1 participates in BRLF1 autoregulation, then transfecting pcDNA-MCAF1 to epithelial cells that are infected by EBV may promote expression of Rta from the virus. This, indeed, is the case; the expression of Rta from maxi-EBV in 293 cells was enhanced after the cells were transfected with pcDNA-MCAF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, lanes 5 and 6). Additionally, the transfection also led to the expression of Zta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>), perhaps through the activation of BZLF1 transcription by Rta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). These observations indicate that MCAF1 participates in EBV lytic activation in 293 cells. However, MCAF1 did not activate Rta expression in P3HR1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). The expression of Rta was only evident when a little pCMV-R was cotransfected with pcDNA-MCAF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, lanes 6 and 7), suggesting that the expression of Rta is a prerequisite for EBV lytic activation by MCAF1. Moreover, an earlier work demonstrated that MCAF1 is abundant in the cell, which may explain why transfecting &#x0003e;10 &#x000b5;g of pcDNA-MCAF1 is required to detect the enhancement of the expression of EBV immediate-early genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>This work demonstrates that Rta can activate gene transcription by two mechanisms, by which Rta activates not only EBV but also cellular genes, which may ultimately affect cell cycle progression and oncogenesis. EBV in epithelial cells is generally known to express Rta constitutively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). Therefore, activation of cellular genes and especially an EBV oncogene, BNLF1, may be crucial to the oncogenesis of the cells. However, Rta expression causes the expression of Zta and activates the EBV lytic cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). Therefore, the cells die by the lytic production of EBV virions. Accordingly, the activation of host genes may only be possible if the lytic productive cycle is abortive. However, our work seems to indicate that although Rta is constitutively expressed from maxi-EBV in 293 cells, the extent of Rta expression may not sufficiently activate the EBV lytic cycle. Not only was Rta expressed at a low level, but also the expression of Zta by the cells was undetected by immunoblot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, lane 2). This low level of Rta expression did not cause the expression of EA-D (data not shown). Additionally, maxi-EBV in 293 cells released only few virions except when the cells were treated with TPA and sodium butyrate, or transfected with a plasmid that expressed Zta (Y.-F. Chiu and S.-T. Liu, unpublished data). These results suggest that a low level of Rta expression in 293 cells may not activate the EBV lytic cycle. This continuously low level of Rta expression may influence the physiology of cells and importantly determine the pathogenicity of the virus.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors want to thank Bill Sugden for his critics and suggestions.
