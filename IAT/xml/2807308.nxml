The Cys or Ser at the N terminus of most inteins initiates a four-step protein splicing reaction by forming a (thio)ester bond at the N-terminal splice junction. Several recently identified inteins cannot perform this acyl rearrangement because they do not begin with Cys, Thr, or Ser. This study analyzes one of these, the mycobacteriophage Bethlehem DnaB intein, which we describe here as the prototype for a new class of inteins based on sequence comparisons, reactivity, and mechanism. These Class 3 inteins are characterized by a non-nucleophilic N-terminal residue that co-varies with a non-contiguous Trp, Cys, Thr triplet (WCT) and a Thr or Ser as the first C-extein residue. Several mechanistic differences were observed when compared with standard inteins or previously studied atypical KlbA Ala<sup>1</sup> inteins: (<italic>a</italic>) cleavage at the N-terminal splice junction in the absence of all standard N- and C-terminal splice junction nucleophiles, (<italic>b</italic>) activation of the N-terminal splice junction by a variant Block B motif that includes the WCT triplet Trp, (<italic>c</italic>) decay of the branched intermediate by thiols or Cys despite an ester linkage at the C-extein branch point, and (<italic>d</italic>) an absolute requirement for the WCT triplet Block F Cys. Based on biochemical data and confirmed by molecular modeling, we propose roles for these newly identified conserved residues, a novel protein splicing mechanism that includes a second branched intermediate, and an intein classification with three mechanistic categories.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Enzymes/Mechanisms</kwd><kwd>Protein/Post-translational Modification</kwd><kwd>Protein Chemistry</kwd><kwd>Protein Motifs</kwd><kwd>Protein Processing</kwd><kwd>Branched Intermediate</kwd><kwd>Intein</kwd><kwd>Proline</kwd><kwd>Protein Splicing</kwd><kwd>Thioester</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Inteins are the protein equivalent of introns. These intervening sequences must be post-translationally removed from the surrounding host protein fragments (exteins) before the host protein becomes functional. The intein together with the first C-extein amino acid act as a single turnover enzyme that removes the intein from the precursor protein and seamlessly joins the exteins. No external cofactors or energy sources are required for this self-catalytic protein splicing reaction. The standard intein-mediated protein splicing pathway consists of four coordinated nucleophilic displacements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) and has been extensively reviewed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The first step is an acyl rearrangement in which the first residue of the intein (Cys<sup>1</sup> or Ser<sup>1</sup>) reacts with the carbonyl carbon of the preceding extein residue, resulting in a (thio)ester bond at the N-terminal splice junction (<bold>II</bold>). The first C-extein residue (Cys<sup>+1</sup>, Ser<sup>+1</sup>, or Thr<sup>+1</sup>) then attacks this (thio)ester bond, cleaving the N-terminal splice junction and transferring the N-extein to its side chain to form the Block G branched (thio)ester intermediate (<bold>III</bold>). The Block G branched intermediate (BI)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN5"><sup>3</sup></xref> is resolved by cyclization of the intein C-terminal Asn, which results in cleavage of the C-terminal splice junction and release of the intein (<bold>IV</bold>) from the (thio)ester linked exteins (<bold>V</bold>). A native peptide bond is formed between the exteins by a spontaneous acyl shift (<bold>VI</bold>). The succinimide at the end of the intein (<bold>IV</bold>) eventually hydrolyzes to form Asn (<bold>VII</bold>) or isoasparagine.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Three intein classes splice by different mechanisms.</bold> Most inteins follow the standard protein splicing pathway (<italic>Class 1</italic>). However, some inteins splice using modifications of this mechanism. The Class 1 standard protein splicing pathway consists of four nucleophilic displacement reactions: <italic>Step 1</italic>, an <italic>N</italic>-(S/O) acyl shift at the N-terminal splice junction; <italic>Step 2</italic>, transesterification to form the Block G branched intermediate; <italic>Step 3</italic>, Asn cyclization to cleave the C-terminal splice junction; <italic>Step 4</italic>, a spontaneous (S/O)-<italic>N</italic> acyl shift to form a native peptide bond between the exteins; and <italic>Step 5</italic>, the slow hydrolysis of the succinimide ring. Although Thr could perform the initial acyl shift, it has not been observed in standard inteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Class 2 and Class 3 inteins lack an N-terminal Ser or Cys, so they cannot perform the acyl shift that initiates the splicing reaction in Class 1 inteins. In Class 2 inteins, Cys<sup>+1</sup> directly attacks an amide bond at the N-terminal splice junction to form the standard Block G branched intermediate (<bold>III</bold>). Known examples of Class 2 inteins are the KlbA inteins. The Class 3 protein splicing pathway also consists of four nucleophilic displacement reactions, including two branched intermediates. In Step 1, the Cys in Block F (Cys<sup>320</sup> in the MP-Be DnaB intein) attacks the peptide bond at the N-terminal splice junction, forming the Block F branched intermediate (<bold>VIII</bold>), which is thiol labile. In Step 2, the N-extein is transferred from the side chain of the Block F Cys to the side chain of the +1 residue (Thr<sup>+1</sup> in the MP-Be DnaB intein) by a transesterification reaction resulting in the formation of the same Block G branched intermediate (<bold>III</bold>) as in Class 1; this is an ester linkage in the MP-Be DnaB intein and is proposed to be resistant to cleavage by thiols at room temperature. Once the Block G branched intermediate (<bold>III</bold>) is formed, the remainder of the splicing pathway is the same in all inteins. Class 3 inteins contain the WCT triplet, whereas Class 2 inteins do not. Residues within the intein assist these reactions. Tetrahedral intermediates are not shown. <italic>X</italic> represents the sulfur or oxygen atom in the side chain of Ser, Thr, or Cys.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc0071003470001"/></fig><p>The catalytic pathway in all inteins is highly coordinated, but the precise mechanism that controls this series of reactions remains unclear. The mechanism may also vary among different inteins. For example, some inteins display coupling of N-terminal and C-terminal reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), whereas others do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Intein mutations and/or the presence of artificial, non-native exteins often disrupt the coordination of these steps, yielding off-pathway single or double splice junction cleavage products that are incapable of forming the mature host protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Off-pathway C-terminal splice junction cleavage is caused by Asn cyclization in precursors (<bold>I</bold> or <bold>II</bold>) prior to BI (<bold>III</bold>) formation, whereas off-pathway N-terminal splice junction cleavage is caused by cleavage of the (thio)ester bond in the linear (<bold>II</bold>) or branched (<bold>III</bold>) (thio)ester intermediates. Off-pathway splice junction cleavage can result from either an increase in the rate of cleavage at that splice junction or a decrease in the reaction rate of another step. However, to our knowledge, neither splicing nor off-pathway cleavage of an amide bond at the N-terminal splice junction has been observed in standard inteins after non-conservative substitution of Ser<sup>1</sup> or Cys<sup>1</sup>.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2.</label><caption><p><bold>A schematic representation of splicing and off-pathway reactions.</bold> The MP-Be DnaB intein (I) was cloned into a model precursor consisting of MBP as the N-extein (M) and a fragment of paramyosin (P) as the C-extein, along with 5 native extein residues flanking each splice site. Protein splicing (S) yields MP and free intein, whereas off-pathway N-terminal splice junction cleavage (N) yields M + IP and off-pathway C-terminal splice junction cleavage (C) yields C-terminal cleavage products (MI + P). Cleavage of the (thio)ester linkage in branched intermediates also yields M + IP. Some mutations result in double cleavage at both splice junctions to yield M + I + P.

Intein splicing domains contain four sequence motifs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>) that are not well conserved in their entirety but contain certain well conserved residues that form part of the protein splicing catalytic center and the hydrophobic core of the splicing domain. There are two concurrently used nomenclatures for these motifs: A or N1, B or N3, F or C2, and G or C1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Block A begins at position 1 of the intein and contains the intein N-terminal nucleophile (Ser<sup>1</sup> or Cys<sup>1</sup>). Thr<sup>1</sup> has not been observed in inteins identified to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) but can perform the same acyl rearrangement as Ser or Cys and has been shown to allow splicing in the S1T mutant of the <italic>Thermococcus litoralis</italic> DNA pol-2 intein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Block B (N3) is usually 60&#x02013;100 amino acids from the intein N terminus and contains a conserved Thr at position 7 and a His at position 10, both of which assist reactions at the N-terminal splice junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Residues in Block F (C2), especially an Asp or a Trp in position 4, have been shown to be essential for N-terminal cleavage, leading many authors to conclude that Block F may be important in orienting the C-extein nucleophile for attack on the N-terminal scissile bond and/or may participate in catalysis at the N-terminal splice site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). In the <italic>Methanococcus jannaschii</italic> (Mja) KlbA intein, Asp<sup>147</sup> likely assists catalysis by helping to activate the Cys<sup>+1</sup> nucleophile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Block G (C1) includes the last 7 amino acids of the intein and the first residue of the C-extein (termed the +1 amino acid). The intein penultimate His usually assists Asn cyclization, although some inteins use other residues for this purpose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Block F is generally &#x0003c;10 amino acids from Block G.</p><p>Inteins exhibit numerous polymorphisms in nucleophiles and assisting residues, with conserved positions populated by amino acids with similar functionalities (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>) and positions of assisting residues varying among inteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). For example, the conserved C-terminal Asn is replaced by Asp or Gln in some inteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). These residues are capable of similar cyclization reactions as Asn, although other mechanisms have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). The low sequence similarity between inteins makes the identification of assisting residues difficult and has limited generalization from one intein to another.</p><p>The first reported variation in the standard protein splicing pathway was necessitated by the absence of an N-terminal nucleophile in the Ala<sup>1</sup> inteins of archaeal KlbA proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). These inteins have overcome the barrier to direct attack on an amide bond at the N-terminal splice junction that is present in standard inteins, likely due to a slight increase in the size of the splicing active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). In the Mja KlbA intein, the C-extein nucleophile (Cys<sup>+1</sup>) directly attacks the amide bond at the N-terminal splice junction, yielding the standard Block G BI (<bold>III</bold>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The remainder of the splicing pathway is indistinguishable from standard Class 1 inteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>This study examines the splicing of another intein that lacks an N-terminal nucleophile. The mycobacteriophage Bethlehem (MP-Be) DnaB intein begins with Pro<sup>1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) and represents a new class of inteins that lack an N-terminal nucleophile, have a unique set of conserved residues, and can form a previously undetected additional BI at the Block F Cys.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Bioinformatic Sequence Analysis</title><p>The multiple sequence alignment of intein motifs is from the June 25, 2009 update of the InBase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) splicing motifs page. The alignment included the 51 positions (columns) comprising the four conserved splicing motifs from 450 sequences in the data base after the removal of bacterial intein-like domains and joining of the N- and C-parts of each split intein. Forty-two inteins lacked an N-terminal Ser or Cys (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.069567/DC1">supplemental Table 1</ext-link>).

This left 40 inteins lacking an N-terminal Ser or Cys, including the five KlbA intein orthologs. Co-variation analysis was performed on every pair of multiple sequence alignment columns using the Chi-square method. The co-variance is quantified by the standard Chi-square calculation method between the expected independent co-occurrence of the residues in two columns from a multiple sequence alignment relative to the observed occurrence of the residue pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).

Initial tests showed that the linker regions between the MP-Be endonuclease and HINT domains could not be modeled effectively by this method, and therefore we did not attempt to include the MP-Be endonuclease domain in the model. The model was evaluated using the programs ANOLEA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), Verify3D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), and GROMOS, as implemented in the SWISS-MODEL workspace, and in addition using the program WhatCheck. The protein geometry parameters calculated by WhatCheck were satisfactory, but the model exhibited a few regions with positive ANOLEA or GROMOS energies, indicating some defects in the local packing or electrostatic environment of some side chains, which are difficult to avoid when using a template with very low sequence identity. The model exhibited a Verify3D cumulative score of 38.19 and average scores ranging from &#x02212;0.02 to 0.57, which indicate a satisfactory overall structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>The MP-Be DnaB Pro<sup>1</sup> Intein Splices in Vivo</title><p>The MP-Be DnaB helicase intein (341 amino acids) begins with Pro<sup>1</sup>.

Splicing was observed after substitution of Thr<sup>+1</sup> with functionally similar residues (Ser or Cys), but non-conservative substitution with Ala completely blocked splicing and yielded almost complete cleavage at both splice junctions (double cleavage yielding M, I, and P). Double cleavage was unexpected because no nucleophile known to attack the N-terminal scissile bond was still present in the T+1A precursor, and the absence of Ser<sup>1</sup>/Thr<sup>1</sup>/Cys<sup>1</sup> precluded the formation of a labile (thio)ester bond at this position. To our knowledge, hydrolysis of an amide bond at an N-terminal splice junction has not been observed in standard or KlbA inteins. However, Pro<sup>1</sup> might impart or require increased lability of the N-terminal splice junction, so the effects of mutating Pro<sup>1</sup> were explored. Splicing was reduced and C-terminal cleavage was observed in Ser, Cys, and Ala substitutions of Pro<sup>1</sup>, which is similar to what occurred with KlbA Ala<sup>1</sup> inteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Double cleavage predominated in the P1C mutant. Combining T+1A with P1A still resulted in cleavage at both splice junctions, proving that Pro<sup>1</sup> is not required for the off-pathway N-terminal cleavage observed in T+1A mutants. Combining T+1A with N341A yielded &#x0003e;90% N-terminal cleavage, indicating that the unknown mechanism of N-terminal cleavage in the T+1A mutant does not require Asn<sup>341</sup> or C-terminal cleavage. Remarkably, the P1A,N341A,T+1A triple mutant was still capable of generating a small amount of N-terminal cleavage products. These results demonstrate that either the MP-Be DnaB intein N-terminal splice junction is highly activated and thus easily hydrolyzes or a previously unrecognized nucleophile is capable of attacking it.</p><p>The intein C-terminal Asn is required for resolution of the Block G BI (<bold>III</bold>) by cleaving the C-terminal splice junction during succinimide ring formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).

The requirement of a native structure for decay of MIP* by thiols suggests the possibility of a thioester-containing intermediate in equilibrium with the standard Block G BI.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of Unique Sequence Features</title><p>Standard inteins are unable to splice or undergo N-terminal cleavage when non-conservative substitutions of Ser<sup>1</sup> or Cys<sup>1</sup> are made. Inteins naturally lacking this N-terminal nucleophile have overcome the barrier to direct attack on an N-terminal splice junction amide bond. In an attempt to identify possible residues specific to these atypical inteins that might be involved in catalysis, we analyzed a multiple sequence alignment of the intein protein splicing motifs to identify co-varying positions, <italic>i.e.</italic> residues that experience simultaneous substitutions in different intein sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). The coupling of amino acid sequence changes may indicate linked functions for these residues or structural interactions. Position 12 in Block B (N3:12), position 4 in Block F (C2:4), and position 5 in Block G (C1:5) showed strong co-variance (Chi-square analysis upper probabilities for chance occurrence of 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;31</sup> to 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;46</sup>). These extremely low values are a consequence of the almost invariance of a specific triplet at these positions in a subset of sequences relative to the absence of conservation in these positions in the majority of the other sequences analyzed. Examining the source of this co-variation identified the sequence Trp, Cys, and Thr in these positions in 37 inteins, which we refer to as the WCT triplet. This triplet appeared much more often than would be expected by the individual occurrences of each residue in these positions. Of the 37 inteins containing the WCT triplet, 34 lack an N-terminal nucleophile (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.069567/DC1">supplemental Table 1</ext-link>) and three have an N-terminal Ser or Cys (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.069567/DC1">supplemental Table 2</ext-link>). The only inteins lacking an N-terminal nucleophile that are not in the WCT triplet group are the five known archaeal KlbA intein orthologs that begin with Ala<sup>1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) and the DNA helicase intein from <italic>Arthrobacter</italic> species FB24 (Arsp-FB24) that begins with Gly<sup>1</sup> and has a WDT triplet. The <italic>Burkholderia vietnamiensis</italic> G4 (Bvi) IcmO intein is the only intein possessing the WCT triplet that lacks the N-terminal nucleophile and has Cys<sup>+1</sup> instead of Thr<sup>+1</sup> or Ser<sup>+1</sup>. These findings specifically link non-KlbA inteins lacking N-terminal nucleophiles with a previously unrecognized pattern of intein sequence motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). It is interesting to note that all inteins lacking an N-terminal nucleophile except the KlbA inteins are present in proteins with putative helicase activity (<italic>e.g.</italic> DnaB, RecG, SNF2, and terminase large subunits of bacteriophage), and most are inserted in an ATPase P-loop motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Mutations in the WCT Triplet and Surrounding Block B, F, and G Residues</title><p>Ala scanning was performed on the WCT triplet and proximal residues to examine their role in the splicing pathway (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.069567/DC1">supplemental Figs. 4&#x02013;6</ext-link>).

and His at position 10, with position 7 being less conserved and sometimes substituted with other residues capable of hydrogen-bonding interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Previous studies indicated that this His is essential for splicing and N-terminal cleavage, whereas mutation of this Thr has a more limited effect on these reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Several Block B residues were examined in the MP-Be DnaB intein (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.069567/DC1">supplemental Figs. 4 and 6</ext-link>). His<sup>65</sup> at position 10 is essential for splicing of the MP-Be DnaB intein, whereas mutation of Ser<sup>62</sup> at position 7 does not appreciably inhibit splicing. Ala substitution of Thr<sup>60</sup>, Ser<sup>64</sup>, Thr<sup>68</sup>, and His<sup>75</sup> had a minimal effect on splicing. T69A (position 14) displayed temperature-dependent splicing (TDS), with complete splicing at 15 &#x000b0;C but only 50% spliced product at 30 &#x000b0;C. The Trp in the WCT triplet (Trp<sup>67</sup> in the MP-Be DnaB intein) at position 12 in Block B is 2 residues after the conserved His<sup>65</sup>. Mutation of Trp<sup>67</sup> to Ala, Leu, His, Tyr, Gln, or Lys yielded &#x0003e;90% inactive MIP precursor at 30 &#x000b0;C, whereas Phe yielded equal amounts of precursor and spliced products. Splicing was rescued at 15 &#x000b0;C in the Trp<sup>67</sup> to Ala, Leu, His, Tyr, Phe, Asn, or Gln mutations, but not in the Lys mutant. These results indicate that of all the Block B residues examined, only His<sup>65</sup> and Trp<sup>67</sup> are essential at 30 &#x000b0;C. The inactivation pattern of the Trp<sup>67</sup> mutants is consistent with a structural role for this residue.</p><p>Block F contains Cys<sup>320</sup> at position 4, which is part of the conserved WCT triplet. Ala scanning was performed on several Block F residues: Lys<sup>319</sup>, Cys<sup>320</sup>, Ile<sup>321</sup>, Asp<sup>324</sup>, His<sup>328</sup>, and Phe<sup>330</sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.069567/DC1">supplemental Figs. 5 and 6</ext-link>). At 30 &#x000b0;C, Ala substitution of Cys<sup>320</sup>, Ile<sup>321</sup>, and Phe<sup>330</sup> abrogated splicing, whereas Ala substitution of Lys<sup>319</sup> and Asp<sup>324</sup> significantly reduced splicing, and Ala substitution of His<sup>328</sup> had no effect. Splicing could be rescued by expression at 15 &#x000b0;C for Ala substitutions of Lys<sup>319</sup>, Ile<sup>321</sup>, and Asp<sup>324</sup>, whereas N-terminal cleavage was the predominant reaction for F330A. Substitution of Phe<sup>330</sup> with Leu yielded similar results to the Ala substitution, but substitution by Tyr yielded &#x0003e;95% spliced product at both temperatures, suggesting that an aromatic residue is important in this position, as opposed to any hydrophobic residue. A similar conclusion was reached for the Mja KlbA intein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Moreover, Phe and Tyr frequently occur at this position in all inteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), suggesting that the requirement for an aromatic residue at position 15 of Block F is probably general to all intein classes. The most critical residue in Block F was Cys<sup>320</sup> because neither splicing nor cleavage could be rescued at 15 &#x000b0;C. Similar results were obtained with the C320S mutant. However, substitution by Asp, which is a very common residue found at this position in standard inteins, resulted in nearly equal amounts of precursor and C-terminal cleavage products at 15 &#x000b0;C.</p><p>Block G contains Thr<sup>339</sup> (part of the WCT triplet) in position 5, the intein penultimate His<sup>340</sup> in position 6, the intein C-terminal Asn<sup>341</sup> in position 7, and the C-extein Thr<sup>+1</sup> in position 8. The results of mutations of the latter two residues were presented above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Substitution of the WCT triplet Thr<sup>339</sup> caused TDS, with Ala having the greatest effect at 30 &#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.069567/DC1">supplemental Fig. 6<italic>C</italic></ext-link>). The minimal effect of mutating the penultimate His was unexpected because this His has been shown to assist C-terminal cleavage in other inteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Examination of Temperature-dependent Splicing Mutants</title><p>Mutations that yield temperature-dependent enzyme activity normally affect folding, which in turn affects catalysis. Many of the Trp<sup>67</sup> and Block F substitutions yielded precursors that failed to splice at 30 &#x000b0;C but spliced at 15 &#x000b0;C. A temperature shift assay was performed to determine the degree of misfolding or aggregation when precursors were expressed at the non-permissive temperature.

All intein splicing domains have a common fold termed the HINT (Hedgehog/intein) domain, which they share with Hedgehog autoprocessing domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). The HINT domain excludes the endonuclease domain and other domains inserted within the intein splicing domain. We performed comparative modeling of the MP-Be DnaB intein HINT domain based on the structure of a precursor of the Sce VMA intein ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) Protein Data Bank (PDB) code <ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="1JVA">1JVA</ext-link>), which was hypothesized to most closely resemble an intein reactive conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) despite the presence of mutations in 4 active site residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Sequence identity between the MP-Be DnaB HINT domain and the HINT domains of other structurally characterized inteins ranges from 10 to 17%, which presents a significant challenge for homology modeling. A sequence alignment between the HINT domains of the MP-Be DnaB and Sce VMA intein was constructed using the program FFAS (Fold &#x00026; Function Assignment System), which is a sequence profile alignment method that takes into account weak sequence similarity over the entire protein that is difficult to detect by other methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). The alignment contains 2 N-extein residues and 4 C-extein residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). It has a sequence identity of 17% and is reasonable based on the conserved positions of the catalytic residues. The resulting model has a root mean square deviation with respect to the template Sce VMA intein of 1.7 &#x000c5; for the backbone N, C<sup>&#x003b1;</sup>, and C&#x02032; atoms of the 117 aligned residues. A PDB file of the modeled structure is included as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.069567/DC1">supplemental File 1</ext-link> along with Ramachandran data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.069567/DC1">supplemental Fig. 7<italic>A</italic></ext-link>).

The model shows that Ser<sup>62</sup> (Block B, position 7) and His<sup>65</sup> (Block B, position 10) are located near the N-terminal scissile bond between Gln<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and Pro<sup>1</sup>. No unusual activating interactions of the N-terminal scissile bond are observed that could explain the lability of the N-terminal splice junction in the absence of Thr<sup>+1</sup>. The model reveals that the WCT triplet Cys<sup>320</sup> residue (Block F, position 4) is located close to both the N-terminal and C-terminal splice junctions. The Cys<sup>320</sup> side chain sulfur atom is located 4.9 &#x000c5; from the Gln<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> carbonyl carbon and 2.6 &#x000c5; from the Thr<sup>+1</sup> side chain oxygen. This is slightly closer to the N-terminal scissile bond than the Thr<sup>+1</sup> side chain oxygen atom, which is 5.2 &#x000c5; from the Gln<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> carbonyl carbon. Thus, the model indicates that Cys<sup>320</sup> is in position to (<italic>a</italic>) cleave the N-terminal splice junction equally well as Thr<sup>+1</sup>, (<italic>b</italic>) cleave the N-terminal splice junction in the absence of Thr<sup>+1</sup>, (<italic>c</italic>) transfer the N-extein from the side chain of Cys<sup>320</sup> to the side chain of Thr<sup>+1</sup>, and (<italic>d</italic>) activate Thr<sup>+1</sup> for attack on the N-terminal scissile bond.

Despite the limitations of this model, the positioning of Trp<sup>67</sup> near His<sup>65</sup> is likely to be correct as several other intein structures contain a hydrophobic residue (Val, Leu, or Phe) at this position, which is located on the same side of the &#x003b2;-strand as the Block B His and packs against hydrophobic residues from neighboring strands. This packing suggests a possible structural role for the Trp in maintaining the proper arrangement of the intein fold for reactivity. Trp<sup>67</sup> may play an additional catalytic role. The positioning of Trp<sup>67</sup> and His<sup>65</sup> suggests a potential cation-&#x003c0; interaction to stabilize a positive charge on His<sup>65</sup> that might be produced during splicing.</p><p>Mutations of Phe<sup>330</sup> and the WCT triplet residue, Thr<sup>339</sup>, both display TDS. In this model, their main chain atoms hydrogen bond as part of a &#x003b2;-hairpin that contains the +1 nucleophile (Thr<sup>+1</sup>), the terminal Asn (Asn<sup>341</sup>), and the C-terminal scissile bond. Their side chains are within 5 &#x000c5; of each other and are directed toward the preceding &#x003b2;-strand that includes Cys<sup>320</sup>, suggesting a structural role. We therefore conclude that they are important to the packing and positioning of the C-terminal &#x003b2;-hairpin and thus help to align the +1 nucleophile for attack on the N-terminal splice junction.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We initially wondered whether Pro<sup>1</sup> inteins would splice at all because Pro<sup>1</sup> imposes chemical and structural limitations on the N-terminal splice junction. However, some previous studies of standard inteins showed a strained, twisted, or <italic>cis</italic> conformation of the N-terminal splice junction scissile bond that was hypothesized to provide an energetic driving force for the splicing reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). The additional steric repulsion in the <italic>trans</italic> isomer of X-Pro peptide bonds leads to a reduced energy barrier for <italic>cis-trans</italic> isomerization, which could facilitate splicing if ground state destabilization of the scissile bond is a major contributor to the energetics of splicing. Additionally, the pyrrolidine side chain of Pro renders the backbone nitrogen atom a tertiary amide, which will affect hydrogen bonding and leaving group properties during the splicing reactions. Because some of these factors are expected to impede splicing, whereas others would assist splicing, it is difficult to predict whether Pro<sup>1</sup> inteins would be more or less efficient than other inteins. Here we report experimental data showing that the MP-Be DnaB intein splices very efficiently.</p><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Absence of an Intein N-terminal Cys<sup>1</sup> or Ser<sup>1</sup></title><p>Standard inteins cannot attack an amide bond at the N-terminal splice junction when Ser<sup>1</sup> or Cys<sup>1</sup> are mutated, suggesting that inteins naturally lacking these N-terminal nucleophiles have unique strategies for initiating splicing. Johnson <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) proposed a steric explanation for the ability of KlbA inteins (Ala<sup>1</sup>) to splice by a three-step mechanism that is initiated by a direct attack on the N-terminal scissile bond by the +1 nucleophile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>Class 2</italic>), with no obvious differences in chemical activating interactions at the scissile bond when compared with standard inteins. In this study, we examined 40 full-length inteins (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.069567/DC1">supplemental Table 1</ext-link>) present in InBase as of June 25, 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) that lacked an N-terminal Ser<sup>1</sup>, Thr<sup>1</sup>, or Cys<sup>1</sup> to identify residues that might also contribute alternative strategies for initiating splicing. We found that 34 of them include 3 invariant interspersed residues (the WCT triplet, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), 1 had a WDT triplet, and 5 KlbA orthologs lacked the WCT triplet. The WCT triplet co-varied with the absence of the standard N-terminal nucleophile with very high statistical significance. All of these inteins except the <italic>B. vietnamiensis</italic> G4 IcmO intein also have Ser or Thr at the +1 position (the first amino acid in C-extein), instead of the more common Cys<sup>+1</sup>. Nevertheless, this association is less statistically relevant because Ser<sup>+1</sup> and Thr<sup>+1</sup> are found in many standard inteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Temperature-dependent Splicing after Mutation</title><p>Mutation of the MP-Be DnaB intein WCT triplet residues Trp<sup>67</sup> and Cys<sup>320</sup> drastically reduced splicing at 30 &#x000b0;C, whereas mutation of Thr<sup>339</sup> had a lesser effect. Only Cys<sup>320</sup> was also essential for splicing at 15 &#x000b0;C. Similar TDS activity (inhibited at 30 &#x000b0;C, active at 15 &#x000b0;C) was seen with other mutations. TDS is not likely due to the fact that mycobacteriophage Bethlehem grows in soil at temperatures below 30 &#x000b0;C because it is normally propagated at 37 &#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) and the wild type intein is active at 30 &#x000b0;C. Temperature-dependent enzyme activity generally reflects structural issues that can range from minor or local folding perturbations to severely misfolded or aggregated proteins. Activity comparable with that observed when initially synthesized at 15 &#x000b0;C was rescued during <italic>in vivo</italic> temperature shifts but not <italic>in vitro</italic> with Trp<sup>67</sup> and Thr<sup>339</sup> mutants or the seven other positions tested. This indicates that these mutations significantly altered the protein conformation such that the refolding machinery of the cell was necessary to recover function at 15 &#x000b0;C. In support of this conclusion, the modeled structure indicates that Trp<sup>67</sup> participates in hydrophobic packing with surrounding residues. The increased structural rigidity at lower temperatures could possibly overcome the effect of the loss of Trp<sup>67</sup> on hydrophobic packing. Trp<sup>67</sup> substitutions that were more hydrophobic had the least negative impact. Mutation of residues known to be catalytically important in other inteins (Block B His, C-terminal Asn, and Thr<sup>+1</sup>) did not show a TDS phenotype in the MP-Be DnaB intein, suggesting a catalytic role for Cys<sup>320</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Activation of the N-terminal Splice Junction</title><p>The MP-Be DnaB intein utilized different residues to assist N-terminal cleavage when compared with standard or KlbA inteins. Standard and KlbA inteins use the Block B His in position 10 and the Block B, position 7 residue (most often Thr, Ser, or Asn) to activate the N-terminal splice junction, although the residue at position 7 is not essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Ala scanning of 8 Block B residues demonstrated that only His<sup>65</sup> (position 10) and Trp<sup>67</sup> (position 12) were important for splicing in the MP-Be DnaB intein. Although amino acid substitutions, TDS, and the modeled structure suggest that Trp<sup>67</sup> has a structural role, this Block B Trp may have an additional catalytic role in protein splicing. The modeled structure suggests that Trp<sup>67</sup> can participate in cation-&#x003c0; interactions with the Block B His<sup>65</sup>, which could stabilize the positive charge generated when His<sup>65</sup> is protonated during the splicing reaction. Thus, the WCT triplet residue Trp<sup>67</sup> seems to have both structural and catalytic roles.</p></sec><sec><title>The Importance of Block F Residues in the Splicing Reaction</title><p>This study supports recent reports positing the importance of Block F while also showing that some previous findings appear to be intein-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Block F encodes parts of two &#x003b2;-strands separated by a loop of variable length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). The Block F N-terminal &#x003b2;-strand is at the C terminus of one of the two large &#x003b2;-strands in the HINT domain that form its main horseshoe structure. The Block F C-terminal &#x003b2;-strand forms a twisted &#x003b2;-hairpin with the last intein &#x003b2;-strand that contains the C-terminal nucleophiles and C-terminal splice junction. The Block F loop could act as a hinge for aligning C-terminal residues in the active site, which may be why mutations in this motif often caused TDS in the MP-Be DnaB intein. A previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) proposed that the Block F His at position 13 played a role in activating the penultimate His in the <italic>Synechocystis</italic> DnaB intein, but our study and a previous study of the Mja KlbA intein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) show no major role for this residue or for Asp<sup>324</sup> (position 9). However, the aromatic residue near the end of Block F (position 15) is important for splicing of the MP-Be DnaB intein (Phe<sup>330</sup>), the <italic>Synechocystis</italic> DnaB intein (Phe<sup>145</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), and the Mja KlbA intein (Tyr<sup>156</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Structural modeling shows Phe<sup>330</sup> in the intein C-terminal &#x003b2;-hairpin with its side chain directed toward the preceding &#x003b2;-strand containing Cys<sup>320</sup>, suggesting that Phe<sup>330</sup> is important for the packing and positioning of the C-terminal &#x003b2;-hairpin. A similar conclusion was also reached for Tyr<sup>156</sup> in the Mja KlbA intein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The frequent occurrence of Phe and Tyr at this position supports an important structural role for Block F, position 15 in all classes of inteins. The positioning of the intein C-terminal &#x003b2;-hairpin is essential for the alignment of the C-extein nucleophile (Thr<sup>+1</sup>) during attack on the N-terminal splice junction and for the alignment of assisting groups. It is interesting to note that the backbone atoms of Phe<sup>330</sup> and Thr<sup>339</sup> (part of the WCT triplet) hydrogen-bond to each other in the &#x003b2;-hairpin.</p><p>In standard inteins, position 4 of Block F is usually Asp but is Trp in the PRP8 inteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) and Cys in WCT triplet inteins. This position is important for reactions at both the N-terminal and the C-terminal splice junctions in the atypical Mja KlbA intein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) and in standard inteins, such as the <italic>Cryptococcus neoforman</italic>s PRP8 intein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) and the <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtu) RecA intein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). In the Mja KlbA intein, Asp<sup>147</sup> (Block F, position 4) is in position to interact with both splice junctions and likely assists catalysis by helping to activate the Cys<sup>+1</sup> nucleophile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Similar results were seen in the Mtu RecA intein structure, where this Asp was shown to be required for both N-terminal and C-terminal cleavage, leading the authors to hypothesize that it is both catalytically important and involved in coordinating the steps in the splicing pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). In the MP-Be DnaB intein, Cys<sup>320</sup> is also essential for splicing and cleavage at both splice junctions. In the <italic>C. neoformans</italic> PRP8 intein, the authors proposed that Block F and especially the position 4 Trp form a switch that coordinates the steps in the protein splicing pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Unique Reactivities of the MP-Be DnaB Intein</title><p>A unique feature of the MP-Be DnaB intein is the lability of the N-terminal splice junction in T+1A mutants. The analogous mutation in the Ala<sup>1</sup> Mja KlbA intein (C+1A) yielded predominantly precursor <italic>in vivo</italic> and C-terminal cleavage after overnight incubation <italic>in vitro</italic> but no N-terminal cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). In standard inteins, off-pathway N-terminal cleavage occurs by hydrolysis or thiolysis of the (thio)ester bond in the linear (<bold>II)</bold> or branched (<bold>III</bold>) (thio)ester intermediates. The linear (thio)ester intermediate (<bold>II)</bold> cannot form in Pro<sup>1</sup> inteins, and the Block G BI (<bold>III</bold>) cannot form in the T+1A mutant. To our knowledge, there are no examples of off-pathway cleavage of an amide bond at an intein N-terminal splice junction. Mutational analysis indicates that neither Pro<sup>1</sup>, Asn<sup>341</sup>, Thr<sup>+1</sup>, the Block G BI (<bold>III</bold>), nor C-terminal cleavage are required for off-pathway N-terminal cleavage in the MP-Be DnaB intein. At 15 &#x000b0;C, the only mutations that blocked splicing (on-pathway N-terminal cleavage) and/or off-pathway N-terminal cleavage were mutations of Cys<sup>320</sup>, His<sup>65</sup>, and Trp<sup>67</sup>. Could Cys<sup>320</sup> be responsible for the unusual lability of the N-terminal splice junction?</p><p>A second unique property of the MP-Be DnaB intein is the apparent thiol sensitivity of the Thr<sup>+1</sup> MIP* Block G BI (<bold>III</bold>), which accumulates in the N341A mutant. Both 50 m<sc>m</sc> DTT and 50 m<sc>m</sc> Cys cleaved the BI to yield M + IP under mild conditions (room temperature, pH 9). The thiolate group of molecular cysteine, rather than the amino group, was most likely the reactive agent because other amino acids had no effect. Thiol-induced MIP* cleavage required a natively folded precursor, with only a few percent of denatured MIP* being cleaved by 50 m<sc>m</sc> DTT. A native structure should not be necessary if the thiols were merely attacking the ester linkage in the Block G BI. However, cleavage by free Cys would be more plausible and a native structure would be required if the Thr<sup>+1</sup> Block G BI was in equilibrium with a thioester containing intermediate. There are only 2 cysteines in the MP-Be DnaB intein that could form this hypothetical thioester intermediate. One Cys is in the endonuclease domain, which is distant from the splicing active site. The other is Cys<sup>320</sup>, which is clearly in or near the active site.</p></sec><sec><title>A New Variation in the Protein Splicing Mechanism</title><p>Based on these experimental results, we propose the following new variation of the protein splicing mechanism that accounts for all of our unusual results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>Class 3</italic>). In step 1, Cys<sup>320</sup> attacks the N-terminal splice junction to form a Block F BI (<bold>VIII</bold>) with a thioester linkage between M and IP at the Cys<sup>320</sup> branch point. Transesterification rapidly transfers the N-extein (M) to Thr<sup>+1</sup>, which results in formation of the standard Block G BI (<bold>III</bold>). The remainder of the pathway is the same as in other inteins. Transesterification is energetically favored from Cys<sup>320</sup> to Thr<sup>+1</sup> because sulfur is a better leaving group than oxygen, which may account for the prevalence of Ser or Thr at the +1 position in WCT-containing inteins. This mechanism is supported by the MP-Be DnaB intein modeled structure. The sulfur atom of Cys<sup>320</sup> is 4.9 &#x000c5; from the carbonyl carbon of Gln<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at the N-terminal splice junction. Given the nature of the model and possible conformational dynamics in the precursor, this distance is reasonable. Cys<sup>320</sup> is slightly closer to the Gln<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> carbonyl carbon in our model than is Thr<sup>+1</sup> at 5.2 &#x000c5;. The Cys<sup>320</sup> side chain sulfur atom is 2.6 &#x000c5; from the Thr<sup>+1</sup> side chain oxygen, which would allow it to rapidly transfer the N-extein to Thr<sup>+1</sup> in step 2. This model also explains the thiol lability of the Thr<sup>+1</sup> BI if the transesterification step is reversible, as is the conversion of linear and branched (thio)ester intermediates in standard inteins. Even if &#x0003c;5% of the BI in N341A mutants is the thiol-labile Block F BI (as suggested by the thiol cleavage experiments with denatured BI), product consumption would drive the decay of the Thr<sup>+1</sup> BI (<bold>III</bold>) in response to thiol reagents. Maintaining the equilibrium between the two branches drives more protein toward the thiol-sensitive Cys<sup>320</sup> form until all of the BI is converted to M + IP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>C</italic>). This proposed splicing mechanism explains (<italic>a</italic>) the essential nature of Cys<sup>320</sup> for both N-terminal cleavage and splicing, (<italic>b</italic>) N-terminal cleavage in the absence of the Thr<sup>+1</sup> nucleophile, and (<italic>c</italic>) cleavage of only properly folded Block G BI by thiols. Unfortunately, the small percentage of thiol-labile Block F BI in N341A mutants, as indicated in lability studies with denatured BI, makes it difficult to isolate and characterize, especially because both BIs have the same mass. However, we will seek out this new branched intermediate in future studies.</p></sec><sec><title>A New Classification of Inteins</title><p>This study describes a new class of inteins that can be identified based on the absence of an N-terminal Ser, Thr, or Cys and the presence of the WCT triplet. We propose calling them Class 3 inteins, with standard inteins being Class 1. KlbA-like inteins represent Class 2, which lack both the standard N-terminal nucleophile and the WCT triplet. Although its splicing mechanism has not been experimentally determined, the DNA helicase intein from <italic>Arthrobacter</italic> species FB24 is also a putative member of Class 2 based on sequence signatures. The three classes represent different splicing mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Although Class 1 and Class 2 inteins use the typical Thr (position 7) and His (position 10) in Block B to activate the intein N-terminal splice junction, Class 3 inteins require the Block B Trp (position 12) to activate N-terminal cleavage. The MP-Be DnaB intein does not require the Block B, position 7 residue (Ser<sup>62</sup>) for N-terminal cleavage. Except for one Class 3 intein, all Class 3 inteins that we identified have Thr or Ser at the +1 position, which energetically favors the transesterification step to generate the Block G BI. We are currently examining splicing of the three known WCT inteins that begin with Ser<sup>1</sup> or Cys<sup>1</sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.069567/DC1">supplemental Table 2</ext-link>) and the one known WCT intein that has Cys<sup>+1</sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.069567/DC1">supplemental Table 1</ext-link>) to determine whether they fall into Class 3 based on differences in reactivity when compared with standard inteins, such as cleavage of the N-terminal splice junction in +1 mutants and the absolute requirement of the Block F Cys for splicing. These future studies will allow us to further refine the requirements for inclusion into Class 3. As more inteins are identified, the range of splicing mechanisms continues to expand, reflecting the robust nature of intein-mediated protein splicing.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author profile</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="supp_285_4_2515_v2_index.html"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by" id="FN1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported in part by Israel Science Foundation Grant 626/03 (to S.
