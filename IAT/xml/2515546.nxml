Due to its pattern of cellular localization and binding partners, syncoilin is an ideal candidate to be both an important structural component of myocytes and a potential mediator of inherited myopathies. Here we present a report of a knockout mouse model for syncoilin and the results of an investigation into the effect of a syncoilin null state on striated muscle function in 6&#x02013;8-week-old mice. An analysis of proteins known to associate with syncoilin showed that ablation of syncoilin had no effect on absolute expression or spatial localization of desmin or alpha dystrobrevin. Our syncoilin-null animal exhibited no differences in cardiotoxin-induced muscle regeneration, voluntary wheel running, or enforced treadmill exercise capacity, relative to wild-type controls. Finally, a mechanical investigation of isolated soleus and extensor digitorum longus indicated a potential differential reduction in muscle strength and resilience. We are the first to present data identifying an increased susceptibility to muscle damage in response to an extended forced exercise regime in syncoilin-deficient muscle. This study establishes a second viable syncoilin knockout model and highlights the importance of further investigations to determine the role of syncoilin in skeletal muscle.</p></abstract><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Syncoilin is a recently described member of the intermediate filament (IF) family of proteins (Newey et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2001</xref>). So named for its enrichment at the neuromuscular synapse and its coiled-coil-forming rod domains, the syncoilin gene has been mapped to chromosome 1 in humans and to chromosome 4 in mice. The syncoilin gene comprises five coding exons that generate a 64-kDa protein product (Newey et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2001</xref>). Following its discovery, subsequent yeast two-hybrid screening analysis showed that the IF protein desmin and the dystrophin-related protein &#x003b1;-dystrobrevin were syncoilin binding partners in striated muscle (Newey et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2001</xref>; Poon et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2002</xref>). Histologic studies utilizing immunofluorescent and confocal microscopy have confirmed that syncoilin colocalizes under normal conditions with both desmin and &#x003b1;-dystrobrevin (McCullagh et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2007</xref>; Newey et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2001</xref>; Poon et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2002</xref>).</p><p>One distinctive feature of syncoilin is its apparent departure from spontaneous dimer-forming behavior. Syncoilin does not appear to form a filamentous network by itself or with other IF proteins, although it may form filaments in certain myopathies (Brown et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2005</xref>; Poon et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2002</xref>).</p><p>Syncoilin is highly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle, and in the former it is concentrated at the sarcolemma, Z-lines, perinuclear space, myotendinous junction, and neuromuscular junction (McCullagh et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2007</xref>; Newey et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2001</xref>; Poon et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2002</xref>). Within the skeletal muscle fiber population, syncoilin is enriched at the sarcolemma and sarcoplasm of oxidative muscle fibers (McCullagh et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2007</xref>). Thus, the localization of syncoilin parallels that of desmin, to which it binds directly.</p><p>Desmin is the dominant IF protein in mature muscle and has been predicted to play a major role in protecting muscle from mechanical stress and is important for muscle integrity (Capetanaki et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2007</xref>; Costa et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2004</xref>). An analysis of the tensile properties of single desmin filaments has shown that it exhibits a nonlinear response to strain (notably above 50% extension) and a tensile strength of at least 240&#x000a0;mPa (Kreplak et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2008</xref>). These properties add further weight to the theory that desmin acts as both a mediator of myocyte spatial organization and provides a physical link between adjacent contractile units.</p><p>Desmin knockout (<italic>des&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic>) mice show a skeletal myopathy as well as a cardiomyopathy, and desmin aberrations have been linked to disease in humans (Li et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1996</xref>; Milner et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1996</xref>; Olive et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2004</xref>). A study of exercise ability showed a reduction in the capacity of <italic>des&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> mice to perform both voluntary wheel running and enforced treadmill exercise. Most interestingly, the study showed that an absence of desmin was not sufficient to increase serum creatine kinase levels (a marker of sarcolemmal damage) (Haubold et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2003</xref>).</p><p>We have previously shown that the levels of syncoilin are reduced by 60% in these animals and that the subcellular location of syncoilin is altered. In the <italic>des&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> mice, syncoilin is lost from the Z-lines and reduced at the sarcolemma (McCullagh et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2007</xref>). Alterations in syncoilin expression have been reported for other myopathies, including elevated levels in dystrophic muscles of <italic>mdx</italic> mice and in atrophic muscle fibers of patients with neurogenic disorders (Brown et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2005</xref>; Newey et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2001</xref>).</p><p>Although there is clear evidence showing that syncoilin binds directly to both &#x003b1;-dystrobrevin and desmin, whether syncoilin has the ability to bind to these proteins simultaneously and thus form a link between the cytoskeletal IF network and the sarcolemma via the dystrophin associated protein complex (DAPC) remains to be investigated. This potential linking of the DAPC to the IF network via syncoilin is of interest since the lateral transmission of contractile force to the extracellular matrix is believed to be mediated mainly through IF proteins (Lieber et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2002</xref>).</p><p>The DAPC is a trans-sarcolemmal protein complex expressed in both muscle and nonmuscle tissues (Blake et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2002</xref>). Due to its expression patterns and its large and varied number of protein constituents, the DAPC is considered to play both a structural and a signaling role. A detailed review of the DAPC with respect to its structure and predicted role in normal skeletal muscle function and myopathy is outside of the scope of this article. The reader is referred to comprehensive reviews by Blake et&#x000a0;al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2002</xref>) and Davies and Nowak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2006</xref>) for further detail.</p><p>Briefly, the DAPC consists of the &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-dystroglycans and the sarcoglycans at the sarcolemma, along with the cytoplasmic components syntrophin and dystrobrevin. It is now well established that mutations in dystrophin and the sarcoglycans result in a muscular dystrophy. Aberrations in both desmin and &#x003b1;-dystrobrevin have been implicated in muscular dystrophies, although in the case of &#x003b1;-dystrobrevin its role in the pathophysiology of neuromuscular disease is far from clear (Jin et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2007</xref>; Jones et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2003</xref>; Paulin et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2004</xref>; Rees et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2007</xref>). The DAPC stabilizes the sarcolemma by linking the extracellular matrix (via an extracellular interaction of laminin-2 with DAPC component &#x003b1;-dystroglycan) with the internal cytoskeleton and contractile apparatus of myocytes (via an interaction of dystrophin with F-actin and indirectly with the IF network via &#x003b1;-dystrobrevin) (Blake et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2002</xref>).</p><p>In view of the findings that the loss of either desmin or dystrobrevin results in the development of muscular dystrophy in association with changes in the distribution of syncoilin, we decided to test the hypothesis that loss of syncoilin might have an adverse effect on myocyte function. We generated a syncoilin knockout mouse by standard techniques of homologous recombination in embryonic stem (ES) cells and a Cre-<italic>lox</italic>P-mediated conditional gene-targeting approach. Such null mutants would allow the investigation of the role of syncoilin in skeletal and cardiac muscle. This strategy allowed us to produce two lines of mice: conditional (<italic>sync</italic>-<italic>floxed</italic>) and constitutive syncoilin (<italic>sync&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic>) knockout mice. Constitutive deletion of syncoilin resulted in a viable mouse, precluding the need for tissue-specific excision of the syncoilin gene.

Together, these data indicate that syncoilin is not essential for either the correct cellular localization or expression of these proteins (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).</p><p>The treatment of skeletal muscle with myonecrotic cardiotoxin induces widespread necrosis followed by a well characterized cascade of satellite cell activation, proliferation, differentiation, and maturation (Shi and Garry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2006</xref>).

Semiquantitative PCR analysis of myogenin, p21, p27, and p57&#x000a0;expression in cardiotoxin-treated tissue also failed to elicit a noticeable difference in transcript levels. When their expression is upregulated, these proteins act to initiate myogenic differentiation and prevent the cell from re-entering the cell replication cycle (Koo et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2007</xref>). These findings indicate that a lack of syncoilin does not obviously retard muscle tissue regeneration and that thus syncoilin is unlikely to play an essential role in this process. The results of both our voluntary running and enforced treadmill exercise studies indicate that phenotypically syncoilin is dispensable for the normal mechanical function of striated mucle under exercise conditions.</p><p>Interestingly, an investigation of contractile function in isolated soleus and EDL demonstrated a reduction of nearly 30% in the maximum force generated by <italic>sync&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> EDL compared with <italic>sync+/+</italic> EDL (although no difference in the soleus analysis) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).

Using an alternative syncoilin-null model (generated by the introduction of a point mutation resulting in the aberrant mRNA splicing of the second syncoilin exon), this study reinforces the findings presented in our own analysis, namely, that syncoilin appears to be largely redundant for striated muscle development and regeneration (Zhang et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2008</xref>).</p><p>Our analysis of serum CK levels following 3 weeks of enforced treadmill exercise is the first report of a functionally induced myopathy deriving from an absence of syncoilin (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

This finding is in contrast to earlier studies performed on <italic>des&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> mice, which failed to exhibit an increase in serum CK levels after a bout of enforced treadmill exercise (Haulbold et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2003</xref>).</p><p>An analysis of serum CK levels in <italic>des&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> mice was performed immediately following and 24&#x000a0;h after a brief period of low-speed downhill running as described by Vilquin et&#x000a0;al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1998</xref>) for use in the dystrophin <italic>mdx</italic> mouse model (Haubold et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2003</xref>; Vilquin et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1998</xref>). The results of this study did not show a difference in CK levels between wild-type and <italic>des&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> animals either immediately after or 1&#x000a0;day after exercise.</p><p>The <italic>mdx</italic> mouse is used as a model of dystrophin ablation-induced muscular dystrophy and exhibits a severe myopathic phenotype (Vilquin et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1998</xref>). The phenotype of a <italic>des&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> mouse is far milder than that exhibited by the <italic>mdx</italic> mouse, although <italic>des&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> mice still exhibit a reduction in running ability when compared with wild-type animals (Haubold et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2003</xref>). At a molecular level, a loss of desmin does not appear to induce disruption of the essential DAPC as is seen with a loss of dystrophin. Although it is surprising that a loss of syncoilin induces an increase in serum CK levels whereas a loss of desmin does not (given the proposed role of syncoilin and the abundance of desmin in mature myocytes), it is a possibility that the exercise regimen applied to the <italic>des&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> mice was not sufficient in either duration or intensity to induce sufficient damage to cause mechanical stress.</p><p>The precise function of syncoilin remains undelineated. However, we do possess several pieces of evidence that can assist us in generating hypotheses about the role(s) of syncoilin in muscle. Given that syncoilin is a member of the IF protein family (at least at a sequence homology level), we can reasonably expect that it plays a role in line with that of other IF proteins, which, among others, involves protecting cells from mechanical stress (Parry et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2007</xref>). Syncoilin&#x02019;s association with the DAPC and other IF proteins (in particular, the finding that it binds to desmin) adds weight to it having a structural role in muscle. Our studies indicate that at least in an acute setting there are sufficient mechanisms in existence in myocytes to cope with a loss of syncoilin. One such potential compensatory mechanism may exist in skeletal muscle in the form of the type IV IF protein synemin, although it is worth noting that there are significant size and structural differences between these two IF proteins.</p><p>Synemin is a large IF protein expressed in all types of human muscle cells as two splice variants, &#x003b1;-synemin and &#x003b2;-synemin (Sun et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2008</xref>). Synemin has been shown to act as a binding partner for a range of cytoskeletal and structural proteins and contains a binding site for &#x003b1;-actinin (Bellin et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2001</xref>). Recent studies have indicated that the two variants may play different roles in muscle, with the ability to interact with vinculin and metavinculin limited to &#x003b1;-synemin, which contains an additional C-terminal 312-residue insert not found in &#x003b2;-synemin (Sun et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2008</xref>). Importantly for our investigation of syncoilin, synemin has also been shown to act as a binding partner for desmin and &#x003b1;-dystrobrevin, and the spatial organization of synemin exhibits a number of parallels to that of syncoilin (Bhosle et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2006</xref>). As such, it has the potential to act in a compensatory role in a <italic>sync&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> system.</p><p>Our Western blot analysis for both H and M variants (analogous to &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; variants in humans) of synemin showed no difference in net protein levels between <italic>sync+/+</italic> and <italic>sync&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> mice, indicating that a lack of overt phenotype in the <italic>sync&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> mouse is not due to compensation by synemin. It is possible, however, that the presence of synemin in what appears to be a similar role in muscle offsets or masks the deleterious effects of a loss of syncoilin, such that under normal laboratory cage or mild exercise conditions, syncoilin exhibits a degree of functional redundancy.</p><p>In summary, our investigations show that we have generated a functional example of a syncoilin knockout mouse model. Syncoilin-null mice do not display an overt phenotype. An absence of syncoilin does not (in the proteins investigated in this study) induce a compensatory protein upregulation in skeletal muscle or the disruption of protein localization in isolated fibers. No difference in muscle regeneration following cardiotoxin-induced necrosis was observed, and an absence of syncoilin did not affect voluntary or enforced exercise capacity.</p><p>The mechanical analysis of isolated muscle revealed a significant alteration in contractile properties, indicating that syncoilin may play a role in the lateral transmission of force across contractile tissues. Most interestingly, we have shown that under extended exercise conditions, an absence of syncoilin predisposes muscle to increased damage. Given the findings in this and other studies, it is possible that the role of syncoilin is analogous to that of &#x0201c;a single spoke in a wheel,&#x0201d; in that its structural role is not appreciated (nor its absence noted) until significant levels of mechanical stress are applied to the syncoilin-deficient system.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the Muscular Dystrophy Association USA and Association Fran&#x000e7;aise Contre les Myopathies.
