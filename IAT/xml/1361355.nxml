Ephrins constitute a class of homologous ligands for the Eph class of receptor tyrosine kinases and exhibit overlapping expression patterns. Thus, we examined whether other ephrins might serve as alternative receptors for NiV. Here, we show that of all known ephrins (ephrinA1&#x02013;A5 and ephrinB1&#x02013;B3), only the soluble Fc-fusion proteins of ephrinB3, in addition to ephrinB2, bound to soluble NiV attachment protein G (NiV-G). Soluble NiV-G bound to cell surface ephrinB3 and B2 with subnanomolar affinities (K<sub>d</sub> &#x0003d; 0.58 nM and 0.06 nM for ephrinB3 and B2, respectively). Surface plasmon resonance analysis indicated that the relatively lower affinity of NiV-G for ephrinB3 was largely due to a faster off-rate (K<sub>off</sub> &#x0003d; 1.94 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> versus 1.06 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for ephrinB3 and B2, respectively). EphrinB3 was sufficient to allow for viral entry of both pseudotype and live NiV. Soluble ephrinB2 and B3 were able to compete for NiV-envelope-mediated viral entry on both ephrinB2- and B3-expressing cells, suggesting that NiV-G interacts with both ephrinB2 and B3 via an overlapping site. Mutational analysis indicated that the Leu&#x02013;Trp residues in the solvent exposed G&#x02013;H loop of ephrinB2 and B3 were critical determinants of NiV binding and entry. Indeed, replacement of the Tyr&#x02013;Met residues in the homologous positions in ephrinB1 with Leu&#x02013;Trp conferred NiV receptor activity to ephrinB1. Thus, ephrinB3 is a bona fide alternate receptor for NiV entry, and two residues in the G&#x02013;H loop of the ephrin B-class ligands are critical determinants of NiV receptor activity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Nipah virus is a deadly virus that can cause death in up to 70&#x00025; of infected patients, mostly from fatal inflammation of the brain. Nipah virus is considered a &#x0201c;priority pathogen&#x0201d; for bioterrorism purposes, and it has the potential for widespread economic devastation as it can spread rapidly among susceptible livestock. The authors had previously identified the receptor that mediates Nipah virus entry into cells.

Thus, the authors screened all known ephrins, and found that a closely related molecule, ephrinB3, also can function as an entry receptor for Nipah virus. In addition, the authors established that while ephrinB2 was better used than ephrinB3 as an entry receptor, the same two critical amino acids in ephrinB2 and B3 were responsible for the viral receptor activity of these molecules.

Thus, we examined if any ephrins, other than ephrinB2, can bind similarly to NiV-G. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we screened for the ability of soluble HA-tagged ectodomain of NiV-G (NiV-G-HA) to bind to all known ephrins (ephrinA1&#x02013;A5 and ephrinB1&#x02013;B3). We found that ephrinB3-Fc, in addition to ephrinB2-Fc, bound to NiV-G-HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020007-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). To confirm these results with cell surface-expressed ephrins, CHO-pgsA745 cells were stably transfected with human ephrinB1 (CHO-B1), ephrinB2 (CHO-B2), or ephrinB3 (CHO-B3). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells do not express ephrins endogenously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020007-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;, while the CHO-pgsA745 cells derived from these CHO cells lack heparin sulfate proteoglycans &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020007-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. Heparin sulfates are known to act as entry or attachment receptors for many viruses, which can confound viral receptor studies. Thus, we used NiV-G-Fc, a fusion construct between the ectodomain of NiV-G and the Fc region of human IgG1, to measure the binding of NiV-G to each of the ephrin B-class ligands stably expressed on CHO-pgsA745 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020007-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Remarkably, the K<sub>d</sub> for NiV-G-Fc binding to ephrinB2 and B3 was in the subnanomolar range (K<sub>d</sub> &#x0003d; 0.06 nM and 0.58 nM for ephrinB2 and B3, respectively). NiV-G-Fc did not bind to CHO-B1 cells when tested under the same conditions used for CHO-B2 and CHO-B3 cells (unpublished data).</p><p>To delineate the difference in binding affinities between ephrinB2 and B3, we examined their binding kinetics to NiV-G-Fc. We performed surface plasmon resonance analysis by coupling NiV-G-Fc to the sensor chip (as ligand) while using soluble ephrinB2 and B3 as analyte. BIAcore analysis of NiV-G-Fc binding to ephrinB2-Fc and B3-Fc indicated that while NiV-G-Fc bound to ephrinB2 and B3 with similar on-rates (K<sub>on</sub> &#x0003d; 9.69 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> and 6.87 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> for ephrinB2 and B3, respectively), their off-rates were significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020007-g001">Figure 1</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020007-g001">1</xref>D). The K<sub>off</sub> for ephrinB2-Fc binding to NiV-G-Fc (1.06 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) was more than 10-fold slower than ephrinB3-Fc (1.94 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020007-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). EphrinB1-Fc was also tested similarly to ephrinB2 and B3 and did not exhibit any binding to NiV-G-Fc even up to concentrations as high as 500 nM (unpublished data). As a control to determine the accuracy of our BIAcore measurements, we determined the K<sub>d</sub> of EphB4-Fc binding to ephrinB2-Fc to be 0.37 nM, a value consistent with published values of approximately 0.5 nM &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020007-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d; (unpublished data). Cumulatively, our data show that the Nipah attachment protein bound to both ephrinB2 and ephrinB3 with different but significant affinities.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>EphrinB3 Supports NiV Entry and Infection</title><p>We next examined whether the high-affinity protein interaction seen between ephrinB3 and NiV-G was sufficient to permit the entry of NiV. We first established a panel of CHO-pgsA745 cells stably expressing ephrinB1, B2, and B3. Since the EphB3 receptor binds to all ephrin B-class ligands with similar affinities (0.27&#x02013;1.8 nM for ephrinB1, 0.28&#x02013;0.78 nM for ephrinB2, and 1.5 nM for ephrinB3) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020007-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;, we used saturating amounts of soluble EphB3 (EphB3-Fc) to determine the level of ephrinB1&#x02013;B3 expression in our stable cell lines by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020007-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). We found that while CHO-B1, CHO-B2, and CHO-B3 cells were significantly positive for EphB3 binding (68&#x00025;, 47&#x00025;, and 47&#x00025;, respectively), only CHO-B2 and CHO-B3 cells bound to NiV-G-Fc (46&#x00025; and 31&#x00025;, respectively). Soluble EphB3 did not bind to parental CHO-pgsA745 cells, nor did the ephrin A-class-specific EphA2-Fc bind any of the cell lines tested (CHO-pgsA745, CHO-B1, CHO-B2, or CHO-B3). These results confirm the specific ephrin B-class expression on our panel of CHO-pgsA745 cells.</p><p>We then proceeded to quantitate NiV entry using NiV envelope pseudotyped luciferase (Luc) reporter viruses. We had previously shown that NiV envelopes can be successfully pseudotyped onto recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) expressing a red fluorescent protein (RFP), but lacking its own envelope (NiV-VSV-&#x00394;G-RFP) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020007-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. Here, the NiV-VSV-&#x00394;G-Luc was made bearing the NiV fusion (F) and NiV-G and expressing the <italic>Renilla</italic> Luc reporter gene in place of the RFP gene. These NiV envelope pseudotyped VSV particles were used to infect CHO-pgsA745 parental cells (CHO), CHO-B1, CHO-B2, and CHO-B3 cell lines. We found that both CHO-B2 and CHO-B3 allowed entry of NiV-VSV-&#x00394;G-Luc virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020007-g002">Figure 2</xref>B), although viral entry into CHO-B2 cells reproducibly resulted in higher Luc levels (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.05, paired <italic>t</italic>-test). In three independent experiments, the reduction in viral entry into CHO-B3 cells ranged from 21&#x00025; to 46&#x00025;. Since the EphB3-Fc binding data indicated similar levels of ephrinB2 and B3 expression on the CHO-B2 and CHO-B3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020007-g002">Figure 2</xref>A), NiV-VSV-&#x00394;G-Luc virus entered CHO-B2 cells more efficiently than CHO-B3 cells.</p><p>To examine whether ephrinB3 can support viral infection, live NiV infections were performed under Biosafety Level-4 conditions. The hallmark of NiV infection in humans is the presence of syncytial or multinucleated giant endothelial cells, and cell lines from many different species produced syncytia upon infection. Therefore, we looked for syncytia formation in CHO, CHO-B1, CHO-B2, CHO-B3, and Vero cells after infection with live NiV. Indeed, we found that live NiV can infect ephrinB2- and B3-expressing cells, although ephrinB2 appears to be used more efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020007-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). With any given multiplicity of infection (MOI), at 24 h postinfection, there were always a greater number of syncytia in the CHO-B2 versus CHO-B3 cells. No syncytia were detected in CHO-B1 cells. At 48 h postinfection, syncytia were apparent at all MOIs tested in the CHO-B3 cells (unpublished data). Thus, ephrinB3 can serve as a bona fide alternative receptor for NiV entry.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>NiV-G Binds EphrinB2 and B3 via an Overlapping Site</title><p>Next, we asked whether ephrinB2 and B3 interact with NiV-G in a distinct or overlapping manner. To answer this question, we used a competition assay where CHO-B2 and CHO-B3 cells were infected with NiV-VSV-&#x00394;G-Luc viruses in the presence of soluble ephrin B-class ligands. As expected, ephrinB2-Fc inhibited pseudotyped NiV on CHO-B2 cells while ephrinB1-Fc did not inhibit entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020007-g003">Figure 3</xref>, left). However, ephrinB3-Fc also inhibited pseudotyped NiV entry on CHO-B2 cells, suggesting that ephrinB3 blocked ephrinB2-dependent NiV entry by competing for a similar binding domain on NiV-G. Conversely, ephrinB2-Fc also inhibited pseudotyped NiV entry on CHO-B3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020007-g003">Figure 3</xref>, right). In both CHO-B2 and CHO-B3 cells, ephrinB2-Fc was a more effective inhibitor of NiV-G entry than ephrinB3-Fc. In summary, these results suggest that ephrinB2 and B3 binding sites on NiV-G are overlapping.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Leu&#x02013;Trp Residues in the G&#x02013;H Loop of EphrinB2 and B3 Are Critical for NiV-G Binding</title><p>Since ephrinB2 and B3 can support NiV entry, while ephrinB1 cannot, we hypothesize that conserved residues common in both ephrinB2 and B3 mediate specific interactions with NiV-G. Alignment of human, mouse, and rat ephrinB1, B2, and B3 sequences identified common residues in ephrinB2 and B3 not present in ephrinB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020007-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). Examination of the homologous G&#x02013;H loop regions between ephrinB1, B2, and B3 reveals that the L&#x02013;W (Leu&#x02013;Trp) residues present in ephrinB2 and B3 are replaced by Y&#x02013;M (Tyr&#x02013;Met) in ephrinB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020007-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). The cocrystal structure of ephrinB2 and the EphB2 receptor (an endogenous ephrinB2 receptor) indicates that the L&#x02013;W (Leu<sub>124</sub>&#x02013;Trp<sub>125</sub>) residues in the G&#x02013;H loop of ephrinB2 insert deep into a hydrophobic pocket in EphB2 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020007-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. We believe this interaction to be informative as soluble EphB2 inhibits NiV-G mediated infection&#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020007-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d; and is likely to interact with a similar region on ephrinB2 as NiV-G. Thus, we sought to determine if the G&#x02013;H loop L&#x02013;W residues in ephrinB2 and ephrinB3 also interact with NiV-G.</p><p>Full-length human ephrinB1, B2, and B3 clones were obtained, and the ectodomain of each was fused to the Fc region of human IgG1. Replacement of Y&#x02013;M in ephrinB1 with L&#x02013;W from the homologous positions in ephrinB2 and B3 resulted in a soluble ephrinB1 mutant, B1<sub>LW</sub>-Fc, that bound NiV-G almost as well as ephrinB2-Fc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020007-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). Conversely, the L&#x02013;W to Y&#x02013;M mutations in soluble ephrinB2 (B2<sub>YM</sub>-Fc) and ephrinB3 (B3<sub>YM</sub>-Fc) abrogated binding to NiV-G-HA, although at higher concentrations, B2<sub>YM</sub>-Fc appears to retain minimal NiV-G binding activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Leu&#x02013;Trp Residues in the G&#x02013;H Loop of EphrinB3 Are Necessary for NiV Entry</title><p>Next, we examined the effects of these L&#x02013;W/Y&#x02013;M mutations in the context of full-length ephrins and their ability to support NiV entry. To do so, we first made stable CHO-pgsA745 cells expressing the full-length ephrin mutants (CHO-B1<sub>LW</sub>, CHO-B2<sub>YM</sub>, and CHO-B3<sub>YM</sub>). We compared the level of mutant ephrin expression in the stable cell lines to that of wild-type ephrin expression using EphB3-Fc in a flow cytometry analysis. It is unlikely that EphB3 binds to the ephrin LW/YM residues in question since EphB3 can bind ephrinB1, B2, and B3 with similar affinities &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020007-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore, using EphB3-Fc to measure cell surface expression, we found that both wild-type ephrin and its relevant mutant were expressed at similar levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020007-g005">Figure 5</xref>A; compare B1 to B1<sub>LW</sub>, B2 to B2<sub>YM</sub>, and B3 to B3<sub>YM</sub>). Parental CHO-pgsA745 (CHO) served as a negative control and soluble EphB3 did not bind to these cells. In addition, NiV-G-Fc bound to the mutant ephrins in the expected patterns seen in our previous solid state ELISA experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020007-g004">Figure 4</xref>B).</p><p>We then proceeded to infect these cells with NiV-VSV-Luc pseudotyped viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020007-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). As expected, both ephrinB2 and B3 permitted NiV envelope-mediated entry as described previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020007-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). The B1<sub>LW</sub> mutant now supported NiV entry, while entry into B2<sub>YM</sub> cells was markedly reduced. Entry into B3<sub>YM</sub> was completely abrogated. We note that while entry into B2<sub>YM</sub> cells was reduced by about 85&#x00025; compared to wild-type ephrinB2 cells, entry was still 44-fold over background (parental CHO-pgsA745 cells). These results suggest that while the L<sub>124</sub>&#x02013;W<sub>125</sub> residues in ephrinB3 appear to be critical for NiV entry, other residues in ephrinB2 likely have a supporting role in mediating NiV entry. Interestingly, the B1<sub>LW</sub> mutant could not fully restore entry equivalent to wild-type B2 or B3 levels, even though NiV-G bound to cell surface ephrinB1<sub>LW</sub> at wild-type ephrinB2 levels. Therefore, in addition to simple binding, additional residues in ephrinB2 likely mediate the subsequent conformational changes in NiV-G and/or F that leads to membrane fusion and entry.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>EphrinB2 was recently identified as a functional cellular receptor for NiV &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020007-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020007-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;.

Here, we show that ephrinB3 is an alternate receptor for NiV and is independently able to support NiV entry and infection, albeit less efficiently than ephrinB2. NiV-G binds to both ephrinB2 and B3 with subnanomolar affinity, with the relatively weaker K<sub>d</sub> of NiV-G for ephrinB3 explained by its faster off-rate. Finally, we implicate two residues (L&#x02013;W) common in the G&#x02013;H loop of ephrinB2 and B3 as crucial for NiV receptor activity. Remarkably, replacement of the Y&#x02013;M residues in the homologous positions in ephrinB1 with L&#x02013;W conferred wild-type NiV-G binding activity and substantial NiV receptor activity to a protein that is otherwise nonfunctional as a NiV receptor.</p><p>To our knowledge, there is no specific indication that ephrinB3 is expressed in the endothelium. At the minimum, ephrinB3 does not appear to be critical to vascular development since ephrinB3 knockout mice lack the overt defects in vascular morphogenesis seen in ephrinB2 knockout mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020007-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020007-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;.
