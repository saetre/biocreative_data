Conventionally, feedback and feed-forward inhibitory activity evoked by somatosensory input to the dorsal horn is believed to be driven by glutamate, the principle excitatory neurotransmitter in primary afferent fibers. Substance P (SP), the prototypic neuropeptide released from primary afferent fibers to the dorsal horn, is regarded as a pain substance in the mammalian somatosensory system due to its action on nociceptive projection neurons. Here we report that endogenous SP drives a novel form of feed-forward inhibitory activity in the dorsal horn. The SP-driven feed-forward inhibitory activity is long-lasting and has a temporal phase distinct from glutamate-driven feed-forward inhibitory activity. Compromising SP-driven feed-forward inhibitory activity results in behavioral sensitization. Our findings reveal a fundamental role of SP in recruiting inhibitory activity for sensory processing, which may have important therapeutic implications in treating pathological pain conditions using SP receptors as targets.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title/><p>Feedback/feed-forward inhibitory modulation driven by glutamate has been well studied in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Little is know whether feedback/feed-forward inhibitory active may be driven in a glutamate-independent manner. A number of neuropeptides including substance P (SP) are also released from nociceptive primary afferent fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. SP has been regarded as a pain substance for decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], as supported by studies, including chemical ablation of lamina I neurons expressing the SP receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], genetic disruption of the genes encoding substance P [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and its receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The nociceptive function of SP is mainly attributed to the activation of NK1 receptors (NK1R) that are expressed on nociceptive projection neurons located in lamina I of the dorsal horn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. It is unknown whether endogenously released SP can directly drive, in a glutamate-independent manner, inhibitory activity within the spinal cord to control nociceptive responses.</p><p>We performed patch-clamp recordings from dorsal horn neurons in lamina V (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>), a region important for nociceptive transmission and modulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. When primary afferent fibers (dorsal roots) were briefly stimulated electrically (500 &#x003bc;A, 5 stimuli in 2.5 sec), EPSCs (excitatory postsynaptic currents) were recorded from lamina V neurons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). All EPSCs were blocked by ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists 20 &#x003bc;M CNQX plus 50 &#x003bc;M APV (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>) or 3 mM kynurenic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Brief stimulation of primary afferent fibers also evoked IPSCs (inhibitory postsynaptic currents). These immediate IPSCs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref> top) were driven by glutamatergic synaptic input, or glutamate-driven feed-forward inhibitory activity, because they were completely abolished in the presence of CNQX plus APV (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref> bottom). However, when prolonged stimulation was applied (500 &#x003bc;A, 20 Hz, 1 min), a robust and long-lasting increase of IPSC frequency and amplitude was recorded in the presence of CNQX plus APV (n = 5, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d&#x02013;f</xref>) or kyurenic acid (KA, n = 7, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>). These results revealed a feed-forward inhibitory (FFI) pathway not driven by glutamate.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Feed-forward inhibitory activity in the absence of glutamatergic driving force</bold>. <bold>a</bold>, Rat spinal cord slice with attached dorsal root.

Capsaicin is widely used as a natural stimulant for studying nociception. It excites nociceptive primary afferent fibers to release glutamate and neuropeptides including substance P through activation of TRPV1 receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Capsaicin (2 &#x003bc;M) produced a robust and long-lasting increase in IPSC frequency and amplitude in the presence of 3 mM kynurenic acid (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1g&#x02013;j</xref>). The capsaicin effects were similar in the presence of kynurenic acid or other glutamate receptor antagonists (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file: 1</xref>, Figure 1a&#x02013;c), indicating that the effects were unlikely due to an incomplete block of glutamate-driven FFI. Inhibitory neurons in lamina V use both GABA and glycine as co-transmitters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and increases of IPSCs by capsaicin were completely abolished in the presence of 20 &#x003bc;M bicuculline and 2 &#x003bc;M strychnine (n = 8).</p><p>It is unknown whether, transmitters, other than glutamate released from primary afferent fibers can directly drive inhibitory circuitry in the spinal cord. If a transmitter can drive FFI, exogenous application should increase inhibitory activity. We examined neuropeptides thought to be released from primary afferent fibers. Galanin (300 nM), NPY (neuropeptide Y, 1 &#x003bc;M), somatostatin (2 &#x003bc;M), and CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide, 0.5 &#x003bc;M) were tested, but none increased IPSCs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). However, SP significantly increased inhibitory activity under conditions when ionotropic glutamate receptors were blocked; SP increased IPSC frequency to ~350% of control (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>, n = 6) and amplitude to ~200% of control (n = 6).</p><p>If endogenously SP drives FFI following capsaicin stimulation, SP receptor antagonists should attenuate FFI. APTL (D-Arg1, D-Pro2, D-Trp7,9, Leu11]-Substance P, 10 &#x003bc;M), a neurokinin receptor antagonist, substantially blocked capsaicin-induced increases in IPSCs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). L-733,060 (2 &#x003bc;M) and L-732,138 (100 &#x003bc;M), two NK1 receptor (NK1R) antagonists, also inhibited capsaicin-induced increases in IPSCs. NK3 receptors are expressed in the dorsal horn, but SB22200 (2 &#x003bc;M), a NK3 receptor antagonist, did not significantly attenuate capsaicin-induced increases of IPSCs. Similar to capsaicin stimulation, we found that FFI elicited by electrical stimulation was largely abolished by the NK1R antagonist ATPL (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>). These results suggest that endogenous SP drives inhibitory activity.</p><p>NK1Rs couple with either the pertussis toxin (PTX)-insensitive Gq/G<sub>11 </sub>family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] or PTX-sensitive Gi/Go family depending on cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. To elucidate which type of G-proteins was involved in SP-driven FFI, PTX was tested. We found that capsaicin-induced increases in inhibitory synaptic activity were completely abolished when spinal cord slices were pretreated with PTX (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). Capsaicin-induced increases of inhibitory synaptic activity were also completely blocked in the presence of NEM (N-Ethylmaleimide), a Gi/Go protein inhibitor (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). Thus, PTX-sensitive G-protein is involved in SP-driven FFI.</p><p>To confirm the involvement of NK1Rs, we used spinal cord slice preparations obtained from both wild type (NK1R<sup>+/+</sup>) and NK1R knockout mice (NK1R<sup>-/-</sup>). While capsaicin increased IPSCs in NK1R<sup>+/+ </sup>mice, it had no effect in NK1R<sup>-/- </sup>mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref>). Consistent with this result, SP (1 &#x003bc;M) did not increase IPSCs in NK1R<sup>-/- </sup>mice, but did substantially increase IPSCs in NK1R<sup>+/+ </sup>mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file: 1</xref>, Figure 2a,b). Thus, endogenous SP released from primary afferent fibers drives inhibitory activity (SP-driven FFI).</p><p>Possible cellular mechanisms of SP-driven FFI include i) direct excitation of inhibitory neurons; ii) via intermediate steps; and/or iii) through synaptic modulation. If NK1Rs are expressed on dorsal horn inhibitory interneurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], SP may directly excite inhibitory neurons. To test this possibility, we used dorsal horn neuron cultures made from GIN mice, a strain of transgenic mice that express EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) under control of a promoter for GAD67 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In GIN mice, almost all EGFP neurons examined in the dorsal horn are inhibitory neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2e</xref>, SP (100 nM) increased intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>in ~30% (23/77) of EGFP neurons tested in the presence of 500 TTX and 3 mM kynurenic acid. We determined whether EGFP neurons in lamina V responded to SP using spinal cord slices prepared from GIN mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2f</xref>). Most EGFP neurons recorded (64%) showed non-adaptive action potential firing in response to membrane depolarization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2g</xref>). Of 22 EGFP neurons examined, 7 (~30%) responded to 1 &#x003bc;M SP with prolonged membrane depolarization (5 &#x000b1; 1 mV, n = 7) and action potential firing (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2h</xref>). These results suggest that a cellular mechanism of SP-driven FFI is direct excitation of inhibitory interneurons by SP.</p><p>We found that SP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file: 1</xref>, Figure 3a&#x02013;c) and capsaicin (n = 12) had no effect on mIPSCs. SP also did not affect paired-pulse eIPSC ratio and corresponding eIPSC ratio (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file: 1</xref>, Figure 3d&#x02013;f). These results suggest that SP/NK1R-mediated increases of IPSCs represent feed-forward neuronal activity rather than pre- or post-synaptic modulation at inhibitory synaptic junction sites.</p><p>We evaluated the extent SP-driving inhibitory activity contributes to the total inhibitory activity under normal conditions, i.e. without blocking glutamate-driven FFI. We also compared temporal phases between SP-driven FFI and glutamate-driven FFI. In NK1R<sup>+/+ </sup>mice, IPSC frequency and amplitude were increased after trains of electrical stimulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a,c,d</xref>), similar to the results when glutamatergic driving force was blocked (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a&#x02013;f</xref> &#x00026; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>). In contrast, in NK1R<sup>-/- </sup>mice, IPSCs were not significantly changed after the same trains of stimulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b,c,d</xref>). We examined IPSCs during electrical stimulation and found that, in both NK1R<sup>+/+ </sup>and NK1R<sup>-/- </sup>mice, IPSCs were elicited pulse-by-pulse immediately following each stimulus. These immediate IPSCs represented glutamate-driven FFI because they could be blocked by ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>). Since the pulse-by-pulse inhibitory activity was seen in both NK1R<sup>+/+ </sup>and NK1R<sup>-/- </sup>mice, but the long-lasting increases in IPSCs after trains of stimulation were only observed in NK1R<sup>+/+ </sup>mice, it suggests that the latter is driven by substance P through NK1R activation. Similar to electrical stimulation, a large and long-lasting increase in inhibitory synaptic activity was observed in NK1R<sup>+/+ </sup>mice but not in NK1R<sup>-/- </sup>mice after capsaicin stimulation in the absence of ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3e</xref>). Thus, SP-driven FFI and glutamate-driven FFI have distinct temporal phases.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>SP-driven inhibitory activity under conditions when glutamatergic driving force is intact</bold>.

To examine this potential physiological function, a behavioral model was used to see if blockade of SP-driven FFI, using an NK1R antagonist, causes behavioral sensitization to nociceptive stimuli. However, an NK1R antagonist will also block SP-mediated nociceptive response, thus interfering with the observation of a functional change following blockade of SP-driven FFI. To solve this complication, we chemically ablated NK1R-expressing neurons in the superficial lamina (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a&#x00026;b</xref>); most of these neurons are nociceptive projection neurons responsible for SP-mediated nociception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and SP-evoked descending modulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Ablating NK1R-expressing neurons in the superficial lamina was achieved by intrathecally applying substance P-conjugated saporin (SP-SAP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], a targeted toxin for NK1R-expressing neurons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a&#x00026;b</xref>).

To verify that SP-driven FFI remains intact, we used spinal cord slices prepared from SP-SAP treated animals and made recordings from lamina V neurons. Capsaicin was found to increase IPSCs to a similar degree in animals with (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>) or without SP-SAP treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1g&#x02013;j</xref>, Supplementary Figure 1), indicating that the ablation did not affect SP-driven FFI in lamina V.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Assessment of the role of SP-driven inhibitory activity in behavioral responses to noxious stimuli</bold>. <bold>a&#x00026;b</bold>, Micrographs show NK1 receptor immunoreactivity in the lamina I region of a normal rat (<bold>a</bold>) and 14 days following intrathecal application of SP-SAP (<bold>b</bold>). <bold>c</bold>, Capsaicin-induced increases of IPSCs recorded from lamina V neurons of SP-SAP treated rats (n = 5). <bold>d</bold>, The first set of bars show baseline of reflexive lick/guard response to heat stimuli at 44.5&#x000b0;C in normal (open bar, n = 8) and SP-SAP rats (solid bar, n = 8).

Reflexive lick/guard (L/G) responses to nociceptive heat stimuli at 44.5&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] were determined. Both the control and SP-SAP groups showed similar baseline responses to noxious stimuli (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Control rats showed behavioral sensitization following application of capsaicin cream to the planter surface, but a substantial attenuation of behavioral sensitization was observed in parallel experiments carried out in SP-SAP animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. To examine whether the NK1-expressing neurons in deeper laminae of SP-SAP animals may intrinsically control behavioral responses to nociceptive heat stimuli, the behavioral responses were determined following blockade of NK1Rs by its antagonist CP-96,345 (36 nmol). Nociceptive reflexes showed sensitization when CP-96,345 was applied in SP-SAP animals, but behavioral hypersensitivity was attenuated by CP-96,345 in control animals (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d</xref>). The opposite effects of NK1R antagonists between normal and SP-SAP animals indicate a dual function of NK1Rs in nociceptive processing <italic>in vivo</italic>. The behavioral sensitization by the NK1R antagonist in SP-SAP animals revealed a role of SP-driven FFI in controlling nociceptive responses.</p><p>SP-driven FFI is a novel sensory processing mechanism. The unique feature is its temporal phase that extends long time after stimulation. This is distinct from glutamate-driven feedback/feed-forward inhibitory activity. Compromising SP-driven FFI can result in sensory hypersensitivity, providing implications in sensory pathology and therapeutics that targets neurokinin system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Electrophysiology recordings were performed on lamina V neurons in transverse spinal cord slices prepared from rats, NK1R<sup>+/+ </sup>and NK1R<sup>-/- </sup>mice, and GIN mice.
