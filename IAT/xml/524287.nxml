ORF57 was capable of self-interaction and bound a rapidly migrating form of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K), a multifunctional cellular protein involved in gene expression. In virus infected cell extracts, ORF57 was present in a complex with hnRNP K that had protein kinase CK2 activity, and was phosphorylated by CK2. Different regions of ORF57 bound both catalytic &#x003b1;&#x0002f;&#x003b1;&#x02032; and regulatory &#x003b2; subunits of CK2. CK2 modification enhanced the ORF57&#x02013;hnRNP K interaction, and may regulate the presence and activities of components in the complex. We suggest that ORF57 and hnRNP K interaction may modulate ORF57-mediated regulation of viral gene expression. Herpesviral ORF57 (<italic>Rhadinovirus</italic>) and ICP27 (<italic>Simplexvirus</italic>) proteins both interact with hnRNP K and CK2 implying that adaptation of the ancestral hnRNP K and CK2 to associate with viral regulatory ancestor protein likely pre-dates divergence of these <italic>Herpesviridae</italic> genera that occurred 200 million years ago.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Herpesviruses infect a wide range of fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, marsupials and other mammals including humans. A distinguishing feature is their ability to establish lifelong latent infections that can cause recurrent rounds of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c1">1</xref>). These viruses utilize cellular RNA polymerase II to transcribe genes in a temporal cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c2">2</xref>). Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV, also known as human herpesvirus 8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c3">3</xref>), a member of the &#x003b3;-2 herpesvirus sub-family that includes Epstein&#x02013;Barr virus (EBV) and herpesvirus saimiri (HVS), is associated with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and multicentric Castleman's disease [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c5">5</xref>)]. Treatment of latently infected B-cell lines such as BCBL-1, generated by culture of PEL material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c6">6</xref>) with the phorbol ester 12-<italic>O</italic>-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) efficiently induces the KSHV lytic cycle and produces virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c6">6</xref>).</p><p>ORF57 (also known as MTA) and ORF50 (also known as RTA), two of the earliest KSHV regulatory proteins to be expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c8">8</xref>), are required for lytic replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c9">9</xref>). A counterpart of ORF57 protein is present in every herpesvirus of mammals and birds sequenced so far, reflecting its importance. These proteins include herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) ICP27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c10">10</xref>), EBV MTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c11">11</xref>) and HVS ORF57 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c12">12</xref>). ICP27 protein is a multifunctional protein that affects transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c13">13</xref>), pre-mRNA 3 processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c14">14</xref>), RNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c15">15</xref>) and promotes export of viral RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c16">16</xref>). KSHV ORF57 protein also regulates gene expression at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Expression of ORF50 protein alone is necessary and sufficient for the switch from latent to lytic KSHV replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c18">18</xref>). We have shown that ORF57 associates with the ORF50 promoter and with ORF50 protein cooperatively activates expression from this promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c19">19</xref>), and others have shown that ORF57 and ORF50 proteins synergistically activate expression from different ORF50-responsive KSHV promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c20">20</xref>). ORF57 protein localizes to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c22">22</xref>) and can shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c22">22</xref>). Expression of ORF57 increases the accumulation of cytoplasmic reporter mRNA, suggesting a post-transcriptional action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c21">21</xref>), and promotes nuclear export of a reporter RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c23">23</xref>). Herpesvirus ORF57 counterparts like human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Rev protein promote nuclear export of viral mRNAs [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c24">24</xref>)].</p><p>In HSV-1-infected cells, ICP27 protein was found in a complex with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) and the cellular protein kinase CK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c25">25</xref>), and phosphopeptide mapping identified serine residues in ICP27 as targets for CK2 phosphorylation <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c26">26</xref>). An evolutionarily conserved protein, hnRNP K [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c28">28</xref>)] can bind RNA and single- or double-stranded DNA via a GRGG box and three repeats of a motif termed the K homology domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c29">29</xref>). The protein contains classical nuclear localization signals and a KNS domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c30">30</xref>) that confers the ability to shuttle bi-directionally between the nucleus and cytoplasm. HnRNP K is involved in a variety of processes that affect gene expression such as chromatin re-modelling, translational silencing of mRNAs and transcriptional activation, where its binding to a CT-element within the <italic>c-myc</italic> promoter has been shown to activate or repress gene expression [see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c27">27</xref>) and references therein]. The involvement of hnRNP K in these various processes reflects the interactions of its several domains with nucleic acids, protein kinases and other proteins involved in different aspects of gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c32">32</xref>).</p><p>CK2, a pleiotropic and ubiquitous protein kinase [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c34">34</xref>)] consisting of two catalytic subunits (&#x003b1; or &#x003b1;&#x02032;) and two regulatory &#x003b2; subunits can be found as &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>, &#x003b1;&#x003b1;&#x02032;&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>, or &#x003b1;&#x02032;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> combinations in the tetrameric holoenzyme. The substrate specificity of CK2 &#x003b1; is dramatically changed by its association with CK2 &#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c35">35</xref>). DNA sequence analysis of CK2 subunits from yeast to humans has revealed strong conservation of both subunits, making it one of the most evolutionarily conserved protein kinases. The CK2 &#x003b2; subunit amino acid sequence is identical between mammals and birds with <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> differing by a single conservative substitution [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c36">36</xref>)]. Deletion of either catalytic subunit is lethal in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c37">37</xref>) and functional studies have shown that CK2 &#x003b1; from the human or <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> can substitute for the <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> catalytic subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c38">38</xref>). CK2 is known to phosphorylate more than 300 proteins and is involved in signal transduction, transcriptional control, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation and cancer [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c33">33</xref>)]. Many viral proteins are substrates for CK2 [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c39">39</xref>)] including the HSV-1 structural proteins VP22 and VP16. HSV-1 infection stimulated CK2 activity at early times, an effect that required expression of ICP27 protein and was not shown by viral mutants with defects in ICP27 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c40">40</xref>). Although CK2 has been considered to be constitutively active, stimulation of its activity has been reported by stress signalling agents and heat shock while other agents inhibit its activity [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c41">41</xref>)].</p><p>Modern herpesviruses replicate in a variety of different cell types and tissues, and their genomes exhibit wide variation in organization, which could be of functional significance in gene expression. In contrast to the majority of unspliced HSV-1 genes, although transcript mapping is not yet complete, the KSHV genome contains several spliced genes [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c42">42</xref>)], including the ORF57 gene itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c22">22</xref>). The ORF57 herpesvirus counterparts may have shared and separate features, e.g. EBV MTA protein only partially complemented ICP27 when inserted into an ICP27-null virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c43">43</xref>). Comparing ORF57 with its different herpesvirus counterparts will identify common functions, and may reveal differences related to virus specialization and speciation. Thus, it was important to determine if the &#x003b3;-herpesvirus KSHV ORF57 interacted with hnRNP K and CK2, earlier shown to bind the &#x003b1;-1 herpesvirus HSV-1 ICP27, and, if so, any functional consequences of these interactions.</p><p>Here, we show that ORF57 and hnRNP K proteins interact using pull down assays and both co-immunoprecipitate from extracts of KSHV positive TPA-treated BCBL-1 cells. In TPA-treated cells, ORF57 was present in a complex with hnRNP K containing CK2 activity and was phosphorylated by CK2. ORF57 protein directly interacted with catalytic &#x003b1;&#x0002f;&#x003b1;&#x02032; and regulatory &#x003b2; subunits of cellular protein kinase CK2. A CK2 inhibitor reduced <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> phosphorylation of ORF57 protein. Modification by CK2 enhanced ORF57 interaction with its hnRNP K partner, indicating that CK2 activity regulates the presence and activities of components within the ORF57 complex.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Recombinant plasmids</title><p>The plasmid expressing an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein of ORF57 amino acids 181&#x02013;455 termed pGST-ORF57 small (gift from Dr L.

In both TPA-treated and untreated BCBL-1 cell extracts, hnRNP K was phosphorylated but this was considerably reduced by DRB only in TPA-treated cells. Taken together with the observation that CK2 activity was associated with hnRNP K only in the presence of ORF57 in the peptide substrate assay, this indicates a requirement of ORF57 for CK2 phosphorylation of hnRNP K. In the presence of DRB <italic>in vivo</italic> at low concentrations specific for inhibiting CK2 phosphorylation, the amount of ORF57 present in a complex with hnRNP K showed a consistent 2- to 3-fold lowering. CK2 phosphorylation therefore serves to recruit ORF57 into a complex with hnRNP K. Phosphorylation by CK2 may regulate the presence and activities of ORF57 and&#x0002f;or hnRNP K, and perhaps other components in the ORF57 complex at various times during KSHV lytic gene expression. In different infected host cells, such as in B-cells or endothelial cells, and during the different phases of lytic KSHV replication, CK2 phosphorylation could alter the subcellular locations of hnRNP K isoforms, sequestering them to active or inactive sites. During the cell cycle, inhibiting CK2 phosphorylation of human chromatin protein DEK with 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazole changed its DNA binding properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c58">58</xref>). ORF57 may act to subvert the multifunctional activities of hnRNP K, re-directing them for use in viral rather than cellular gene expression or, alternatively, prevent hnRNP K from accessing common pathways thereby inhibiting competition for cellular components used by both proteins.</p><p>ORF57 protein can regulate gene expression at the transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c20">20</xref>). We have shown that ORF57 associates with the ORF50 promoter and with ORF50 protein to co-operatively activate expression from this promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c19">19</xref>). ORF50 protein expression is sufficient to induce lytic replication in latently infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c18">18</xref>), and this protein also is extensively phosphorylated <italic>in vivo</italic> and contains several serine&#x0002f;threonine-rich consensus phosphorylation sites for protein kinase CK2 and protein kinase C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c8">8</xref>). CK2 phosphorylation of both ORF57 and ORF50 proteins could play an important role in the augmentation of ORF50 activity by ORF57 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c19">19</xref>), facilitating the cascade of lytic KSHV gene expression and thereby breaking latency. ORF57 protein shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c22">22</xref>), and also regulates gene expression post-transcriptionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c21">21</xref>), promoting the nuclear export of an intron-less reporter RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c23">23</xref>). Nuclear import of Simian virus 40 large T antigen is enhanced by CK2 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c78">78</xref>). Similarly, CK2 phosphorylation may regulate ORF57 protein transport and&#x0002f;or transport of hnRNP K with a viral RNA cargo. HnRNP K has a binding preference for poly (C) [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh876c28">28</xref>)], can shuttle from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and might export viral RNAs via an ORF57&#x02013;RNA complex piggybacking on hnRNP K to the cytoplasm. Or, the ORF57 interaction might prevent hnRNP K from shuttling, permitting ORF57 to access a nuclear export or import route normally used by hnRNP K.</p><p>The &#x003b3;-2 herpesvirus KSHV (genus, <italic>Rhadinovirus</italic>) ORF57 protein and the &#x003b1;-1 herpesvirus HSV-1 (genus, <italic>Simplexvirus</italic>) ICP27 protein both interact with hnRNP K and are phosphorylated by CK2. Thus, the functional adaptation of the ancestral herpesvirus ORF57 regulatory protein and its counterparts to interact with the hnRNP K and CK2 ancestral proteins is likely to have preceded divergence of these <italic>Herpesviridae</italic> genera.
