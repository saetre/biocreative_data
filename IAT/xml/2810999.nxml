The Vif-induced degradation of these restriction factors by the proteasome has been extensively studied, but little is known about the translational repression of hA3G and hA3F by Vif, which has also been proposed to participate in Vif function. Here, we studied Vif binding to hA3G mRNA and its role in translational repression. Filter binding assays and fluorescence titration curves revealed that Vif tightly binds to hA3G mRNA. Vif overall binding affinity was higher for the 3&#x02032;UTR than for the 5&#x02032;UTR, even though this region contained at least one high affinity Vif binding site (apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 27 &#x000b1; 6 nM). Several Vif binding sites were identified in 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032;UTRs using RNase footprinting. <italic>In vitro</italic> translation evidenced that Vif inhibited hA3G translation by two mechanisms: a main time-independent process requiring the 5&#x02032;UTR and an additional time-dependent, UTR-independent process. Results using a Vif protein mutated in the multimerization domain suggested that the molecular mechanism of translational control is more complicated than a simple physical blockage of scanning ribosomes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) infects primary T-cells, macrophages and monocytes, ultimately leading to the destruction of the immune system, infection by opportunistic pathogens, and death, if its replication cannot be inhibited. However, these cell lineages possess an innate defense system directed against retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements and HIV-1 had to develop a countermeasure against this protective system in order to be able to infect them. Primary T-cells, macrophages and monocytes, as well as some lymphocyte-derived cell lines, collectively named non-permissive cells, express two related cytosine deaminases, APOBEC3G (hA3G) and APOBEC3F (hA3F) that restrict HIV-1 replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). However, these antiviral factors are counteracted by the HIV-1 viral infectivity factor (Vif), a basic 23 kDa protein required for HIV-1 propagation <italic>in vivo</italic> and pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4 B5">1&#x02013;5</xref>).</p><p>The N- and C-terminal domains of hA3G and hA3F possess significant similarity to APOBEC1, the catalytic subunit of the mammalian apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme. The APOBEC family includes the cellular cytidine deaminases APOBEC1, APOBEC2, APOBEC3, APOBEC4 and the activation-induced deaminase (AID). In humans, there are seven <italic>apobec3</italic> genes coding for hA3A, hA3B, hA3C, hA3DE, hA3F, hA3G and hA3H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5 B6">3&#x02013;6</xref>). Among these proteins, hA3G has the most potent anti-HIV-1 activity, while the activity of hA3F is weaker but significant, and the anti-HIV-1 activity of hA3DE is very weak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Other APOBEC3 members display potent activities against various viruses and retroelements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). In the absence of Vif (i.e. in HIV-1 &#x00394;<italic>vif</italic>), hA3G and hA3F are incorporated into HIV-1 and they catalyze cytosine deamination during (&#x02212;) strand DNA synthesis, ultimately resulting in (i) degradation of the viral DNA and/or (ii) lethal hypermutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9 B10 B11 B12">7&#x02013;12</xref>). Notably, accumulating evidence shows that catalytically inactive hA3G and hA3F mutants also significantly inhibit HIV-1 DNA synthesis and replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5">3&#x02013;5</xref>), and some of the antiviral effects of these proteins might not require packaging into the viral particles.</p><p>HIV-1 Vif decreases the intracellular concentration of hA3G and hA3F and prevents their incorporation into HIV-1 particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9">7&#x02013;9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13 B14 B15 B16">13&#x02013;16</xref>). HIV-1 Vif suppresses hA3G and hA3F antiviral functions by hijacking a cellular E3 ubiquitin ligase and inducing their degradation by the 26S proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12">10&#x02013;12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16 B17 B18">16&#x02013;18</xref>). Even though the Vif induced-degradation of hA3G by the 26S proteasome has been extensively studied, it is not the only mechanism, and possibly not the main mechanism, by which Vif counteracts hA3G and hA3F. Indeed, Vif has been shown to be able to inhibit packaging and antiviral activity of a degradation resistant hA3G variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). In one of the first publications in the field, Landau and coworkers reported a 4.6-fold reduction of hAG3 synthesis in the presence of Vif and concluded that Vif-induced degradation of hA3G does not appear to be the primary mechanism by which it blocked hA3G encapsidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). It is possible that the Vif-induced, proteasome-dependent, degradation of Vif was underestimated in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), but the effect of Vif on hA3G synthesis was confirmed by several independent groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). The mechanism by which Vif downregulates hA3G translation has never been studied.</p><p>Recently, we showed that Vif binds the 5&#x02032;-region of the HIV-1 genomic RNA with high affinity and moderate cooperativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), and that Vif has an RNA chaperone activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). In addition, mutations reducing the affinity of Vif for RNA have been shown to diminish viral replication in non-permissive cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), suggesting that RNA binding plays a central role in Vif function. We therefore studied binding of HIV-1 Vif to hA3G mRNA by biochemical and biophysical methods. As the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032;UTRs of mRNAs are often involved in negative translational control by proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), we compared Vif binding to the full-length mRNA and RNA fragments corresponding to the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032;UTRs and to the hA3G coding region. Our results showed that wild-type Vif has a high affinity for the hA3G mRNA, and especially for its 3&#x02032; UTR. Using chemical and enzymatic footprinting, we identified several Vif binding sites not only in the 3&#x02032;UTR, but also in the 5&#x02032;UTR of hA3G mRNA. Finally, we compared the effect of Vif on the <italic>in vitro</italic> translation of full-length hA3G mRNA and mRNAs lacking the 5&#x02032; or/and 3&#x02032;UTR(s) regions. Vif had two negative effects on hA3G translation: a time-dependent, UTR-independent effect and a more important time-independent effect that required the 5&#x02032;UTR. Our results suggest that Vif binding to hA3G mRNA, and particularly to its 5&#x02032;UTR might be crucial for Vif function, by downregulating hA3G translation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>The DNA sequence corresponding to hA3G was obtained after polyA<sup>+</sup> mRNA isolation from H9 cells (PolyATtract&#x000ae; mRNA Isolation Systems&#x02014;Promega) and RT&#x02013;PCR analysis (Superscript&#x000ae;&#x02014;Invitrogen) using a sense primer corresponding to the major transcription site defined by Muckenfuss <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) and an antisense primer corresponding to the 3&#x02032;-end of the 3&#x02032;UTR (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).

Thus, even though the PPLP motif is important for Vif multimerization, its mutation does not completely abolish Vif self-association.</p></sec><sec><title>Filter binding assays</title><p>In order to detect and analyze binding of wild type (WT) HIV-1 Vif to hA3G mRNA, we first performed filter binding assays using either full-length hA3G mRNA, mRNAs deleted of the 5&#x02032; or the 3&#x02032;UTR or RNA fragments corresponding to the 5&#x02032;UTR, the hA3G coding region or the 3&#x02032;UTR, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). All binding curves displayed a sigmoid shape suggesting that binding of Vif to the hA3G mRNA and the fragments thereof is cooperative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). The experimental data were adequately fitted with the Hill equation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A), and the apparent dissociation constants (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) and the Hill constant (&#x003b1;<sub>H</sub>), which reflect cooperativity, extracted from this analysis are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>. No cooperativity corresponds to &#x003b1;<sub>H</sub> = 1, while &#x003b1;<sub>H</sub> &#x0003e; 1 indicates positive cooperativity. In addition, &#x003b1;<sub>H</sub> gives a lower limit of the number of Vif binding sites on RNA. For this analysis and all other quantitative analyses in the next sections, the Vif concentrations were expressed as concentrations of Vif monomers, even though characterization of wild-type and AALA Vif proteins indicated that they are oligomeric (see above). Indeed, as we do not know how many RNA binding sites are present per Vif oligomer, it would be very speculative to use more complex models. All dissociation constants must therefore be considered as apparent dissociation constants, which are nevertheless very useful to compare Vif binding to different RNA species. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of the RNA and Vif proteins used in this study.

However, Vif displayed a higher affinity for the 3&#x02032;UTR of hA3G mRNA, while binding to the coding region was slightly weaker than to the 5&#x02032;UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). These experiments suggested that the 3&#x02032;UTR of hA3G mRNA contains at least one high affinity Vif binding site. In keeping with this interpretation, WT Vif binds tighter to hA3G and hA3G-&#x00394;5&#x02032;UTR RNAs, which contain the 3&#x02032;UTR, than to hA3G-&#x00394;3&#x02032;UTR (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). WT Vif appeared to bind all RNA fragments with moderate cooperativity.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Vif bound hA3G and hA3G-&#x00394;5&#x02032;UTR RNAs weaker than hA3G-3&#x02032;UTR RNA, even though these three RNAs contain the same high affinity Vif binding site(s). This result revealed that the assumption that all RNA&#x02013;protein complexes are retained with the same efficiency on the cellulose membrane was not fulfilled. Instead, retention of the RNA&#x02013;Vif complexes on the filter probably increased as an increasing number of proteins bound to the same RNA molecule. Even though a theoretical framework has been developed to determine the retention efficiency of RNA&#x02013;protein complexes in filter binding experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), it could not be applied to our experiments, which involved an unkown number of RNA&#x02013;protein complexes with different retention efficiencies. Thus, the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> do not correspond to the binding dissociation constant of Vif from the highest affinity binding site present in each RNA fragment, but correspond to a weighted average of the binding dissociation constants of all binding sites present on each RNA.</p><p>As Vif multimerization is required to counteract the antiviral activity of hA3G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33 B34 B35">33&#x02013;35</xref>), and as it would also help to explain the cooperative binding of this protein to hA3G mRNA, we mutated the Vif multimerization domain, which has been mapped to the 161PPLP164 motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Detailed characterization of the WT and mutant Vif proteins will be described elsewhere (S. Bernacchi <italic>et al.</italic>, manuscript in preparation). Interestingly, we observed that mutation of the PPLP motif did decrease the oligomerization of Vif but did not totally prevent it, as Vif AALA behaved as dimers or/and trimers (see above and S. Bernacchi <italic>et al.</italic>, manuscript in preparation). As compared to WT Vif, the mutant Vif AALA protein displayed very little preference for any of the RNA fragments we tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). While the mutant Vif had a slightly stronger affinity for the isolated 3&#x02032;UTR than for the 5&#x02032;UTR, it also displayed a slightly better affinity for the hA3G-&#x00394;3&#x02032;UTR RNA than for the hA3G-&#x00394;5&#x02032;UTR. Thus, it seems that the mutant Vif did not display any global preference for one of the UTR or for the coding region of the hA3G mRNA. However the PPLP motif was not required for cooperative binding, since &#x003b1;<sub>H</sub> values were consistently higher for Vif AALA than for WT Vif (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Fluorescence spectroscopy</title><p>In order to reinforce the conclusions drawn from the filter binding experiments, we studied Vif binding to the hA3G mRNA by fluorescence spectroscopy. HIV-1 Vif protein contains eight Trp residues, including seven that are located in the N-terminal region of Vif, which corresponds to the RNA binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Thus, Vif displays a high intrinsic fluorescence that is quenched upon binding to nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). While increasing amounts of protein were used to titrate a negligible amount of RNA in the filter binding assays, a constant and non negligible amount (50 or 100 nM) of protein was titrated with increasing amount of nucleic acids in the fluorescence experiments. Thus, the same formalism could not be used to analyze the two kinds of binding curves, and we analyzed the fluorescence binding curves using the McGhee and von Hippel model for cooperative binding (see &#x02018;Materials and Methods&#x02019; section).</p><p>Compared to the filter binding assays, fluorescence titrations consistently yielded lower <italic>K</italic><sub>obs</sub> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>), as expected if several Vif proteins have to bind to a same RNA molecule to obtain complete retention of the complexes on the filters. Alternatively, this difference might also indicate that some Vif&#x02013;RNA complexes dissociate during washing of the filters. However, both techniques indicated that WT Vif bound all RNA fragments with moderate cooperativity. Fluorescence titration curves revealed that WT Vif had a high affinity for hA3G-3&#x02032;UTR RNA, in agreement with filter binding assays, but also for hA3G-&#x00394;UTR RNA, a feature not observed in the previous experiments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). As a result, Vif also demonstrated a high affinity for all RNA fragments containing either the 3&#x02032;UTR or the coding region of hA3G mRNA. Note that as binding cooperativity is not extremely high, the <italic>K</italic><sub>obs</sub> values derived from the fluorescence titrations are mean values of all binding events quenching the Vif fluorescence, whereas, as previously pointed out, the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values derived from the filter binding assay are affected by the differential retention of the Vif&#x02013;RNA complexes on the filters. Thus, differences in the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>obs</sub> values obtained by these two techniques are not completely unexpected. <table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3.</label><caption><p>Binding parameters derived from analysis of the fluorescence titration curves using the model of McGhee and von Hippel</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">RNA</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>K</italic><sub>obs</sub> (nM)<sup>a</sup></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x003c9;<sup>a</sup></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stoichiometry<sup>c</sup></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">RNA length (nt)</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left"><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">hA3G</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">36 &#x000b1; 6<sup>b</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">108</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0223c;6&#x02013;7 vif/RNA</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1773</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">hA3G-&#x00394;5&#x02032;UTR</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">42 &#x000b1; 5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">78</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0223c;2&#x02013;4 vif/RNA</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1476</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">hA3G-&#x00394;3&#x02032;UTR</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">40 &#x000b1; 2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">109</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0223c;2&#x02013;3 vif/RNA</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1452</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">hA3G-&#x00394;UTR</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">46 &#x000b1; 7</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">76</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0223c;2&#x02013;3 vif/RNA</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1155</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">hA3G-5&#x02032;UTR</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">120 &#x000b1; 16</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">254</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0223c;3&#x02013;4 vif/RNA</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">297</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">hA3G-3&#x02032;UTR</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">49 &#x000b1; 11</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">125</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0223c;3&#x02013;4 vif/RNA</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">321</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="TF3"><p><sup>a</sup><italic>K</italic><sub>obs</sub> and &#x003c9; values were obtained by fitting the experimental data to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="M3">equation 3</xref> (see &#x02018;Materials and Methods&#x02019; section).</p></fn><fn id="TF4"><p><sup>b</sup>Mean &#x000b1; SD of at least three experiments.</p></fn><fn id="TF5"><p><sup>c</sup>The binding stoichiometry was determined graphically from the fluorescence binding curves (see text).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>The fluorescence binding curves also allowed determination of the binding stoichiometry of Vif to the various RNA fragments from the intersection of the initial slope with the fluorescence plateau (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref> and data not shown) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).

Indeed, this low stoichiometry indicates that there are several RNA binding sites per wild-type Vif oligomer (corresponding to &#x0223c;9 Vif monomers).

This analysis is justified because these RNAs bound only a few Vif molecules (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). When plotting the fraction of the bound to unbound protein as a function of the fraction of bound protein, the fluorescence binding data was linear over a wide range of RNA concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A), indicating that these data can indeed be used to determine the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of Vif for the highest affinity binding site present in each RNA (<italic>K</italic><sub>Sca</sub>).

Indeed, the affinity of Vif AALA for the highest affinity binding sites present in hA3G-5&#x02032;UTR, hA3G-3&#x02032;UTR and hA3G-&#x00394;UTR RNAs was not decreased.

Nevertheless, the important point is that although mutation of the PPLP motif decreases the overall affinity of Vif for hA3G mRNA and fragments thereof, it does not reduce the affinity for the highest affinity binding sites present in hA3G-5&#x02032;UTR, hA3G-3&#x02032;UTR and hA3G-&#x00394;UTR RNAs. <table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>Table 4.</label><caption><p>Determination of the apparent dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>Sca</sub>) of the highest affinity Vif binding site using the Scatchard equation</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">RNA</th><th colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1"><italic>K</italic><sub>Sca</sub> (nM)<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="TF3"><sup>a</sup></xref><hr/></th></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">WT Vif</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Vif AALA</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left"><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">hA3G-5&#x02032;UTR</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">27 &#x000b1; 6<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="TF4"><sup>b</sup></xref></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">9 &#x000b1; 2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">hA3G-3&#x02032;UTR</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">24 &#x000b1; 5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">11 &#x000b1; 1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">hA3G-&#x00394;UTR</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">37 &#x000b1; 4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">20 &#x000b1; 6</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="TF6"><p><sup>a</sup><italic>K</italic><sub>Sca</sub> values were obtained by fitting the experimental data to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="M4">Equation 4</xref> (see &#x02018;Materials and Methods&#x02019; section).</p></fn><fn id="TF7"><p><sup>b</sup>Mean &#x000b1; SD of at least three experiments.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec><sec><title>RNA probing and footprinting of Vif</title><p>To further investigate Vif binding to hA3G mRNA and its possible role in regulating hA3G translation, we next used chemical and enzymatic probing to determine the secondary structure of this mRNA and enzymatic footprinting to identify Vif binding sites.

Agarose gel electrophoresis performed at 4&#x000b0;C revealed no complex, strongly suggesting that no long range interaction takes place between the 5&#x02032;UTR, the coding region, and the 3&#x02032;UTR of the hA3G mRNA (data not shown) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>).

Most nucleotides in the 5&#x02032;-J12 and 5&#x02032;-J23 junctions were slightly to highly reactive towards chemical and 5&#x02032;-J23 was also cleaved by RNase A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A and D). The structure of the structured domains (5&#x02032;-D1 to 5&#x02032;-D3) was also unambiguous. Most nucleotides in the stems were not reactive, except some moderate reactivity close to some helix ends. In addition, the existence of several stems in 5&#x02032;-D1 and 5&#x02032;-D3 was confirmed by RNase V1 cuts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B&#x02013;D). On the other hand, as expected, most nucleotides that are single-stranded in our model were strongly modified by chemicals or/and cut by RNases A and T1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A and D). The only ambiguous region in the 5&#x02032;-UTR of hA3G mRNA is the 5&#x02032;-strand of the upper internal loop of 5&#x02032;-D1 (52&#x02013;55 nt). This loop was simultaneously cleaved by RNases A and V1, while theses nucleotides were reactive to CMCT and DMS, suggesting that these nucleotides are unpaired but stacked.</p><p>The RNAse V1 cleavages in this region increased upon addition of increasing Vif concentration, except at the highest Vif concentration (3 &#x000b5;M) at which they almost completely disappear. It is plausible that Vif binds first to the adjacent unstable stem (46&#x02013;50 nt), increasing stacking of the internal loop, then binds to the loop itself at 3 &#x000b5;M Vif. However, this internal loop must be regarded as a weak Vif binding site, considering the Vif concentration at which protection was observed. No Vif footprint was detected in 5&#x02032;-D2, while several were detected in 5&#x02032;-D3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C and D). RNase V1 cleavages at nt 212&#x02013;218 were strongly inhibited at &#x02265;1 &#x000b5;M Vif, reflecting Vif binding to the lower helix of 5&#x02032;-D3. Similarly, RNAse V1 cleavages at 257&#x02013;262 nt and RNAse V1 and RNase A cleavages at 265&#x02013;267 nt were strongly protected at 2 &#x000b5;M Vif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C and D). These two regions may either represent a unique Vif binding site or two contiguous binding sites.</p></sec><sec><title>The 3&#x02032;UTR of hA3G mRNA</title><p>Chemical and enzymatic probing of the 3&#x02032;-UTR of hA3G mRNA revealed that it also consists in three independent structural domains separated by two single stranded junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Junction 3&#x02032;-J23 was highly reactive towards chemical probes, while most nucleotides in 3&#x02032;-J12 were only slightly reactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A and D). Indeed, the 3&#x02032;-J12 3&#x02032; half may form an unstable helix with the very 3&#x02032;-end of the 3&#x02032;UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D). The model structure of 3&#x02032;-D1 is well supported by experimental data: nucleotides involved in helices were not reactive towards chemicals, except at the end of some helices, and the existence of most helices was supported by RNase V1 cleavages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C and D). The proposed structure of domain 3&#x02032;-D2 is in good agreement with experimental data, except for a weak RNase A cut after nt U1621, which is located in the middle of a helix, as supported by the lack of reactivity of the neighboring nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, B and D). The short apical stem of 3&#x02032;-D2 consisting only of A&#x02013;U and G&#x02013;U base pairs is very unstable and might not exist at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A and D). The secondary structure of 3&#x02032;-D3 is in good agreement with the probing data, except for the lower stem of this domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D). Thus, this stem might not exist, or might adopt alternative conformations, as suggested by cleavage by both RNase A and RNase V1 between nucleotides 1643 and 1648 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B&#x02013;D).</p><p>Vif footprints were observed in the three structured domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B&#x02013;D). In 3&#x02032;-D1, Vif-induced protections were split in several short regions but without a detailed knowledge of its 3D structure, it is difficult to estimate how many Vif molecules bind to this flexible domain. In 3&#x02032;-D2, the two protected regions located in a continuous helical domain might be to far away to be produced by a single Vif protein. Similarly, it is unclear whether the protections observed in the 11 nt stretch encompassing the 3&#x02032;-end of 3&#x02032;-J23 and the 5&#x02032;-region of 3&#x02032;-D3 correspond to a single or two contiguous Vif binding site(s). To note, inhibition of the RNAse V1 cleavages in this region was already observed at 0.3 &#x000b5;M Vif, while protections in the other domains required higher protein concentrations.</p></sec></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro</italic> translation</title><p>As Vif was found to bind with high affinity to hA3G mRNA, including to the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; UTRs which are often involved in translational regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), we studied the effects of WT Vif and Vif AALA on <italic>in vitro</italic> translation of full length and truncated versions of hA3G mRNA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1009/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Effect of Vif on the <italic>in vitro</italic> translation of hA3G.

Inhibition of translation from hA3G mRNA by WT Vif further increased at longer incubation times, and a &#x0223c;3-fold reduction of hA3G was observed at 45 min. Importantly, at 15 min, WT Vif did not significantly reduce hA3G synthesis from hA3G-&#x00394;UTR RNA, indicating that the UTRs of hA3G mRNA play a crucial role in the translational repression mediated by WT Vif (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1009/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1B</ext-link> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). Further analysis showed that translation from hA3G-&#x00394;3&#x02032;UTR RNA was repressed at the same level as the full-length hA3G mRNA, whereas hA3G-&#x00394;5&#x02032;UTR RNA behaved as hA3G-&#x00394;UTR RNA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1009/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1B&#x02013;D</ext-link> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). These results demonstrated that the 5&#x02032;UTR was necessary and sufficient to allow Vif-mediated translational repression of hA3G. As the incubation time increased to 45 min, WT Vif gradually repressed hA3G synthesis from all RNAs, including hA3G-&#x00394;UTR and hA3G-&#x00394;5&#x02032;UTR RNAs. However the amount of hA3G synthesized from these RNAs was always twice that obtained from full-length and hA3G-&#x00394;3&#x02032;UTR RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). To further ensure that the Vif-mediated translational repression of hA3G was specific, we checked that WT-Vif had not effect on translation of luciferase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1009/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1E</ext-link>). In addition, adding MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate did not affect the results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C), indicating that we were really looking at differences in protein synthesis, and not at protein degradation.</p><p>Finally, we tested whether the Vif multimerization domain played a role in the inhibition of translation. Indeed, the results we obtained with Vif AALA were almost identical to (and do not show any statistically significant difference with) those obtained with WT Vif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). They demonstrated that the Vif multimerization domain is not required for Vif-mediated repression of hA3G translation, and confirmed the role of the 5&#x02032;UTR of hA3G mRNA in this process.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this work, we first analyzed Vif binding to hA3G mRNA using filter binding and fluorescence assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Tables 2</xref> to <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). Even though both techniques gave rather divergent dissociation constant values (120 and 36 nM, respectively, which will be discussed below) they allow to conclude that Vif binds strongly to hA3G mRNA, especially as we used buffers containing high concentrations of monovalent and divalent cations to reduce unspecific electrostatic interactions. We previously showed that Vif binds with high affinity and moderate cooperativity to the 5&#x02032;-region of HIV-1 genomic RNA, while it binds very weakly or does not bind at all to the central and 3&#x02032;-regions of this RNA, to <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNAs and 5S RNA, and to the 3&#x02032;-region of <italic>Drosophila melangaster bicoid</italic> mRNA, indicating that Vif is not an unspecific RNA binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Indeed, the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> (from filter binding assays) and <italic>K</italic><sub>obs</sub> (from fluorescence titration curves) values we determined here for Vif binding to hA3G mRNA compare favorably with the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> (45&#x02013;79 nM) and <italic>K</italic><sub>obs</sub> (42&#x02013;70 nM) values for Vif binding to 500 nt long RNA fragments derived from the HIV-1 genomic RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>There are however two noticeable differences between Vif binding to HIV-1 genomic RNA and to hA3G mRNA. First, with the latter RNA, we obtained rather divergent <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>obs</sub> values (compare <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>), whereas <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>obs</sub> values were very close with the former RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Second, the binding density of Vif to the hA3G mRNA fragments [one Vif molecule per &#x02265;100 nt in the UTRs, and per &#x02265;400 nt in the hA3G coding region (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>)] was much lower than the one we observed with the HIV-1 RNA fragments [one Vif molecule per &#x0223c;10 nt for RNA fragments derived from the 5&#x02032;-region of HIV-1 genomic RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>)]. This lower binding density to hA3G mRNA was confirmed by our RNase footprinting experiments, which showed much more limited protections upon Vif binding to 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032;UTRs of hA3G mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), than to the 5&#x02032;-region of HIV-1 genomic RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, this low binding density might explain the divergences between <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>obs</sub> values observed with hA3G mRNA fragments. As explained in the &#x02018;Results&#x02019; section, our filter binding data imply that not all complexes formed between Vif and hA3G mRNA fragments were retained with the same efficiency on the cellulose filters. Indeed, retention of the Vif/RNA complexes probably increased with the Vif binding density up to a threshold value above which retention was complete. If the Vif binding density is high, as for the HIV-1 genomic RNA fragments, most Vif&#x02013;RNA complexes are completely retained on the filters. However, if the binding density is low, a bias is introduced in the filter binding experiments that artificially increases the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>. If our assumption is correct the differences in the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>obs</sub> values should be smaller for the shorter RNAs, which have the higher Vif binding density (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>), than for the longer ones. This hypothesis is indeed verified, since the two techniques yielded very similar <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>obs</sub> values for the short hA3G-5&#x02032;UTR and hA3G-3&#x02032;UTR RNAs, while divergent values were obtained for the longer RNAs. To summarize, (i) both techniques demonstrated that Vif has a stronger affinity for the 3&#x02032;UTR than for the 5&#x02032;UTR of hA3G mRNA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3) and (ii</xref>) for longer RNAs, <italic>K</italic><sub>obs</sub> derived from fluorescence titrations are more reliable than <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values derived from filter binding assays. Interestingly, the fluorescence data showed that Vif has also a high affinity for the hA3G coding region (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>However, the <italic>K</italic><sub>obs</sub> values extracted from the fluorescence titration curves using the McGhee and von Hippel model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) are also mean values of the individual Vif binding sites. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, it was also possible to analyze these data using the Scatchard equation in order to extract the <italic>K</italic><sub>Sca</sub> value for the binding site having the highest affinity for Vif in hA3G-5&#x02032;UTR, hA3G-3&#x02032;UTR and hA3G-&#x00394;UTR. This analysis revealed that the highest affinity Vif binding sites present in the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032;UTRs of hA3G mRNA bind Vif with similar affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>Sca</sub> = 27 &#x000b1; 6 and 24 &#x000b1; 5 nM, respectively), even though the overall binding of Vif to the 5&#x02032;UTR is significantly weaker than to the 3&#x02032;UTR (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Thus, the secondary Vif binding sites located in the 5&#x02032;UTR must have considerably weaker affinity for this protein than those located in the 3&#x02032;UTR of hA3G mRNA. In contrast, the <italic>K</italic><sub>Sca</sub> of the highest affinity Vif binding site in hA3G-&#x00394;UTR (<italic>K</italic><sub>Sca</sub> = 37 &#x000b1; 4 nM), is identical, within experimental errors to <italic>K</italic><sub>obs</sub> (46 &#x000b1; 7 nM), indicating that all binding sites present in the coding region of hA3G mRNA have a similar affinity for Vif.</p><p>We showed that mutation of the Vif multimerization motif reduced the Vif oligomerization state but did totally abolished it, suggesting that an additional region is involved in Vif multimerization. Interestingly, this mutation decreased the overall affinity of the Vif AALA protein for hA3G mRNA, but it did not decrease its affinity for the RNA sites with the highest affinity for Vif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>RNase footprinting revealed 3 to 4 Vif binding sites in the 5&#x02032;UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) and 3 to 6 Vif binding sites in the 3&#x02032;UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), in agreement with the fluorescence data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). In addition, while most protections in the 3&#x02032;UTR were obvious at 1.5 &#x000b5;M Vif, only one Vif-binding site, located in the lower stem of domain 5&#x02032;-D3, was clearly detected at 1 &#x000b5;M Vif. This observation is in keeping with the overall higher affinity of Vif for the 3&#x02032;UTR of hA3G mRNA, even though the protein concentrations required to observe a footprint could not be directly compared to those used in titration experiments.</p><p>In the last part of this study, we analyzed the effect of Vif on the <italic>in vitro</italic> translation of hA3G from full-length hA3G mRNA and mRNAs devoid of the 5&#x02032;UTR or/and the 3&#x02032;UTR. Vif induced a 2-fold reduction of translation that was strictly dependent on the 5&#x02032;UTR, while the 3&#x02032;UTR had no influence on translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6</xref> and S1). Hence, there is no correlation between the relative binding affinity of Vif for the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032;UTRs and their role in Vif-mediated translational repression. The same conclusion holds true when comparing WT Vif and Vif AALA: mutation of the Vif multimerization domain reduced the overall affinity and specificity of Vif binding to hA3G mRNA fragments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>), but it didn&#x02019;t significantly affect translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). The fact that wild-type Vif and Vif AALA have similar affinities for the highest affinity Vif binding site located in the 5&#x02032;UTR of hA3G RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>), may explain why they have similar effects on hA3G mRNA translation. These results suggest that Vif does not simply physically prevent scanning of the ribosomes through the 5&#x02032;UTR of hA3G mRNA, but raise the possibility of a specific mechanism of Vif-mediated translational repression. Mutation of the individual Vif binding sites we identified in the 5&#x02032;UTR of hA3G mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) should prove very useful in order to decipher this mechanism. Numerous examples in the literature showed that both the 5&#x02032; and the 3&#x02032;UTRs can be involved in translational regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). However, despite Vif binding to both UTRs of hA3G mRNA, our data clearly show that the 3&#x02032;UTR is dispensable for the translational regulation by Vif. Otherwise, several lines of evidence indicated that mRNAs &#x02018;circularize&#x02019; during translation, and this phenomenon is also involved in some translational control mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). The experiments we performed in the present study do not allow to rule out this possibility, as our hA3G-&#x00394;3&#x02032;UTR expression construct, although lacking the authentic 3&#x02032;-UTR of the hA3G mRNA, contains the 3&#x02032;-UTR present in the expression vector.</p><p>The 5&#x02032;UTR-dependent translational repression of hA3G by Vif was observed at all incubation times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). In addition, a general repression of hA3G synthesis by Vif was gradually observed at increasing incubation times, irrespective of the mRNA used for its synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). This phenomenon ultimately resulted in a 30&#x02013;40% reduction in hA3G synthesis. Several groups previously reported a negative impact of Vif on hA3G translation. Pulse-chase experiments in cells transfected with a tagged hA3G indicated a 30&#x02013;78% decrease in hA3G synthesis in the presence of Vif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>), while Vif impaired hA3G translation by 70&#x02013;75% in an <italic>in vitro</italic>-coupled transcription/translation system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Importantly, none of these studies used expression vectors with the authentic 5&#x02032;UTR of hA3G mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Thus, these authors very likely only observed the time-dependent, UTR-independent secondary effect, while they missed the main 5&#x02032;UTR-dependent, time-independent effect. Even though we cannot dismiss that possibility, we think it is unlikely that the time-dependent inhibition of translation is due to Vif aggregation, because (i) in all these experiments (including ours) Vif was directly synthesized in the <italic>in vitro</italic> translation system and (ii) one would expect a decrease of Vif activity upon aggregation (i.e. aggregation of Vif would likely decrease inhibition of translation over time).</p><p>Since the seminal publication by Sheehy <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>), it has become increasingly clear that the function of Vif is to counteract the restriction factors hA3G and hA3F. Even though several mechanisms have been proposed for Vif function, the proteasome-mediated, Vif-induced degradation of these factors has been by far the most studied. In agreement with previous studies suggesting that the RNA binding properties of Vif are essential for its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), our present work indicates that Vif binding to hA3G mRNA, and particularly to its 5&#x02032;UTR might be crucial for Vif function, by downregulating hA3G translation. Even though other authors already reported a negative effect of Vif on hA3G translational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>), our present work suggest that these authors missed most of the effect by working with expression vectors lacking the authentic 5&#x02032;UTR of hA3G mRNA, which had not been identified at that time. We are presently performing experiments to confirm that Vif binding to the 5&#x02032;UTR of hA3G mRNA inhibits hA3G synthesis in cells, and to evaluate the contribution of this effect to HIV-1 replication in the presence of hA3G expression (G.
