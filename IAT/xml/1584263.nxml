These studies have led to its proposed use for regional saturation mutagenesis by taking a forward-genetic approach. Thus, we used the SB system to mutate a region of mouse Chromosome 11 in a forward-genetic screen for recessive lethal and viable phenotypes. This work represents the first reported use of an insertional mutagen in a phenotype-driven approach. The phenotype-driven approach was successful in both recovering visible and behavioral mutants, including dominant limb and recessive behavioral phenotypes, and allowing for the rapid identification of candidate gene disruptions. In addition, a high frequency of recessive lethal mutations arose as a result of genomic rearrangements near the site of transposition, resulting from transposon mobilization. The results suggest that the SB system could be used in a forward-genetic approach to recover interesting phenotypes, but that local chromosomal rearrangements should be anticipated in conjunction with single-copy, local transposon insertions in chromosomes. Additionally, these mice may serve as a model for chromosome rearrangements caused by transposable elements during the evolution of vertebrate genomes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Perhaps the greatest challenge for biomedical research in the post-genomics era will be to assign functions to the human set of ~25,000 genes. The classical method for discovering the gene function is mutation. Thus, technologies that can mutate genes in mammalian genetic models like the mouse are under development in hopes of creating an efficient method to complete this task. One such technology, the <italic>Sleeping Beauty</italic> (SB) transposon system, was developed for this purpose in 2001. This mobile DNA element is highly active in transgenic mice and has been shown to disrupt mouse genes efficiently. Geurts et al. describe a novel attempt to use the SB transposon in a forward-genetic screen using an insertional mutagen, the first attempt of its kind. They discovered that the process of transposon mobilization in mouse chromosomes can lead to dramatic effects on local genomic sequences. Indeed, transposons like SB can cause genomic rearrangements including deletions, inversions and translocations, involving tens of thousands to tens of millions of base pairs. This discovery has important implications for using transposable elements for mouse germline mutagenesis and, at the same time, may provide a model for studying genomic rearrangements that have helped shape vertebrate genomes during evolution.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Geurts AM, Collier LS, Geurts JL, Oseth LL, Bell ML, et al.

Previous studies indicate that the advantages of this cut-and-paste transposon system are four fold. First, because the element is active in vivo, breeding transgenic mice is all that is required to generate heritable mutations. Second, insertional mutations in genes can be identified and tracked through generations using simple PCR-based techniques because the transposon vector serves as a molecular tag. Third, SB transposons have a strong tendency to reinsert during transposition at loci closely linked to their donor site. It has been proposed that this tendency will allow one to develop screens to saturate regions of the mouse genome that are syntenous to human genomic regions known to harbor disease genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020156-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020156-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;.

The goal of the study presented here, rather, was to test whether the SB transposon system could be used as a mutagen for forward-genetic studies in the mouse germline.</p><p>Gene-dense regions, which share a high degree of linkage conservation with human chromosomal regions with disease genes, would be ideal for testing the SB system in this context. The Chromosome 11 region between the <italic>Trp53</italic> (69.3 Mb) and <italic>Wnt3</italic> (103.6 Mb) loci is very gene dense and is syntenous to a region of human Chromosome 17 known to harbor many disease genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020156-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;.

The 88 reported mutations, however, provide an opportunity to evaluate the results of a saturation mutagenesis screen using transposons in the same region of the genome and potentially to assign specific genes to similar phenotypes, because the transposon serves as a molecular tag for mutation.</p><p>Using a donor site of mutagenic transposon vectors on mouse Chromosome 11, near the 90-Mb position, we tested the SB transposon system in a three-generation, forward-genetic, regional mutagenesis screen for recessive-lethal and viable phenotypes.

Two control pedigrees, generated in the absence of the transposase strain, were randomly introduced into the screen and were found to be phenotypically normal.

The open field test, performed in the SHIRPA arena (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), identified a recessive hyperactivity phenotype as homozygous BG animals traveled through more squares when compared to their control siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020156-g003">Figure 3</xref>B).</p><p>Candidate gene insertions were identified in the mutagenized Chromosome 11 of pedigrees BM and BG. Heterozygous pedigree BM mice harbor an insertion (03A-0204, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020156-st001">Table S1</xref>) in a pioneer gene (UniProt/TrEMBL ID Q5SRA9). This gene is highly conserved throughout all major animal phyla, yet no clues as to its function have been reported in other model organisms. Homozygous pedigree BG animals display the hyperactive phenotype and harbor an insertion (03A-0355, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020156-st001">Table S1</xref>) in a member of a family of genes known to be expressed in the nervous system and that have been associated with neurological disorders. We are currently attempting to correlate these candidate single-gene disruptions on Chromosome 11 with phenotypes. However, subsequent analysis of the recessive prenatal lethal phenotypes led us to discover that other types of mutations were present on Chromosome 11 in these and other pedigrees, as is described below. Thus, it is possible that transposon insertions are not responsible for these viable phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Recessive Lethality as a Result of Transposon Mutagenesis of Chromosome 11</title><p>As mentioned above, 21 of the 38 pedigrees demonstrated recessive lethality, all of which were prenatal lethal (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020156-t001">Table 1</xref>). While we anticipated a high rate of recessive lethal phenotypes, this result was in stark contrast to the ENU study where out of 55 (recently updated to 59 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020156-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;) recessive lethal phenotypes isolated, only 30 were characterized as prenatal &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020156-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;.

SB transposition-induced lethal pedigrees harbored nearly twice as many potential gene disruptions per pedigree on average than non-lethal pedigrees (1.7 vs. 0.9) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020156-t001">Table 1</xref>). One possibility is that the germline mobilization rate is sufficiently high such that the screen would identify lethal mutations at this rate. We addressed this hypothesis by both analyzing candidate gene disruptions and complementation testing between lethal pedigrees.</p><p>Candidate gene insertions in lethal pedigrees were examined for their association with lethal phenotypes. Carriers were repeatedly outcrossed until recombinants were obtained separating pedigree M insertion 03A-0033, in the mouse carbonic anhydrase 10 gene <italic>(Car10),</italic> and pedigree V insertion 03A-0063, in the mouse myosin heavy chain 2 gene <italic>(Myh2)</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020156-st001">Table S1</xref>), from all other insertions and the donor site (unpublished data). Carriers of the isolated insertions were intercrossed to discover any associated recessive phenotypes. Homozygous carriers of either insertion were fertile, healthy mice, and displayed no visible or behavioral abnormalities in our assays, showing that the lethality in these pedigrees was not due to transposon insertions in these genes. These gene trap insertions were subsequently characterized to determine their effect on gene expression. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020156-g004">Figure 4</xref>A shows the RT-PCR analysis on tissues from wild type, carrier, and homozygous animals for each insertion.

Pedigrees Z and BL, therefore, have mutations that overlap with both major complementation groups, while AS likely has more than one lethal mutation since it fails to complement group I pedigrees and, separately, pedigree AX. Pedigrees AG and BC have unique lethality-inducing mutations.

Each of five BAC clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020156-g006">Figure 6</xref>A), detected with rhodamine (red), was co-hybridized with a fluorescein-detected (green) transposon probe to metaphase chromosome preparations.

Pedigree AG was previously confirmed to be a lethal pedigree because homozygous carriers of an insertion near the concatemer donor site (03A-0071, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020156-st001">Table S1</xref>) cannot be generated (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c;0.01 by &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> analysis, unpublished data). BAC probing revealed a sizeable insertion involving a portion of the concatemer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020156-g006">Figure 6</xref>C, white arrowheads), and at least 400 kb of distal Chromosome 11 sequence overlapping probes 403C3 and 107H16 (yellow arrows), into distal Chromosome 5 as determined by spectral karyotyping (unpublished data). Thus, these mice have two normal copies of Chromosome 11, which explains why pedigree AG complements all other pedigrees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020156-g005">Figure 5</xref>). This is the second example of insertion of the GT3A concatemer into another chromosome, as we previously reported the insertion of a large portion of the concatemer into Chromosome 4 and subsequent local transposition from the translocated donor site to a nearby gene &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020156-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. A third mutant pedigree revealed a large inversion covering tens of millions of base pairs. Multiple green transposon signals can be observed in pedigree BC, suggesting multiple copies of the gene-trap tTA vector were involved in complex rearrangements since a single copy of the transposon could not be detected by this probe (unpublished data). One rearrangement situated the red signals for probes 297L3 and 367E18 to a more proximal position along Chromosome 11 when compared to the normal copy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020156-g006">Figure 6</xref>D, first two panels).

Based on the UCSC mm5 build (May 2004 freeze), pedigree W deletion extends from approximately 89.7&#x02013;90.1 Mb, a loss of ~400 kb of sequence, while the amplification (due to insertion of sequences from Chromosome 11, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020156-g006">Figure 6</xref>C) in pedigree AG was a roughly 1.9-Mbp region from ~90.3&#x02013;92.2 Mb. This insertion is detected as amplification by ROMA because the region of Chromosome 11 that would have shown a deletion was bred away. Thus, pedigree AG animals now have two normal copies of Chromosome 11 in addition to the inserted 1.9-Mbp region into Chromosome 5.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020156-g007">Figure 7</xref>B summarizes ROMA and FISH data collected for Chromosome 11 rearrangements from various pedigrees. We propose that the two major complementation groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020156-g005">Figure 5</xref>) can be explained by overlapping deletions that occurred during transposition. Complementation group I, represented by pedigrees AL, BB, AS, V, BM, and CQ, carry overlapping deletions detectable by ROMA (blue bars) or FISH (black bars) in a region of Chromosome 11 immediately distal to the predicted concatemer donor site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020156-g007">Figure 7</xref>B).

Even though it is a member of complementation group I, pedigree AO did not harbor a deletion detectable by the ROMA technique. This pedigree, rather, harbors multiple transposon insertions, one within the non-complementation region just defined by the pedigrees above, situated in <italic>Tom1l1</italic> (insertion 03A-0297, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020156-st001">Table S1</xref>), and may indicate that <italic>Tom1l1</italic> is essential.</p><p>In contrast to those distal mutations caused by transposition, pedigrees W, BH, AP, and AY, members of complementation group II, have overlapping deletions which are proximal to the predicted donor site. This region contains the monocyte to macrophage differentiation-associated and hepatic leukemia factor genes (orange box, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020156-g007">Figure 7</xref>B). ROMA analysis of pedigree AP also identified a tandem duplication of Chromosome-11 sequences distal to the donor site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020156-g007">Figure 7</xref>B).</p><p>The ~4.3-Mbp deletion in pedigree Z, detected by ROMA, explains why this pedigree fails to complement either group I or group II pedigrees, because this larger deletion would cover both of the above regions. Additionally, the non-lethal pedigree BG contains two separate deletions not immediately adjacent to the donor site, minimally defined by FISH, suggesting that these regions do not harbor essential sequences. Two cases of insertion translocations have been identified as demonstrated in pedigree AG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020156-g006">Figure 6</xref>C) and a previously described translocation involving just the transposon concatemer &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020156-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;.

A background of approximately 7&#x02013;10&#x00025; probe non-detection existed when probing control GT3A cells with any BAC or transposon probe due to technical artifacts associated with the FISH method. Loss of signal 107H16 could be verified at a low frequency because the red 107H16 probe signal was not adjacent to the green transposon signal in some interphase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020156-g008">Figure 8</xref>).

In a limited number of pedigrees, we recovered one dominant limb and one recessive behavioral phenotype. Unexpectedly, however, genomic rearrangements including deletions and inversions near the transposon donor site, as well as insertion of the donor site plus nearby Chromosome-11 sequences into other chromosomes, caused a high frequency of early embryonic phenotypes in our screen. We hypothesize that the donor site of transposons is situated between these two sets of deletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020156-g007">Figure 7</xref>B, blue and orange boxes), and that transposition resulted in deletions that were proximal or distal to the donor site. We further hypothesize that sequences contained within these deleted regions are essential, and thus result in the recessive lethal phenotypes we observed. We also observed similar de novo rearrangements in somatic cells. These genetic changes may not have been previously recognized because earlier studies involved sequence- or expression-driven approaches. Through a forward-genetic approach, we identified a high frequency of recessive lethal mutations, and then by complementation testing and molecular analysis, determined the nature of the lesions.</p><p>Small- and large-scale local genome rearrangements including insertions, deficiencies, duplications, inversions, and translocations are a common result of <italic>Ac/Ds</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020156-b019">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020156-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;, <italic>Tam3</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020156-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;, Tc1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020156-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;, <italic>P</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020156-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020156-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;, and bacterial &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020156-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d; element transpositions.

The SB-induced genomic rearrangements reported here could be caused by alternative mechanisms of transposition, or due to chromosome instability caused by double-strand breakage during excision and integration. In either case, these events may have been exacerbated by the fact that the GT3A donor site consists of many identical copies of the transposon elements and the high mobilization rate in the GT3A strain.</p><p>This discovery has implications for using SB and possibly other transposable elements as mutagenic tools in the mouse germline and soma. A recent study took advantage of the local hopping phenomenon of SB transposons to demonstrate regional saturation mutagenesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020156-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. Employing a polyA-trap design, insertions were cloned from sperm and identified in every gene over a 4-Mb interval. The data presented here suggest other genetically linked lesions often accompany insertions in local genes. Indeed, single gene insertions were identified in the cases of the dominant polysyndactyly and recessive hyperactivity, seen in pedigrees BM and BG, respectively. Further analysis, however, led us to discover genomic deletions within the mutagenized Chromosome 11 in each of these pedigrees that are also genetically linked to these phenotypes. Pedigree BM, along with the polysyndactyly phenotype, is a member of complementation group 1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020156-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020156-g007">Figure 7</xref>B) and harbors a deletion distal to the concatemer donor site. The hyperactive pedigree BG contains two separate deletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020156-g007">Figure 7</xref>B) in addition to single copy insertions. Since these genomic rearrangements and transposon insertions are genetically linked to the phenotypes we observed, we cannot rule out that the deletions are not causative. As is always the case, it will be crucial to prove that any transposon insertion causes the observed phenotype by remobilizing it from within the gene by re-exposure to transposase, by removing the mutagenic elements of the vector, or transgene rescue. We have previously reported that the germline mobilization rate of single-copy elements is only about 1&#x00025;, and thus loxP recombination sites were engineered into the T2/GT3/tTA transposon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020156-g001">Figure 1</xref>A), flanking the mutagenic core of the transposon, to potentially rescue expression of a gene &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020156-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Somatic transposition of oncogenic SB transposons is a powerful method for studying the cancer genome of tumors previously inaccessible to retroviral insertional mutagens &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020156-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020156-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;.

While analyzing the results of mobilizing these vectors, it will be important to include methods to detect these mutations.</p><p>Finally, we propose that the genomic rearrangements caused by mobilization of SB transposons may serve as a model for the genomic rearrangements that have occurred during the evolution of vertebrate genomes.

Though the synthetic SB element is likely to be much more active than an endogenous cut-and-paste element would have been millions of years ago, we postulate that analogous rearrangements could contribute to the speciation and evolution of vertebrates. Such mutations by a highly active element would undoubtedly be deleterious to a host species over several generations. It now seems plausible that genomes evolved mechanisms to suppress cut-and-paste elements to protect against these damaging rearrangements rather than to prevent the accumulation of rare mutations caused by single-copy insertions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Phenotyping.</title><p>At birth (P0), living and dead G3 pups were counted and any gross abnormalities noted.
