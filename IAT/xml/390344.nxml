TFIIB is composed of two domains that engage in an intramolecular interaction that can be disrupted by the VP16 activation domain. In this study, we describe a novel human TFIIB derivative harbouring two point mutations in the highly conserved N-terminal charged cluster domain. This mutant, TFIIB R53E:R66E, exhibits an enhanced affinity in its intramolecular interaction when compared with wild-type TFIIB. Consistent with this, the mutant displays a significantly reduced affinity for VP16. However, its ability to complex with TATA-binding protein at a model promoter is equivalent to that of wild-type TFIIB. Furthermore, this TFIIB derivative is able to support high order preinitiation complex assembly in the absence of an activator. Strikingly though, an activator fails to recruit the TFIIB mutant to the promoter. Taken together, our results show that a TFIIB conformational change is critical for the formation of activator-dependent transcription complexes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The initiation of class II gene transcription in eukaryotes requires the assembly of a preinitiation complex (PIC) in order to recruit RNA polymerase II (pol II) to the promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c1">1</xref>). The general transcription factor TFIIB plays a central role during this process, providing a physical bridge between promoter-bound TFIID and pol II/TFIIF.</p><p>TFIIB contains two defined domains. The structure of the core C-terminal domain has been solved and comprises two imperfect direct &#x003b1;-helical repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c3">3</xref>). The second of these repeats contains a helix&#x02013;turn&#x02013;helix motif that confers sequence-specific binding to the TFIIB recognition element (BRE) located immediately upstream of the TATA box in a subset of promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c6">6</xref>). TFIIB can also make specific contacts with the DNA downstream of TATA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c7">7</xref>). The extreme N-terminus of TFIIB contains a zinc ribbon, for which the structure has been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c8">8</xref>). TFIIB has also been reported to possess acetyltransferase activity and can acetylate itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c9">9</xref>).</p><p>The N- and C-terminal domains of TFIIB engage in an intramolecular interaction that has been proposed to regulate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c10">10</xref>). The transcriptional activation domain of the herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) VP16 protein is able to disrupt the TFIIB intramolecular interaction, inducing a conformational change in TFIIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c11">11</xref>). Subsequent studies have demonstrated that TFIIB conformation can modulate transcription, but the underlying mechanism(s) has yet to be determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c14">14</xref>).</p><p>In addition to stabilizing and correctly orienting the TATA-binding protein (TBP)&#x02013;promoter complex and recruiting pol II/TFIIF, other roles for TFIIB during pol II transcription have been established. For instance, TFIIB plays a critical role in selection of the transcription start site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c17">17</xref>) and also has a function following PIC assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c20">20</xref>). Both require a region within the N-terminus of TFIIB that lies between the zinc ribbon and the core domain. This domain, for which no structural information is available, contains a cluster of highly conserved charged residues (charged cluster domain, CCD) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh504f1">1</xref>A).</p><p>We have shown previously that a point mutation in the CCD of human TFIIB (R66E) enhances the affinity of the intramolecular interaction, driving the equilibrium towards a closed conformation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh504f1">1</xref>B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c14">14</xref>). TFIIB R66E was found to severely inhibit transcription <italic>in vivo</italic> but not <italic>in vitro</italic>, precluding a direct analysis of the alteration in TFIIB function that arises when the closed conformation is predominant.</p><p>In the present study, we have generated a novel TFIIB derivative that possesses an enhanced intramolecular interaction and, significantly, is defective in <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription assays. This has enabled us to analyse the effects of TFIIB conformation on PIC assembly and activator-mediated recruitment of TFIIB. Our results suggest that TFIIB conformational status does not regulate assembly of TFIIB into a complex with TBP at the promoter or the recruitment of pol II/TFIIF. However, we find that a change in TFIIB conformation is required for activator-mediated recruitment of TFIIB and thus to achieve high levels of transcription.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids and protein purification</title><p>G9AdML contains nucleotides &#x02013;50 to &#x0002b;22 from the adenovirus major late (AdML) promoter cloned downstream of nine Gal4 DNA-binding sites in the pCAT basic vector (Promega). pGEX, pGEX-VP16, pTAC Gal4&#x02013;AH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c21">21</xref>), pET TFIIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c22">22</xref>), pET6HIS GAL4&#x02013;VP16, pET6HIS GAL4&#x02013;SP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c23">23</xref>), pET6HISTBP and pGEX TFIIB (residues 1&#x02013;124) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c14">14</xref>) have been described before.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c26">26</xref>) using the amounts of TFIIB indicated in the figure legends. Briefly, an AdML promoter fragment was end-labelled with Klenow and &#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;dATP and binding reactions were assembled in 10 mM HEPES, pH 8, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM ammonium sulfate, 8&#x00025; (v/v) glycerol, 2&#x00025; (w/v) PEG, 55 mM KCl, 5 mM &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mM EDTA and 0.2 mM PMSF.

Reactions were assembled in 20 mM HEPES (pH 8), 0.2 mM EDTA, 10&#x00025; (v/v) glycerol, 150 mM KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 1 mM DTT. The digestion products were subsequently resolved by SDS&#x02013;PAGE and western blotting performed with &#x003b1;-T7 antibody (Novagen) to detect TFIIB fragments via a C-terminal T7 epitope tag.</p><p>Circular dichroism (CD) measurements were made using a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter using a 0.02 cm path length demountable cuvette. A 0.25 mg/ml solution of each protein was dialysed against 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 8) overnight at 4&#x000b0;C to remove chloride ions. Spectra were measured between 195 and 240 nm at a scan speed of 100 nm/min. Each measurement was repeated 10 times and the average used. The spectra were deconvolved to provide estimations of secondary structure content using CDSSTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c27">27</xref>) as part of the CDPRO software package.</p></sec><sec><title>Affinity chromatography and immobilized DNA template assays</title><p>Purified recombinant human TFIIB and derivatives were applied to minicolumns in buffer D containing KCl at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends. SDS&#x02013;PAGE loading buffer was added to the fractions and the proteins resolved by SDS&#x02013;PAGE and immunoblotted onto Immobilon P membrane (Millipore). &#x003b1;-T7 antibody was used to detect the TFIIB derivatives via a C-terminal T7 epitope tag. Immobilized DNA template assays were performed using magnetic beads (Dynal) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c28">28</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>Our previous studies showed that the arginine residue at position 66 in human TFIIB is critical in modulating the affinity of the TFIIB intramolecular interaction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh504f1">1</xref>A and B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c14">14</xref>). Subsequent studies revealed that the similarly conserved arginine at position 53 is also involved (data not shown and see below). We therefore hypothesized that the simultaneous mutation of R53 and R66 to acidic residues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh504f1">1</xref>A) might sufficiently enhance the TFIIB intramolecular interaction so as to manifest a transcriptional defect <italic>in vitro</italic> that could then be analysed further. Wild-type human TFIIB and the derivatives R53E, R66E and R53E:R66E (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh504f1">1</xref>A) were prepared from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> to equivalent purities, as revealed by SDS&#x02013;PAGE and Coomassie staining (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh504f1">1</xref>C).</p><p>VP16 and the N-terminus of TFIIB compete to interact with the TFIIB core domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c14">14</xref>). Thus, VP16 preferentially interacts with the open form of TFIIB. We exploited this fact, using VP16-binding capacity as an indicator of the affinities of the intramolecular interactions of our TFIIB CCD mutants. A salt elution profile was used to determine the relative affinities of wild-type TFIIB, TFIIB core domain (&#x00394;4&#x02013;85) and the CCD mutants for the VP16 activation domain immobilized as a GST fusion protein on a glutathione&#x02013;agarose column (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh504f2">2</xref>A). A GST column was used as a negative control. TFIIB &#x00394;4&#x02013;85 (which lacks a competing N-terminus) showed an enhanced affinity for VP16 (salt resistance) when compared to wild-type TFIIB. As shown before, TFIIB R66E (which favours the closed conformation) displayed a reduced affinity for VP16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c14">14</xref>). A similar effect was observed with TFIIB R53E. Significantly, and as anticipated, TFIIB R53E:R66E showed a further decrease in its affinity for VP16. These data strongly indicate that, when compared with the single amino acid CCD mutants, the R53E:R66E double point mutation drives the equilibrium further towards the closed conformation of TFIIB.</p><p>We next performed an affinity chromatography experiment to assess the avidity of the intramolecular interactions of the TFIIB derivatives in <italic>trans</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh504f2">2</xref>B). Residues 1&#x02013;124 of the wild-type and mutant human TFIIB derivatives were expressed as fusions to GST, immobilized onto beads and assembled into separate chromatography columns, along with GST alone as a control. TFIIB core domain (&#x00394;4&#x02013;85) was then applied to each of the TFIIB N-terminal derivative columns and a salt gradient used to determine the elution profile.</p><p>TFIIB core domain eluted from the wild-type TFIIB N-terminus column at a salt concentration of 100&#x02013;120 mM. When the immobilized TFIIB N-terminus contained either the R53E or R66E single point mutations, 120&#x02013;140 mM potassium chloride was required to elute all of the bound core domain, demonstrating an enhanced interaction. Combining these mutations within the CCD of TFIIB also caused an increase in the affinity of the TFIIB N-terminus for the core domain, but no further enhancement was observed when compared with the single point mutations. However, the VP16-binding data (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh504f2">2</xref>A) strongly suggest that combining the R53E and R66E mutations further enhances the formation of closed form TFIIB. This disparity perhaps suggests a more complex or subtle alteration in the association of the N- and C-terminal domains in TFIIB R53E:R66E that occurs in intact TFIIB but may not be detectable using the separated domains.</p><p>The N-terminus of TFIIB has previously been shown to be sensitive to attack by trypsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c30">30</xref>). We therefore reasoned that the TFIIB CCD mutants, which show a greater propensity to adopt the closed form (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh504f2">2</xref>), might exhibit a greater resistance to degradation by trypsin. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh504f3">3</xref>A shows the results of titrating trypsin into reactions containing either wild-type TFIIB or each of the CCD mutant derivatives. Intact TFIIB and the proteolytically derived core domain were detected by western blotting with an antibody directed against a C-terminal epitope tag. We consistently found that, as the concentration of trypsin was increased, all of the TFIIB CCD mutants retained a higher proportion of intact full-length TFIIB when compared to the wild-type protein. Importantly, the amount of trypsin required to initiate the proteolysis of wild-type TFIIB and each derivative was the same. These data suggest that in all TFIIB populations there is a mix of the open and closed forms, but that the CCD mutations cause a shift in the equilibrium towards the closed conformation.</p><p>Using CD we next sought to determine if the mutations that we introduced into TFIIB had affected the secondary structure (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh504f3">3</xref>B). Ellipticity measurements for each TFIIB protein were gathered between 195 and 240 nm and these plots were compared with the standard curves representing each class of protein secondary structure. The CD profile of wild-type human TFIIB reflected that of a protein population comprised mostly of &#x003b1;-helices (50&#x00025;), consistent with the published structure of the TFIIB core domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c3">3</xref>). Each of the TFIIB mutants produced CD profiles that were equivalent to that observed with wild-type TFIIB. Thus, the CCD mutations analysed in this study do not cause significant changes to TFIIB secondary structure, but do augment the formation of closed form TFIIB (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh504f2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh504f3">3</xref>A).</p><p>Our data so far suggest that TFIIB R53E:R66E exhibits an enhanced affinity in its intramolecular interaction which reduces its capacity to interact with VP16. We next tested the abilities of the TFIIB derivatives to restore transcriptional activity to HeLa nuclear extract that had been depleted of endogenous TFIIB. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh504f4">4</xref>A shows activator-independent (basal level) transcription at the AdML promoter when a TFIIB-depleted nuclear extract is supplemented with either wild-type TFIIB or each of the three CCD mutants. Although both the R53E and R66E TFIIB derivatives showed a modest impairment in supporting basal transcription when compared to wild-type TFIIB, the double point mutant R53E:R66E showed a significantly reduced activity.</p><p>TFIIB has been proposed as a target of transcriptional activator proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c31">31</xref>). We therefore tested the ability of the TFIIB CCD mutants to support transcriptional activation mediated by Gal4&#x02013;VP16, Gal4&#x02013;AH and Gal4&#x02013;SP1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh504f4">4</xref>B). In each case the TFIIB R53E:R66E double substitution mutant showed a significant defect in supporting transcriptional activation that was not observed with the single CCD mutants. We therefore conclude that the TFIIB mutant R53E:R66E exhibits reduced function in supporting basal transcription, but is more defective in supporting activator-dependent transcription when compared to the single point mutations.</p><p>Having generated a TFIIB derivative that is sufficiently altered in conformation so as to manifest a transcription defect <italic>in vitro</italic>, we proceeded to determine the role of TFIIB conformation in PIC assembly. A central function of TFIIB is to form a complex with TBP at the promoter. Therefore, we assayed the abilities of each of the TFIIB CCD mutants to form a TFIIB&#x02013;TBP&#x02013;AdML promoter complex using EMSA. Increasing amounts of wild-type TFIIB (and the CCD mutants) were incubated with recombinant TBP and radiolabelled AdML promoter and the resulting complexes were resolved by electrophoresis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh504f5">5</xref>A). The results show that each of the CCD mutants forms a complex in a concentration-dependent manner equivalent to that observed with wild-type TFIIB. To investigate the possibility of more subtle effects, we also monitored the rate of assembly of the TFIIB derivatives into TFIIB&#x02013;TBP&#x02013;promoter complexes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh504f5">5</xref>B). The TFIIB CCD mutants were indistinguishable from wild-type TFIIB in their rate of promoter association.</p><p>The TFIIB&#x02013;TBP&#x02013;promoter complex provides a platform for the entry of pol II and TFIIF into the PIC. Indeed, it was originally proposed that the TFIIB intramolecular interaction might mask the binding sites for TFIIF and pol II and hence block PIC assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c11">11</xref>). Therefore, we tested the ability of the TFIIB CCD mutants to form a TFIIB&#x02013;TFIIF&#x02013;Pol II&#x02013;TBP&#x02013;AdML promoter complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh504f5">5</xref>C). Each of the TFIIB CCD mutants was able to mediate assembly of pol II at the promoter, although we note that TFIIB R53E showed a reduced ability. We have consistently observed that this is not the case with the TFIIB R53E:R66E mutant.</p><p>We finally considered if activator-mediated recruitment of TFIIB may underlie the defect that we observe in transcriptional activation with the R53E:R66E mutant. To investigate this, we used an immobilized DNA template to purify functional PICs from TFIIB-depleted nuclear extract that had been supplemented with either wild-type TFIIB or the R53E:R66E mutant. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh504f6">6</xref>A shows the results of a transcription assay performed using PICs purified in this way. As we observed before (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh504f4">4</xref>B), the R53E:R66E TFIIB mutant is defective in supporting transcriptional activation. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh504f6">6</xref>B shows complexes that were purified as above but were instead immunoblotted to monitor the levels of GAL4&#x02013;AH, TBP and TFIIB (wild-type and R53E:R66E mutant) that had assembled at the promoter. As observed before, TBP (TFIID) assembled at the promoter independently of the activator, whereas wild-type TFIIB showed activator- enhanced assembly at the promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c28">28</xref>). In contrast, the TFIIB mutant R53E:R66E failed to undergo activator- mediated recruitment. Thus, the compromised transcriptional activation observed with TFIIB R53E:R66E can be explained, at least in part, by a defect in activator-mediated recruitment.</p></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Previous studies using mutations that alter the affinity of the TFIIB intramolecular interaction have shown that a conformational change in TFIIB is vital for transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c14">14</xref>). However, the underlying mechanism(s) was not established. The data presented here suggest that the TFIIB intramolecular interaction does not modulate the assembly of TFIIB into a TFIIB&#x02013;TBP&#x02013;promoter complex or play a significant role in the subsequent recruitment of pol II and TFIIF. Rather, a change in the conformation of TFIIB is required in the response to an activator protein and specifically for activator-mediated recruitment of TFIIB.</p><p>Several reports have implicated TFIIB as a key target during transactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c31">31</xref>). These studies used mutations within the core domain that directly disrupt the interaction between an activator and TFIIB. Such TFIIB mutants are specifically defective in transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c32">32</xref>). TFIIB mutations within the CCD, however, which is not an interaction surface for activator proteins, represent a different class of TFIIB mutants displaying defects in transcriptional activation. Rather than directly disrupting the surface within TFIIB that interfaces with the activator, these mutations occlude an intact activator-binding site by enhancing the affinity of the intramolecular interaction between the N- and C-terminal domains of TFIIB.</p><p>It was originally speculated that the pol II and/or TFIIF binding sites in TFIIB may be inaccessible in the closed form and that this might restrict PIC assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c11">11</xref>). However, our results show that TFIIB R53E:R66E is able to recruit pol II to the promoter, yet is still defective in transcription, particularly in the presence of an activator protein. Previous work by others has described TFIIB CCD mutants that can form an intact PIC but are defective in initiation, suggesting a post-recruitment role for TFIIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c20">20</xref>). Our observation that TFIIB R53E:R66E shows reduced basal transcription despite being able to recruit pol II/TFIIF is consistent with this hypothesis. Moreover, a recent study has provided insights into how TFIIB may perform functions after PIC assembly, proposing that the CCD is likely to be positioned within the active site cleft of pol II within the PIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh504c33">33</xref>).</p><p>The data presented here show that the defect of TFIIB R53E:R66E in supporting transcriptional activation occurs by a mechanism distinct to that observed in basal level transcription. Specifically, an activator protein fails to recruit significant levels of TFIIB R53E:R66E to the promoter. Our affinity chromatography data suggest that this impairment is due to a significantly reduced affinity of this mutant TFIIB derivative for an activation domain. Thus, the TFIIB intramolecular interaction regulates activator-mediated assembly of the PIC but not activator-independent PIC formation.</p><p>A role for the TFIIB intramolecular interaction in regulating the formation of PICs in response to transcriptional activators could provide a mechanism to control the potency of transcriptional activators. It may also present a focal point for transcriptional synergy in that multiple activation domains may better compete with the TFIIB intramolecular interaction, providing a threshold level of response. In summary, our present data have defined a critical function of the TFIIB conformational change in the mechanism of action of transcriptional activators.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh504f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Targeted point mutagenesis of the human TFIIB charged cluster domain.
