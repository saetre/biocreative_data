So far, no function has been assigned to the cytoplasmic fraction of Rrp43p. We have addressed Rrp43p function by analyzing mRNA stability in three <italic>rrp43</italic> temperature-sensitive (<italic>ts</italic>) strains, which carry different <italic>ts</italic> alleles (<italic>rrp43-1</italic>, <italic>rrp43-2</italic> and <italic>rrp43-3</italic>), and by analyzing Rrp43p interactions with the remaining exosome subunits. In the <italic>ts</italic> strains, endogenous mRNAs (<italic>ACT1</italic> and <italic>PAB1</italic>), as well as a heterologous reporter mRNA (<italic>CATpG</italic>) showed longer half-lives, relative to a control strain carrying wild-type <italic>RRP43</italic>. The mutants also accumulated a degradation intermediate of the reporter mRNA that is typical of defective mRNA decay. These results allow us to propose that Rrp43p is required for mRNA degradation. Rrp43p interacts with the exosome complex via Rrp46p, as determined by two-hybrid analyses. Interestingly, the <italic>rrp43 ts</italic> mutant proteins do not interact with Rrp46p, indicating that the <italic>ts</italic> phenotype may be caused by disruption of the Rrp43p&#x02013; Rrp46p interaction. The <italic>ts</italic> strains also showed a pre-rRNA processing defect, which is consistent with previous studies on Rrp43p function.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In eukaryotes, extensive post-transcriptional processing is generally necessary for the synthesis of mature RNAs. Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) undergo 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; processing and intron removal. mRNA processing includes 5&#x02032;-capping, excision of introns, 3&#x02032;-cleavage and polyadenylation and, in some cases, editing of specific nucleotides. In addition, degradation of mRNA is of special interest because it is important for the control of gene expression. Studies utilizing the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> have identified two mRNA degradation pathways. mRNAs either undergo shortening of the polyadenylate tail, followed by decapping and 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; exonucleolytic digestion, or they are first deadenylated and subsequently degraded by 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; digestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c2">2</xref>). Three of the four rRNAs are synthesized from a single pre-rRNA. This pre-rRNA contains the coding sequences of the 18S, 5.8S and 25&#x02013;28S rRNAs flanked by two external transcribed sequences (5&#x02032; ETS and 3&#x02032; ETS) and two internal transcribed sequences (ITS1 and ITS2, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c3">3</xref>). During rRNA processing, which is best characterized in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf545f1">1</xref>), these spacer sequences are removed by a sequential series of endo- and exonucleolytic cleavages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c5">5</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, several factors involved in mRNA degradation also participate in rRNA, snRNA and snoRNA biosynthesis. The 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; exonucleases Rat1p and Xrn1p degrade single-stranded RNA and excised pre-rRNA sequences, and are responsible for the formation of the mature 5&#x02032;-end of the 5.8S and 25S rRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c9">9</xref>). The exosome is a conserved eukaryotic protein complex containing multiple 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; exonucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c15">15</xref>). Eight homologs of yeast exosome subunits have recently been found in <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> and been shown to be involved in rRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c16">16</xref>). In addition, an exosome-like complex was identified in <italic>Arabdopsis thaliana</italic>, which contains AtRrp41p, a protein that complements Rrp41p function in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c17">17</xref>). The exosome was initially identified as a five-subunit complex required for processing of the 5.8S rRNA 3&#x02032;-end (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf545f1">1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c14">14</xref>). More recently, six other exosome subunits were identified that co-purify with ProtA&#x02013;Rrp4p on an IgG&#x02013;Sepharose column and form nuclear and cytoplasmic sub-complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c10">10</xref>). The exosome subunits Rrp4p, Rrp41p&#x0002f;Ski6p and Csl4p&#x0002f;Ski4p have been shown to participate in 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; degradation of deadenylated mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c19">19</xref>). The mammalian exosome was reported to participate in degradation of ARE (A-U-rich element)-containing RNAs in a cell-free system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c20">20</xref>) and the mammalian homolog of yeast Rrp45p, PM-Scl75, interacts with AREs, mediating the rapid degradation of ARE-containing mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c21">21</xref>). Based on recent data, a model has been proposed in which the exosome degrades mRNA in a decapping-independent mechanism that requires Ski2p, Ski3p, Ski7p and Ski8p in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c2">2</xref>). However, there is evidence that the mammalian exosome is functionally linked to mRNA decapping. Following deadenylation, the mammalian exosome degrades the mRNA 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032;, in a process coupled to decapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c22">22</xref>). The subunits Rrp4p and Rrp41p&#x0002f;Ski6p are also involved in snRNAs and snoRNAs processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c13">13</xref>). Except for Rrp6p, all the other exosome subunits are essential for yeast cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c23">23</xref>). Up to now, exonuclease activity has been demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> for the subunits Rrp4p, Rrp41p&#x0002f;Ski6p, Rrp44p&#x0002f;Dis3p and Rrp6p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c14">14</xref>); however, all of the subunits have sequence similarity with bacterial RNases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c24">24</xref>). So far, it is unclear why cells need so many RNases with similar function. Detailed studies are still required to understand the specific function of most exosome subunits.</p><p>Rrp43p is one of the exosome subunits identified by co-purification with ProtA&#x02013;Rrp4p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c14">14</xref>) and was shown to interact with Nip7p, a protein required for 25S rRNA synthesis and 60S ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c26">26</xref>). In addition to defects in 3&#x02032;-end formation of 5.8S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c14">14</xref>), depletion of Rrp43p also blocks processing of the 27S pre-rRNA, formation of the 20S pre-rRNA and leads to accumulation of an aberrant 23S pre-rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c27">27</xref>). Rrp43p shows sequence similarity to <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RNase PH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c14">14</xref>); however, an RNase activity for Rrp43p has not yet been demonstrated. Subcellular localization studies have detected Rrp43p in the nucleolus, nucleoplasm and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c26">26</xref>). It is assumed that the nucleolar and nuclear fractions of Rrp43p function in pre-rRNA processing and degradation of excised spacer sequences. No function has been demonstrated for the cytoplasmic fraction of Rrp43p, but its presence in this cell compartment, together with the fact that other exosome subunits are involved in mRNA decay, suggest that it may also be involved in mRNA degradation. Furthermore, there is no information about the mechanism of Rrp43p interaction with the exosome complex.</p><p>Previous studies on Rrp43p function were based on conditional expression using the regulated <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter, which is repressed in the presence of glucose and strongly induced by galactose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c27">27</xref>). This type of conditional strain has to be maintained in galactose-containing media, resulting in production of the <italic>GAL1</italic>-regulated protein in the cell in excess of normal levels. In this work, we used a mutagenesis strategy to generate <italic>rrp43p</italic> temperature-sensitive (<italic>ts</italic>) mutants in order to investigate Rrp43p function on mRNA degradation. We show that, at the restrictive temperature, certain amino acid substitutions cause significant accumulation of mRNA and abolish Rrp43p function in rRNA processing. In addition, the two-hybrid system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c28">28</xref>) was used to analyze potential Rrp43p interactions with other exosome subunits. These analyses revealed that Rrp43p interacts with the exosome only via Rrp46p, and that the <italic>rrp43 ts</italic> mutants no longer interact with Rrp46p.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>DNA analysis methods and plasmid construction</title><p>DNA cloning and electrophoretic analysis were performed as described by Sambrook <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c29">29</xref>). DNA sequencing was performed by the Big Dye method (Perkin Elmer). A cDNA library fused to the <italic>GAL4</italic> activation domain was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC 87002). Plasmids used in this study are summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf545tb1">1</xref> and cloning strategies are briefly described below. The <italic>lexA</italic>:: <italic>RRP43</italic> fusion used in the two-hybrid screen was constructed by inserting a 1.2 kb <italic>Bam</italic>HI&#x02013;<italic>Sal</italic>I <italic>RRP43</italic> fragment into pBTM116 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c30">30</xref>), which had been digested with the same restriction enzymes, generating plasmid pBTM-RRP43. <italic>GAL4</italic> activation domain fusions with the exosome subunits were constructed by inserting PCR-amplified open reading frames (ORFs) into the <italic>Bam</italic>HI and <italic>Sal</italic>I sites of pGAD-C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c31">31</xref>), generating pGAD-RRP4, pGAD-RRP40, pGAD-RRP41, pGAD-RRP42, pGAD-RRP44, pGAD-RRP45, pGAD-RRP46, pGAD-MTR3, pGAD-CSL4 and pGAD-RRP6. Plasmid pCFUS-RRP43 was constructed by inserting a 1.2 kb <italic>Bam</italic>HI&#x02013;<italic>Sal</italic>I <italic>RRP43</italic> fragment into pGFP-C-FUS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c32">32</xref>), which was digested with the same enzymes to remove the GFP coding sequence. In this plasmid, <italic>RRP43</italic> is under control of the <italic>MET25</italic> promoter. Plasmid pACT-RRP46, which bears the gene encoding a hybrid protein of the Gal4p activation domain and Rrp46p, was isolated from strain YCO45 that showed positive two-hybrid interaction with Rrp43p. Plasmids pCFUS-rrp43-1, pCFUS-rrp43-2 and pCFUS-rrp43-3 were isolated from mutant strains <italic>rrp43-1</italic>, <italic>rrp43-2</italic> and <italic>rrp43-3</italic>, respectively (see below). Plasmid YCp111GAL-RRP43 was constructed by inserting an <italic>Xba</italic>I&#x02013;<italic>Sal</italic>I <italic>RRP43</italic> fragment (from pGFP-RRP43) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c26">26</xref>) into YCp111GAL-NIP7 (N.I.T.Zanchin, unpublished results), digested with <italic>Xba</italic>I and <italic>Sal</italic>I. It results in a <italic>HIS6</italic>&#x02013;<italic>RRP43</italic> fusion controlled by the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter.

Subsequently, a 20 nt long poly(G) oligo was inserted into an <italic>Xba</italic>I restriction site, downstream of the <italic>CAT</italic> stop codon. Plasmids containing wild-type and mutant <italic>RRP43</italic> alleles fused to the HA epitope were contructed as follows. A DNA fragment encoding the HA epitope was isolated from vector pACT2 (obtained from Clontech) by digestion with <italic>Bgl</italic>II and <italic>Bam</italic>HI. This fragment was inserted into the <italic>Bam</italic>HI restriction site of the vectors pCFUS-RRP43, pCFUS-rrp43-1, pCFUS-rrp43-2 and pCFUS-rrp43-3, which is located upstream of the <italic>RRP43</italic> coding sequence, resulting in N-terminal HA fusions.

Yeast strains were maintained as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c34">34</xref>). Glucose or galactose was added as carbon source to yeast extract&#x02013;peptone medium (YP) or synthetic medium (YNB) to a final concentration of 2&#x00025;. The <italic>RRP43</italic> gene disruption has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c27">27</xref>), as has the construction of a conditional strain for <italic>RRP43</italic>, DG458, which bears a plasmid-encoded copy of <italic>RRP43</italic> under the control of the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter. Strain YCO43 was constructed by replacing the endogenous plasmid of strain DG458 with plasmid YCp111GAL-RRP43 (<italic>LEU2</italic>). Strains <italic>rrp43-1</italic>, <italic>rrp43-2</italic> and <italic>rrp43-3</italic> were isolated in a screen to identify temperature-sensitive mutations in <italic>RRP43</italic> (see results). Strains carrying the <italic>RRP43</italic> alleles containing an N-terminal HA epitope tag were generated by transforming strain YCO43 with vectors pCFUS-HARRP43, pCFUS-HArrp43-1, pCFUS-HArrp43-2 and pCFUS-HArrp43-3. YCO43 carries a vector with <italic>RRP43</italic> under the control of the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter that is repressed in the presence of glucose.

The resulting strains (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf545tb2">2</xref>) carrying both the wild-type and the mutant proteins fused to the HA epitope were able to grow in glucose-containing medium at 25&#x000b0;C, showing that the HA-tagged proteins can complement the chromosomal deletion of <italic>RRP43</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf545f2">2</xref>D).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro</italic> mutagenesis and isolation of <italic>rrp43</italic> temperature-sensitive (<italic>ts</italic>) alleles</title><p>The method for mutagenesis and <italic>in vivo</italic> recombination was performed essentially as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c35">35</xref>). Briefly, plasmid DNA template (pCFUS-RRP43) was linearized with <italic>Xho</italic>I and diluted to 10 ng&#x0002f;&#x000b5;l. PCRs (100 &#x000b5;l) contained 1 mM dGTP, dCTP and dTTP and 0.2 mM dATP. MgCl<sub>2</sub> was added to an end concentration of 3 mM. Reactions were pre-heated to 94&#x000b0;C and submitted to 30 cycles of 1 min at 94&#x000b0;C, 1 min at 55&#x000b0;C, 1 min at 72&#x000b0;C. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used in the PCR were: 5&#x02032;-TCACTCTAGACGGATCCTGGAAATGGCTGAAAGTACC-3&#x02032; for the forward primer and 5&#x02032;-GTTTGTCGACTCCTTTCGACAGTCATCAG-3&#x02032; for the reverse primer. Yeast strain YCO43 was transformed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c36">36</xref>) with total PCR plus 100 ng of pCFUS-RRP43 linearized with <italic>Eco</italic>RI and plated onto YNB medium, containing glucose and lacking uracil and leucine. In such a way, transformants in which recombination between the PCR product and pCFUS-RRP43 (<italic>URA3</italic>) had occurred were selected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf545f2">2</xref>B). Approximately 1700 transformants were obtained that were able to grow on glucose-containing medium selective for the genetic marker (<italic>URA3</italic>) of vector pCFUS-RRP43 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf545tb1">1</xref>) at 25&#x000b0;C.

At this stage of analysis, all of the strains still contained plasmid YCp111GAL-RRP43 and, therefore, were able to grow on galactose-containing plates at 37&#x000b0;C, because the wild-type copy of <italic>RRP43</italic> is being expressed, whereas on glucose, with <italic>GAL</italic>::<italic>RRP43</italic> repressed, only the control strain YCO44 grew well at 37&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf545f2">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Yeast two-hybrid screen for proteins that interact with Rrp43p</title><p>The host strain for the two-hybrid screen, YCO45 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf545tb2">2</xref>), is a derivative of strain L40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c37">37</xref>) containing both yeast <italic>HIS3</italic> and <italic>E.coli lacZ</italic> genes as reporters for two-hybrid interaction integrated into the genome.

The mRNA half-life corresponds to the time when the initial amount of mRNA was 50&#x00025; reduced (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf545tb3">3</xref>). Three northern blots were also performed to analyze <italic>MFA2</italic> mRNA decay (data not shown). mRNA decay of the reporter mRNA (CATpG) was analyzed by transforming the <italic>ts</italic> mutant strains and the control strain with plasmid pCATpG. Yeast strains containing this plasmid were grown on selective medium for 4 or 8 h at 37&#x000b0;C, when thiolutin was added, and fractions were collected at various times as described above. CATpG intermediates were analyzed as follows: total RNA was extracted, resolved on 4&#x00025; polyacrylamide&#x02013;7 M urea gels, transferred to Hybond nylon membrane (Amersham) using an electroblotter (Hoeffer) and hybridized with an oligonucleotide specific to the poly(G) of the reporter mRNA. For normalization of the amount of RNA loaded on gels, a probe specific to the RNA polymerase III transcript scR1 was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c41">41</xref>). Metabolic labeling of rRNA was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c34">34</xref>). Exponentially growing cultures of strains YCO44, <italic>rrp43-1</italic>, <italic>rrp43-2</italic> and <italic>rrp43-3</italic> were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 4 h in YNB-glucose medium lacking methionine. Subsequently, cells were pulse&#x02013;chase labeled with 100 &#x000b5;Ci&#x0002f;ml &#x0005b;methyl-<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;methionine (Amersham Pharmacia) for 2 min and chased with 100 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml unlabeled methionine. At various times, samples were taken and quickly frozen in a dry ice&#x02013;ethanol bath. Total RNA was isolated, separated by electrophoresis and blotted as described above. Nylon membranes were incubated in En<sup>3</sup>Hance (NEN) and submitted to autoradiography.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoblot analysis</title><p>Yeast strains YCO47, YCO48, YCO49 and YCO50 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf545tb2">2</xref>) were incubated at 25&#x000b0;C to an OD<sub>600</sub> of &#x0223c;0.8 and shifted to 37&#x000b0;C for various times. Cells were collected by centrifugation, suspended in PBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c29">29</xref>) and disrupted by vortexing with glass beads. Extracts were cleared by centrifugation, fractionated by SDS&#x02013;PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were incubated with an anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by incubation with anti-mouse IgG linked to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Amersham Biosciences). The translation factor eIF2&#x003b1; served as an internal control and was detected with a rabbit antiserum (provided by John McCarthy, University of Manchester), followed by incubation with anti-rabbit IgG linked to HRP (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were developed using the ECL system as described by the supplier (Amersham Biosciences).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Amino acid substitutions in the central region of Rrp43p cause a temperature-sensitive (<italic>ts</italic>) phenotype</title><p>Previous studies on Rrp43p were based on carbon source conditional strains, which contained the <italic>RRP43</italic> gene under control of the regulated <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c27">27</xref>). Since this promoter is repressed by glucose and induced by galactose, the conditional strain must be maintained in galactose-containing medium, resulting in an excess of Rrp43p in the cell. Analysis of mRNA from this type of conditional strain showed that it was not suitable for mRNA stability assays (data not shown). In addition, we intended to study the effects of Rrp43p deficiency on RNA metabolism with subtle changes that could reveal its specific function. Therefore, we sought to generate <italic>RRP43</italic> mutants with temperature-sensitive phenotypes using an <italic>in vitro</italic> mutagenesis technique (see Materials and Methods; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf545f2">2</xref>B) that allows for <italic>in vivo</italic> recombination of mutagenic PCR products with a co-transformed linear vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c35">35</xref>). Approximately 1700 transformants were screened and three strains (<italic>rrp43-1</italic>, <italic>rrp43-2</italic> and <italic>rrp43-3</italic>) showing stable temperature-sensitive phenotypes were isolated (see Materials and Methods; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf545f2">2</xref>). To confirm that the <italic>ts</italic> phenotype was associated with mutations in the plasmid-borne copy of <italic>RRP43</italic>, plasmids pCFUS-rrp43-1, pCFUS-rrp43-2 and pCFUS-rrp43-3 were isolated from strains <italic>rrp43-1</italic>, <italic>rrp43-2</italic> and <italic>rrp43-3</italic>, respectively, and retransformed into strain YCO43 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf545tb2">2</xref>), which contains plasmid YCp111GAL-RRP43. The resulting strains were cured of YCp111GAL-RRP43 and tested for growth at 37&#x000b0;C. None of the strains containing the plasmids isolated from strains <italic>rrp43-1</italic>, <italic>rrp43-2</italic> and <italic>rrp43-3</italic> was able to grow at 37&#x000b0;C (data not shown). Since the temperature-sensitive phenotype could be caused by rapid degradation of the mutant proteins at the non-permissive temperature, we inserted the HA epitope tag at the N-terminus of the wild-type and mutant proteins to examine their stability by immunoblot analysis. The HA-tagged proteins are functional since they complement the chromosomal deletion of <italic>RRP43</italic> at the permissive temperature (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf545f2">2</xref>D). Interestingly, equivalent levels of wild-type and mutant <italic>RRP43</italic> proteins were detected following incubation of cells at 37&#x000b0;C for up to 12 h (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf545f2">2</xref>E), revealing that the temperature-sensitive phenotype is caused by inactivation rather than by rapid degradation of the mutant proteins at 37&#x000b0;C.</p><p>Sequence analysis was performed with plasmids pCFUS-rrp43-1, pCFUS-rrp43-2 and pCFUS-rrp43-3 recovered from the mutant strains to identify the amino acid substitutions. <italic>rrp43-1</italic> contains a unique amino acid substitution that replaces Val212 with Ala, whereas in <italic>rrp43-2</italic> three mutations were detected, Cys230&#x02192;Tyr, Ile274&#x02192;Thr and Cys276&#x02192;Tyr, and <italic>rrp43-3</italic> has two amino acids replaced, Ser162&#x02192;Phe and Ala246&#x02192;Thr. It is interesting to note that all amino acid substitutions are located in the central region of Rrp43p between amino acids 162 and 276, suggesting that this region is important either for the thermostability of the protein or for its interaction with the exosome complex.</p></sec><sec><title>Temperature-sensitive mutants of Rrp43p show rRNA processing defects</title><p>By creating <italic>ts</italic> mutations in <italic>RRP43</italic>, it was expected that pre-rRNA processing would be affected since a requirement for Rrp43p in rRNA synthesis has already been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c21">21</xref>). Therefore, we initially analyzed rRNA processing in the <italic>ts</italic> strains for various times at the restrictive temperature. Northern hybridization analyses detected both a moderate decrease in 5.8S rRNA levels and an increase in 7S pre-rRNA levels in the <italic>rrp43 ts</italic> mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf545f3">3</xref>A and B). These strains also showed a strong accumulation of the 5&#x02032; ETS region upstream from cleavage site A<sub>0</sub> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf545f3">3</xref>C). Accumulation of the 5&#x02032; ETS has also been reported for yeast strains defective for the exosome subunits Rrp6p, Rrp40p and Csl4p and the RNA helicase Dob1p&#x0002f;Mtr4p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c42">42</xref>), indicating that degradation of the spacer sequences is a very complex process. The three mutant strains showed slower processing of the 27S pre-rRNA and under-accumulation of the mature 25S rRNA as observed by &#x0005b;methyl-<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;methionine pulse&#x02013;chase labeling of pre-rRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf545f4">4</xref>), which is consistent with the accumulation of the 27S pre-rRNA observed in the mutant strains by northern blot analysis. A modest accumulation of the 35S pre-rRNA and of the aberrant 23S pre-rRNA indicates that processing at the sites A<sub>0</sub> and A<sub>1</sub> may be impaired in the mutant strains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf545f3">3</xref>D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c4">4</xref>). The 23S pre-rRNA has been considered an aberrant precursor, containing the 5&#x02032; ETS, the 18S rRNA and part of ITS1, that is formed by direct cleavage of the 35S pre-rRNA at site A<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c43">43</xref>); however, under the conditions used in this work, the 23S pre-rRNA can be detected even in the control strain, although at only a low level (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf545f3">3</xref>D). Northern hybridization with probe 2 detected both the 20S pre-RNA, which is the immediate precursor of the 18S rRNA, and the 23S pre-rRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf545f3">3</xref>D). By comparing the 23S:20S ratio, a relative increase in the aberrant 23S pre-rRNA is observed in the mutant strains. This increase is more striking in strain <italic>rrp43-2</italic>. In strain <italic>rrp43-3</italic>, the levels of 20S pre-rRNA decreased following longer incubation at the restrictive temperature, but no corresponding increase in 23S pre-rRNA was detected, suggesting a possible destabilization of the 20S pre-rRNA. In strain <italic>rrp43-2</italic>, on the other hand, the higher 23S:20S ratio is clearly caused by an increase in the aberrant 23S pre-rRNA concentration. These results suggest that the mutants may show allele-specific defects. An apparent lower level of &#x0005b;methyl-<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;methinone labeling was observed in the case of strains <italic>rrp43-2</italic> and <italic>rrp43-3</italic>. This may be another indication of allele-specific phenotypes and is not surprising, because allele-specific defects have been described for other mutant strains, such as the <italic>ts</italic> conditional mutants of <italic>NOP1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c44">44</xref>). The aberrant 23S pre-rRNA is barely detectable in the pulse&#x02013;chase labeling with &#x0005b;methyl-<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;methinone in the mutant strains, probably because cells were shifted to the non-permissive temperature for only 4 h, whereas for steady-state analysis, samples were analyzed for up to 12 h. All of the pre-rRNA processing defects detected in the <italic>rrp43 ts</italic> strains are consistent with the previous reports about <italic>RRP43</italic> function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c27">27</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>mRNA shows a longer half-life in <italic>rrp43 ts</italic> strains</title><p>It has been demonstrated previously that Rrp43p is part of both nuclear and cytoplasmic exosome complexes. Moreover, the exosome subunits Rrp4p, Rrp41p&#x0002f;Ski6p and Csl4p&#x0002f;Ski4p, which are components of the cytoplasmic complex, are required for mRNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c26">26</xref>). These findings raised the possibility that the cytoplasmic fraction of Rrp43p also participates in mRNA degradation. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the stability of several mRNAs in the <italic>ts</italic> strains isolated in this work. These were grown at 25&#x000b0;C to early log phase and then transferred to 37&#x000b0;C for 4 or 8 h. Subsequently, cells were collected and resuspended in pre-warmed YNB-glucose medium containing 20 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml of the RNA polymerase II inhibitor thiolutin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c40">40</xref>). Samples were collected at the moment of thiolutin addition (<italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub>) and after various times of incubation at 37&#x000b0;C. RNA was extracted and analyzed by northern blotting using probes specific to the <italic>PAB1</italic>, <italic>ACT1</italic>, <italic>MFA2</italic> and CATpG mRNAs. The relative mRNA levels at each time point were obtained by correcting the amount of the test mRNA to the amount of 25S rRNA. Although <italic>ts</italic> mutants contain less 25S rRNA than the control strain, the 25S rRNA was used as an internal control, because its amount does not change significantly during the time frame in which mRNA half-lives were analyzed. Similar results were obtained when the scR1 RNA, which is transcribed by RNA polymerase III, was used as an internal control. Each of the mRNAs tested showed a significant stabilization in the <italic>rrp43</italic> mutant strains relative to the control strain (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf545f5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf545f6">6</xref>). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf545f5">5</xref>B shows the graph of <italic>PAB1</italic> mRNA decay, which includes data from five independent experiments. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf545f6">6</xref>B shows <italic>ACT1</italic> and CATpG decay based on seven and eight independent experiments, respectively. Stability of the <italic>MFA2</italic> mRNA was also analyzed and this mRNA showed a longer half-life in all of the mutant strains, although the analysis was done only three times (data not shown). The half-lives of the mRNAs tested, shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf545tb3">3</xref>, were estimated from the average values plotted in the graphs of Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf545f5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf545f6">6</xref>. The half-life of the <italic>PAB1</italic> mRNA was 15 min in the control strain and increased to 21 and 25 min in strains <italic>rrp43-2</italic> and <italic>rrp43-1</italic>, respectively. In strain <italic>rrp43-3</italic>, the half-life of the <italic>PAB1</italic> mRNA is very similar to the control strain in the beginning of the assay. However, following longer times of incubation at the non-permissive temperature, the relative amount of the <italic>PAB1</italic> mRNA in <italic>rrp43-3</italic> cells is very similar to the other two mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf545f5">5</xref>B), which indicates a stabilization of this mRNA in each of the three mutants. The half-life of the <italic>ACT1</italic> mRNA increased from 20 min in the control strain to 32 min in <italic>rrp43-2</italic> and &#x0223c;40 min in strains <italic>rrp43-1</italic> and <italic>rrp43-3</italic>. In order to further characterize mRNA decay in the mutant strains isolated in this work, we analyzed the stability of the heterologous CAT (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) gene containing a poly(G) segment at the 3&#x02032;-UTR. A CATpG cassette was inserted into a plasmid under the control of the strong constitutive <italic>PGK1</italic> promoter and the resulting plasmid transformed into the strain YCO44 (control) and the <italic>ts</italic> mutants. The poly(G) segment impairs 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; mRNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c45">45</xref>) and increases the half-life of the CAT mRNA from a few minutes (4 min) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c39">39</xref>) up to 37 min in the control strain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf545f6">6</xref>). Interestingly, the CATpG mRNA half-life was even longer in the <italic>rrp43</italic> mutant strains, increasing from 37 min in the control strain to 52 min in <italic>rrp43-1</italic>, to 65 min in <italic>rrp43-2</italic> and to 62 min in <italic>rrp43-3</italic> cells. Since the poly(G) segment impairs 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; mRNA degradation, we also performed northern blot analysis with a probe specific to the poly(G). This analysis detected a degradation intermediate, corresponding to the poly(G) fragment, at a significantly higher concentration in the mutant strains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf545f6">6</xref>C). Accumulation of this intermediate and the longer half-lives of the <italic>PAB1</italic> and <italic>ACT1</italic> mRNAs provide strong evidence that Rrp43p is required for proper mRNA decay in yeast.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vivo</italic> interactions of Rrp43p with other proteins</title><p>Isolation of the exosome by chromatography from yeast cells results in purification of the entire complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c14">14</xref>), making it difficult to identify pair-wise subunit interactions. Rrp43p interacts with Nip7p both in the two-hybrid and in co-purification assays. Nip7p is also involved in rRNA maturation, but is not an exosome subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c26">26</xref>). In addition, Rrp43p deficiency affects processing of the 18S and 25S rRNA precursors, indicating that it may interact with more factors of the rRNA processing pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c27">27</xref>). In order to understand Rrp43p interactions within the exosome complex and to identify novel factors that interact with this protein, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c28">28</xref>) using strain YCO45 that carries plasmid pBTM-RRP43, encoding a lexA&#x02013;Rrp43p fusion as bait for two-hybrid interactions. A cDNA encoding the Rrp46p exosome subunit was identified among the clones that showed a positive two-hybrid interaction, as determined by growth on medium lacking histidine and &#x003b2;-Gal activity (data not shown). The remaining clones contained cDNAs encoding a proteasome subunit and the 90 kDa subunit of TFIIIB, which are not expected to be involved in RNA metabolism. The specificity of Rrp43p interactions with these proteins needs to be confirmed by other methods and will be addressed elsewhere.</p><p>Since Rrp46p was the only exosome subunit isolated from the pACT-cDNA library screen, we decided to test directly for Rrp43p interactions with individual exosome subunits.

The complete coding sequences of all ORFs were verified by DNA sequence analysis and the plasmids were transformed into strain YCO45. The resulting strains were tested for growth on selective (&#x02013;His) plates and for &#x003b2;-Gal activity. The results showed that Rrp43p interacts strongly only with Rrp46p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf545f7">7</xref>). The remaining exosome subunits did not show interactions with Rrp43p under the conditions tested (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf545f7">7</xref>).</p><p>Amino acid substitutions in the central region of Rrp43p severely affected its function; therefore, it was relevant to test whether these mutations affected the Rrp43p&#x02013;Rrp46p interaction.

The results shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf545f7">7</xref> demonstrated that the Rrp43p <italic>ts</italic> mutants do not interact with Rrp46p, either at 25 (data not shown) or 30&#x000b0;C. Most likely these mutations either cause changes in Rrp43p structure, in such a way that the interaction is no longer possible, or they lie in the domains responsible for interaction with Rrp46p.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Central amino acid substitutions inactivate Rrp43p activity at 37&#x000b0;C</title><p>Rrp43p function has been inferred from its co-purification with the exosome complex and from experiments using strains in which it was conditionally expressed. These studies have shown that Rrp43p deficiency impairs formation of the 5.8S 3&#x02032; end and degradation of the excised 5&#x02032; ETS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c27">27</xref>) and affects processing of the 18S and 25S rRNA precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c27">27</xref>). The finding that Rrp43p specifically interacts with Nip7p, a protein also involved in rRNA maturation but not an exosome subunit, suggests that it is involved in more than one step of pre-rRNA processing. A role for Rrp43p in RNA metabolism is further supported by the fact that it shows sequence similarity to bacterial RNase PH. Furthermore, a fraction of Rrp43p is found in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c26">26</xref>). In order to further characterize the role of Rrp43p in RNA metabolism, in this work we isolated <italic>rrp43 ts</italic> mutants and analyzed their effects <italic>in vivo</italic> on pre-rRNA processing, mRNA degradation and interactions with the exosome.</p><p>Three <italic>rrp43 ts</italic> alleles were isolated, which bear one or more amino acid substitutions in the central region of Rrp43p, ranging from Ser162 to Cys276. In the case of mutant <italic>rrp43-2</italic>, two of the five cysteine residues found in <italic>RRP43</italic> are replaced by tyrosine, which may disrupt disulfide bonds, causing structural changes in the protein. However, <italic>rrp43-1</italic> has only the Val212Ala substitution, and shows the same phenotype with respect to temperature sensitivity. Moreover, the temperature-sensitive phenotype of the mutant strains is not caused by rapid turnover of the mutant proteins, since no reduction of the HA-tagged mutant protein levels was detected for up to 12 h of incubation under non-permissive conditions. The HA is a small tag and does not affect protein function since HA-tagged proteins complement the chromosomal deletion of <italic>RRP43</italic> at the permissive temperature. In addition, the HA tag does not affect the conditional phenotypes of the mutant strains at 37&#x000b0;C. The presence of the mutant proteins after 12 h of incubation at 37&#x000b0;C indicates that they remain stable under non-permissive conditions. Similar results have been reported for conditional mutant alleles of <italic>NOP2</italic>, which are stable for up to 24 h at the non-permissive temperature, as determined by immunoblot analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c46">46</xref>).</p><p>Since it has already been shown that Rrp43p participates in rRNA processing, we intended to analyze the effects of the amino acid changes on Rrp43p function. Formation of the 5.8S rRNA 3&#x02032; end and degradation of the 5&#x02032; ETS are the steps that appear to require the function of an intact exosome, since inactivation of individual subunits blocks these steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c27">27</xref>). Accordingly, the <italic>ts</italic> mutants showed a moderate effect in 5.8S rRNA synthesis, with accumulation of unprocessed 7S pre-rRNA. In addition, slower processing of the 27S pre-rRNA was also observed in the <italic>rrp43 ts</italic> mutants, which is consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c27">27</xref>). The slower processing of the 27S pre-rRNA in the mutants is clearly detected by pulse&#x02013;chase labeling, where it can be visualized up to 8 (<italic>rrp43-1</italic> and <italic>rrp43-2</italic>) or 16 min (<italic>rrp43-3</italic>) after the chase with methionine. Steady-state analysis by northern blot detected a higher 27S pre-rRNA concentration in the mutants, relative to the control strain. However, the band intensity decreases over time at 37&#x000b0;C. Although at a lower rate, the 27S pre-rRNA continues to be processed following incubation at 37&#x000b0;C since there is formation of 5.8S rRNA even after 24 h at 37&#x000b0;C. The molecular mechanism by which the mutations in Rrp43p impair 27S pre-rRNA processing is not known. Therefore, it is not possible to explain why the concentration of this pre-rRNA decreases in the <italic>ts</italic> strains over time at the restrictive temperature. Apparently, a fraction of the 27S pre-rRNA is destabilized and degraded prior to cleavage at sites C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>. Previous studies based on carbon source-regulated depletion of Rrp43p detected a decrease in 5.8S formation and 7S pre-rRNA accumulation only after 4&#x02013;6 h of <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c27">27</xref>). The <italic>ts</italic> strains used in this work show these defects even at the permissive temperature (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf545f3">3</xref>), demonstrating that apparently the mutants provide a more sensitive system for the analysis of Rrp43p function in rRNA processing.</p><p>The control strain shows background formation of an aberrant 23S pre-rRNA, but all of the mutants, especially <italic>rrp43-2</italic>, showed a higher 23S:20S ratio (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf545f3">3</xref>). This pre-rRNA has been considered an aberrant precursor that is formed by direct cleavage of the 35S pre-rRNA at site A<sub>3</sub> (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf545f1">1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c43">43</xref>) when cleavages at sites A<sub>0</sub>, A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> are blocked. Therefore, its appearance has been linked to defects in the pathway leading to 18S rRNA biosynthesis. However, the aberrant 23S pre-rRNA has also been detected in strains deficient for factors specifically involved in 25S and 5.8S rRNA biosynthesis. In this case, its presence has been considered a secondary effect of general inhibition of 35S processing, since rRNA synthesis and ribosome biogenesis are highly concerted events. It is unclear whether the increased relative amount of the aberrant 23S pre-rRNA in the <italic>ts</italic> mutant strains is a secondary effect, because they appear to show allele-specific defects (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf545f3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf545f4">4</xref>), as has been observed for conditional <italic>ts</italic> mutants of <italic>NOP1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c44">44</xref>). Nevertheless, we show here that the <italic>ts</italic> mutants of Rrp43p show a significant relative increase in the 23S pre-rRNA, though to different extents, which is consistent with the proposal that the exosome, together with Dob1p&#x0002f;Mtr4p, degrades aberrant pre-rRNA processing intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c4">4</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Rrp43p is involved in mRNA decay</title><p>As mentioned previously, the findings that several exosome subunits are involved in mRNA degradation and that a fraction of Rrp43p is found in the cytoplasm suggested a role for Rrp43p in mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c47">47</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c24">24</xref>). The analyses performed in this work show that the half-lives of three native <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> mRNAs and of the heterologous reporter mRNA <italic>CATpG</italic> are significantly increased in <italic>rrp43 ts</italic> strains, following inactivation of Rrp43p. For example, the half-life of the <italic>ACT1</italic> mRNA increased 2-fold in the mutant strains relative to the half-life observed in the control strain. All three mRNAs tested showed a similar half-life increase in the mutant strains. The half-life values of native mRNAs obtained here were slightly different from those obtained in other strain backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c49">49</xref>). This could be explained by the RNA polymerase II inhibition method utilized (thiolutin) and by the incubation at 37&#x000b0;C. Secondary effects of cell incubation at 37&#x000b0;C for long time periods have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c13">13</xref>), but no effect was detected on the control strain YCO44 (<italic>RRP43</italic>) subjected to the same conditions. Previous studies on mRNA degradation involving exosome subunits were based on an assay that detects a poly(G)-containing intermediate that is stabilized in strains with defects in Rrp4p, Ski6p&#x0002f;Rrp41p and Csl4p&#x0002f;Ski4p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c19">19</xref>). Similar experiments performed in this work demonstrated the stabilization of an mRNA degradation intermediate in the mutant strains, which supports the hypothesis that Rrp43p can participate directly in mRNA decay. This hypothesis is also supported by the stabilization of the full-length <italic>ACT1</italic> and <italic>PAB1</italic> mRNAs in the <italic>rrp43 ts</italic> strains. Since a fraction of Rrp43p is found in the cytoplasm, we further suggest that it participates in mRNA decay in this cell compartment. Rrp43p inactivation may not have produced a strong effect on mRNA degradation because the main cytoplasmic mRNA turnover pathway involves 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; degradation, whereas 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; degradation, which involves all of the exosome subunits, is more active in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c47">47</xref>). Further experiments are required to characterize a possible Rrp43p role in nuclear pre-mRNA degradation.</p></sec><sec><title>Rrp43p interacts strongly with Rrp46p, but not with other exosome subunits</title><p>The exosome processes rRNA, snRNA, snoRNAs, pre-mRNAs and mRNAs, and its function in all of these processes must be regulated. Therefore, it is expected that the exosome must interact with many factors in order to distinguish and properly process the different substrates. It has already been demonstrated that Rrp43p interacts with Nip7p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c26">26</xref>) and that the proteins Ski2p, Ski3p and Ski8p interact with the cytoplasmic exosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c18">18</xref>). Following Rrp4p characterization as a 5.8S rRNA processing factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c50">50</xref>), the exosome has been purified from yeast cell extracts as a protein complex co-purifying with ProtA&#x02013;Rrp4p, which is also involved in other cellular events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c14">14</xref>). However, it is still unknown how interactions within the complex occur, specifically, what components directly interact. In addition, it is not known whether all of the subunits have a catalytic function or if some may have only a structural function. Most probably, each enzyme of the exosome complex acts preferentially on a different substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c51">51</xref>), and the study of protein&#x02013;protein interactions should shed some light on these questions. For example, experiments with the two-hybrid system were recently used to investigate protein&#x02013;protein interactions within the U6 snRNP complex and contributed to the identification of proteins that interact with U6 RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c52">52</xref>). In this work, the two-hybrid system analyses revealed that Rrp43p interacts strongly with Rrp46p. The <italic>rrp43 ts</italic> mutant proteins did not show any interaction with Rrp46p under the conditions tested, suggesting that the <italic>ts</italic> phenotype is caused by disruption of the Rrp43p&#x02013;Rrp46p interaction, although we cannot exclude the possibility that Rrp43p possesses a catalytic activity that is defective in the <italic>ts</italic> strains. Nevertheless, the finding that Rrp43p interacts with the exosome through Rrp46p fits the model of a multiple enzyme complex, where each subunit would be able to reach its preferred substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf545c53">53</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf545f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Structure of the 35S pre-rRNA and major intermediates of the rRNA processing pathway in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>. The 35S pre-rRNA contains the sequences of the mature 18S, 5.8S and 25S rRNAs separated by two internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) and flanked by two external transcribed spacers (5&#x02032; ETS and 3&#x02032; ETS). Processing of the 35S pre-rRNA starts with endonucleolytic cleavages at sites A<sub>0</sub> (in 5&#x02032; ETS) and A<sub>1</sub>, originating a 5&#x02032; ETS fragment and a 32S pre-rRNA containing the mature 5&#x02032; end of the 18S rRNA. Subsequent processing at site A<sub>2</sub> (in ITS1) yields the 20S and the 27SA<sub>2</sub> pre-rRNAs. The former is processed at site D to 18S rRNA while the latter is processed into the mature 5.8S and 25S rRNAs by two alternative pathways. The major pathway involves cleavage at sites A<sub>3</sub> and B<sub>2</sub>, generating a shorter 5&#x02032; end, and the mature 3&#x02032; end of the 25S rRNA. 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; exonucleolytic cleavage originates the mature 5&#x02032; end of 5.8S rRNA, and processing at sites C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> separates the 7S pre-rRNA from mature 25S rRNA. The 7S pre-rRNA is finally 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; processed to generate mature 5.8S rRNA. In the minor pathway, the 27SA<sub>2</sub> pre-rRNA is processed by a mechanism that produces a 5.8S rRNA with an extra 7&#x02013;8 nt at the 5&#x02032; end. Numbers below the 35S pre-rRNA indicate the position of the probes used in hybridization experiments.
