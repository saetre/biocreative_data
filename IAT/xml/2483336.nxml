Block by 3&#x02013;10 &#x003bc;M Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> was time dependent, described by bimolecular kinetics with binding at &#x0223c;3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and voltage-dependent exit. Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub>, Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub>, and Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> also affected channel gating, primarily by shifting channel activation, consistent with screening a surface charge of 1 e<sup>&#x02212;</sup> per 98 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> from Gouy-Chapman theory. Additionally, inward currents inactivated &#x0223c;35% faster in Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> (vs. Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> or Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub>).

But it has long been recognized that interpretation of such results is complicated. In particular, the whole-cell current is affected by gating as well as permeation. Ions can modify gating by a variety of mechanisms, including screening of surface charge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frankenhaeuser and Hodgkin, 1957</xref>), effects of pore occupancy on gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Swenson and Armstrong, 1981</xref>), and binding to sites outside the pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gilly and Armstrong, 1982</xref>).</p><p>The classical method for separating gating from permeation is the instantaneous current&#x02013;voltage relationship (IIV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952</xref>). Channels are first activated by a fixed depolarizing pulse, followed by repolarization to a wide range of voltages. The current measured &#x0201c;instantaneously&#x0201d; at each new voltage reflects the current through the population of channels opened by the prior depolarizing pulse (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Thus, the number of channels open is constant, so any variation in current must reflect the effect of voltage on permeation through those open channels. The IIV method makes several assumptions, most critically that currents can be accurately measured before gating processes affect the number of channels open (see Materials and methods).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>The instantaneous current&#x02013;voltage protocol (IIV) used to examine permeation and block.

In this study, we examine the concentration dependence of current from 100 nM to 110 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (or Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>), from &#x0002b;100 to &#x02212;150 mV. This dataset provides a detailed yet large-scale view of how voltage and ion concentration affect permeation. One major goal was to examine the basis of selectivity between Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, for a channel that exhibits similar ionic currents with the two ions, but is selective for Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> by other criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Serrano et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>We also found that divalent cations modify gating, by two distinct mechanisms. First, Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, and Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> shift channel activation, in a manner largely consistent with screening of surface charge. This contrasts with high voltage&#x02013;activated (HVA) Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Byerly et al., 1985</xref>) and Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hille et al., 1975</xref>), where Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> has larger effects than Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, suggesting that Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> can both bind to and screen surface charges. This implies that some or all of the &#x0201c;surface charge&#x0201d; is specific to a particular ion channel. Second, Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> speeds inactivation of inward currents (compared with Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>), and the effect correlates with pore occupancy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Whole-Cell Recording</title><p>Whole-cell recordings were performed from HEK293 cells stably transfected with rat Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 1999</xref>) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Serrano et al., 1999</xref>).

Because of channel rundown and other time-dependent changes, we recorded first in a reference solution (usually 2 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or 2 mM Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>), then in a test solution, and finally after return to the reference solution. The effects of one or two different test solutions were examined in each cell. The average of currents in the reference solution (recorded before and after application of the test solution) was used as the control value. For the experiments varying Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> or Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub>, rundown was 17 &#x000b1; 9% (mean &#x000b1; SD, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 60), comparing the sum of the absolute values of currents at all voltages from the IIV protocols recorded in the reference solution, before vs. after a test solution. Cells with &#x0003e;40% rundown by that criterion were rejected.</p><p>The leak current tended to be nonlinear in &#x0201c;leaky&#x0201d; cells, producing artifactual time-independent outward currents at strongly depolarized voltages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Obejero-Paz et al., 2004</xref>). Most cells with &#x0003e;0.2 nA of inward holding current at the holding potential were excluded from analysis. This criterion was relaxed for &#x0223c;15% of the cells recorded in 0.1&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;M Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> or Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub>, since the leak tended to be high in that condition, but currents were also large (giving a high signal-to-leak ratio). In such cells, currents inactivated essentially to zero except at the most positive voltages (well above the reversal potential), where the contribution of leak to the measured current was estimated to be &#x0003c;10%.</p><p>For a few cells, to reduce 60 Hz noise, a section of baseline (lasting an integral number of 60 Hz cycles, usually 1 or 2) was fitted to a 60 Hz sine wave plus several harmonics (usually 9), adjusting the amplitude and phase for the best fit. The sum of the sine waves was then subtracted from the entire record. This was done with a program written by S.W. Jones in Microsoft Visual Basic v.6.</p><p>Effects of ions on permeation were assessed using IIV relations, measured by fitting single exponentials to the decay of current following a brief (2-ms) step to &#x0002b;60 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Serrano et al., 2000</xref>). The exponential fit began when the tail currents reached a peak, as an estimate of the current at the time when accurate voltage clamp was actually achieved, and extended 20 ms into the voltage steps. The amplitude of the fitted exponential at the starting point of the fit was used for the IIV measurements shown. In most of our experimental conditions, the time course of block is fast, i.e., pore occupancy has reached steady state by the time the IIV is measured. The time course of block can be resolved by careful analysis in certain conditions (1 mM Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> in 2 mM Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Serrano et al., 2000</xref>; 10 &#x003bc;M Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figs. 7&#x02013;9</xref><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig"/><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig"/>), but the single exponential fit did not include those very fast (&#x003c4; &#x0003d; 0.1&#x02013;0.2 ms) components, so we interpret the IIV measurements as representing steady-state block in all experimental conditions in this study.</p><p>Chord conductances (G) were calculated from<disp-formula id="fd2"><label>(2)</label><tex-math id="M2">\documentclass[10pt]{article} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pmc} \usepackage[Euler]{upgreek} \pagestyle{empty} \oddsidemargin -1.0in \begin{document} \begin{equation*}G=I/(V-V_{R}),\end{equation*}\end{document}</tex-math></disp-formula>where <italic>V<sub>R</sub></italic> was estimated by linear interpolation between the two data points on either side of reversal.

Chord conductances calculated from the I-V protocol are often used as a measure of channel activation, but this assumes that the open-channel IIV relationship is linear, which is far from true for T-channels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). On the other hand, the P<sub>O,r</sub> is undefined at the reversal potential, and subject to large error nearby. In principle, this singularity can be eliminated by calculating P<sub>O,r</sub> from chord conductances rather than currents. However, the additional calculation (dividing by driving force) can increase error as well, so we present P<sub>O,r</sub> values from the method that we judge to be most accurate (as noted in figure legends). The maximal P<sub>O,r</sub> at strongly depolarized voltages often exceeded 1.0 (in 2 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub>, 1.10 &#x000b1; 0.08, mean &#x000b1; SD, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 52), probably because the 2-ms prepulse to &#x0002b;60 mV in the IIV protocol did not precisely match the time of maximal P<sub>O</sub>.

P<sub>O,r</sub> was fitted a Boltzmann relationship raised to the fourth power for each cell, with the slope factor the same in reference and test solutions, using the Solver function in Excel to minimize the sum of squared errors. Log(&#x003c4;<sub>IIV</sub>) was linearly interpolated to the value at 2 ms from data at &#x02212;70 to &#x02212;120 mV (see Fig. S7, A and B, and Fig. S15, A and B).

Cells were selected primarily based on the time course and shape of the tail current near &#x02212;100 mV with the IIV protocol. In some cells, series resistance error was also evaluated from the effect of partial inactivation on the time course of tail currents at &#x02212;100 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Serrano et al., 1999</xref>). The average series resistance was 0.75 M&#x003a9; (assuming 80% compensation), which would give 16 mV of error for a 21-nA current. This is significant for the largest currents observed in this study, but we note that use of the IIV protocol eliminates the negative slope conductance region normally observed for calcium currents. Series resistance error would selectively underestimate the chord conductance in low Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> by &#x0223c;13% (calculated for a 16-mV error with 120-mV driving force). The error will be proportionally less for the smaller currents observed with millimolar concentrations of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (e.g., &#x0223c;5% error for the conductance at the most negative voltage in 110 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>). Put another way, the estimated error was 1% for each 13 nS of conductance. No correction was made for this effect.</p><p>For measurement of I-V relations, peak inward currents were &#x0003c;2.5 nA in all conditions (except 100 nM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> or Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub>), so errors should be &#x0003c;2 mV (with 0.75 M&#x003a9; of uncompensated series resistance). Errors in T<sub>Peak</sub> should also be small, since that value was also measured from inward currents with the I-V protocol. Activation curves were calculated from the I-V/IIV ratio, and the error can be significant for the IIV. In the worst case (100 nM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> or Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub>), at the measured 50% activation voltage (&#x02212;50 mV), there would be &#x0223c;7 mV of error for the IIV. The error would be less than half that value at 10 &#x003bc;M Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> or Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub>, and even smaller in all other conditions (e.g., for 110 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub>, 2 mV error near half activation). Errors where &#x003c4;<sub>IIV</sub> &#x0003d; 2 ms will be significant (&#x0223c;15 mV) for the large inward tail currents at 0.1&#x02013;10 &#x003bc;M Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> or Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub>, &#x0223c;7 mV in 110 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub>, but &#x0003c;5 mV in other conditions. Overall, activation measurements should be reliable (except perhaps at 100 nM), although small shifts (&#x0003c;5 mV) should be interpreted with caution. For the relatively small currents with 2 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> or Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> the estimated errors in our voltage shift measurements are &#x0003c;1 mV, so the small effects in <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12 (C&#x02013;F)</xref> should not be affected by series resistance error (which would be similar in Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> vs. Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> in any case).

It is immediately apparent that inward currents are substantially increased in both test solutions. With 100 nM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub>, outward currents are also increased. This illustrates several well-known features of calcium channel permeation. First, in the near absence of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub>, channels are highly permeable to monovalents (in our conditions, Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>). Second, the inward current through calcium channels is not saturated at the physiological concentration (2 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub>). Third, Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup><sub>i</sub> can carry large outward currents, but these outward currents are reduced by 2 or 110 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub>.

Qualitatively, if channels inactivate more rapidly in Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub>, fewer channels would be open when peak current is reached, which would decrease the measured channel activation, especially at more negative voltages (where activation is relatively slow). Faster inactivation could also shorten the time to peak current. And to the extent that &#x003c4;<sub>IIV</sub> depends on inactivation, it would be faster in Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> than in Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub>. That is, faster inactivation in Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> would produce a downward shift of the activation, &#x003c4;<sub>IIV</sub>, and T<sub>Peak</sub> curves, which would appear to be a rightward shift along the voltage axis for activation and &#x003c4;<sub>IIV</sub>, but a leftward shift for time-to-peak (see <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12, D&#x02013;F</xref>). We explored this interpretation by simulating the effect of faster inactivation on these measurements, using the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Serrano et al.

The model parameters were varied to optimize the fit to the data of <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12 (D&#x02013;F)</xref>, with only the microscopic inactivation rate constant allowed to differ between Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> and Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> (see Materials and methods).

We conclude that the subtle differences in gating observed between Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> and Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> result primarily from the more rapid inactivation for inward currents with Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We report effects on Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 T-type calcium channels of varying Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, over a wide range of concentration (100 nM to 110 mM) and voltage (&#x02212;150 to &#x0002b;100 mV).

These results dramatically contrast with most HVA calcium channels, where currents are approximately twofold larger for Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> vs. Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub>. Furthermore, we find that the pore binds Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> and Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> with similar apparent affinity, either for block of currents carried by Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> or for permeation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 F</xref>).</p><p>However, some measures of selectivity report larger differences between Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>.

Second, outward currents are larger with 2 mM Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> vs. Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> near &#x0002b;60 mV, demonstrating weaker block of currents carried by Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup><sub>i</sub> by Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub>, although this effect is reduced at more strongly depolarized voltages (Fig. S9). Third, block by Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> is weaker with Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub>, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Serrano et al., 2000</xref>). This effect is also seen for other pore-blocking ions, including Y<sup>3&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Obejero-Paz et al., 2004</xref>) and Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Obejero-Paz et al., 2008</xref>). We conclude that a T-channel, like an L- or N-channel, can tell the difference between a Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> ion and a Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> ion. However, not all aspects of permeation and block are affected to the same extent by Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> and Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub>.

This effect is small for the relatively linear IIV relationship observed with Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> as charge carrier, but slope conductances are approximately twofold larger than chord conductance at 2 or 110 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (Fig. S21). Block by Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> reduces the slope conductance to near zero at voltages and concentrations where block is far from complete (Fig. S21, E and F; compare to Fig. S12, C and D). We do not mean that it is incorrect to use slope conductances as a measure of ion permeation, but it is worth noting that chord and slope conductances can give substantially different numerical values.</p></sec><sec><title>Time-dependent Block by Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub></title><p>For most conditions in this study ion entry and exit from the pore are rapid with respect to the time course of gating. The exception was 3&#x02013;10 &#x003bc;M Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. From three different experimental approaches (single channel gating, noise analysis of macroscopic currents, and macroscopic tail currents), we estimate that Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> blocked Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 channels at a bimolecular rate of 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, with little voltage dependence from &#x02212;20 to &#x02212;80 mV (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>).

For example, the pseudo first-order Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> entry rate would be 30 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 100 nM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> (slow with respect to channel gating, including inactivation) or 3,000 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 0.1 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> (not fully resolved by our voltage clamp). Detection of blocking kinetics also depends on the extent of block, which is weak at extreme voltages. We did not see evidence for time-dependent block in tail currents at 10 &#x003bc;M Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>; possible contributing factors include slightly weaker block by Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, and a possible difference in Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> entry rate.</p><p>Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> block has a biphasic voltage dependence, becoming weaker either with strong depolarization or strong hyperpolarization (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, C and F</xref>; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 F</xref>). Qualitatively, this agrees with previous results on T channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fukushima and Hagiwara, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lux et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shcheglovitov et al., 2007</xref>) and HVA channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carbone et al., 1997</xref>). From &#x02212;90 to &#x02212;20 mV, voltage dependence results primarily from changes in exit rate (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). At more depolarized voltages, we do not have separate measurements of entry vs. exit rates for Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, but relief of Y<sup>3&#x0002b;</sup> block by strong depolarization primarily reflected accelerated exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Obejero-Paz et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Permeation Models and Mechanisms</title><p>Our results are consistent with the traditional view that calcium channel selectivity results from ion&#x02013;ion competition in a single-file pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almers and McCleskey, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hess and Tsien, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 1993</xref>), but also with alternative approaches such as Poisson-Nernst-Planck theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nonner and Eisenberg, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boda et al., 2006</xref>). The simple models used here, e.g., fitting V<sub>R</sub> shifts to GHK theory (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), and fitting the concentration dependence of chord conductances to the sum of block and permeation components (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), are essentially empirical approaches to data analysis, as opposed to full theories for ion selectivity and permeation. Such analysis can also be applied to current&#x02013;voltage relationships predicted by a particular quantitative model. We expect that the dataset reported here (Table S2) will be useful to constrain and test future quantitative descriptions of calcium channel permeation.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of Channel Activation</title><p>We also examined effects of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> on channel gating, measuring channel activation as the relative open probability (P<sub>O,r</sub>), the ratio of the peak current evoked by the I-V protocol to the maximally activated current (from the IIV protocol). Many studies on calcium channels use chord conductances as a measure of channel activation, but that is valid only if the instantaneous I-V for an open channel is linear. That is clearly not true for Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Serrano et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">2000</xref>). The voltage dependence of chord conductances from the I-V protocol differs dramatically from the expected Boltzmann-like relationship (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11, A and B</xref>). However, the G-V relationship in 2 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> is well described by a Boltzmann relationship, if data above &#x02212;20 mV are not included. Compared with our P<sub>O,r</sub> analysis, the V<sub>1/2</sub> is too negative by &#x0223c;13 mV, and the steepness of the activation curve is greatly exaggerated (Fig. S6). The &#x0201c;maximal&#x0201d; conductance in that analysis occurs at &#x02212;20 mV, where a comparison of I-V and IIV protocols clearly demonstrates that channels are not maximally activated (Fig. S22).</p><p>The voltage dependence of block can affect voltage shifts measured from the position of peak current with the I-V protocol, or from chord conductances, so such measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shcheglovitov et al., 2007</xref>) may not accurately measure shifts in channel gating. Conversely, measurement of fractional inhibition from the I-V protocol (using either currents or conductances) would not accurately estimate the extent of pore block, since that measurement would be affected by both block and by surface charge shifts. For example, measurements from the I-V protocol overestimate the extent of Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> block (and its voltage dependence) at voltages where the activation curve is shifted by Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> (analysis not shown), and the shift in peak inward current (Fig. S14, C and D) greatly exceeds the voltage shift measured using P<sub>O,r</sub> (Fig. S16 A).</p><p>Channel activation is also shifted by extracellular protons, and the effect of H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> is reduced by divalent cations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Talavera et al., 2003a</xref>). That is, reducing the pH from 7.2 (as used in the present study) might shift activation to more negative voltages, especially in low Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub>. A differential effect of H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> ions would tend to underestimate the effects of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub>, as measured at pH 7.2. This possibility remains to be evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> vs. Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub>: Gating</title><p>Although Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> and Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> shifted activation similarly, direct comparison of our three measures of voltage dependence (P<sub>O,r</sub>, &#x003c4;<sub>IIV</sub>, T<sub>Peak</sub>) in 2 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> vs. Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> showed subtle differences (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12, C&#x02013;F</xref>). Simulations indicate that these differences can be explained by faster inactivation of inward currents in Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub>. Kinetic coupling of activation to inactivation means that changes in either process can appear to affect the other, at the macroscopic level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Talavera and Nilius, 2006</xref>). It has long been appreciated that channel &#x0201c;activation curves&#x0201d; do not solely reflect the activation process for a rapidly inactivating channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stimers et al., 1985</xref>), and the time course of activation (including T<sub>Peak</sub>) is also affected by inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gonoi and Hille, 1987</xref>).</p><p>The inactivation rate increased with Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12 A</xref>), correlating with the concentration dependence of Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> block of Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> current (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, C and D</xref>). Therefore, we propose that Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> occupancy of the pore speeds inactivation, compared with pores occupied by Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> or Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. Although there is ample precedent for effects on gating of pore occupancy by specific ions, it is not clear why Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> would have this particular effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Surface Charge Effects on Gating of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Channels</title><p>Activation occurs at more positive voltages in Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> vs. Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub>, for both Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hille et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ohmori and Yoshii, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanck and Sheets, 1992</xref>) and HVA Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ohmori and Yoshii, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wilson et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cota and Stefani, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Byerly et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kass and Krafte, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ganitkevich et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zamponi and Snutch, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smith et al., 1993</xref>).

Evolutionarily, based on analysis of conservation of amino acid sequence, Ca<sub>V</sub>3 channels are almost equidistant between Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels vs. HVA (Ca<sub>V</sub>1 and Ca<sub>V</sub>2) channels. One known difference is that IQ and EF hand-like domains in the proximal C terminus are conserved among Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and HVA channels, but absent in Ca<sub>V</sub>3. It seems highly unlikely that these intracellular domains are causally related to surface charge effects observed for extracellular cations, but this is a precedent for functional characteristics shared among Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and HVA channels, but not Ca<sub>V</sub>3.</p><p>Our data are generally consistent with a classical Gouy-Chapman model, where ions shift channel activation by screening a uniform surface charge. In contrast, the larger voltage shifts with Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> have led to the suggestion that Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>o</sub> can also bind to the surface charge, i.e., Gouy-Chapman-Stern theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hille et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Byerly et al., 1985</xref>). It now seems abundantly clear that the &#x0201c;surface charge&#x0201d; is specific to a particular channel.
