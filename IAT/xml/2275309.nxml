Previously we have demonstrated that human neutrophils isolated from allergic asthmatics express a functional Fc&#x003b5;RI, and therefore it was of importance to examine the factors regulating its expression. In this study, we found that neutrophils from allergic asthmatics showed increased expression of Fc&#x003b5;RI-&#x003b1; chain surface protein, total protein and mRNA compared with those from allergic non asthmatics and healthy donors (p&#x0003c;0.001). Interestingly, in neutrophils isolated from allergic asthmatics, Fc&#x003b5;RI-&#x003b1; chain surface protein and mRNA expression were significantly greater during the pollen season than outside the pollen season (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;9, P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.001), an effect which was not observed either in the allergic non asthmatic group or the healthy donors (p&#x0003e;0.05). Allergen exposure did not affect other surface markers of neutrophils such as CD16/Fc&#x003b3;RIII or IL-17R. In contrast to stimulation with IgE, neutrophils incubated with TH2 cytokines IL-9, GM-CSF, and IL-4, showed enhanced Fc&#x003b5;RI-&#x003b1; chain surface expression. In conclusion, these results suggest that enhanced Fc&#x003b5;RI expression in human neutrophils from allergic asthmatics during the pollen season can make them more susceptible to the biological effects of IgE, providing a possible new mechanism by which neutrophils contribute to allergic asthma.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the bronchial airways which has been increasing in prevalence during the last four decades.

Moreover, TH-2 cytokines, highly expressed in human allergic asthma, mimicked seasonal pollen exposure <italic>in</italic> vitro and up-regulated Fc&#x003b5;RI expression in neutrophils from allergic asthmatics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001921-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001921-g004">4</xref>) but not from allergic non asthmatics or healthy donors (data not shown).

Later, Fc&#x003b5;RI was also detected on human cutaneous Langerhans cells, monocytes from patients with allergic disorders, eosinophils from patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome or asthma, on platelets, circulating dendritic cells and bronchial epithelial cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001921-Kinet1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001921-Campbell1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

We assessed the expression of Fc&#x003b5;RI in human neutrophils among the three groups of individuals in two ways. First, we determined the mRNA expression of Fc&#x003b5;RI-&#x003b1; chain using <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization. Second, we compared surface and total protein expression of Fc&#x003b5;RI-&#x003b1; chain using flow cytometry and immunofluorescence, respectively. These analyses showed that neutrophils in allergic asthmatics but not in allergic non asthmatics or healthy individuals expressed high levels of mRNA, surface and intracellular protein Fc&#x003b5;RI. In accordance with our results, high levels of Fc&#x003b5;RI expression have been observed in monocytes, eosinophils and Langerhans cell from allergic subjects compared with healthy donors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001921-Kinet1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, heterogeneity in Fc&#x003b5;RI expression is observed within neutrophils from allergic asthmatic at the level of both mRNA and protein, suggesting that Fc&#x003b5;RI expression in neutrophils is highly regulated.</p><p>We then investigated whether seasonal exposure to allergen affects Fc&#x003b5;RI in neutrophils from the three groups. Our data clearly demonstrated specific up-regulation of Fc&#x003b5;RI at the mRNA and protein level in neutrophils isolated <italic>ex vivo</italic> during the pollen season (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001921-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Expression of other surface receptors by human neutrophils was not affected, suggesting that Fc&#x003b5;RI may play a role in allergic asthma during pollen season.</p><p>Studies that have investigated the regulation of Fc&#x003b5;RI <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, have shown a correlation between the serum IgE level and Fc&#x003b5;RI expression on the cell surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001921-Malveaux1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001921-Yamaguchi1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain the basis of this correlation. Either a common factor was capable of regulating the level of both serum IgE and IgE receptors, or the number of receptors was modulated by serum IgE concentrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001921-Quarto1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001921-Furuichi1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Subsequent studies have demonstrated that monomeric IgE up-regulates Fc&#x003b5;RI expression on human mast cells and mouse basophils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001921-Yamaguchi1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001921-Yano1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001921-Lantz1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. The proposed mechanism of this up regulation is that IgE protects the cell bound receptors from degradation during receptor recycling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001921-Kinet1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Mast cells from IgE deficient mice express low levels of Fc&#x003b5;RI unless up-regulated by <italic>in vitro</italic> incubation of these cells with IgE or injection of IgE <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001921-Yamaguchi2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. However, our data revealed that <italic>in vitro</italic> incubation with IgE has no effect on Fc&#x003b5;RI surface expression in human neutrophils isolated from allergic asthmatic (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001921.s001">Figure S1</xref>,A) or allergic non asthmatic individuals (data not shown). This phenomenon may occur through various plausible mechanisms. First, stabilization by IgE, which prevents Fc&#x003b5;RI receptor internalization and degradation, may not have occurred in neutrophils, in contrast to human basophils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001921-MacGlashan1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001921-MacGlashan2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Second, the preformed pool of Fc&#x003b5;RI receptor was possibly not adequately transported to the cell surface. Third, the basal level of Fc&#x003b5;RI protein synthesis was not maintained in cultured neutrophils, due to their well documented low transcriptional and translational capacity, thus preventing intracellular pool and cell surface replenishment. Fourth, it may be that IgE prevents Fc&#x003b5;RI surface loss within 24 hrs of culture but simultaneous apoptosis occurring in neutrophils with associating membrane changes may disguise this effect. Further in depth studies are needed to address these possibilities.</p><p>Regulation of Fc&#x003b5;RI expression is not entirely dependent on IgE. Mast cells from IgE deficient mice express low levels of Fc&#x003b5;RI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001921-Yamaguchi2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> which suggests that the basal levels are under the control of other regulators. In this study, we have clearly demonstrated that Th-2 cytokines IL-9, GM-CSF and IL-4, upregulate Fc&#x003b5;RI protein expression in human neutrophils. These data are in agreement with a positive role of IL-4 and IL-9 in the transcription of Fc&#x003b5;RI-&#x003b1; chain in human mast cells, eosinophils from patients with atopic dermatitis and human dendritic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001921-Xia1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001921-Kraft1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001921-Terada1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, although IL-4 did significantly increase Fc&#x003b5;RI surface expression in human neutrophils it's effect at mRNA level was not consistent which may suggest that IL-4 affects Fc&#x003b5;RI expression by a different mechanism than GM-CSF and IL-9. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that GM-CSF upregulates Fc&#x003b5;RI in human neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001921-g003">Figure 3</xref>). As a key cytokine with pleotropic activity on neutrophil function, GM-CSF also has the ability to induce other neutrophil surface receptors, including the low affinity IgE receptor CD23/Fc&#x003b5;RII <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001921-Yamaoka1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Taken together, our data highlight the fact that Th-2 cytokines directly and indirectly account for the pathophysiologic manifestations of allergy and are involved in inducing Fc&#x003b5;RI, hence amplifying the IgE/ IgE receptors network.</p><p>In previous studies, we and others have demonstrated that Fc&#x003b5;RI dependent activation of neutrophils from allergic asthmatics leads to IL-8 release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001921-Gounni2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001921-Monteseirin1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, a potent neutrophilic chemoattractant, as well as proteases that may damage airway mucosa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001921-Monteseirin1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001921-Monteseirin2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001921-Monteseirin3">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.

In light of these studies and our present data, we propose that, <italic>in vivo</italic>, allergen exposure in sensitized asthmatics not only enhances neutrophil recruitment to the site of allergen exposure but also upregulates expression of Fc&#x003b5;RI by these cells which may therefore participate in IgE-mediated allergic inflammatory responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Subjects</title><p>This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada and written informed consent was obtained from each participant.
