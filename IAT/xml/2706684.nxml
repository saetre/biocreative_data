Women are more likely to quit smoking during pregnancy than at any other time in their lives, but some pregnant women continue to smoke. A recent genome-wide association study demonstrated an association between a common polymorphism (rs1051730) in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gene cluster (<italic>CHRNA5&#x02013;CHRNA3&#x02013;CHRNB4</italic>) and both smoking quantity and nicotine dependence. We aimed to test whether the same polymorphism that predisposes to greater cigarette consumption would also reduce the likelihood of smoking cessation in pregnancy. We studied 7845 pregnant women of European descent from the South-West of England. Using 2474 women who smoked regularly immediately pre-pregnancy, we analysed the association between the rs1051730 risk allele and both smoking cessation during pregnancy and smoking quantity. Each additional copy of the risk allele was associated with a 1.27-fold higher odds (95% CI 1.11&#x02013;1.45) of continued smoking during pregnancy (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0006). Adjustment for pre-pregnancy smoking quantity weakened, but did not remove this association [odds ratio (OR) 1.20 (95% CI 1.03&#x02013;1.39); <italic>P</italic> = 0.018]. The same risk allele was also associated with heavier smoking before pregnancy and in the first, but not the last, trimester [OR for smoking 10+ cigarettes/day versus 1&#x02013;9/day in first trimester = 1.30 (95% CI 1.13&#x02013;1.50); <italic>P</italic> = 0.0003]. To conclude, we have found strong evidence of association between the rs1051730 variant and an increased likelihood of continued smoking in pregnancy and have confirmed the previously observed association with smoking quantity. Our data support the role of genetic factors in influencing smoking cessation during pregnancy.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Maternal smoking in pregnancy is associated with a number of adverse outcomes including fetal growth restriction and various pregnancy complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP216C1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP216C2">2</xref>). Clinical trials of interventions to promote smoking cessation have effectively reduced smoking and the prevalence of low birth weight and preterm birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP216C3">3</xref>), but despite a strong and direct public health message, many pregnant women continue to smoke. In the year 2000, prevalence estimates for the USA, Sweden and UK, were 12, 13 and 20%, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP216C2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP216C4">4</xref>).</p><p>Observational data suggest that 20&#x02013;40% of female smokers quit during pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP216C2">2</xref>). Smoking cessation during pregnancy is influenced by multiple factors, including maternal age, socioeconomic position, parity and partner's smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP216C5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP216C6">6</xref>). In addition, genetic susceptibility to the addictive properties of nicotine is likely to be important. Evidence from twin studies suggests that up to 70% of the variance in nicotine dependence is due to genetic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP216C7">7</xref>). Consistent with this, a study of 840 adoptive families demonstrated high concordance between the smoking behaviour of adoptees and their biological full siblings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP216C8">8</xref>).</p><p>Recently, a genome-wide association study of 15 771 Europeans showed that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP rs1051730) on chromosome 15q24 was associated with smoking quantity and nicotine dependence [assessed by questionnaire incorporating the Fagerstrom test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP216C9">9</xref>)] among smokers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP216C10">10</xref>). The polymorphism was equally prevalent in smokers and never-smokers, suggesting that it does not predispose to smoking initiation, but to dependence among those who smoke. Each additional copy of the minor, T, allele of the rs1051730 variant was associated with an increase of 0.095 (95% CI 0.075&#x02013;0.115) smoking quantity units, approximately equal to one cigarette per day (<italic>P</italic> = 6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;20</sup>). The SNP lies within the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gene, <italic>CHRNA3</italic>, in a linkage disequilibrium block containing two other strong candidate genes, <italic>CHRNA5</italic> and <italic>CHRNB4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP216C10">10</xref>). A recent study showed that the minor allele of the missense polymorphism, D398N, in <italic>CHRNA5</italic> (rs16969968), which is highly correlated with rs1051730 (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> &#x0003e; 0.79), conferred a reduced response to a nicotinic agonist <italic>in vitro</italic> (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP216C11">11</xref>). This polymorphism may therefore be the functional variant responsible for the association with smoking quantity.</p><p>We considered that pregnancy would be a situation characterized by considerable health and social pressure to stop smoking and proposed that the same genetic factor that leads individual smokers to consume more cigarettes could also influence smoking cessation in pregnancy. We aimed to test the hypothesis that the rs1051730 risk allele is associated with an increased likelihood of continued smoking in pregnancy.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The basic characteristics of the study subjects are presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="DDP216TB1">1</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="DDP216TB1" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1.</label><caption><p>Basic characteristics of study subjects</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Study</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ALSPAC</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">EFSOCH</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total number of pregnant women<sup>a</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6998</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">847</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Median age in years (IQR)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">28 (25&#x02013;31)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">31 (27&#x02013;34)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Median pre-pregnancy BMI in kg/m<sup>2</sup> (IQR)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.19 (20.47&#x02013;24.55)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.98 (21.12&#x02013;25.52)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Percentage of women who had ever smoked regularly</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">49</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">29</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Percentage of women who smoked regularly just before pregnancy</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">32</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">28</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Percentage of women who smoked regularly during the first trimester of pregnancy<sup>b</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">23</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">18</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Percentage of women who smoked regularly during the third trimester of pregnancy<sup>c</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">19</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">14</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>IQR, inter-quartile range.</p></fn><fn><p><sup>a</sup>Includes women of white ethnicity with rs1051730 genotype and data available on whether or not they smoked regularly during the first 3 months of pregnancy.</p></fn><fn><p><sup>b</sup>Women were questioned during the 18th week (ALSPAC) or the 28th week (EFSOCH) of pregnancy about their smoking behaviour during the first 3 months of pregnancy.</p></fn><fn><p><sup>c</sup>Women were questioned during the 32nd week (ALSPAC) or the 28th week (EFSOCH) of pregnancy about their current smoking behaviour.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><sec id="s2a"><title>Association between rs1051730 genotype and the odds of continued smoking in pregnancy</title><p>We observed a strong association between the rs1051730 risk allele and the odds of continuing to smoke in pregnancy.

We have also shown that the same risk allele is associated with the quantity of cigarettes smoked before pregnancy and in the first trimester. The association of the risk allele with continued smoking in pregnancy was reduced after adjustment for pre-pregnancy smoking quantity, but was not removed. This is consistent with the risk allele having two related effects, each reflecting a predisposition to nicotine dependence: (i) an effect on the likelihood of quitting through a primary effect on smoking quantity, whereby carriers find it harder to quit because they smoke in greater quantities and (ii) an effect on the likelihood of quitting, regardless of smoking quantity at the time of attempting to quit.</p><p>Previously, Thorgeirsson <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP216C10">10</xref>) observed that the same variant was associated with smoking quantity in smokers, but not with smoking prevalence, implicating the variant in nicotine dependence rather than smoking initiation. Our data are consistent with this and with other studies reporting associations between SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with rs1051730 and nicotine dependence or smoking quantity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP216C12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP216C14">14</xref>). The lack of association with smoking quantity in our third trimester smokers may reflect this group being enriched with the most nicotine-dependent subjects. Two additional studies have demonstrated highly significant associations between rs1051730 and lung cancer (OR &#x02248; 1.3; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>) but found either weak or no evidence of association with smoking behaviour, suggesting that further work is necessary to determine whether the variant has a role in disease susceptibility independently of smoking behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP216C15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP216C16">16</xref>).</p><p>We observed a trend to reduced birth weight with each copy of the rs1051730 risk allele carried by the mother (<italic>P</italic> = 0.07). The size and direction of effect were consistent with those expected, given the smoking quantity&#x02013;birth weight and smoking quantity&#x02013;risk allele associations. However, the sample size was limited. Further well-powered studies are needed to investigate more thoroughly the hypothesized associations with fetal growth.</p><p>Our finding is the first robust association between a common genetic variant and smoking cessation. Previous candidate gene association studies investigating smoking cessation have used much smaller sample sizes and have either shown inconsistent results or require replication in independent larger studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP216C17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP216C18">18</xref>). While our statistical evidence does not meet generally accepted criteria for &#x02018;genome-wide significance&#x02019; (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>), the prior genome-wide association with smoking quantity (<italic>P</italic> = 6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;20</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP216C10">10</xref>), coupled with the strong evidence for association in our study (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0003&#x02013;0.0006), suggests that our result is unlikely to be a false-positive.</p><p>Motivated by concern for the health of their babies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP216C2">2</xref>), women are more likely to quit smoking in pregnancy than at any other time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP216C17">17</xref>). However, many pregnant women continue to smoke. Our data support the role of genetic factors in predisposing to this detrimental behavioural phenotype. The association is not deterministic: approximately one-third of women carrying two copies of the risk allele did quit smoking in pregnancy. However, the 1.66-fold (95% CI 1.21&#x02013;2.26) higher odds of continued smoking in women with two risk alleles (11% of the total) versus women with none (44%) is a strong evidence that the polymorphism is a susceptibility factor for an important human behavioural trait. This may have implications for the design of interventions to help women quit smoking in pregnancy, and possibly for smoking cessation strategies more generally. It will be important to investigate this possibility.</p><p>There are some limitations to our study. First, data on smoking behaviour were self-reported. Multiple validation studies using biochemical markers such as cotinine have demonstrated that pregnant women may not admit to smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP216C2">2</xref>), so our prevalence figures are likely to be underestimates. In addition, examination of our data suggests that non-responders in the third trimester in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) study were more likely to be pre-pregnancy smokers than were responders (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp216/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S2</ext-link>). However, such sources of error in the phenotypic data are likely to result in increased noise and reduced power rather than confounding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP216C19">19</xref>). Importantly, the associations we observed are unlikely to be due to bias in self-reporting of smoking cessation. Any bias in our study of pregnant women is more likely to be towards a null result than a false-positive result. This is because while pregnant smokers may falsely report that they have quit, the reverse situation, in which pregnant women falsely report smoking, is extremely unlikely. Women who continue to smoke in pregnancy are expected to have a higher frequency of the risk allele due to higher nicotine dependence. If a proportion of these women falsely declared that they had quit smoking, this would cause the group of &#x02018;quitters&#x02019; to be enriched with the risk allele, causing the association to be biased towards the null. Another limitation is that our study participants may not fully represent the general population. We have previously shown that Exeter Family Study of Childhood Health (EFSOCH) study participants had a lower-than-average level of socioeconomic deprivation and were more likely to be non-smokers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP216C20">20</xref>). However, the rs1051730 SNP is not associated with these factors, so this will not introduce bias.</p><p>To conclude, our study provides further evidence for a role of the rs1051730 SNP in the <italic>CHRNA5&#x02013;CHRNA3&#x02013;CHRNB4</italic> gene cluster in smoking quantity and demonstrates an association with smoking cessation in pregnancy. Further studies are needed to assess the association between the SNP and smoking cessation in other situations. Our finding provides an example of how genes can influence what is perceived by many to be a purely behavioural phenotype. There are parallels between our results and those of genetic association studies which have implicated appetite-regulatory pathways in obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP216C21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP216C22">22</xref>). Both phenotypes are thought by many scientists, health-care professionals and policy-makers to be a matter of &#x02018;self-control&#x02019; and have much social stigma attached. Twin and other studies have previously shown that these traits have a heritable component, but the identification of robust associations with common genetic variants may help a little to emphasize that physiology plays an important role in &#x02018;socially unacceptable&#x02019; phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Study subjects</title><p>We studied pregnant women of white, European ancestry from two studies (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="DDP216TB1">1</xref>).

We performed linear regression of birth weight on the number of maternal risk alleles carried, with sex, gestational age and study as covariates. We then repeated this analysis including first trimester smoking quantity as an additional covariate. We additionally used a triangulation approach to estimate the expected effect size of the association between maternal genotype and offspring birth weight.
