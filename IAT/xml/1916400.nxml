The majority of more than 120 cloned human blindness genes are highly expressed in photoreceptors. In order to establish an integrative framework in which to understand these diseases, we have undertaken an experimental and computational analysis of the network controlled by the mammalian photoreceptor transcription factors, <italic>Crx</italic>, <italic>Nrl</italic>, and <italic>Nr2e3</italic>. Using microarray and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization datasets we have produced a model of this network which contains over 600 genes, including numerous retinal disease loci as well as previously uncharacterized photoreceptor transcription factors. To elucidate the connectivity of this network, we devised a computational algorithm to identify the photoreceptor-specific <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements (CREs) mediating the interactions between these transcription factors and their target genes. <italic>In vivo</italic> validation of our computational predictions resulted in the discovery of 19 novel photoreceptor-specific CREs near retinal disease genes. Examination of these CREs permitted the definition of a simple <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory grammar rule associated with high-level expression. To test the generality of this rule, we used an expanded form of it as a selection filter to evolve photoreceptor CREs from random DNA sequences <italic>in silico</italic>. When fused to fluorescent reporters, these evolved CREs drove strong, photoreceptor-specific expression <italic>in vivo</italic>. This study represents the first systematic identification and <italic>in vivo</italic> validation of CREs in a mammalian neuronal cell type and lays the groundwork for a systems biology of photoreceptor transcriptional regulation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) lie at the center of organismal development and physiology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000643-BenTaboudeLeon1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000643-Levine1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Transcription factors (TFs) within these networks control the spatiotemporal pattern and levels of expression of their target genes by binding to CREs, short (&#x0223c;300&#x02013;600 bp) stretches of genomic DNA which can lie upstream, downstream, or within the introns of the genes they control. Significant progress has been made in the computational identification of putative CREs in a variety of species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000643-Chang1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000643-Schroeder1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, given the importance of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory change in evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000643-Prudhomme1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> and the relatively limited number of deeply conserved non-coding regions in the mouse (&#x0223c;3000 were identified in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000643-Pennacchio1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>), it is likely that there are many tissue-specific CREs which do not fall within such regions.</p><p>Despite advances in the design of computational algorithms to identify CREs in mammalian genomes, the development of cheap, high-throughput assay systems for validating these computational predictions in vivo has lagged far behind. Most studies of mammalian <italic>cis</italic>-regulation to date have relied on mouse transgenesis as a means of assaying the enhancer function of CREs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000643-Pennacchio1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. This technique is time-consuming, costly and subject to insertion site effects. On the other hand, rapid assays for mammalian CRE function have been developed in tissue culture systems, but it is not clear how such results translate into the <italic>in vivo</italic> behavior of CREs. We aim to demonstrate in this paper that rapid, inexpensive, high throughput analysis of mammalian CREs can be achieved by exploiting electroporation to introduce CRE-reporter fusion constructs either into living tissue <italic>in vivo</italic> or in <italic>ex vivo</italic> explant culture. This approach retains many of the desirable features of <italic>in vivo</italic> transgenic approaches to CRE analysis but is much more rapid and inexpensive.</p><p>Photoreceptor cells are sensory neurons that elaborate a highly specialized, membrane-rich organelle, the outer segment, which is exquisitely sensitive to light. These cells are particularly susceptible to degeneration. There are currently over 180 mapped disease loci which cause blindness in humans (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sph.uth.tmc.edu/RetNet/">http://www.sph.uth.tmc.edu/RetNet/</ext-link>).

By comparison, <italic>Rho</italic>-CRE was classified as &#x02018;very strong&#x02019; and <italic>Nrl</italic>-CRE as &#x02018;strong&#x02019;. Next we examined the CREs within the five expression classes to determine whether any rules could be derived to explain their differences in expression level. A very simple <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory motif associated with high level expression in photoreceptors was found. The motif consists of a single Nrl site less than 40 bp from a Crx site, with individual and combined affinity scores above defined cutoffs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000643.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). When we assessed all 26 tested photoreceptor CREs for the presence of this motif, we found that it was present in the following percentage of CREs: 100&#x00025; (4/4) of &#x02018;very strong&#x02019; CREs, 17&#x00025; (1/6) of &#x02018;strong&#x02019; CREs, 25&#x00025; (1/4) &#x02018;medium&#x02019; CREs, and 0&#x00025; of &#x02018;weak&#x02019; (0/5) and &#x02018;absent&#x02019; (0/7) CREs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000643.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). This motif is also present within the first 100 bp of the <italic>Rho</italic> promoter. These findings suggest that synergistic activation of photoreceptor gene transcription by Crx and Nrl as first reported for <italic>Rho</italic>-CRE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000643-Mitton1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, is a common principle of photoreceptor CRE design, at least for CREs which drive high level expression in rods. The absence of this motif from many photoreceptor CREs, some with &#x02018;strong&#x02019; expression, demonstrates that clusters of Crx sites (perhaps in combination with sites for other unidentified TFs) can also support strong photoreceptor-specific expression.</p><p>If the novel photoreceptor CREs identified here represent the principal regulatory regions controlling expression of the genes in question, then one might expect there to be a correlation between the expression strength of a given CRE and the corresponding gene's transcript levels <italic>in vivo</italic>. In order to test this idea, we compared the expression strength classification of 21 photoreceptor CREs (19 novel CREs along with <italic>Rho</italic>-CRE and <italic>Nrl</italic>-CRE as controls) with their mRNA levels (using the average array value of the gene in question as a surrogate for mRNA levels). We found that the average wild-type (C57BL/6) array values for genes in each of the four expression strength categories were as follow: &#x02018;very strong&#x02019;&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;19,607; &#x02018;strong&#x02019;&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;15,308; &#x02018;medium&#x02019;&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;11,016; and &#x02018;weak&#x02019;&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;7,927. This result demonstrates that the average transcript levels of genes within a given CRE expression category correlate with the strength of that category. Despite this trend, the genes within individual expression strength categories show a wide range of array values. For example, Rgs9-CRE was rated as &#x02018;strong&#x02019;, but the array value of the corresponding gene was quite low (i.e., &#x0003c;300). There are a couple possible explanations for this type of discrepancy. First, although array values roughly correlate with endogenous transcript levels, they are not a strictly quantitative measure of mRNA levels. Non-representative array values could therefore result in a lack of correlation between CRE strength and endogenous transcript levels. In addition, for a number of genes (e.g., Crx) there appears to be more than one functional CRE. In such cases, the endogenous transcript levels would reflect the concerted activity of all associated CREs and so would not be expected to correlate perfectly with the activity of any one CRE tested in isolation. Despite a number of individual exceptions, the overall correlation between CRE strength and transcript levels suggests that we have successfully identified the principal regulatory regions of many of the genes under consideration.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title><italic>In silico</italic> evolution of functional photoreceptor <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements</title><p>Comparative analysis of the CREs identified in this study demonstrated a correlation between a closely linked pair of Crx and Nrl sites and strong expression in photoreceptors.

The purpose of this experiment was to produce sequences that retain the essential features of photoreceptor-specific CREs (i.e., closely clustered Crx and Nrl binding sites), while randomizing all intervening sequences. We found that in less than 100 generations it was possible to evolve CREs with features highly reminiscent of naturally occurring photoreceptor-specific CREs, including some with a strong resemblance to the well characterized <italic>Rho</italic>-CRE (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000643-g005">Fig. 5A</xref> with B-D; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000643.s014">Table S10</xref>).

However, the basal promoter used in these experiments contains the proximal 36 bp upstream of the &#x02018;TATA&#x02019; box from the bovine <italic>Rho</italic> locus. This stretch of DNA includes the so-called &#x02018;Ret4&#x02019; element which consists of a single low-affinity Crx site as well as a binding site for an unidentified ubiquitous factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000643-Chen3">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. To rule out the possibility that this ubiquitous factor is playing a significant role in driving expression in these synthetic constructs, we repeated these experiments using a basal promoter carrying a mutation known to eliminate binding of this ubiquitous factor. The expression level of two constructs (Syn2-G65 and Syn3-G500) were basically unchanged and the levels of two others (Syn1-G70 and Syn3-G55) were only modestly reduced (data not shown). These findings suggest that clusters of Crx and Nrl sites alone are sufficient to drive high-level expression in photoreceptors in this assay system.</p><p>In order to determine whether further evolution could be used to generate CREs with progressively stronger expression, CRE-reporter constructs corresponding to the fittest organism from the 150<sup>th</sup>, 300<sup>th</sup>, and 500<sup>th</sup> generations of run number 3 (the same run from which syn3-G55 was derived) were synthesized. The 500<sup>th</sup> generation construct drove very strong expression in photoreceptors, comparable to some of the strongest naturally occurring CREs we examined (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000643.s004">Fig. S4D</xref>). In addition, we found that expression was detectable at progressively earlier timepoints the more highly evolved the element (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000643-g005">Fig. 5E, F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000643.s004">Fig. S4</xref>). However, there was not a clear linear progression in the ultimate strength of expression. In fact, the CRE from generation 150 was significantly weaker than that from generation 55 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000643.s004">Fig. S4</xref>). The reason for this decrease is unclear but could relate to the acquisition of a binding site for an unidentified repressor.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We have employed experimental and computational analyses of <italic>Crx</italic>, <italic>Nrl</italic>, and <italic>Nr2e3</italic> mutant retinas to define a comprehensive model of the mouse photoreceptor TRN which contains over 600 genes. This model will serve as a template for understanding retinal diseases at a systems level. Using computational prediction and <italic>in vivo</italic> validation we were able to identify 19 new photoreceptor-specific CREs, thus doubling the number of known photoreceptor-specific CREs. Given recent progress in using viral vectors for intraretinal gene therapy in animal models of blindness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000643-Acland1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000643-Pawlyk1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, these novel CREs could prove useful as gene-specific drivers for rescue constructs in human gene therapy. This study also demonstrates the usefulness of electroporation into living tissue as a means of assaying mammalian CREs in a rapid manner which circumvents costly mouse transgenesis. We believe that this approach can be extended to other cell types and organs and can easily be made quantitative.</p><p>Our microarray and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization results showed that many photoreceptor genes appear to be co-regulated by Crx and Nrl, a finding which is corroborated by prior analyses of individual photoreceptor-specific CREs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000643-Mitton1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000643-Pittler1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. At the same time, we also showed that maintenance of normal Nrl transcript levels depends on Crx. This latter result suggests that the similarities between the sets of target genes regulated by Crx and Nrl could, in part, be attributable to the decrease in Nrl expression in <italic>Crx<sup>-/-</sup></italic>. Although we cannot completely rule out this possibility, multiple lines of evidence suggest that, for many co-regulated genes, Crx's transcriptional control is independent of Nrl. First, several cone-enriched genes (e.g., <italic>Opn1sw</italic>, <italic>Pde6h</italic>, and <italic>Arr3</italic>) are downregulated in <italic>Crx<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and upregulated in <italic>Nrl<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000643.s005">Table S1</xref>). This pattern is the opposite of what one would expect if Crx's regulation of these genes was exclusively mediated via maintenance of Nrl transcription. Secondly, we showed that Crx binding sites are abundant within many functional CREs around co-regulated photoreceptor genes. Again, this finding would not be expected if Crx's control of these genes was mediated solely via downstream activation of Nrl. Despite these points, the extent to which the transcriptional changes seen in <italic>Crx<sup>-/-</sup></italic> are due to a decrease in the levels of Nrl is an important problem for future studies.</p><p>Using synthetic CREs, we found that clusters of Crx and Nrl binding sites alone are sufficient to drive strong photoreceptor-specific expression in the mouse retina. This finding was somewhat surprising given the proposed role of other photoreceptor TFs in the regulation of rod photoreceptor gene expression. For example, recent studies have shown that mice carrying mutations in the nuclear receptor TF, <italic>Nr2e3</italic>, show a delay in the onset of <italic>Rho</italic> expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000643-Corbo1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> and modest decreases in the levels of expression of several other rod genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000643-Peng1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, <italic>Neurod1</italic> is thought to regulate gene expression in rods since mice carrying mutations in this TF show rod degeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000643-Pennesi1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, we demonstrated in this study that there is a small subset of photoreceptor genes whose expression is unchanged in <italic>Crx<sup>-/-</sup>;Nrl<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000643.s001">Fig. S1</xref>), suggesting that there must be alternative activators of rod gene expression. In general, however, the effects of <italic>Nr2e3</italic> and <italic>Neurod1</italic> mutations on rod gene expression are modest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000643-Chen2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000643-Corbo1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> (and data not shown). We therefore propose that Crx and Nrl are the primary activators of gene expression for the majority of rod genes in the mouse, and that other TFs expressed in rods such as <italic>Nr2e3</italic> and <italic>Neurod1</italic> are involved in fine-tuning expression.</p><p>In analyzing the novel photoreceptor CREs identified in the present study, we were able to define a simple <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory motif associated with high-level expression in photoreceptors which consisted of a pair of Crx and Nrl binding sites. This motif is reminiscent of a <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory motif recently identified in the regulatory regions of <italic>Drosophila</italic> immune response genes which consists of a heterotypic pair of REL and GATA binding sites with a defined orientation relative to each other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000643-Senger1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. The mammalian eye offers other intriguing examples of cell types in which two different TFs play the predominant role in regulation of gene expression. For instance, Otx2 and MITF are known to be the principal TFs involved in regulation of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) gene expression and are thought to act at the same hierarchical level in the RPE gene network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000643-MartinezMorales1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, gene expression in the mammalian lens is known to depend crucially on binding sites for two types of TF, Maf and Sox <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000643-Shimada1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. In this case, multiple members of the Sox family are known to participate in different stages of lens differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000643-Kamachi1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>, but they all share a very similar binding site. These findings suggest that such &#x02018;two-site&#x02019; motifs may be a common feature of metazoan <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions. We propose that despite the apparent diversity of TFs expressed in a given cell type (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000643-g001">Fig. 1G</xref>) in many cases only two or three TFs may play the major role in control of gene expression. The host of other TFs in that cell type may either be involved in fine-tuning gene expression or in regulating the expression of a selected subset of genes.</p><p>Another example of this general principle is the control of cone photoreceptor gene expression in the mouse. Many cone genes are activated by <italic>Crx</italic> and many are repressed (in rods) by <italic>Nrl</italic> and <italic>Nr2e3</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000643-Furukawa2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000643-Mears1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000643-Chen2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000643-Corbo1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000643-Corbo2">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. These three TFs therefore appear to be the primary regulators of cone gene expression. However, several other cone TFs have been shown to regulate a small subset of cone genes. For example, Thrb2 is known to be required for activation of <italic>Opn1mw</italic> and dorsal repression of <italic>Opn1sw</italic> in the mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000643-Ng1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. The TF, Rxrg, appears to have an even more specialized role in cone photoreceptors in that it is involved in the dorsal repression of <italic>Opn1sw</italic>, but does not appear to regulate <italic>Opn1mw</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000643-Roberts1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Lastly, a recent paper showed that the orphan nuclear receptor TF, RORbeta, is required for the activation of <italic>Opn1sw</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000643-Srinivas1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. Although it is possible that these three TFs have other transcriptional targets in cone photoreceptors, it may also be the case that they their transcriptional regulatory role is restricted to only a subset of genes in this cell type.</p><p>A recent study identified functional CREs in the human genome by searching for contiguous blocks of extreme phylogenetic conservation and then testing them in transgenic mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000643-Pennacchio1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. We compared the location of the 19 novel photoreceptor CREs identified here with a set of over 3000 elements conserved between human and <italic>Fugu</italic> identified in that study. We found that none of the 19 CREs were included in that set (data not shown). This result suggests that approaches which rely solely on identifying extended blocks of extreme phylogenetic conservation may fail to detect many cell-type specific CREs. The algorithm used in the present study only requires that the identified binding site itself be phylogenetically conserved. This approach was employed because examination of known photoreceptor CREs demonstrated that, in many cases, blocks of conservation were found to encompass only a single binding site (e.g., the rightmost Crx site in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000643-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p><p>Given the reliance of the CRE-finding algorithm used in the present study on clustering of phylogenetically conserved Crx binding sites which contain the canonical &#x02018;TAAT&#x02019; sequence bound by many homeodomain TFs, putative regulatory peaks predicted around non-photoreceptor genes must be interpreted with caution. A preliminary analysis of the genomic regions around 20,000 mouse genes using this algorithm detected a marked enrichment of predicted regulatory peaks around TFs and other developmental regulators (data not shown). Nearly half of the 100 top-ranked genes in this analysis were homeodomain TFs, most of which are unlikely to be involved in photoreceptor development and therefore represent false positives. We believe there are two possible explanations for this result. First, the scoring algorithm is not normalized according to the extent of regional phylogenetic conservation of non-coding DNA. Since developmental regulators including TFs are known to exhibit a greater degree of phylogenetic conservation in their surrounding non-coding regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000643-Blanchette1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>, the algorithm would be expected to predict more regulatory peaks in such regions by chance alone. Secondly, the abundance of homeodomain TFs among the top-ranked genes suggests that the algorithm may be identifying bona fide CREs containing clusters of binding sites for homeodomain TFs other than Crx. Given these caveats, the algorithm presented here identifies functional CREs with considerable reliability when applied to the genomic region around photoreceptor-enriched genes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Oligonucleotide microarray analysis</title><p>Microarray analysis of P21 <italic>Crx<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Crx<sup>-/-</sup>;Nrl<sup>-/-</sup></italic> retinas was performed on Affymetrix mouse genome 430 2.0 GeneChip arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, California, United States).

For each microarray, RNA was prepared from 4-6 freshly dissected retinas derived from 2-3 animals at P21. Probes were synthesized starting with 10 &#x000b5;g of total RNA for each sample according to manufacturer's instructions (Affymetrix). Hybridization, washing, and scanning of the microarrays were all performed at the Bauer Center for Genomics Research at Harvard University according to manufacturer's instructions (Affymetrix).</p><p>Initial data analysis was carried out using the GeneChip Operating System (GCOS) software from Affymetrix. Pairwise comparisons were made between individual mutant microarray results and controls. For our &#x02018;low stringency&#x02019; analysis, up- and downregulated genes were determined by using Wilcoxon's signed rank test to compare mutant and control microarrays in a pairwise fashion with a p-value&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.002. Only those array features which were significantly &#x02018;increased&#x02019; or &#x02018;decreased&#x02019; in three out of three microarray comparisons were considered to have met our criteria for inclusion in the low stringency datasets.</p><p>To create a &#x02018;high stringency&#x02019; dataset, we used the same approach used previously for the <italic>Nrl</italic> mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000643-Corbo2">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. First, we separated the features in the low stringency datasets into three expression level categories: (for analysis of downregulated features) (1) features whose average microarray score in the wild-type retina (score<sub>129</sub>) is &#x02265;5000; (2) 1000&#x02264;score<sub>129</sub>&#x0003c;5000; and (3) 100&#x02264;score<sub>129</sub>&#x0003c;1000. For analysis of upregulated features, the same categories were created using the average microarray score for the mutant. Next, we sorted each of these three sub-lists according to the ratio of their average wild-type to average mutant scores and retained only those features that passed the following thresholds for the three expression categories: category (1) at least a 2-fold change; category (2) at least a three-fold change and category (3) at least a 5-fold change. In this manner, we applied progressively more stringent fold-change requirements for the features showing lower levels of expression. Next, in order to create a non-redundant list of up- and downregulated genes (since our initial feature lists contained multiple Affymetrix features which correspond to a single gene) we used the DAVID functional annotation tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/">http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/</ext-link>) to annotate the low and high stringency lists. We then wrote a Perl script to sort and format the DAVID outputs (script available on request).

Since microarray data from a mixed wild-type background were not available as a control, it was necessary to use the pure 129 and B6 wild-type datasets as controls for the <italic>Crx;Nrl</italic> double mutant. Accordingly, pairwise comparisons were made between individual <italic>Crx<sup>-/-</sup>;Nrl<sup>-/-</sup></italic> microarray results and both 129 and B6 controls using the GeneChip Operating System (GCOS) software from Affymetrix (i.e., a total of six pairwise comparisons).

In preliminary computational analyses we found very few instances of the 14-bp motif around photoreceptor genes (data not shown) and we therefore only used the 13-bp motif in all subsequent analyses.

The no-basal vector was used for those CRE that occurred immediately upstream of the TSS. In the latter case, the gene's own endogenous basal promoter could be cloned directly upstream of the DsRed coding sequence.

Retinas from newborn (P0) CD-1 mice were dissected in serum free medium (SFM; 1:1 DMEM:Ham's F12 (Gibco), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 &#x000b5;g/ml streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco) and 2 &#x000b5;g/ml insulin (Sigma)) from surrounding sclera and soft tissue leaving the lens in place. Retinas were then transferred with forceps to an electroporation chamber containing a 1 &#x000b5;g/&#x000b5;l solution of supercoiled DNA in PBS (model BTX453 Microslide chamber, Genetronics Inc.). The chamber had been previously divided with silicon cement into four sub-chambers each with a volume of &#x0223c;60 &#x000b5;l. Next, five square pulses (30 V) of 50-ms duration with 950-ms intervals were applied using a pulse generator (model ECM 830, Genetronics Inc.). Electroporated retinas were removed from the electroporation chamber and allowed to recover in SFM for several minutes before being transferred to the same medium supplemented with 5&#x00025; fetal calf serum (Gibco) for several minutes. The retinas were then placed (lens side down) on polycarbonate filters (Whatman, 0.2 &#x000b5;m pore size) and cultured at 37&#x000b0;C in SFM supplemented with 5&#x00025; fetal calf serum for 8 days. Upon harvesting, retinas were fixed in 4&#x00025; paraformadehyde in PBS for 30 minutes washed two times with PBS. Next, the retinas were flat-mounted (photoreceptor side up) and examined using a BX51 compound microscope (Olympus). Digital images were captured using a DP70 camera (Olympus). After imaging of flatmounts, retinas were equilibrated in 30&#x00025; sucrose/PBS overnight at 4&#x000b0;C and embedded in OCT. 16 &#x000b5;m cryosections were collected, and confocal micrographs were captured using a BX61WI microscope (Olympus) equipped with a DSU spinning disc and an ORCA-ER CCD camera (Hamamatsu).</p><p>The expression strength of the novel CREs were categorized in the following manner. Images of the best electroporated retina for each CRE-reporter construct (defined as that retina with the greatest area and intensity of green fluorescence of the retinas examined for a given construct) were captured in both green and red channels at the same exposure time (1/300 second) for all constructs. These images were then compared side-by-side with images for all other constructs as well as images of retinas electroporated with <italic>Rho</italic>-CRE and <italic>Nrl</italic>-CRE controls. &#x02018;very strong&#x02019; expression was defined as red fluorescence (i.e., expression levels of DsRed driven by the CRE in question) that showed extensive pixel saturation (i.e., yellow areas on the image) at 1/300 second exposure. &#x02018;strong&#x02019; expression was defined as widespread robust red fluorescence without significant saturation. &#x02018;medium&#x02019; expression was defined as red flourescence that was visible at 1/300 exposure but that was considerably weaker or more patchy than that seen in &#x02018;strong&#x02019; constructs. &#x02018;weak&#x02019; expression was defined as any definite expression in photoreceptors that was not easily visible in a 1/300 second exposure. &#x02018;absent&#x02019; expression was defined as absolutely no detectable expression in the retina.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Algorithm for <italic>in silico</italic> evolution of photoreceptor <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements</title><p>A genetic algorithm was developed in Matlab to evolve photoreceptor-specific CREs <italic>in silico</italic>. The original inspiration for this algorithm came from a paper by Thomas Schneider <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000643-Schneider1">&#x0005b;70&#x0005d;</xref>. The algorithm consists of four distinct steps: initiation, mutation, selection, and reproduction. In the initiation step, random 400 bp DNA sequences were generated in accordance with the GC content of the mouse genome (0.43), and a single such sequence lacking Crx and Nrl sites (i.e., containing no Crx or Nrl sites with log odds scores greater than 4 and 6, respectively) was selected. This sequence was then assigned to 100 &#x02018;organisms&#x02019;, each consisting of a single 400 bp genome. In the mutation step, random point mutations were assigned to individual organisms according to a Poisson distribution such that, on average, each organism received one point mutation per generation.</p><p>In the selection step, the &#x02018;fitness&#x02019; of each organism was determined by assessing the affinity of any Crx or Nrl sites in the organism's genome (scored using the PWMs and TFBS Perl module described above), the spacing between pairs of sites, whether the pairs of sites were homotypic (i.e., Crx-Crx or Nrl-Nrl) or heterotypic (i.e., Crx-Nrl) and the distance of sites from the TSS. Specifically, the fitness score, <italic>S</italic>, for each 400 bp organism was calculated using the following formula:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pone.0000643.e004.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/></disp-formula>where <italic>r<sub>LOS</sub></italic> is the raw log odds score of the site being scored; <italic>y</italic> is a normalizing factor to even the contribution made by Crx and Nrl sites, where <italic>y</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3 for Crx sites and 2.5 for Nrl sites (the raw log odds score for a high affinity Nrl site is greater than that for a high affinity Crx site since the Nrl binding site is almost twice as long); <italic>i</italic> represents all other Crx or Nrl binding sites within the 400 bp genome; <italic>f<sub>pair</sub></italic> is a weighting term which equals 2 for homotypic neighboring sites (i.e., Crx neighbors if site being scored is Crx; Nrl neighbors if site being scored is Nrl) and 8 for heterotypic neighboring sites (i.e., greater weight is attributed to Crx-Nrl pairs to reflect the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory motif defined in this study); <italic>g<sub>dist</sub></italic> is a second weighting term which reflects the importance of site clustering: <italic>g<sub>dist</sub></italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0 if <italic>i</italic>&#x0003e;100 bp from the site being scored; <italic>g<sub>dist</sub></italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1 if 40 bp&#x0003c;<italic>i</italic>&#x02264;100 bp; and <italic>g<sub>dist</sub></italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;2 if <italic>i</italic>&#x02264;40 bp (this weighting term also reflects the important contribution of sites within 40 bp of each other as demonstrated in our <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory motif); lastly, <italic>h<sub>TSS</sub></italic> is a weighting term which increases from 1 to 4 the closer the location of the site being scored is to the 3&#x02032; end of the 400 bp genome (this term is intended to reflect the importance of proximity of binding sites to the TSS; several of the most strongly expressing endogenous CREs examined (e.g., <italic>Rho</italic>, <italic>Kcnv2</italic>, and <italic>Nr2e3</italic>) have key TF binding sites less than 200 bp from the TSS. For purposes of scoring, Crx and Nrl sites with log odds scores less than 6 and 9, respectively, were ignored.</p><p>After assignment of a fitness score, the organisms are ranked from highest to lowest fitness, the bottom 50 organisms are culled, and the top 50 are permitted to differentially reproduce to restore the original population of 100. In this reproduction step, the top ten scoring organisms each contribute three identical offspring to the next generation, the 21<sup>st</sup> to 40<sup>th</sup> highest scoring organisms contribute two identical offspring to the next generation, and the 41<sup>st</sup> to 50<sup>th</sup> highest scoring organisms each contribute one offspring to the next generation. The new population of 100 organisms reenters the algorithm at the mutation step and the cycle is repeated.
