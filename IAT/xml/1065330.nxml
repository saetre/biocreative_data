We have investigated the mechanisms of inflammation in murine zymosan-induced arthritis (ZIA) in the light of recent data on the roles of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and Dectin-1 in the activation of monocyte/macrophages by zymosan. The severity of inflammation, joint histology, lymphocyte proliferation and antibody production in response to zymosan were analyzed in mice deficient in TLR2 and complement C3, and the effects of Dectin-1 inhibition by laminarin were studied. In comparison with wild-type animals, TLR2-deficient mice showed a significant decrease in the early (day 1) and late phases (day 24) of joint inflammation. C3-deficient mice showed no differences in technetium uptake or histological scoring. TLR2-deficient mice also showed a significant decrease in lymph node cell proliferation in response to zymosan and a lower IgG antibody response to zymosan at day 25 in comparison with wild-type controls, indicating that TLR2 signalling has a role in the development of acquired immune responses to zymosan. Although laminarin, a soluble &#x003b2;-glucan, was able to significantly inhibit zymosan uptake by macrophages <italic>in vitro</italic>, it had no effect on ZIA <italic>in vivo</italic>. These results show that ZIA is more prolonged than was originally described and involves both the innate and acquired immune pathways. C3 does not seem to have a major role in this model of joint inflammation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>chronic inflammation</kwd><kwd>immune system</kwd><kwd>monocytes/macrophages</kwd><kwd>Toll-like receptor</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Zymosan, a polysaccharide from the cell wall of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, is composed primarily of glucan and mannan residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic>, it has served as a model for the study of innate immune responses, because it is capable of stimulating inflammatory cytokine production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and can activate complement in the absence of immunoglobulins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Zymosan is recognized and phagocytosed principally by monocytes and macrophages and leads to cellular activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Zymosan-induced arthritis (ZIA) in mice was first described by Keystone in 1977 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Arthritis was induced by intra-articular injection of zymosan and was thought to be mediated by activation of the alternative pathway of complement and the release of lysosomal hydrolases from activated macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The recent discovery of pattern recognition receptors and their role in innate immunity has led to a re-evaluation of our concepts of zymosan-induced inflammation. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of type 1 transmembrane proteins that consists of an extracellular leucine-rich repeat domain and a cytoplasmic domain homologous to the cytoplasmic domain of the human interleukin 1 (IL-1) receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The ligands of TLR2 include lipopeptides and peptidoglycan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and TLR2 is a receptor for zymosan, acting in collaboration with CD14 and TLR6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Ligand binding to TLRs induces the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B and the production of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-18 as well as the expression of the co-stimulatory molecule B7.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Additionally, zymosan is able to induce maturation of dendritic cells <italic>in vitro </italic>and to stimulate their production of IL-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], providing evidence for a link between the innate and the adaptive immune responses.</p><p>The inflammatory response triggered by zymosan is linked to its phagocytosis, a process that is mediated by a set of different receptors from the TLRs. The non-opsonic recognition of zymosan by macrophages is mediated by Dectin-1. Dectin-1 is a type 2 membrane receptor with an extracellular C-type lectin-like domain fold and a cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and is expressed on macrophages, dendritic cells and neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Dectin-1 mediates the binding of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>and <italic>Candida albicans </italic>in a &#x003b2;-glucan-dependent manner and may also have a pro-inflammatory function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>In the light of the above findings, we have re-investigated ZIA to elucidate the roles of the innate and adaptive immune responses in this model and to compare the effects of TLR2 deficiency and complement C3 deficiency. The role of Dectin-1 in zymosan-induced inflammation was also investigated. Our results indicate that TLR2 is the major pathway of pro-inflammatory signalling in ZIA and is necessary for the development of specific immune responses to zymosan.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>C3-deficient mice (C3<sup>-/-</sup>) on a C57bl/6 background were generated by Professor M Botto [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].

Subsequently, inflammation returned to levels that could be as high (as measured by <sup>99m</sup>Tc uptake) as the initial peak, suggesting that ZIA has early and late phases. Histologically, the joint inflammation was characterized by mononuclear cell infiltration in the sublining layer and hypertrophy of the lining layer as well as cartilage damage. Histological changes were milder at day 8 than at day 25. Zymosan particles were present in the synovium at day 25.</p><p>We then investigated the role of TLR2 in ZIA because the macrophage inflammatory response to zymosan depends largely on its recognition by a heterodimer of TLR2 and TLR6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In TLR2<sup>-/- </sup>mice there was a significant attenuation of the early and late inflammatory phases of ZIA, indicating that a ligand that activates the innate immune response through TLR2 can lead to a chronic local inflammatory reaction.</p><p>In the absence of TLR2, joint inflammation was not totally blocked. This would suggest that, <italic>in vivo</italic>, the inflammatory response to zymosan is not dependent on TLR2 signalling alone and that receptors other than TLR2 might have a role. This is supported by the observation that inhibition of TLR2 and MyD88 by dominant-negative mutants blocked pro-inflammatory signalling but not zymosan uptake <italic>in vitro</italic>. Recent data have shown that Dectin-1 and SIGNR1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] on macrophages and pentraxin-3, an opsonin for the recognition of zymosan by Dectin-1, are involved in zymosan recognition and internalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. We therefore investigated the role of Dectin-1 by using the &#x003b2;-glucan laminarin as a competitive inhibitor of zymosan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. We confirmed that laminarin inhibited zymosan uptake by RAW 264.7 cells and did not observe any difference in the blocking capacity of laminarin, whether administered before or at the same time as zymosan. In both cases and at two different concentrations, we observed a 50% decrease in cell-bound zymosan particles. On the basis of these results, we proceeded to assess the effect of laminarin on ZIA. Although there was a trend towards reduced <sup>99m</sup>Tc uptake in the treated animals, this was not statistically significant. It is possible that 50% inhibition of zymosan phagocytosis is insufficient to modulate inflammatory signalling through TLR2. Furthermore, a redundancy in the multiple mechanisms that mediate zymosan phagocytosis could also explain the lack of effect of laminarin inhibition <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>The biphasic course of ZIA and its modulation by TLR2 led us to study the acquired immune response to zymosan and the effects of TLR2 deficiency on it. We compared the cellular proliferative and antibody responses to zymosan in WT and TLR2<sup>-/- </sup>mice at day 25. First, we were able to detect zymosan-induced lymphocyte proliferation and enhanced IFN-&#x003b3; production in the draining LNC of mice with ZIA, and second, this was accompanied by the formation of a zymosan-specific IgG. In TLR2<sup>-/- </sup>animals, the proliferative response was blunted and only reached 50% of that observed in WT ZIA animals. There was also a significant decrease in the zymosan-specific IgG response, which was about 50% lower than in WT mice. At day 8 we did not observe any difference between ZIA and naive WT mice in their proliferative response to zymosan (data not shown). These findings suggest that inflammation in the later phase of ZIA is paralleled by the development of acquired immune response to zymosan. The finding that zymosan particles persisted in the joint even at day 25 suggests that they could become a target for specific immune responses. The decrease in acquired immune responses in TLR2<sup>-/- </sup>mice might be a result of the decreased antigen presentation efficiency of dendritic cells in the absence of TLR2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] or the lack of co-stimulatory signals through TLR2 expressed on activated T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>A significant role for the alternative pathway of complement in this model of inflammation was excluded by the phenotype observed in C3<sup>-/- </sup>mice. Both phases of ZIA were comparable to that observed in WT controls. Mice with combined deletions of the C3 and the TLR2 genes did not show a significant decrease in <sup>99m</sup>Tc uptake in comparison with TLR2<sup>-/- </sup>mice. Histologically, we observed a significant decrease in cartilage damage in mice with the combined deficiency of TLR2 and C3, which did not occur in C3<sup>-/- </sup>mice. We interpret this effect to be due in principle to the lack of TLR2, because TLR2<sup>-/- </sup>mice also showed a diminished cartilage score (although it did not reach statistical significance). Combined with recent data showing that phagocytosis of zymosan is not mediated by complement receptor 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], complement activation does not seem to contribute to zymosan-induced joint inflammation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>The expression of TLR2 in arthritic synovium from WT mice in the ZIA model and the modulation of joint inflammation in TLR2<sup>-/- </sup>animals show that TLR2 may have a general role in amplifying local inflammation. TLR2 has been shown to be expressed on neutrophils and lymphocytes as well as macrophages, and they all are participants in the inflammatory process in this model. The data in human arthritis would also support such a role for TLR2. Increased expression of TLR2 in synovial lining layer and by CD16<sup>+ </sup>peripheral blood mononuclear cells in RA indicate that its expression is upregulated during chronic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. TLR2 is also expressed on RA synovial fibroblasts, and incubation of cultured RA synovial fibroblasts with pro-inflammatory cytokines increases levels of TLR2 mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Although the precise role of TLR signalling in RA is unclear at present, increased TLR2 expression might modulate synovial inflammation if endogenous or exogenous TLR2 ligands gain access to the joint, thus amplifying specific and innate immune pathways of synovial inflammation. Furthermore, our results provide a model by which stimulation of the innate immune response can lead to chronic inflammation in the joint. These pathways may be of relevance to the development of reactive arthritis in man.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of the present study indicate that the biphasic joint inflammation in ZIA is mediated primarily by activation of the innate immune system. In the early phase of arthritis TLR2 plays a vital role, and in the later phase the development of a secondary immune response to zymosan may contribute to joint inflammation. Innate immune responses may be important amplificatory pathways of joint inflammation in man.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ELISA = enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; IFN = interferon; IL = interleukin; LNC = lymph node cells; TLR = Toll-like receptor; WT = wild-type; ZIA = zymosan-induced arthritis.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MF contributed to breeding and genotyping, performed technetium uptake measurements and immunoassays, and participated in coordination of the study.
