The association of a dimorphism in amino acid 131 (R/H) of the Fc&#x003b3;RIIa with malaria severity, the R-allele being associated with a milder disease outcome, led to the investigation of the possible impact of this polymorphism in the interethnic difference in malaria susceptibility seen between the Fulani and Dogon in Mali.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Plasma from individuals from Mali (164 Fulani and 164 Dogon) were analysed for malaria-reactive and total IgG subclass antibodies using ELISA, and the same individuals were also genotyped for the Fc&#x003b3;RIIa R131H polymorphism using RFLP-PCR. Statistical analyses of the IgG subclass levels were done by unpaired t-test and ANOVA, and genotype differences were tested by &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>-test.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>While the two ethnic groups showed a similar frequency of the Fc&#x003b3;RIIa 131 R/H heterozygote genotype, 131R/R dominated over the 131 H/H genotype in the Dogon whereas the Fulani presented a similar frequency of the two homozygote genotypes. The two alleles were evenly distributed in the Fulani, while the Dogon were clearly biased towards the R-allele. The Fulani showed higher levels of anti-malarial IgG1, -2 and -3 antibodies, with a higher proportion of IgG2, than the Dogon. In the Fulani, H-allele carriers had higher anti-malarial IgG2 levels than R/R homozygotes, while in the Dogon, the R-allele carriers showed the higher IgG2 levels. For anti-malarial IgG3, the R-allele carriers in the Fulani had higher levels than the H/H homozygotes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, the results showed marked interethnic differences in Fc&#x003b3;RIIa R131H genotypes. Furthermore, the results indicate that the Fc&#x003b3;RIIa R131H genotype may influence the IgG subclass responses related to protection against malaria, and that IgG2 may be of importance in this context.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Malaria remains one of the most prevalent infectious diseases in the world today, with high morbidity and mortality, and no effective control strategies. A rational vaccine design is limited by the lack of knowledge of how the immune system clears the infection. Several studies relate high titers of anti-malarial IgG to protection from severe malaria, and seroepidemiological studies from different endemic areas have demonstrated an association between IgG antibodies of the cytophilic subclasses IgG1 and IgG3 with protection against <italic>Plasmodium falciparum </italic>malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In other study populations, IgG2 antibodies to certain <italic>P. falciparum </italic>antigens, have been shown to be related to protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], indicating that the role of the different IgG subclasses in malaria protection still needs to be clarified.</p><p>The Fc&#x003b3; receptors on monocytes and other leukocytes are important structures in the immune defence against pathogens. The binding of antibodies to the Fc-receptors provokes important biological functions, e.g. antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) or inhibition (ADCI) and phagocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In humans, there are three families of Fc-receptors binding IgG, Fc&#x003b3;RI (CD64), -RII (CD32) and -RIII (CD16). Fc&#x003b3;RI is a high-affinity receptor that binds monomeric IgG, Fc&#x003b3;RII and -RIII are low-affinity receptors, only binding complexed or aggregated IgG. Based on a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the Fc&#x003b3;RIIa gene (G494A) (rs1801274), this receptor has two co-dominantly expressed allotypes, differing at amino acid position 131 (R/H). Fc&#x003b3;RIIa-131H is the only human Fc&#x003b3;R that binds IgG2 efficiently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This polymorphism appears to affect the regulation of the IgG subclass production or turnover in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], which could be a contributing factor to the inconclusive results seen in previous studies on the Fc&#x003b3;RIIa-R131H polymorphism in relation to malaria. Some of the studies are associating the Fc&#x003b3;RIIa-131R/R genotype with protection against malaria, and the Fc&#x003b3;RIIa-131H/H genotype with susceptibility to the disease (reviewed by Braga [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]). However, recent publications suggest the Fc&#x003b3;RIIa-131H allele to be associated to protection against severe malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This discrepancy is still not understood; it may be caused by different genetic backgrounds or by differences in the pathogen pressure.</p><p>Several studies have demonstrated differences in susceptibility to malaria between different ethnic groups. In West Africa, the Fulani were shown to have a lower incidence of malaria than other sympatric groups, despite the same exposure and no differences in socio-cultural circumstances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Studies in Burkina Faso extended those results, demonstrating that the Fulani are less parasitized, less affected by malaria and have higher anti-malarial immune responses than the sympatric Mossi and Rimaib&#x000e9; groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This is also true for the Malian Fulani and their sympatric neighbours, the Dogon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Previous results have shown that this relative resistance to malaria in the Fulani, as compared to other sympatric tribes, appears to be pathogen related and not due to a general hyper-reactive immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Various markers confirm that the Fulani are genetically distinct from other African tribes, and it was thus proposed that established malaria resistance factors would be at a higher frequency in the Fulani, but the reverse was found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>In an attempt to further define potential genetical and immunological factors contributing to these ethnic differences in malaria susceptibility, the Fc&#x003b3;RIIa genotypes in sympatric individuals from Mali were analysed and related to both the total and the malaria reactive IgG subclass profiles.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Study area</title><p>The study area is located in the Mopti area about 850 km Northeast of Bamako, the capital of Mali. Four villages (Mant&#x000e9;ourou, Naye, Bin&#x000e9;dama, and Anak&#x000e9;di&#x000e9;) were identified for the study. The Mant&#x000e9;ourou and Naye are divided into two subdivisions, Mant&#x000e9;ourou Peulh/Mant&#x000e9;ourou Dogon and Naye Peulh/Naye Dogon-Dinsogou. The two subdivisions are separated by 300&#x02013;500 meters and inhabited either by Fulani or Dogon. The other two villages, Bin&#x000e9;dama and Anak&#x000e9;di&#x000e9;, are exclusively populated by either Fulani or Dogon, respectively, and are located approximately 1,000 meter apart. Malaria transmission is mesoendemic in the area, with <italic>P. falciparum </italic>as the main parasite species. The entomological inoculation rate (EIR) is similar in both ethnic groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In this area the dry season extends from October to May and the rainy season from July to October.</p></sec><sec><title>Human samples</title><p>Blood was collected during the rainy season in September 2005 from 328 (164 Fulani and 164 Dogon) asymptomatic, randomly selected donors, aged 1&#x02013;60 years. For PCR analyses, finger prick blood was collected on filter papers. For plasma samples, either finger prick blood was collected in capillaries or venous blood in vacutainer tubes, both with heparin as anti-coagulant. Spleen enlargement was established based on palpation and graded on the Hackett score (0&#x02013;5). The proportion of individuals that had enlarged spleens was denoted spleen rate. Informed consent was obtained from all participants or their guardians and it was performed in two steps; first an orally community consent is obtained prior to the study, where the whole community is informed of the aim of the study. Second an individual consent is obtained before blood collection; an alphabetized volunteer sign the form and a non-alphabetized volunteer puts his fingerprint. The Ethical committee of the Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy of Mali and the National Ethics Committee in Sweden approved the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Plasma preparation</title><p>The capillaries were cut, and blood cells and plasma were separated by centrifugation.

After blocking at 37&#x000b0;C with carbonate buffer containing 1% BSA (w/v) for 2 hours, the plates were washed with saline containing 0.05% Tween 20. Serum dilutions (50 &#x003bc;l, 1:500 for IgG1 and IgG3 and 1:50 for IgG2 and IgG4) were added to the plates and incubated 1 h at 37&#x000b0;C. To detect IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4, 50 &#x003bc;l biotin-conjugated mouse anti-human monoclonal antibodies (IgG2: clone G18-21, 1:3000 dilution, PharMingen, San Diego, CA.

IgG4: clone HP6025, 1:2000 dilution, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and alkaline phosphatase conjugated streptavidine (Mabtech AB, Sweden) were used. Detection of IgG1 was done with a monoclonal mouse anti-human IgG1 antibody (50 &#x003bc;l of 1:1000 dilution, clone NL16-purified, SkyBio Limited, Bedfordshire, U.K) and alkaline phosphatase conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig (Dako Denmark A/S, Glostrup, Denmark). The assay was developed with p-nitrophenyl phosphate disodium salt (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) as substrate and the optical densities were read at 405 nm in ELISA plate reader (VmaxTM Kinetic Microplate Reader, Menlo Park, CA). The concentrations of anti-malarial antibodies, expressed as ELISA-units (a &#x003bc;g/ml equivalent), were calculated from standard curves obtained in a sandwich ELISA with six dilutions of myeloma proteins of the IgG1-4 isotypes (Serotec, Oxford, UK). No cross reactivity between the different subclass reagents were detected in this system.</p><p>The total concentrations of IgG subclass 1&#x02013;4 were determined with PeliClass human IgG subclass kit (Sanquin Reagents, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). In short, precoated micro titre plates where incubated with diluted sera (1:30 000 for IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 and 1:240 000 for IgG1) at 37&#x000b0;C for 1 h. For detection, an HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG antibody was used and the assay was developed with ABTS-substrate and read at 405 nm in ELISA plate reader (VmaxTM Kinetic Microplate Reader, Menlo Park, CA).</p></sec><sec><title>RFLP analysis of the Fc&#x003b3;RIIa polymorphism</title><p>The <italic>R131H </italic>Fc&#x003b3;RIIa polymorphism (rs1801274) was investigated using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis as described by Jiang <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].

No differences were found for parasite density, haemoglobin levels or spleen rate. The number of circulating parasite clones differed in the Fulani group, where individuals with the RR genotype had higher numbers of clones than HR and HH genotype individuals (mean &#x000b1; SD: 3.3 &#x000b1; 3.5, 1.3 &#x000b1; 2.5 and 1.9 &#x000b1; 2.6, respectively, p = 0.006) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">6</xref>). Also, the frequency of Hb AS carriers differed between the genotypes in the Fulani group, again RR individuals having a higher Hb AS frequency than HR and HH individuals (p = 0.01, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">6</xref>). When comparing the parasite prevalence, it was found that the Fulani HR carriers had a higher frequency of parasite positivity than the other genotypes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">6</xref>). Furthermore, when comparing only the parasite positive, a difference in distribution pattern was found between the ethnic groups. While the Fulani showed an even distribution of parasite positive individuals between the genotypes, the Dogon had a lower frequency of parasite positive individuals with the HH genotype than in HR and RR (Fulani: HH: 32%, HR: 36%, RR: 32%, Dogon: HH: 17%, HR: 43%, RR: 40%. p = 0.066), but this difference in patterns did not reach statistical significance.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study shows that two sympatric ethnic groups in Mali, the Fulani and the Dogon, exhibit differential frequencies in the expression of Fc&#x003b3;RIIa R131H genotypes and allotypes. It furthermore, confirms and extends the previous findings regarding differences in anti-malarial responses between sympatric ethnic groups living in West Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The Fulani were less parasitized, had fewer parasite clones and had higher anti-malarial IgG subclass levels than the sympatric ethnic group, the Dogon. Fulani also showed a higher spleen rate as compared to Dogon. Interestingly, the Fulani showed significantly lower haemoglobin levels as compared to the Dogon, which was recently confirmed in both a longitudinal study and two cross sectional studies in the same study area (Dolo <italic>et al</italic>, personal communication).</p><p>The Fc&#x003b3;RIIa R131H genotype results of this study contradict those from previous reports, where the R/R genotype has been associated with protection (reviewed by Braga [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]). Here it was revealed that the H/H genotype is more common in the Fulani, who are considered to be less susceptible to malaria, and this was recently confirmed by a study in Sudan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], where the H allele was more common in the Fulani group than in the sympatric Masaleit group. In line with these findings, others have recently reported that the H/H genotype is related to protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], suggesting that the H/H genotype might contribute to the relative protection from malaria in the Fulani. The influence of the Fc&#x003b3;RIIa R131H polymorphism on the relative susceptibility to malaria, could in part be due to the association of this polymorphism with a differential IgG subclass production or turnover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In line with this, the present study shows an association between differential levels of IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies and Fc&#x003b3;RIIa R131H genotypes. The previous suggestion, that the presence of the R-allele is an important factor in protection from severe disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] is compatible with the finding in this study that the Fulani had higher levels of anti-malarial IgG3 among the R-allele carriers than among the H/H individuals. Also the Dogon group showed higher IgG3 antibody levels among R/R homozygotes than the H-allele carriers. In individuals from the Dogon ethnic group, the R-allele also seems to be related to higher IgG2 levels, while in Fulani, the H-allele carriers have higher IgG2 levels. Why the two ethnic groups have different distribution of the IgG2 subclass is not known. However, it may be speculated that since the Fc&#x003b3;RIIa 131R receptor is being less effective in binding IgG2, more IgG2 will be present free in the circulation of individuals with the R-allele than those with the H-allele. This could explain the higher IgG2 levels found in Dogon individuals carrying the R-allele, but not the higher IgG2 levels in the Fulani individuals carrying the H-allele. Interestingly, the Fulani show a Fc&#x003b3;RIIa genotype frequency similar to what has previously been reported for Caucasians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], while the Dogon have the same H/H frequency as African-Americans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], but differs regarding R/R and R/H genotype frequency. Since the Fulani have been shown to be closer to Caucasians than Africans for some genetic markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], the difference seen between the two ethnic groups regarding Fc&#x003b3;RIIa appears therefore not to have been driven by malaria pressure, but rather be a reflection of their different genetic background.</p><p>The impact of the Fc&#x003b3;RIIa R131H polymorphism on the clinical outcome of malaria has been shown in several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In this study, however, the analyses of a possible effect of the polymorphism on some malariometric factors (age, spleen rate, haemoglobin levels, parasite density, number of clones and carriage of Hb AS) showed that only the frequency of Hb AS and the number of circulating clones differed, with H-allele carriers having a lower Hb AS frequency and fewer clones than R/R homozygotes, but only in the Fulani group (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">6</xref>). It has been indicated that the number of clones is related to protection against severe malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], and together with the present results, it appears that the H-allele might be a prognostic factor in this context. It is important to notice that this parameter fluctuates considerably in individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and that it is difficult to conclude anything based on only one measurement. The unequal balance in the distribution of parasite positive individuals between the genotypes found in the Dogon, where the HH homozygotes had fewer positive individuals than the HR and RR genotype groups, may suggest that the HH genotype could be more protective due to the pattern of fewer parasite positive individuals in this group.</p><p>No differences between the two ethnic groups were shown when comparing total IgG subclasses, except for IgG4, were the Dogon showed slightly higher concentrations than the Fulani. This confirms the previous suggestion, that the relative resistance seen in the Fulani as compared to other sympatric ethnic groups appears to be pathogen related, and not a result of a generally more activated immune system in the Fulani [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Regarding anti-malarial IgG subclasses, the Fulani had higher levels of all subclasses, except for IgG4, which was very low in both ethnic groups. When calculating the percentage of anti-malarial IgG subclass antibodies within the total IgG concentrations, the Fulani showed a higher percentage of all IgG subclasses of anti-malarial antibodies, except for IgG4, where there were no differences between the two ethnic groups. For the ratios between IgG1:IgG2, IgG1:IgG3 and IgG2:IgG3, the Fulani had higher IgG1, IgG2 and IgG3 levels, while the Dogon had predominant IgG1 and IgG3 responses. Previous studies suggest that IgG1 and IgG3 are the most important IgG subclasses in the protection against malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. IgG1 and IgG3 are known to opsonate infected red blood cells, while IgG2 and IgG4 have been shown to inhibit this opsonization. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. However, other reports suggest a protective role of anti-malarial IgG2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], and high IgG2 and low IgG4 levels of anti-malarial antibodies have been associated with resistance to <italic>P. falciparum </italic>malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The data reported here showed that the Fulani have higher anti-malarial IgG2 levels compared to the Dogon, while IgG4 were similarly low in the two ethnic groups. This suggests that the association of high IgG2 and low IgG4 levels reported by Aucan <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] could be a contributing factor for the relative resistance to malaria seen in the Fulani. However, even though the results presented here do not contradict this suggestion, the IgG4 concentrations were overall very low in this study and were therefore excluded from the analyses. Thus, the role of IgG4 in the ethnic differences in malaria susceptibility seen between the Fulani and the Dogon of Mali remains to be investigated.</p><p>Carriage of haemoglobin AS has been reported to influence the anti-malarial IgG2 concentrations in Gabonese children, which was independent of the Fc&#x003b3;RIIa R131H genotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Preliminary observations did not detect any influence of carriage of haemoglobin AS on anti-malarial IgG2 levels in this study. No differences in frequency of AS carriers between the ethnic groups were seen (7.2% in Dogon and 7.9% in Fulani), and there was no difference in levels of anti-malarial IgG2 between the AS and AA genotype carriers.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the relative resistance to malaria seen in the Fulani as compared to the Dogon appears not to be a generally more reactive immune system, but rather a pathogen related phenomenon. Furthermore, the results indicate that the Fc&#x003b3;RIIa 131H allele may be associated with a lower susceptibility to malaria in the Fulani group as compared to other sympatric ethnic groups, and also that the Fc&#x003b3;RIIa R131H polymorphism may have an influence on the IgG subclass responses and thereby affecting the malaria susceptibility.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>EI contributed to the design of the study, performed the Fc&#x003b3;RIIa genotyping and the ELISA, carried out the statistical analyses and drafted the manuscript.
