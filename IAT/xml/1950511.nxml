The majority of the breast cancers are positive for ER&#x003b1; (ER&#x003b1;+), but not all patients with ER&#x003b1;+ cancer respond to endocrine therapy and many subsequently succumb to local relapse or metastasis. The failure of some breast cancers to respond to tamoxifen, currently the most common adjuvant endocrine treatment, is a major clinical problem and several resistance mechanisms have been elucidated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>ER&#x003b2; and its splice variants are differentially expressed in a variety of normal tissues and cancers including breast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], but not all published studies are in agreement about the role of ER&#x003b2; isoforms in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The ER&#x003b2;2/ER&#x003b2;cx variant arises from alternative splicing of the last ER&#x003b2; exon. This produces a truncated ER&#x003b2; protein unable to bind oestradiol as a result of a disorientated helix12 in the ligand binding domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. ER&#x003b2;2 acts as a dominant negative modulator of ER&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and therefore might be expected to have a protective effect in breast tumorigenesis or outcome, at least for ER&#x003b1; + breast cancer.</p><p>Further verification of ER&#x003b2; variants, including ER&#x003b2;2, as potential clinical markers is still required. Many previous studies make use of mRNA levels as a surrogate marker for ER&#x003b2; protein expression and few have attempted to relate mRNA to protein levels. Other studies that do assess the expression of ER&#x003b2; protein use techniques that rely on detection of N-terminal epitopes that are shared by most variants. A good proportion of studies also fail to take into account menopausal status, stage of the disease or the treatment given.</p><p>We have previously identified ER&#x003b2;2 mRNA levels as being more closely associated with treatment outcome than mRNA levels of ER&#x003b2;1 or ER&#x003b2;5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] in a treatment-specific cohort of postmenopausal women receiving adjuvant endocrine treatment but not chemotherapy. However in the same setting, mRNA levels for the wild-type ER&#x003b2;1 isoform do not correlate well with protein levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. With the aim of clarifying the significance of ER&#x003b2;2 expression in tamoxifen response and investigating the relationship between ER&#x003b2;2 mRNA and protein levels, we have therefore set out to evaluate both expression of ER&#x003b2;2 protein by immunostaining and expression of ER&#x003b2;2 mRNA by quantitative RTPCR (qRTPCR). Our hypothesis was that ER&#x003b2;2 may be associated with outcome following adjuvant tamoxifen treatment of breast cancers and therefore be useful as a predictive marker or give some insight into mechanisms of resistance.</p><p>We were able to confirm a significant association of both high ER&#x003b2;2 protein and high mRNA levels with good outcome, but ER&#x003b2;2 protein levels were not a useful marker of outcome. Strong ER&#x003b2;2 staining was associated with better outcome, but not independently of ER&#x003b1;. Although ER&#x003b2;2 mRNA and protein levels did not correlate with each other, approximately one third of cases (34%) were seen to have both high mRNA and high protein levels; these had a significantly better outcome than the other cases, so ER&#x003b2;2 protein may have a role in improved outcome for a subset of breast cancers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients and specimens</title><p>Patients undergoing treatment for invasive breast cancer during the period 1993 and 1999 at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital were identified from a database at the Cancer Tissue Bank Research Centre (CTBRC), University of Liverpool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. A total of 141 postmenopausal patients (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) with primary breast cancer were selected, median age was 68 years (range 47&#x02013;87). They had been treated by surgery (47 mastectomy, 94 wide local excision) and radiotherapy (70 cases), but had not received systemic chemotherapy or primary endocrine therapy. All patients received adjuvant endocrine therapy; either tamoxifen (n = 133) or as part of the ATAC trial (n = 8). Clinical and histological characteristics are summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. ER&#x003b1; and progesterone receptor (PgR) status was obtained from review of histopathology notes or determined immunohistochemically using a cut-off of 10% positive cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Ki67 immunostaining was reported previously as % positive tumour cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Clinical follow-up data was recorded by retrospective case-note review with data from surviving patients censored at the date last seen. Outcome measures were breast cancer relapse (BCR) and breast cancer survival (BCS). Median follow-up was 71 months for BCR (range 9 to 113) and 79 months for BCS (range 11 to 113). Ethical approval for the study was obtained from The Liverpool Adult Research Ethics Committee (Reference 01/116), who also approved the collection of samples by the CTBRC with informed consent.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Patient characteristics</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold>Characteristic</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Immunostaining cohort </bold>n (total = 141)</td><td align="center"><bold>qRTPCR cohort </bold>n (total = 100)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><bold>Histology</bold></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;invasive ductal</td><td align="center">121</td><td align="center">85</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;others</td><td align="center">20</td><td align="center">15</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Grade</bold></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;G1</td><td align="center">22</td><td align="center">14</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;G2</td><td align="center">58</td><td align="center">44</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;G3</td><td align="center">61</td><td align="center">42</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Size</bold></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;T1</td><td align="center">63</td><td align="center">44</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;T2</td><td align="center">74</td><td align="center">53</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;T3</td><td align="center">3</td><td align="center">2</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;unknown</td><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Nodal status</bold></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;+</td><td align="center">51</td><td align="center">39</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;-</td><td align="center">67</td><td align="center">49</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;unknown</td><td align="center">23</td><td align="center">12</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Vascular invasion</bold></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;present</td><td align="center">60</td><td align="center">41</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;absent</td><td align="center">81</td><td align="center">59</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>ER&#x003b1;<sup>1</sup></bold></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;+</td><td align="center">98</td><td align="center">70</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;-</td><td align="center">43</td><td align="center">30</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>PgR<sup>1</sup></bold></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;+</td><td align="center">69</td><td align="center">53</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;-</td><td align="center">72</td><td align="center">47</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>ER&#x003b2;2 protein</bold></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;high<sup>2</sup></td><td align="center">100</td><td align="center">72</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;low</td><td align="center">41</td><td align="center">19</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>ER&#x003b2;2 mRNA</bold></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;high<sup>2</sup></td><td align="center">49</td><td align="center">34</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;low</td><td align="center">51</td><td align="center">30</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>1 </sup>data from O'Neill <italic>et al</italic>.

Tissues were subjected to antigen retrieval by microwaving for 10 minutes in antigen unmasking solution (H3300, Vector Laboratories Ltd., Peterborough, UK). Slides were pre-incubated in Protein Block Serum-Free (DakoCytomation, Ely, UK) for 10 minutes. Immunostaining for ER&#x003b2;2 was performed overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with mouse anti-human ER&#x003b2;2 monoclonal antibody MCA2279S (clone no 57/3, Serotec; raised to the unique C-terminal region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and previously used for breast tumour staining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]), diluted 1 in 25 in 0.1% (w/v) BSA, 50 mM Tris, 15 mM NaCl, pH7.6. The bound antibodies were detected using the DAKO LSAB2 system, according to manufacturer's recommendations (DakoCytomation). The bound antibodies were visualized as a brown stain by incubating with DAB chromogen (Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, UK). Sections were counterstained with Mayers' Haemotaxylin (Sigma-Aldrich) and mounted in DPX (Merck, Dorset, UK). In controls the ER&#x003b2;2 antibody was preincubated with a molar excess of immunising synthetic peptide (CMKMETLLPEATMEQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]) prior to application to sections from positively-staining specimens. Nuclear staining was abolished in these blocked controls, but some cytoplasmic staining remained. Scoring of tumour sections was performed for nuclear staining only. Stained slides were analysed independently by two observers (RV and VA) using light microscopy; the percentage of positively stained malignant cells was estimated (%+) as was the staining intensity, an immuno-score (Allred) was calculated according to the Allred system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>qRTPCR</title><p>RNA of suitable quality for 100 cases was obtained from the CTBRC; testis RNA (Promega, Southhampton, UK) and MCF7 cell line RNA were used as positive controls. Cases were selected for RNA analysis following independent histological review of adjacent sections, so as to avoid high levels of tissue heterogeneity. Samples from all cases consisted of at least 75% tumour cells and 67% of cases had at least 90% tumour cells. Inflammatory infiltrates were present in a minority of cases (at 10% in 15 cases and at 25% in 4 cases).</p><p>Reverse transcription was performed in duplicate as described previously with oligo-dT primers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], but using 1.5 &#x003bc;g total RNA and Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). Quantitative PCR for ER&#x003b2;2 was performed on a Bio-Rad Icycler Real-Time PCR machine (Bio-Rad Laboratories Ltd., Hertfordshire, U.K.) using 4 &#x003bc;1 of a 1/2 dilution of cDNA per reaction (equivalent to cDNA from approximately 150 ng of total RNA). ER&#x003b2;2 PCR reactions included 1&#x000d7; IQ Supermix (Bio-Rad) and PCR primers and a Taqman probe (as given in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). For control gene PCR (HPRT, GAPDH) and ER&#x003b1; 4 &#x003bc;l of a 1/50 dilution was used and the reaction contained IQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). The PCR reactions consisted of a hot-start <italic>Taq </italic>Polymerase activation step of 95&#x000b0;C for 3 minutes, followed by conditions shown to be produce unique, specific bands for each mRNA (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Expression levels of mRNA for each gene were calculated using standard curves produced with the relevant cloned cDNAs and correcting for the control genes (HPRT and GAPDH). All amplicons crossed introns to avoid amplification of genomic DNA and the identity of PCR products was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis and DNA sequence analysis, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>qPCR conditions</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center"><bold>Gene</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Primers/Probes<sup>3</sup></bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Conc. </bold>(&#x003bc;M)</td><td align="center"><bold>Amplicon</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Cycling conditions</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><bold>ER&#x003b2;2<sup>1</sup></bold></td><td align="left">For-ATCCATGCGCCTGCTAAC</td><td align="center">0.5</td><td align="center">bases 1265&#x02013;1343</td><td align="center">50 cycles:</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Rev-GAGTGTTTGAGAGGCCTTTTCTG</td><td align="center">0.5</td><td align="center"><ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AF124790">GenBank: AF124790</ext-link></td><td align="center">95&#x000b0;C 20s, 52&#x000b0;C 20s</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Probe-TCCTGATGCTCCTGTCCCACGTCA</td><td align="center">0.2</td><td align="center"><ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AF124790"/></td><td align="center"></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><bold>ER&#x003b1;<sup>2</sup></bold></td><td align="left">For-CCACCAACCAGTGCACCATT</td><td align="center">1.0</td><td align="center">bases 1030&#x02013;1137</td><td align="center">40 cycles: 95&#x000b0;C 20s</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Rev-GGTCTTTTCGTATCCCACCTTTC</td><td align="center">1.0</td><td align="center">GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_000125">NM_000125</ext-link></td><td align="center">60&#x000b0;C 20s, 72&#x000b0;C 30s</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><bold>HPRT<sup>2</sup></bold></td><td align="left">For-GTGTTGGATATAAGCCAGACTTTGTT</td><td align="center">1.0</td><td align="center">bases 597&#x02013;763</td><td align="center">40 cycles:</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Rev-AACTCAACTTGAACTCTCATCTTAGGC</td><td align="center">1.0</td><td align="center">GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_000194">NM_000194</ext-link></td><td align="center">94&#x000b0;C 30s, 64&#x000b0;C 60s</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><bold>GAPDH<sup>2</sup></bold></td><td align="left">For-GCATCCTGGGCTACACTGAG</td><td align="center">0.5</td><td align="center">bases 917&#x02013;1079</td><td align="center">40 cycles:</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Rev-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA</td><td align="center">0.5</td><td align="center">GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_002046">NM_002046</ext-link></td><td align="center">94&#x000b0;C 30s, 65&#x000b0;C 90s</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>1 </sup>primers from Critchley <italic>et al. </italic>[25];</p><p><sup>2 </sup>primers designed in-house.</p><p><sup>3 </sup>For = forward primer; Rev = reverse primer; Probe = Taqman probe.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Power calculations were performed using the PS program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] with survival analysis implementation of Schoenfeld and Richter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. All other statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS package (Windows, v.11). The degree of agreement for immunostaining between observers was assessed using the Kappa statistic. Pearson correlation and Spearman's rank correlation were used as measures of association. Student's T-test and the Mann-Whitney U test (MW) were used to compare between groups of cases defined by other variables; for paired data paired T-tests and Wilcoxon signed ranks tests were used. Optimal cut-points for continuous variables were determined using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) plots for BCR and BCS at 5 years after surgery. Curves for outcome were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method for censored data, with surviving patients' data being censored at the date of their last clinic visit, and were compared using the Log Rank test. Unadjusted hazard ratios (HR) &#x000b1; 95% confidence intervals (CI) were obtained using Cox's univariate analysis. Cox's regression model was used for multivariate survival analysis.

Our own previous data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] was based on a semi-quantitative RTPCR analysis using an assay in which ER&#x003b2;5 is co-amplified with ER&#x003b2;2 and distinguished based on size of the PCR product, similar to the triple-primer assay used elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. We found that, using the arbitrary cut-off imposed by detection sensitivity, ER&#x003b2;2 mRNA expression was more closely associated with survival benefit than ER&#x003b2;1 or ER&#x003b2;5 mRNA expression. We therefore set out to establish whether ER&#x003b2;2 protein levels similarly predicted patient outcome. We defined discriminatory cut-points of ER&#x003b2;2 levels in a non-arbitrary manner, using ROC analysis, and used these to assess the relationship between ER&#x003b2;2 expression and outcome.</p><sec><title>Immunohistochemical staining for ER&#x003b2;2</title><p>A cohort of 141 cases were stained by immunohistochemistry for ER&#x003b2;2 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) including 98 ER&#x003b1; + cases.

The percentage of ER&#x003b2;2 positive cells were somewhat lower in grade 3 cases (P = 0.042 MW), in keeping with the association with ER&#x003b1; status. There was no association with Ki67 staining, vascular invasion, nodal status, age or size, or with ER&#x003b2;1-specific immunostaining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]; most previous studies have similarly failed to show clear links to many clinical and pathological parameters.</p><p>The association seen here between ER&#x003b2;2 and ER&#x003b1; has not always been seen by others. Although case selection and clinical setting may have some bearing on this, it is also possible that such correlations are due to better tissue preservation of antigens in some blocks of tissue. We do not think that this is the case here, as in the same cohort ER&#x003b1; but not ER&#x003b2;2 inversely correlated with p53 immunostaining (unpublished data) and ER&#x003b1; did not correlate with ER&#x003b2;1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].

When considering only ER&#x003b1; +, tamoxifen-treated cases there was no relationship between ER&#x003b2;2 immunostaining at outcome (BCR P = 0.95, BCS P = 0.65 Log Rank).</p><p>One previous study of only 50 ER&#x003b1; positive cases using immunostaining with a different antibody raised to the same ER&#x003b2;2-specific epitope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] similarly failed to show any predictive association with adjuvant tamoxifen treatment. However this analysis was based on detecting differences in staining between "sensitive" and "resistant" cases using the crude measure of relapse within 5 years of tamoxifen therapy. Unpublished observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] also failed to show any predictive value in an adjuvant setting and a similar lack of association between ER&#x003b2;2 immunostaining and outcome has recently been demonstrated in the neoadjuvant setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Hence the early outcome benefit seen with strong ER&#x003b2;2 immunostaining was not identified previously. However, an association of ER&#x003b2;2 protein with a favourable outcome has been seen in a metastatic and locally advanced setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In this case, not only was the clinical setting different, but ER&#x003b2;2 was assessed by western blot. Therefore the present study is the largest to date to assess immunostaining of ER&#x003b2;2 as a predictive marker of outcome in the postmenopausal, adjuvant endocrine setting. Results indicate that ER&#x003b2;2 protein levels did not apparently relate closely to outcome for ER&#x003b1; + cases. Rather there was some association of ER&#x003b2;2 immunostaining with better outcome in broader cohorts of patients (including ER&#x003b1;- cases), due in part to a correlation between ER&#x003b1; and ER&#x003b2;2 protein levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Association of ER&#x003b2;2 mRNA with patient survival</title><p>ER&#x003b2;2 immunostaining results are at odds with previous semi-quantitative RTPCR results. We therefore performed a repeat RTPCR analysis on a larger series of patients, but with fully quantitative RTPCR using independent cDNA synthesis reactions and different splice variant specific PCR conditions. A subgroup of 100 cases (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) with suitable quality mRNA available were used in qRTPCR for ER&#x003b2;2, ER&#x003b1; and control genes HPRT and GAPDH. Expression of ER&#x003b2;2 mRNA (mean 0.006 attomoles per &#x003bc;g total RNA) was significantly lower (P &#x0003c; 10<sup>6 </sup>paired T-test) than that of ER&#x003b1; (mean 25 attomoles per &#x003bc;g total RNA). These low levels of ER&#x003b2; mRNA (also seen with ER&#x003b2;1 and ER&#x003b2;5, results not shown) may contribute to technical difficulties in reproducibly measuring ER&#x003b2; variants and hence to the lack of consistency between different studies.</p><p>In the 100 case (ER&#x003b1; + and ER&#x003b1; -) qRTPCR cohort (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), high grade (BCR &#x00026; BCS P &#x02264; 0.001), positive nodal status (BCR &#x00026; BCS P &#x02264; 0.0005), larger size (BCS P = 0.042), ER&#x003b1; negative status (BCR P = 0.009, BCS P = 0.041) and PgR negative status (BCR P = 0.032, BCS P = 0.026) were all associated with poor outcome (Log Rank). Using an ROC-derived optimal cut-point (0.0040 attomoles per &#x003bc;g total RNA) for this 100 case cohort in Kaplan Meier Log Rank analysis, there was a significant association between higher ER&#x003b2;2 mRNA expression and good outcome (BCR P = 0.046 Log Rank, HR 0.51 CI 0.26&#x02013;1.00 P = 0.0496). As with ER&#x003b2;2 immunoscore, this association was stronger at 5 years (5-year BCR P = 0.016 Log Rank, HR 0.39 CI 0.18&#x02013;0.87 P = 0.020). Notably, unlike ER&#x003b2;2 immunostaining, no significant association was found between ER&#x003b2;2 mRNA and ER&#x003b1; immunostaining. Also unlike ER&#x003b2;2 protein, ER&#x003b2;2 mRNA and ER&#x003b1; status were independently associated with BCR at 5 years (ER&#x003b2;2 HR 0.43 CI 0.20&#x02013;0.95 P = 0.036, ER&#x003b1; HR 0.36 CI 0.18&#x02013;0.75 P = 0.006). These two measures of ER&#x003b2;2 expression therefore seem to behave differently in relation to ER&#x003b1; status and treatment outcome.</p><p>Further outcome analysis was limited to ER&#x003b1; positive women who received adjuvant tamoxifen and had a defined breast cancer related outcome (n = 62 BCR, n = 58 BCS). High grade (BCR P = 0.006, BCS P = 0.0008) and positive nodal status (BCR P = 0.003, BCS P = 0.007) maintained their association with worse outcome (Log Rank). ROC plots for BCR and BCS at 5 years indicated a significant relationship between good outcome and high qRTPCR values for ER&#x003b2;2 (BCR area under curve 0.68 CI 0.52&#x02013;0.84, P = 0.036) and the optimal cut-point was 0.0039 attomoles per &#x003bc;g total RNA. There were significant associations between outcome and ER&#x003b2;2 mRNA level using the ROC-derived cut-point (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). High ER&#x003b2;2 mRNA was significantly associated with better outcome (BCR P = 0.0095 Log Rank, HR 0.32 CI 0.13&#x02013;0.79; BCS P = 0.011 Log Rank, HR 0.25 CI 0.08&#x02013;0.79). The 5-year cumulative relapse-free population was 81% in the ER&#x003b2;2-high group (standard error 8%), compared to 55% in the ER&#x003b2;2-low group (standard error 10%); the 5-year cumulative BCS was 89% in the ER&#x003b2;2-high group (standard error 6%), compared to 62% in the ER&#x003b2;2-low group (standard error 10%).</p><p>In Cox multivariate analysis of the ER&#x003b1; + tamoxifen-treated cohort including grade, size, nodal status and PgR status, high ER&#x003b2;2 mRNA had independent significance for good outcome: for BCR ER&#x003b2;2 (HR 0.31 CI 0.11&#x02013;0.86, P = 0.024) and nodal status (HR 3.7 CI 1.2&#x02013;11.5, P = 0.022) were independently significant; for BCS ER&#x003b2;2 (HR 0.17 CI 0.05&#x02013;0.65, P = 0.0095) and grade (HR 1.8 CI 1.03&#x02013;3.3, P = 0.041) were independently significant. Notably there was no significant association between ER&#x003b2;2 and grade, size, nodal status or PgR status in this treatment-specific cohort (all P &#x0003e; 0.35 Chi-square). In ER&#x003b1; +, node negative cases (n = 33), using a lower cut-off (0.00185 attomoles per &#x003bc;g total RNA), ER&#x003b2;2 was significantly associated with better outcome (BCR P = 0.0005, BCS P &#x0003c; 0.00005 Log Rank); the 5 year cumulative relapse-free population was 96% in the ER&#x003b2;2-high group (standard error 4%), compared to 39% in the ER&#x003b2;2-low group (standard error 24%).</p><p>Our results indicate that ER&#x003b2;2 isoform mRNAs may be an independent marker for ER&#x003b1; + cases that respond well to adjuvant tamoxifen treatment. In node negative cases, where the need for additional markers of response is greatest, our study shows that low ER&#x003b2;2 mRNA levels are significantly related to worse outcome; as the cases in this subgroup analysis was small, a larger study of node negative patients is warranted. The fully quantitative nature of the qRTPCR results allows comparison of mRNA levels between different ER isoforms and of variant levels between tumours, but necessitated selection of optimal cut-points (in this case using ROC analysis) for the dichotomization required for standard outcome analysis. It should be noted that, whilst such dichotomization is useful in demonstrating associations with outcome, true utility of ER&#x003b2; variant mRNA measurement will only be demonstrated with larger patient cohorts and may be better achieved by treating mRNA quantitation as a continuous variable, as in other RTPCR based outcome predictors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Association of staining for ER&#x003b2;2 protein with mRNA expression</title><p>Associations between high levels of ER&#x003b2;2 protein (immunoscore) or mRNA (qRTPCR) and improved outcome have been seen, but only the qRTPCR results are significant in the clinically relevant ER&#x003b1; + cohort. It is therefore important to establish the relationship between mRNA and protein levels in clinical samples. Notably, most previous RTPCR-based analyses have failed to take into account the possible translational control when assigning biological or clinical relevance to ER&#x003b2; isoform expression.</p><p>When assessing the relationship between immunostaining and qRTPCR for paired samples from each case, no correlation was seen between levels of protein and mRNA for ER&#x003b2;2 [Pearson (%+) -0.12 P = 0.24; and Spearman (Allred) -0.08 P = 0.40]. This is in contrast to ER&#x003b1; in the same cohort [Pearson (%+) 0.30 P = 0.003; Spearman (Allred) 0.50 P = 1.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-6</sup>], but a similar lack of correlation was seen previously for ER&#x003b2;1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Due to tissue heterogeneity, any mRNA analysis of tissue homogenates without selection can contribute to discordance with immunostaining results that are scored on specific cell types. In order to minimise the impact of such artefacts, we selected cases for mRNA analysis that had high proportions of tumour cells (see Methods). It is known that lymphocytes express ER&#x003b2;2 mRNA, but when 14 cases with inflammatory infiltrates were excluded there was still no significant correlation between ER&#x003b2;2 mRNA and protein expression. A major factor in the discordance is that many cases express high levels of protein, but low mRNA levels; a situation that is not likely to arise from expression of mRNA in non-tumour cells. It is however possible that heterogeneity of expression in the different parts of the tumour specimen used for mRNA and protein analysis contributes to the lack of correlation and <italic>in situ </italic>analysis of mRNA and protein in adjacent sections might address this.</p><p>High ER&#x003b2;2 protein levels and high ER&#x003b2;2 mRNA levels, when entered into a Cox multivariate model, were independently associated with better relapse-free survival in the whole cohort (ER&#x003b2;2 protein HR 0.40 CI 0.20&#x02013;0.80 P = 0.010, ER&#x003b2;2 mRNA HR 0.43 CI 0.22&#x02013;0.83 P = 0.013). In multivariate analysis of mRNA and protein in the ER&#x003b1; + tamoxifen-treated cohort, only high ER&#x003b2;2 mRNA levels were significantly associated with lower BCR (HR 0.28 CI 0.212&#x02013;0.72 P = 0.008), but a trend remained for protein (HR 0.42 CI 0.15&#x02013;1.19 P = 0.10). Similar results were obtained for analysis of BCS. This indicates that both mRNA and protein levels may contribute to the relationship of ER&#x003b2;2 with improved outcome.</p><p>Using the cut-points optimised for outcome analysis, the majority of cases (69%) with high ER&#x003b2;2 mRNA levels also had high levels of ER&#x003b2;2 protein. However, only a minority of cases (44%) with high ER&#x003b2;2 protein were also classified as having high ER&#x003b2;2 mRNA. Thus ER&#x003b2;2 mRNA expression is frequently associated with expression of significant levels of ER&#x003b2;2 protein, but ER&#x003b2;2 protein expression is often dissociated from mRNA expression. Hence, there is a subset of cases (34%) with concomitant high ER&#x003b2;2 mRNA and protein and another subset of cases (44%) in which high protein levels are not accompanied by high mRNA levels. The cases with both high ER&#x003b2;2 protein and mRNA had a significantly better outcome than those with low levels of either mRNA or protein or both (P = 0.011 Log Rank, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). When cases with high ER&#x003b2;2 protein and RNA were compared a group consisting of all other cases they had significantly better outcome: in the whole cohort of ER&#x003b1; + and ER&#x003b1;- cases, (BCR P = 0.002 Log Rank, HR 0.67 CI 0.51&#x02013;0.88 P = 0.004; BCS P = 0.003 Log Rank, HR 0.61 CI 0.43&#x02013;0.87 P = 0.006) and for ER&#x003b1; + tamoxifen-treated cases (BCR P = 0.004 Log Rank, HR 0.61 CI 0.43&#x02013;0.88 P = 0.009; BCS P = 0.009 Log Rank, HR 0.56 CI 0.34&#x02013;0.91 P = 0.020). The outcome benefit of concomitant high ER&#x003b2;2 mRNA and protein levels was particularly marked at shorter follow-up, where this measure was the only independent marker of improved outcome in the ER&#x003b1; + tamoxifen-treated cohort using Cox multivariate analysis including grade, size PgR status and nodal status (5-year BCR HR 0.48 CI 0.24&#x02013;0.95 P = 0.036, 7 year BCS HR 0.46 CI 0.23&#x02013;0.92 P = 0.029). In the ER&#x003b1; + tamoxifen-treated, node negative cases, having both high ER&#x003b2;2 mRNA and protein was significantly related to an improved BCS (P = 0.028 Log Rank).</p><p>Although ER&#x003b2;2 protein levels are apparently not directly related to mRNA levels, expression of ER&#x003b2;2 protein may be important because good outcome was observed for those cases assessed as having both high mRNA and protein levels and this was independent in multivariate analysis. It is possible therefore that the relatively poor utility of ER&#x003b2;2 protein assessment by immunostaining as a measure of outcome prediction may be due to high levels of ER&#x003b2;2 protein in some cases (with lower levels of ER&#x003b2;2 mRNA) being related to some form of protein stabilization, or detection of inactive ER&#x003b2;2. The disparity between protein and RNA expression for ER&#x003b2;2 is even suggestive of an inverse relationship. Nevertheless a significant proportion of cancers (34%) had both high protein and high mRNA levels and these had a significantly better outcome than the remaining cases. This suggests that transcription of ER&#x003b2;2 mRNA drives ER&#x003b2;2 protein levels in some cases, and these cases do particularly well on tamoxifen treatment. It is perhaps unsurprising that previous studies of ER&#x003b2;2 protein expression did not find significant associations between ER&#x003b2;2 and outcome in ER&#x003b1; + tamoxifen treated cases as these did not include measurement of ER&#x003b2;2 mRNA levels. They were thus unable to distinguish between ERB2 protein associated with increased transcription and that possibly present due to some form of post-transcriptional control (or perhaps the breakdown of normal control).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Whilst our data would suggest that high ER&#x003b2;2 levels could contribute to an improved outcome in a subgroup of patients, it provides further evidence that determination of ER&#x003b2;2 protein by immunostaining is unlikely to provide the predictive test that is needed for better targeting of additional therapy in those women for whom adjuvant tamoxifen is not likely to be sufficient. The failure to link protein expression to outcome measures does not preclude the use of ER&#x003b2;2 mRNA levels in a clinical setting. Low ER&#x003b2;2 mRNA was significantly associated with worse outcomes in ER&#x003b1; + tamoxifen-treated patients independently of other factors such as grade and nodal status. Larger trials to validate ER&#x003b2;2 mRNA as a biomarker are needed and should be extended to alternative adjuvant endocrine therapies such as aromatase inhibitors.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>BCR = breast cancer relapse; BCS = breast cancer survival; CI = confidence interval; ER&#x003b1; = oestrogen receptor alpha; ER&#x003b2; = oestrogen receptor beta; HR = hazard ratio; MW = Mann-Whitney U test; %+ = percentage positive cells; PgR = progesterone receptor; qRTPCR = quantitative reverse-transcription PCR analysis; ROC = Receiver Operating Characteristic.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>RV performed qRTPCR analysis and immunostaining under the supervision of MD.
