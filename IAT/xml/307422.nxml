The typical and individual properties of their structural organization are analyzed. Promoters are subgrouped according to the extent of the polymerase contact area. A set of alternative sequence elements that could be responsible for RNA polymerase attachment in different promoter groups is suggested on the basis of their sequence homology near the hyperreactive sites. The model of alternative pathways used for promoter activation is discussed.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00022-0009.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4533"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00022-0010.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4534"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00022-0011.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4535"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00022-0012.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4536"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00022-0013.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4537"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00022-0014.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4538"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00022-0015.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4539"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00022-0016.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4540"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00022-0017.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4541"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
