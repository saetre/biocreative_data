Multistage development of the disease has been associated with remarkable genetic events, mainly at the level of oncogenes and oncosuppressor genes, most notably the adenomatous polyposis coli gene (APC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], ras [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Although great advances have been made during the last few decades in understanding the molecular biology of colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], the prognosis of patients with this neoplasm has not improved in parallel. The overall five-year survival rate remains poor (40&#x02013;45%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. It can be assumed that several genes involved in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer are still unknown. Therefore, further elucidation of the molecular biology of colorectal cancer may be useful to devise new methods for the diagnosis and the treatment of the disease.</p><p>Several approaches have been taken to identify and compare gene expression in normal and disease states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The differential display technique was employed in this study based on its ability to identify both up-regulated genes (putative oncogenes) and down-regulated genes (putative tumor/metastasis suppressor genes) simultaneously. Differential Display (DD) is a useful method to compare patterns of gene expression in RNA samples of different types or under different biological conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The technique produces partial cDNA fragments by a combination of reverse transcription (RT) and PCR of randomly primed RNA. Changes in the expression level of genes are identified after separation of the cDNA fragments produced in an arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction on a sequencing-type gel. When combined with real-time quantitative PCR to eliminate false positives, DD becomes a powerful method for generating high confidence hits in the screening of hundreds of potentially differentially expressed transcripts. A number of genes such as UCC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], Reg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and PIGR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] have been detected by DD-PCR to be associated with colorectal cancer.</p><p>In this study, we found that <italic>DHX32</italic>, a novel RNA helicase, was significantly up-regulated in colorectal cancer compared to its adjacent normal tissue using a combination of DD-PCR and real-time PCR methods. Our results suggested that the level of <italic>DHX32 </italic>gene expression in colorectal cancer was significantly associated with cancer location, lymph gland metastasis, cancer nodal status, differentiation grade and Dukes' stage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>34 pairs of specimens (tumor tissues and their adjacent normal tissues) and 14 tumor tissues were obtained from patients with colorectal cancer who underwent surgical resection at the Xiamen Zhongshan Hospital, Xiamen University in Xiamen during 2006 and 2007.

Consequently, further studies of CRC-related genes would help better understand the tumorigenesis of CRC and develop new methods for population screening, follow-up of treated patients, prognosis, and new therapies of the disease. In this study, we demonstrated that human <italic>DHX32</italic>, a novel RNA helicase, was up-regulated in colorectal cancer compared to its adjacent normal tissues. Furthermore, our results suggested that the level of <italic>DHX32 </italic>gene expression in colorectal carcinoma was significantly associated with tumor location, lymph gland metastasis, tumor nodal status, differentiation grade, and Dukes' stage.</p><p><italic>DHX32 </italic>was originally identified as a novel RNA helicase with unique structure in the helicase domain, but with overall similarity to the DHX family of helicases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. RNA helicases are enzymes that utilize the energy derived from nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) hydrolysis to modulate the structure of RNA molecules and thus potentially influence all biochemical steps involving RNA which at least include transcription, splicing, transport, translation, decay, and ribosome biogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The involvement of RNA molecules in these steps is influenced by their tendency to form secondary structures and by their interaction with other RNA molecules and proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. <italic>DHX32 </italic>is composed of 12 exons spanning a 60-kb region at human chromosome 10q26 and encodes for a 743 amino acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of 84.4 kDa. <italic>DHX32 </italic>has a widespread tissue distribution and also has cross-species counterparts, such as 84 and 80% amino acid identity with mouse and rat counterparts, respectively. The high level of similarity between human and murine <italic>DHX32 </italic>and the widespread expression of <italic>DHX32 </italic>message suggest that it is an evolutionally conserved and functionally important gene.</p><p>With a few notable exceptions, the biochemical activities and biological roles of RNA helicases, including <italic>DHX32</italic>, are not very well characterized. In our study, we found that <italic>DHX32 </italic>was overexpressed in colorectal cancer compared with the adjacent normal tissues, suggesting that abnormal expression of <italic>DHX32 </italic>is associated with the development of colorectal cancer. The involvement of <italic>DHX32 </italic>in other cancer development was previously demonstrated by other groups. For example, the expression of <italic>DHX32 </italic>was dysregulated in several lymphoid malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. DHX32 was reported as anti-sense to another gene, BCCIP (BRCA2 and CDKN1A Interacting Protein), and BCCIP was down-regulated in kidney tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The overexpression of one of BCCIP isoforms can inhibit tumor growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>So far, several groups have attempted to reveal the underlying mechanisms by which <italic>DHX32 </italic>involves in cancer development, but the exact biochemical activities and biological functions of <italic>DHX32 </italic>are still elusive. DHX32 contains sequences which are highly conserved between a subfamily of DEAH RNA helicases, including the yeast pre-mRNA splicing factor Prp43 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and its mammalian ortholog DHX15. The structural similarity of <italic>DHX32 </italic>to RNA helicases involved in mRNA splicing suggests a role in pre-mRNA splicing. It is possible that the dysregulation of the normal function of RNA helicases can potentially result in abnormal RNA processing with deleterious effects on the expression/function of key proteins in normal cell cycles and contribute to cancer development and/or progression. There are several examples of dyregulation of RNA helicases in cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], mostly in the forms of overexpression including those of <italic>DDX5 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and <italic>DDX6 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] which were reported to be overexpressed in colorectal tumor.</p><p>Our results indicated that the differential expression of <italic>DHX32 </italic>in colorectal carcinoma was significantly associated with tumor location, lymph gland metastasis, tumor nodal status, differentiation grade, and Dukes' stage. These results not only further confirmed the possible critical role of <italic>DHX32 </italic>in human colorectal development, but also suggested that additional studies may help develop <italic>DHX32 </italic>as a potential biomarker to judge the prognosis of colorectal cancer patients: the patients with higher gene expression of <italic>DHX32 </italic>may have worse prognosis.</p><p>In conclusion, to our knowledge, we are the first to report the more frequent and significant overexpression of human <italic>DHX32 </italic>in human CRC than that of the adjacent normal tissue, indicating that overexpression of <italic>DHX32 </italic>may play a pivotal role in the multistage carcinogenesis of human CRC. It still remains to be further investigated for the functions of <italic>DHX32 </italic>during the progression of colorectal cancer. <italic>DHX32 </italic>may also serve as a bio-marker for judging the levels of malignancy of colorectal cancer, which may guide the development of anticancer therapy regime after additional studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p><italic>DHX32 </italic>may play an important role in the development of colorectal cancer and additional studies may help use <italic>DHX32 </italic>as a novel biomarker for colorectal
