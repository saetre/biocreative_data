Here, we find that the DNA damage sensors, Mec1, Mec3 and Rad24 control Type II recombination, while the Rad9 adaptor protein and the Rad53 and Chk1 effector kinases have no effect on survivor type selection. Therefore, the Mec1 and Mec3 checkpoint complexes control telomeric recombination independently of their roles in generating and amplifying the Mec1-Rad53-Chk1 kinase cascade. <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic> mutant cells, bearing a mutation in Replication Protein A (RPA) conferring a defect in recruiting Mec1-Ddc2, were also deficient in both types of telomeric recombination. Importantly, expression of an Rfa1-t11-Ddc2 hybrid fusion protein restored checkpoint-dependent arrest, but did not rescue defective telomeric recombination. Therefore, the Rfa1-t11-associated defect in telomeric recombination is not solely due to its failure to recruit Mec1. We have also isolated novel alleles of <italic>RFA1</italic> that were deficient in Type I but not in Type II recombination and proficient in checkpoint control. Therefore, the checkpoint and recombination functions of RPA can be genetically separated, as can the RPA-mediated control of the two types of telomeric recombination.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Telomeres, the ends of eukaryotic linear chromosomes, are required for overall genome stability. Telomeric DNA is made of tandem arrays of TG-rich nucleotide repeats of variable length depending on the organisms (&#x0223c;300 bp in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, 5&#x02013;15 kb in humans) and kept at a constant value in a given organism. Telomeric proteins, organized around telomeric DNA, provide both telomere end protection and processes for access of telomerase during telomere replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). Telomere length homeostasis is crucial for two main reasons. First, removal of the terminal primer at the end of lagging-strand during DNA synthesis leaves a small gap that cannot be filled in, a phenomenon known as the &#x02018;end-replication problem&#x02019; [e.g. see Ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>)]. Telomere replication, by a specialized reverse transcriptase, telomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>), solves this problem by maintaining telomeres at a constant length. Second, maintenance of telomeric tracts of a minimal size is needed for recruitment by telomeric DNA sequences of specialized telomeric proteins. The major function of telomere end protection proteins is to prevent inappropriate access of DNA repair or modification proteins, such as exonucleases. The processes underlying telomere replication and telomere end protection are intimately linked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). For instance, in yeast and humans, both telomere erosion and telomere uncapping can trigger telomeric senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Classically, inactivation of telomerase or of the yeast <italic>EST</italic> proteins trigger telomeric senescence during which telomeres shorten critically so as to lead to cell death after &#x0223c;75&#x02013;100 generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). Telomeric senescence activates the DNA damage checkpoint that ultimately leads to a cell cycle arrest of the senescing cells at the G<sub>2</sub>/M transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>).</p><p>In recent years, increasing interest has been focused on a telomerase-independent mechanism for maintaining telomeric repeats that relies on homologous recombination between the repeated telomeric DNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). This pathway, first discovered in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>), allows senescing cells deficient in telomerase function, such as <italic>est</italic> or <italic>tlc1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>), to maintain indefinitely functional telomeres, and, hence, viability, in the absence of telomerase. These mechanisms are receiving much attention at the moment due to the recent finding that they are also operating in some human tumor cells, in which they are known as the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). In <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, the rare cells escaping telomeric senescence, termed post-senescence survivors, use two distinct pathways of recombination, based on the initial observation that Rad52, essential for recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>), was needed for this telomerase-independent maintenance of telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). In telomerase-negative, otherwise wild-type, cells, a first class of survivors (of type I), relying on Rad51, were found to amplify the subtelomeric Y&#x02032; elements and had very short terminal tracts of TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> DNA, while Rad50-dependent type II survivors amplified the terminal TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> sequences with no evidence for rearrangement of Y&#x02032; elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). In the yeast <italic>Kluveromyces lactis</italic>, small rolling circles of single- or double-stranded telomeric DNA resulting from the resolution of an intratelomeric invasion provide one mechanism that is responsible for the generation of the long type II telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). Very recently, extra-chromosomal circles of DNA have also been identified in both type I and type II post-senescent survivor <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). In addition to these recombination-dependent pathways of survival to telomeric senescence, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> telomerase-negative cells have also been shown to utilize recombination-independent pathways that involved repair of DNA double-strand break by palindromic DNA structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>).</p><p>A number of factors have been found to affect the selection of the survivor type in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>. In most of these cases, factors affecting telomere end protection or the processing of damaged telomeric DNA were implicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Interestingly, the checkpoint proteins of the phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinase-like family, Mec1 and Tel1 (homologues to the human ATR and ATM, respectively), have been recently found to be required for type II recombination in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Here, we focused our attention on the role of Mec1, as well as that of other checkpoint proteins, in survivor type selection. We also document the role of Replication Protein A (RPA) in telomeric recombination by analyzing a particular allele of its larger subunit, <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic>, previously reported to be defective in recruiting Mec1/ATR and Ddc2/ATRIP at sites of damaged DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>), as well as in recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). Finally, we have isolated separation-of-function <italic>rfa1</italic> mutants that exhibit checkpoint proficiency but telomeric recombination defects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast strains and plasmids</title><p>All strains used in this study were in the BF264-15D genetic background used in our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>).

The membrane was then pre-hybridized in 6&#x000d7; SSC, 0.1% SDS, 1% non-fat milk and hybridized with a 270 bp TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub><sup>32</sup>P-labeled telomeric probe. Following digestion with XhoI, to cut within the Y&#x02032; regions of chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>), telomere tracts of wild-type cells appear as a broad-band of &#x0223c;1.2&#x02013;1.3 kb, which represents the average length of most chromosomes, those containing Y&#x02032; subtelomeric regions. From non-Y&#x02032; chromosomes, XhoI cutting typically generates fragments migrating at &#x0223c;2.1, 2.3, 3.3 and 3.9 kb in Southerns. In senescing cells, the disappearance of the non-Y&#x02032; fragments attests to the fact that survivors have arisen by homologous recombination [see, for instance, Ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>)]. In some experiments, genomic DNA was digested with a mixture of four restriction enzymes (AluI, HaeIII, HinfI and MspI) using a 4 bp recognition sequence and the Southern revealed with a TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> probe. Since these enzymes cut within telomeric Y&#x02032; sequences but not within the TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> sequences, they are currently used to confirm identification of type II telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). In some cases, a <sup>32</sup>P-labeled Y&#x02032; probe was used. Results were analyzed using a Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and ImageQuant.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of the kinetics of senescence/survival and of growth rates</title><p>Telomerase-negative cells undergo senescence in 75&#x02013;100 generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). In all kinetics, senescence of <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; haploid mutant cells, and of their derivatives, was initiated after the <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394;/<italic>TLC1</italic><sup>+</sup> diploids or their derivatives were induced to sporulate. In the &#x02018;liquid assays&#x02019;, selected spores of the desired genotype were individually propagated for over 100 generations as exponentially growing liquid cultures that were, under standard conditions, diluted to 10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml every day. In some experiments, wherever indicated, liquid cultures of senescing cells were diluted to 10<sup>6</sup> or 10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml every day, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). Under such conditions, telomeric senescence took place in the liquid culture, thus resulting in a mixture of both possible survivor types and allowing the conversion from types I to types II that normally occurs in telomerase-negative cells, due to a selective growth advantage of types II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). In &#x02018;streak assays&#x02019;, which allowed the detection of both type I and type II survivors, re-streaking of single colonies on a YEPD agar-based plate was repeated every 48 h (typically, cells underwent &#x0223c;25 generations per streakout or passage at 29&#x000b0;C) to allow loss of viability and appearance of survivors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). The occurrence of senescence was determined from analyzing the progression with time of the growth rate or from the appearance of post-senescence survivors on the plates, as well as from the analysis of telomere structure by Southern blotting with a telomeric probe, as described above.</p></sec><sec><title>Construction of fusion proteins</title><p>Plasmids expressing the Rfa1-t11-Rad52, Rfa1-t11-Ddc2 and Rfa1-t11-HA in-frame fusion proteins were constructed by cloning in a single-copy, centromeric, plasmid the entire ORF of the first part of the hybrid protein plus upstream promoter sequences, in front of the ORF, (which included its natural stop codon) of the second part of the hybrid protein, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>).

Standard <italic>Taq</italic> polymerase and PCR buffer (Invitrogen) were used. Following a 30-cycle amplification, the PCR products were cleaned and, according to the gap repair method, transformed directly into <italic>rfa1</italic>::<italic>Kan</italic>-<italic>MX4</italic> YCp33-<italic>RFA1</italic>-<italic>URA3</italic> (including promoter sequences, ORF and post-stop sequences) strains, together with another centromeric <italic>LEU2</italic> plasmid (YCp111) made linear by digestion with NdeI and carrying <italic>RFA1</italic> flanking regions at each extremity: region &#x02212;267 to +166 (position of an endogenous NdeI site) at one end, and region +2000 to +2169 (position of another endogenous NdeI site) (the TAA stop codon starts at position +1861) at the other end. Thus, sequences upstream and downstream of <italic>RFA1</italic> were available for homologous recombination, while all of <italic>RFA1</italic> ORF (with the exception of the first 166 bp) were available for PCR-based mutagenesis. Cells were plated onto leucine-lacking medium at 25&#x000b0;C. Around 10&#x02009;000 transformants grew up which were transferred to leucine-lacking liquid medium and then plated on 5-FOA-containing medium at 25&#x000b0;C in order to force the loss of the YCp33-<italic>RFA1</italic>-<italic>URA3</italic> plasmid. Growing colonies were then re-streaked on YEPD medium and then analyzed for possible defects in telomeric recombination, as explained above, after introduction, by crossing, of a telomerase-negative (<italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394;) mutation.

Two types of recombination can be generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Type I involves recombination between the homologous subtelomeric sequences Y&#x02032; and, in telomerase-negative, otherwise wild-type, cells, is Rad51-dependent, while type II involves recombination between the telomeric TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> sequences and is Rad50- and Rad59-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). It is currently agreed, as previously explained in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>), that the type I telomere pattern is most easily visualized by XhoI digestion Southern blot analysis. XhoI cleaves 0.9 kb from the 3&#x02032; end of the Y&#x02032; element yielding a &#x0223c;1.3 kb terminal fragment corresponding to the distal part of the Y&#x02032; element plus the &#x0223c;0.3&#x02013;0.4 kb of terminal TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> tracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In type I survivors, the TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> terminal tracts have become eroded and the XhoI-restricted terminal fragment is now &#x0223c;0.9&#x02013;1.0 kb long (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast to type I survivors, type II survivors exhibit many XhoI fragments of different sizes [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>)]. The terminal part of the Y&#x02032; elements contain short TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> tracts, allowing type I survivors to be also conveniently detectable with a TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> probe [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>)]. Although type II survivors grow better than type I survivors, &#x0223c;90% of <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; surviving cells display type I telomeres when grown on solid (agar-based) media [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>)]. On the other hand, and most importantly for the experiments described below, when <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; surviving cells are grown in liquid medium, 100% type II cells are typically recovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), because, due to their faster growth, which is similar to that of wild-type cells, they quickly overtake the population of type I survivors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>).</p><p>Telomerase-negative cells also bearing a null mutation in the <italic>MEC3</italic> checkpoint gene had difficulties in generating type II cells, even in liquid medium. Thus, when grown in liquid rich medium for about 130 generations (crisis occurs &#x0223c;80&#x02013;100 generations after inactivation of telomerase), only &#x0223c;20% of <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>mec3</italic>&#x00394; cells displayed type II telomeres <italic>versus</italic> 100% of type II for the <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>MEC3</italic><sup>+</sup> control (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We verified that in the <italic>mec3</italic>&#x00394; background type II survivors also grew better than type I survivors (data not shown). The Mec3 complex (Ddc1 and Rad17 are the other two components) represents, together with the Mec1&#x02013;Ddc2 complex, DNA damage sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). The Mec1 and Mec3 complexes are recruited independently to DNA double-strand breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>). Interestingly, telomerase-negative cells bearing a <italic>mec1</italic>&#x00394; mutation have been previously shown to be deficient in type II recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). To better document the relationships between telomeric recombination and the DNA damage checkpoint, we next constructed additional checkpoint-negative telomerase-negative double mutants and analyzed their pattern of telomeric recombination after extended propagation in liquid cultures. Among these, <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rad17</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rad24</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>mec1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>sml1</italic>&#x00394;, similarly to <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>mec3</italic>&#x00394;, had difficulties in generating type II survivors after crisis. On the other hand, <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rad9</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rad53</italic>&#x00394; <italic>sml1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>chk1</italic>&#x00394; were fully proficient in type II recombination (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). It should be noted that Rad24 is required for the loading of the Mec3&#x02013;Ddc1&#x02013;Rad17 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). The Rad9 checkpoint adaptor and the Rad53 and Chk1 effector kinases are subsequently activated after the Mec1 and Mec3 complexes have bound damaged DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). It appears, therefore, that among the different classes of checkpoint proteins, only the DNA damage sensors have an effect on the type of telomeric recombination. In agreement with the finding above that in mutants of the Mec3 complex type II recombination, although diminished, was still possible, we recovered 100% type II survivors after <italic>RAD51</italic> had been deleted in the <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rad17</italic>&#x00394; mutant (Table 3).</p><p>Mec1 is, together with Tel1 (homologues of ATR and ATM in humans, respectively), a protein kinase of the phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinase-like family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>). In budding yeast, phosphorylation of target checkpoint proteins by Mec1 is necessary for initiating the DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>).

After verifying by sequencing actual introduction of the <italic>mec1</italic>-<italic>kd</italic> mutation at the <italic>MEC1</italic> locus in our wild-type background, as well as associated-hypersensitivity to the genotoxic agent methyl methane sulfonate (MMS) and concomitant failure to activate endogenous Rad53-HA (data not shown), we constructed the <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>mec1</italic>-<italic>kd sml1</italic>&#x00394; mutant strain and analyzed its survivor type during post-senescence. Only around one-third of the <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>mec1</italic>-<italic>kd sml1</italic>&#x00394; senescing cells generated type II survivors in liquid cultures, in contrast with the usual 100% type II in the <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>MEC1</italic><sup>+</sup> control (data not shown). We conclude that, in this assay, the <italic>mec1</italic>-<italic>kd</italic> mutation behaves like a null <italic>mec1</italic> mutation and, therefore, the control of telomeric recombination necessitates Mec1 protein kinase activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Overexpression of <italic>CLB2</italic> rescues the defect in type II recombination conferred by a mutation in the Mec3 complex</title><p>A null mutation in <italic>CLB2</italic>, coding for the major <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> B-type cyclin, as well as temperature-sensitive mutations in <italic>CDC28</italic> (Cdk1), were recently found to confer a defect in type II telomeric recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>), similar to those found here for <italic>mec1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>mec3</italic>&#x00394; mutants. We reasoned that both mechanisms might be related and set out to establish a functional link between the two events. To this end, we overexpressed <italic>CLB2</italic> from an episomal plasmid (under the control of its native promoter) in <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>ddc1</italic>&#x00394; double mutants. As expected, because Ddc1 is a component of the Mec3 complex, <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>ddc1</italic>&#x00394; mutants were deficient in type II recombination (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We noted that in these experiments with <italic>CLB2</italic> overexpression, some of the samples did not exhibit as clear-cut type I characteristics as usual (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This may have been due to the fact that these cells were cultivated on selective medium to maintain the plasmid within the cells, thereby generating poorer growth and less efficient recombination. However, under identical conditions, overexpression of <italic>CLB2</italic> could rescue the defect conferred by <italic>ddc1</italic>&#x00394; in telomerase-negative cells to the same extent as it did in rescuing the defect of <italic>CLB2</italic>-deleted telomerase-negative cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We therefore conclude that the defect in type II recombination conferred by a mutation in the Mec3 complex might be functionally related to that conferred by a deficit in Cdc28-Clb2.</p><p>Possible cell cycle alterations in Clb2 levels could be invoked to explain the type II recombination defects in telomerase-negative cells bearing a mutation in the Mec3&#x02013;Ddc1&#x02013;Rad17 complex. To evaluate this possibilty, we measured Clb2 levels by immunoprecipitation of endogenous <italic>CLB2</italic>-HA in the <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>ddc1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; mutants. Clb2 levels did not vary in the absence of Ddc1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We also assessed <italic>CLB2</italic>-HA levels following overexpression from a multi-copy plasmid, the same conditions as those used for determining the survivor type in these mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Similar levels of overproduced Clb2 from one isolate to the other in both strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) indicated that, under these experimental conditions, comparing the survivor type in various mutants, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, is technically relevant. This was expected as in the multi-copy plasmid, <italic>CLB2</italic>-HA was under the control of its native promoter, like in the integrative plasmid. In addition, we observed that Clb2 levels were slightly decreased in the absence of Ddc1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This may reflect a slight effect of the <italic>ddc1</italic>&#x00394; mutation on endogenous Clb2 levels, but detectable only at higher levels of expression for reasons of increased sensitivity. Alternatively, this may reflect the exsitence of a mechanism of control of <italic>CLB2</italic> expression in this checkpoint-deficient mutant.</p><p>We next evaluated the possibility that the type II defect observed in telomerase-negative cells bearing a mutation in the Mec3&#x02013;Ddc1&#x02013;Rad17 complex might in fact reflect alterations in the type I recombination machinery. For instance, it was possible that the intracellular levels of Rad51, (which controls type I recombination) were increased in these mutants and that this could affect telomeric recombination. To test this hypothesis, we overexpressed <italic>RAD51</italic> (from a multi-copy, episomal, plasmid) in various strains and analyzed the pattern of telomeric recombination. This had no visible effect as <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; single mutants overexpressing <italic>RAD51</italic> still continued to produce 100% type II survivors, while overexpression of <italic>RAD51</italic> in <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rad17</italic>&#x00394; double mutants did not alter their rate of type II defect (data not shown). It is therefore unlikely that the type II defect conferred by a mutation in the Mec3&#x02013;Ddc1&#x02013;Rad17 complex is due to this complex somehow inhibiting Rad51 at the telomeres.</p></sec><sec><title>RPA controls both types of telomeric recombination</title><p>RPA, a single-stranded DNA-binding protein essential for DNA replication, has been implicated in a number of DNA metabolism reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>). RPA is generally considered to be the initial sensor of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>), but, because some studies have found that Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>) or Mre11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>) were recruited first at DNA double-strand breaks, the issue is still the matter of debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>). RPA has been evolutionary conserved and, in humans, consists, of three subunits, RPA70, RPA32 and RPA14, homologues in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> to Rfa1, Rfa2 and Rfa3, respectively. In yeast and humans, RPA binds single-stranded DNA generated after resection of DNA double-strand breaks, then Ddc2/ATRIP, thereby loading the Mec1&#x02013;ATR complex and activating the checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Numerous mutants of <italic>RFA1</italic>, mainly, have been isolated based on their sensitivity to genotoxic stress, defects in various types of recombination or in DNA replication. Because RPA has been recently shown to recruit Ddc2-Mec1 at sites of DNA damage, a function lost in the <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>), we chose to use the <italic>rfa1-t11</italic> (K45E) mutant to further document the <italic>mec1</italic>&#x00394;-induced telomeric recombination defect described above. Moreover, <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic>-induced defects in recombination and adaptation to DNA damage have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>). As detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), telomerase-negative cells bearing the <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic> mutation were severely affected in telomeric recombination events. Incidentally, survivors (all of type I) from <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic> mutants appeared when the liquid cultures were propagated using a lower dilution [10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml every 24 h; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>; the rate of dilution has recently been proven to be important in such experiments; Ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>)]. However, intriguingly, deletion of <italic>RAD51</italic> (essential for type I recombination in telomerase-negative, otherwise wild-type, cells) in <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic> mutants still allowed the production of survivors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). Although we have not directly tested whether Y&#x02032; elements were amplified in these <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic> mutants, the absence of any amplification of TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, last lane), together with the existence of only two types of telomeric sequences being amplified in telomerase-negative cells, namely Y&#x02032; and TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>), most probably identify these survivors as type I survivors. The complete absence of any survivor in senescing <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11 rad59</italic>&#x00394; mutants indicated that this <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic>-associated type I recombination (atypically) relied on the Rad59 pathway (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Targeting Rad52 at Rfa1-t11 binding sites restores type I, but not type II, recombination</title><p>Some aspects of type II recombination are still very mysterious because the Rad51 recombinase, essential for strand invasion, is dispensable during these homologous recombination processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). Interactions between RPA and Rad51 (and Rad52) are relatively well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>). On the other hand, the putative role of RPA in type II telomeric recombination is totally unknown. As Rad52 participates in -and is essential for- both type I and type II recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>), we set out to determine whether targeting Rad52 at the sites for binding of the recombination-deficient Rfa1-t11 protein would have the same effect on these two types of recombination. Expression of fusion (hybrid) proteins has been shown to represent a valuable tool to decipher telomeric pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>). Here, we constructed an <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic>-<italic>RAD52</italic> chimeric gene and expressed it, together with the appropriate control constructs, in <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic> mutants. Survivors from <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rfa1-t11</italic> p-<italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic>-<italic>RAD52</italic> were generated, in the liquid assay, while <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rfa1-t11</italic> mutants did not generate survivors at all under identical conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Under the usual criteria, these survivors appeared to be of type I, with the reserve, however, that bands in the 2.0&#x02013;3.0 kb range were still present in some isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, left panel). In both types of survivors, the disappearance of the non-Y&#x02032; fragments (migrating at &#x0223c;2.1, 2.3, 3.3 and 3.9 kb) attests to the occurrence of homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). Since in <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rfa1-t11</italic> p-<italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic>-<italic>RAD52</italic> cells, some of these bands were still visible, we set out to further characterize these survivors. To this end, the same blot as that shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> (left panel) was reprobed with an Y&#x02032; probe. The telomeric fragments migrating at &#x0223c;1.1 kb, representative of type I recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), were heavily labeled over the background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, left panel). We also digested the genomic DNA from the <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rfa1-t11</italic> p-<italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic>-<italic>RAD52</italic> cells with a mixture of four base cutter restriction enzymes that is sometimes used to identify type II recombination on the TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> substrate [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>); see also Materials and Methods]. This also identified these survivors as type I survivors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, middle panel). Finally, the survivors from the <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rfa1-t11</italic> p-<italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic>-<italic>RAD52</italic> strain depended on Rad51 for their maintenance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), as do normal survivors from telomerase-negative, otherwise wild-type, cells. Therefore the Rfa1-t11-Rad52 fusion protein does rescue telomeric recombination but leaves cells with an <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic>-associated specific defect in type II recombination.</p><p>To try to confirm these findings above, we also performed experiments with <italic>RAD52</italic> expressed from a plasmid. Interestingly, overexpression of <italic>RAD52</italic> from a multi-copy (episomal) plasmid also rescued the recombination defect in <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rfa1-t11</italic> cells, only type I but not type II, like the Rfa1-t11-Rad52 fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Importantly, slight overexpression of <italic>RAD52</italic> from a centromeric plasmid (the same sort as that used for the <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic>-<italic>RAD52</italic> fusion experiments described above) did not rescue the recombination defect in <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rfa1-t11</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Therefore, in the experiments with the <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic>-<italic>RAD52</italic> fusion, the effect of Rad52 on telomeric recombination is really due to targeting to <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic>'s binding sites and not merely to moderate increase in its intracellular amounts. In summary, targeting of Rad52 to Rfa1-t11's binding sites with two different strategies produce the same phenotype, namely selective rescue of telomeric recombination.</p></sec><sec><title>An Rfa1&#x02013;t11&#x02013;Ddc2 fusion protein restores the checkpoint function of rfa1-t11 cells but not its recombination function</title><p>RPA and Rad52 are likely to interact functionally and physically, thereby modulating the interactions between RPA and Rad51 during repair of double-strand breaks by homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>), as well as during type I telomeric recombination, as seen above. Since in wild-type cells, RPA recruits Mec1-Ddc2 at the sites of DNA double-strand breaks, an event that is defective in <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>), and since <italic>mec1</italic>&#x00394; cells are defective in type II recombination [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>); present data], we next wanted to determine whether failure of the Rfa1-Ddc2 interaction in <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic> was responsible for the type II recombination defect in this mutant. Because we were confident that fusion proteins implicating Rfa1-t11 could be reliable, as seen above, we decided to use an Rfa1&#x02013;t11&#x02013;Ddc2 fusion protein to target Mec1-Ddc2 at the sites of telomeric damage. First, we determined whether the hybrid protein could rescue the checkpoint defect of the <italic>rfa1-t11</italic> mutation in the <italic>cdc13-1</italic> background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>). We did not expect to rescue the lethality conferred by the absence of <italic>DDC2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>) with this chimeric protein, but only aimed at trying to restore Rfa1-t11's defect in Ddc2 binding without interfering with other Ddc2 functions. Consequently, these experiments were performed in a <italic>DDC2</italic><sup>+</sup> background. <italic>cdc13-1 rfa1-t11</italic> cells expressing the <italic>rfa1-t11-DDC2</italic> fusion construct clearly grew less at 29&#x000b0;C than when expressing the plasmid alone, but still grew better than <italic>cdc13</italic>-<italic>1</italic> cells, thereby suggesting partial re-establishment of a functional DNA damage checkpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).</p><p>Improved growth of <italic>cdc13</italic>-<italic>1</italic> cells can result not only from checkpoint inactivation, but also from diminished amounts of damaged DNA, such as in <italic>exo1</italic>&#x00394; mutants, for instance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>). Since RPA is likely to readily affect processing of damaged DNA and to control exonucleases, we set out to assess checkpoint activation in a different manner. The phosphorylation state of Rad53, an event that reflects its activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref>), was visualized by western blotting using anti-HA antibodies in strains in which a <italic>RAD53-HA</italic> fusion gene had been introduced at the <italic>RAD53</italic> locus. As expected, Rad53 was massively phosphorylated in <italic>cdc13</italic>-<italic>1</italic> mutant cells at 34&#x000b0;C, but not at 24&#x000b0;C, and this signal was absent in <italic>cdc13-1 rad9</italic>&#x00394; cells at either temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In <italic>cdc13-1 rfa1-t11</italic> cells, Rad53 phosphorylation was intermediate between these two fully active and inactive states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), in agreement with the previous finding that the <italic>rfa1-t11</italic> allele is not completely defective in checkpoint activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>). Importantly, Rad53 exhibited a higher degree of phosphorylation in <italic>cdc13-1 rfa1-t11</italic> cells bearing the <italic>rfa1-t11-DDC2</italic> construct than in <italic>cdc13-1 rfa1-t11</italic> cells expressing the control fusions or plasmid alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Indeed, an additional Rad53 shifted band was present in the former sample compared with the control samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Increased Rad53 activation in cells expressing the Rfa1&#x02013;t11&#x02013;Ddc2 fusion was also evident from the observation of a decrease in the intensity of the Rad53 lower band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Altogether, these data indicated that the Rfa1&#x02013;t11&#x02013;Ddc2 fusion protein is capable of restoring, at least partially, the DNA damage checkpoint.</p><p>We next asked whether the <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>11</italic>-<italic>DDC2</italic> construct could cure the <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic>-associated telomeric recombination defects. <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rfa1-t11</italic> cells bearing the <italic>rfa1-t11-DDC2</italic> construct were unable to generate any survivors at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), as observed in <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rfa1-t11</italic> cells under identical conditions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus, partial rescue of Rfa1-t11's checkpoint defect by the Rfa1&#x02013;t11&#x02013;Ddc2 fusion protein does not result in concomitant rescue of telomeric recombination. At this point, we hypothesized that the interaction between RPA and Mec1-Ddc2 might be important for operating some processes only of type II recombination. We therefore set out to provide <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic> mutants with a functional Rad52 machinery and determine whether the <italic>rfa1-t11-DDC2</italic> fusion could now make type II recombination work. <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic> cells co-expressing <italic>RAD52</italic> and the <italic>rfa1-t11-DDC2</italic> fusion could generate type I survivors, as observed above with the <italic>rfa1-t11-RAD52</italic> construct alone, but were still unable to produce type II survivors (data not shown). These data suggest that the telomeric recombination defect conferred by <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic> does not result from improper recruitment of Ddc2-Mec1 at damaged telomeres. Moreover, a functional interaction between RPA and the Mec1-Ddc2 checkpoint complex does not appear to play any role in promoting the functioning of the Rad51-dispensable type II recombination, even when functional Rad52 is present.</p></sec><sec><title>RPA might compete with Cdc13 for the occupancy of the telomeric TG<sub>1-3</sub> substrate</title><p><italic>cdc13-1</italic>, a temperature-sensitive mutation in <italic>CDC13</italic>, coding for a single-stranded telomeric DNA-binding protein exhibiting affinity exclusively for TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>), generates large stretches of single-stranded telomeric DNA at semi-permissive and restrictive temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>).

In the <italic>cdc13-1 tlc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rfa1-t11</italic> strain, survivors were generated at the 10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml dilution (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). By Southern analysis, telomeres of the <italic>cdc13-1 tlc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rfa1-t11</italic> strain were of type II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Therefore, presumably, the increase in single-stranded telomeric DNA provoked by the <italic>cdc13</italic>-<italic>1</italic> mutation compensates for the defects conferred by the <italic>mec3</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>rad17</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>rfa1-t11</italic> mutations in type II recombination by providing more TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> substrate normally masked by Cdc13, as previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Interestingly, the <italic>cdc13-1 tlc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rfa1-t11 rad17</italic>&#x00394; survivors displayed type I telomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The most likely explanation is that the <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic> and <italic>rad17</italic>&#x00394; mutation impinge on type II recombination in an additive manner, acting in parallel pathways, such that type I recombination remains the only possible mechanism.</p><p>We next asked whether Mec1 was acting through the RPA pathway or the Mec3-Ddc1-Rad17 pathway.

However, the finding that combining the <italic>mec1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>sml1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>rad17</italic>&#x00394; mutations now results in type II recombination, unlike that of combining the <italic>rad17</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, left panel), strongly suggests that Mec1 functions in the same pathway as the Mec3&#x02013;Ddc1&#x02013;Rad17 complex, or at least in an overlapping pathway, in these processes.</p><p>We attempted to use the same logic to determine in which pathway of telomeric recombination control Clb2 was acting. To this end, various mutant strains combining a <italic>clb2</italic>&#x00394; mutation and the <italic>mec1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>sml1</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic> or <italic>rad17</italic>&#x00394; mutations, all in the <italic>cdc13</italic>-<italic>1 tlc1</italic>&#x00394; background, were constructed. The analysis of the type of telomeric recombination in these mutants, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, indicated that they all generated type II survivors.

To address this point, we set out to isolate <italic>rfa1</italic> mutants that, unlike <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic>, which is deficient in both the checkpoint and recombination functions, would be defective in either one (see Materials and Methods).

In agreement with this observation, these <italic>rfa1</italic> mutants did not exhibit significant hypersensitivity to MMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Interestingly, these mutants were specifically deficient in type I recombination, as they produced 100% type II survivors in the &#x02018;streak assay&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), a situation in which, in most strain backgrounds, including ours, &#x0223c;90% of the survivors are of type I when grown on agar-based medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>).</p><p>DNA sequencing revealed that <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>1</italic> and <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>9</italic> contained multiple point mutations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>).

In the absence of telomerase, telomeres progressively shorten, thus losing their protective proteins, and eventually fuse together and break during chromosome segregation, leading to death by senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Rare cells survive this telomeric senescence by performing recombination between telomeric or subtelomeric sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). In budding yeast, telomeric recombination can be affected by mutations in DNA polymerases, a helicase, an exonuclease, a linker histone, telomere end protection proteins, telomere length control proteins, checkpoint protein kinases, cyclin-dependent kinase, non homologous end joining genes and by mating type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref>). The present data reveal that, upon loss of telomerase function, the DNA damage sensors Mec1, Rad24 and Mec3 can affect telomere recombination in a pathway distinct from that initiating the Mec1-Rad53-Chk1 kinase cascade normally culminating, upon DNA damage, in cell cycle arrest. This study has also provided insights into how the evolutionary conserved DNA repair/replication/checkpoint RPA complex is involved in promoting cell proliferation by controlling telomeric recombination.</p><sec><title>Control of telomeric recombination by DNA damage checkpoint proteins</title><p>Here, we find that a subset of checkpoint proteins, namely Mec1 [also found in a previous study, Ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>)], Mec3-Ddc1-Rad17 and Rad24, are required for optimal operation of type II telomeric recombination. On the other hand, inactivation of, either <italic>RAD9</italic>, <italic>RAD53</italic> or <italic>CHK1</italic> had no impact on telomeric recombination. Inactivation of one of the latter genes totally or partially (Rad53 and Chk1 function in parallel pathways both requiring Rad9) prevents activation of the whole DNA damage response. In particular, the kinase cascade that goes from Mec1 to Rad53 and Chk1 is, of course, interrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). Therefore, the whole checkpoint response is not required for the correct control of telomeric recombination by checkpoint proteins. Mec1 kinase activity, which is absolutely necessary for the functioning of the downstream checkpoint components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>), was indispensable for these events. This observation leaves open the possibility that Mec1 could act in these pathways by phosphorylating a member of the MRX (Mre11&#x02013;Rad50&#x02013;Xrs2) complex or Rad59, as proposed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). In the present situation, the Mec1-dependent DNA damage checkpoint response was shown to branch out early during the process of damage recognition, initiating two separate pathways, one that results in the activation of the kinase cascade and cell cycle arrest, the second one that activates type II recombination. This is not unprecedented as, for instance, <italic>mec1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>tel1</italic>&#x00394; double mutants underwent telomeric senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref>), while single or double mutants of the downstream checkpoint components do not. We propose that Mec1 and Mec3, once loaded onto damaged DNA, affect its conformation. They might, for instance, bend it so as to create conformations compatible with access of proteins subsequently needed for type II recombinational events, such as Mre11, Rad50, Xrs2, Rad59 or other as yet unidentified proteins.</p><p>Recently, <italic>rad24</italic>&#x00394; mutants were shown to exhibit a marked delay in the processing and repair of broken ends at a DNA double-strand break, independently of their defect in G<sub>2</sub>/M arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">70</xref>). The resulting low survival, not observed in <italic>rad9</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>chk1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>pds1</italic>&#x00394; mutants, was also observed in <italic>rad17</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>mec3</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>mec1</italic>&#x00394;, and noticeably, in <italic>rad53</italic>&#x00394; <italic>dun1</italic>&#x00394; mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">70</xref>). On this basis, the mechanisms described here by which Rad24, Mec1 and Mec3, but not Rad53, control telomeric recombination appear to differ from the mechanisms of resection of sequences at a broken end described by Aylon and Kupiec (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">70</xref>). Moreover, in the study by Aylon and Kupiec (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">70</xref>), Rad51-dependent events of recombination were analyzed, whereas in the present study the defects conferred by the <italic>rad24</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>mec3</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>mec1</italic>&#x00394; mutations concerned a pathway of recombination which, in telomerase-negative, otherwise wild-type, cells, is completely Rad51-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">71</xref>). At telomeres, some checkpoint proteins have also been shown to affect the processing of single-stranded DNA that is produced after <italic>cdc13</italic>-<italic>1</italic>-induced telomeric damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72">72</xref>). It has now been established that Mec1, Rad53 and Rad9 inhibit degradation of telomeric DNA by preventing formation of abnormal single-stranded DNA in these cells, while, on the opposite, Mec3, Rad17 and Rad24 promote degradation of telomeric DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b73">73</xref>). In fact, human Rad1 and Rad9 (homologues to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Rad17 and Ddc1) have indeed been shown to possess exonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b74">74</xref>). Therefore, a member of the Mec3 DNA damage sensor complex could potentially be involved in controlling telomeric recombination <italic>via</italic> processing damaged structures specifically used for Rad50-, Rad59-dependent recombination.</p><p>Although Rad9 also accumulates at double-strand breaks in a Mec1-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b75">75</xref>), the <italic>rad9</italic>&#x00394; mutation, unlike the <italic>mec1</italic>&#x00394; mutation, was not found here to affect telomeric recombination. However, it should be noticed that another study found that Rad9 focus formation was only partially affected in <italic>mec1</italic>&#x00394; mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>). In fission yeast, Crb2 (the homologue of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> Rad9) also physically associated with double-strand breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b76">76</xref>). Recruitment of Crb2 could be accomplished in the absence of Rad1 and Rad3, (respectively, Rad17 and Mec1 in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>) but necessitated their presence to remain attached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b76">76</xref>). Therefore, the physical presence of a checkpoint protein at the sites of damaged DNA is not a sufficient criterion to take into account as determining a positive action on type II recombination. The Mec1 and Mec3 DNA damage sensors may therefore be endowed with specific properties that entitle them to affect type II recombination.</p><p>In telomerase-negative, otherwise wild-type, cells, type II recombination takes place on TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> repeats and is operated via the MRX complex, Rad59 and Rad52 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">71</xref>). Type II recombination is interesting on a mechanistic point of view because it does not require the intervention of the Rad51 recombinase, the only protein capable of strand invasion during homologous recombination. Rolling-circle replication primed by an intrachromosomal telomeric D-loop has been proposed as the basis for type II recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b77">77</xref>). The observation made here that <italic>cdc13</italic>-<italic>1</italic> rescues the <italic>rad17</italic>&#x00394;-induced defect in type II recombination demonstrates the possibility of efficient recombination on TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> sequences in the absence of the Mec3 complex. This strongly argues that the unusual predominance of type I survivors in <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>mec3</italic>&#x00394; cells is due to the impairment of the Rad50 pathway in the absence of Mec3 rather than to an impairment of recombination <italic>per se</italic>. Noticeably, type II recombination in <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rad17</italic>&#x00394; was restored after <italic>RAD51</italic> had been deleted, leaving open the possibility that Rad51 might inhibit type II recombination in wild-type cells and that deletion of a member of the Mec3 complex might affect telomeric recombination through changing Rad51 levels. However, control experiments indicated that variations in Rad51 levels, induced by overexpressing <italic>RAD51</italic>, had no effect on telomeric recombination and were, therefore, probably not responsible for the observed defect in type II recombination in these mutants. Since Rad52 is essential for type II recombination, unlike MRX and Rad59, which can substitute for each other in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b78">78</xref>), it has been speculated that Rad52 might perform the annealing activity involved in D-loop formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b78">78</xref>). Clearly, however, Rad52 cannot be the defective target in <italic>mec1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>mec3</italic>&#x00394; mutants, as if this was the case, then these mutants would also be deficient in type I recombination, Rad52 being essential for both types of recombination.</p><p>An important step towards elucidating the processes analyzed here was the observation that <italic>CLB2</italic> overexpression could rescue the type II recombination defect conferred by a mutation in the Mec3 complex. These data establish that the cell cycle machinery can impinge on recombinational repair, thus confirming several recent data, including the initial one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b79">79</xref>) and one on telomeric recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). Since Cdc28-Clb2, homologue to Cdk1-cyclin B, rescued a null mutation in <italic>DDC1</italic>, it is not likely that it stimulated the recombination function of the Mec3&#x02013;Ddc1&#x02013;Rad17 complex by acting upstream of it. However, Cdc28-Clb2 might act by increasing the intensity of the signal contributed by Mec1. Indeed, it should be noted that our data indicate that Mec1 and Mec3 are both required for the control of telomeric recombination and that, consequently, they perform distinct functions in these processes. The possibility of such a scenario is rendered likely by the recent demonstration that ectopic <italic>CLB2</italic> overexpression resulted in direct activation of Tel1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b80">80</xref>). Alternatively, larger amounts of Cdc28-Clb2 than usual might activate a component of the recombinational machinery that is normally put in place by the action of the Mec3 complex, thus bypassing the need for Mec3-induced chromatin modifications. In the same vein, it is possible that Cdc28-Clb2 directly affects Rad51, inhibiting it for instance, rather than acting on the Mec3 complex, either upstream or downstream of it. In this scenario, the Mec3 and Cdc28&#x02013;Clb2 complexes would affect telomeric recombination independently of each other, but modifying the dosage of the other complex could then counterbalance any effect of either one of these complexes on Rad51.</p><p>Our data do not eliminate the possibility that increased dosage of <italic>CLB2</italic> might indirectly act by affecting the position of telomerase-negative cells in the cell cycle, possibly enriching a stage favoring type II recombination. For instance, the Cdk1-cyclin B complex has been shown to influence recombinational repair during the G<sub>2</sub> phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b79">79</xref>). However, it should be noticed that, unlike constitutive <italic>CLB2</italic> overexpression that causes strong mitotic delay or even arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b81">81</xref>), overexpression of <italic>CLB2</italic> under the control of its native promoter has no apparent effect on cell cycle progression (N. Grandin and M. Charbonneau, unpublished data). We did not observe significant changes in endogenous Clb2 levels in the absence of the Mec3&#x02013;Ddc1&#x02013;Rad17 complex. Even if the slight decrease in overproduced Clb2 levels observed in <italic>ddc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; mutants also takes place in cells expressing endogenous levels of Clb2 but remains undectable, it seems unlikely that such a variation could affect telomeric recombination, because it is only in the complete absence of Clb2 that a defect in type II recombination could be observed. Finally, the slight decrease in overproduced Clb2 levels induced by <italic>DDC1</italic> deletion might reflect an effect of the inactivation of the checkpoint on cell cycle position resulting in slight changes in <italic>CLB2</italic> expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Control of telomeric recombination by RPA</title><p>To our knowledge, the role of RPA in mediating telomeric recombination had not been previously studied and the present work therefore provides a platform for further studies. We chose to analyze RPA functions during telomeric recombination using the <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic> mutant allele (encoding Rfa1-K45E) because it has been well documented in other contexts, not only in DNA repair but also in checkpoint pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>). Several conclusions can be made based on the new phenotypes of <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic> cells observed in the present study. <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic> resulted in impairment of both type I and type II recombination. Importantly, however, type I recombination in <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic> mutants (only possible at decreased dilutions during passages) atypically relied on Rad59, thus stressing the plasticity of these recombinational pathways. This also confirms that <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic> confers complete impairment of the Rad51 machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>). The Rfa1&#x02013;t11&#x02013;Ddc2 fusion protein partially restored the checkpoint but did not facilitate the generation of type II recombination. The recombination defect caused by <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic> was more severe than that caused by the absence of a DNA damage sensor. The Rfa1&#x02013;t11&#x02013;Rad52 fusion protein restored normal, Rad51-dependent, type I recombination in <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic> cells, but not type II recombination. The <italic>cdc13</italic>-<italic>1</italic> mutation rescued the defects in type II recombination conferred by <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic>.

Moreover, based on genetic arguments illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, Rad17 and Mec1 appear to function in the same pathway of telomeric recombination control or, at least, in overlapping pathways, while Cdc28-Clb2 might function in a pathway that overlaps with both the Mec1, Mec3 and RPA pathways.</p><p>Although expression of fusion (hybrid) proteins may produce anomalous results under certain circumstances, it should be stressed that it has been previously used with success in studies on telomeric processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>). Noticeably, one of the telomeric proteins of the protein fusion pairs used in these previous studies was Cdc13, which, like Rfa1 used here, is a single-strand DNA-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>). In the present study, overexpression of <italic>RAD52</italic> gave similar results, thus comforting the experiments using the <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic>-<italic>RAD52</italic> and <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic>-<italic>DDC2</italic> chimeric genes.</p><p>The production of abnormally high levels of single-stranded DNA at telomeres in <italic>cdc13</italic>-<italic>1</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>) was presumably the cause for the rescue of type II recombination in <italic>mec3</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>rad17</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). It is possible that increased single-stranded DNA allows more RPA to be recruited at damaged telomeres, thereby counterbalancing the defect caused by the <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic> mutation. Increased efficiency of type II recombination in the <italic>cdc13</italic>-<italic>1</italic> mutant background has been previous observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). We propose two possibilities to explain the rescue of type II recombination by <italic>cdc13</italic>-<italic>1</italic> in <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic> cells. In the first scenario, Rfa1-t11 would not bind enough TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> sequences, which would result in a failure to recruit the Mre11&#x02013;Rad50&#x02013;Xrs2 complex, needed for type II recombination. This would be a specific characteristic of Rfa1-t11 towards this type of DNA because Rfa1-t11 normally binds other types of single-stranded DNA, <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b82">82</xref>). In the second scenario, Rfa1-t11 would normally bind the telomeric TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> DNA but would be defective in binding Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2. In both situations, increasing the amount of single-stranded TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> DNA via expression of the <italic>cdc13</italic>-<italic>1</italic> mutation would correct either defect by increasing the amount of Rfa1-t11, which although defective, would eventually become functional due to the increase in its amounts. Somehow unexpectedly, type II survivors were no longer generated when the control of recombination became too defective, due to the simultaneous mutations in Rfa1 and Rad17 in <italic>cdc13</italic>-<italic>1 rad17</italic>&#x00394; cells and type I survivors were generated instead. This observation that there is at least one possible condition that allows the generation of type I survivors in a <italic>cdc13</italic>-<italic>1</italic> background again underlines the remarkable plasticity of these recombinational pathways.</p><p>The failure of the only one documented checkpoint-deficient mutant protein, Rfa1-t11, to recruit Mec1-Ddc2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>) also confers an intrinsic recombination defect, due to the fact that Mec1 affects type II recombination [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>); present data]. The present finding that expression of an Rfa1-t11-Ddc2 hybrid protein partially re-established checkpoint signaling in <italic>cdc13</italic>-<italic>1 rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic> cells without concomitant rescue of recombination, in <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic>, suggested that RPA-t11's defect in type II recombination not only stems from its defect in recruiting Ddc2, but is also due to a defect in a distinct pathway. Interestingly, the experiments in which cells overproduced <italic>RAD52</italic> in addition to the Rfa1&#x02013;t11&#x02013;Ddc2 fusion suggest that this latter pathway necessitates something else than Rad52 competent in Rad51-mediated events of recombination. The putative formation of D-loops by Rad52, presumably required for Rad50-, Rad59-mediated type II recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>), might not involve as tight and direct interactions between RPA, Rad52 and MRX as those between RPA, Rad51 and Rad52 during strand invasion. The present data do not preclude the likely possibility that the function of Mec1 in controlling telomeric recombination necessitates its recruitment by RPA. Our data may also suggest that the defect of the DNA damage sensors mutants <italic>mec3</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>rad17</italic>&#x00394; in generating type II recombination is not due to the absence in these cells of RPA&#x02013;Ddc2 interactions. Finally, the present study also provides <italic>rfa1</italic> alleles that are deficient in telomere recombination but proficient in checkpoint function and that may be useful in some biochemical or genetic assays. These alleles, <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>1</italic>, <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>9</italic>, <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>10</italic> and <italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>11</italic>, may confer a specific defect in type I recombination. Alternatively, they may confer a defect in the processing of damaged DNA, so as to alter the nature of the substrate used for telomeric recombination. In this latter hypothesis, these <italic>rfa1</italic> mutants would behave like <italic>cdc13</italic>-<italic>1</italic> or <italic>yku70</italic>&#x00394; mutants, which, presumably because they accumulate abnormal levels of telomeric single-stranded DNA, also abnormally generate exclusively type II survivors during growth on semi-solid medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). Recombinational telomere elongation, which at the moment is best understood in yeast, appears to be involved in a subset of human cancers and its study in yeast is therefore important for biomedical research.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Richard Kolodner, Andrew Emili, Errol Friedberg, Akira Matsuura, Leland Hartwell, Steve Reed, Dan Gottschling, Giovanna Lucchini, Jim Haber and Lorraine Symington for the gifts of strains and plasmids.

Genomic DNAs from wild-type cells (no recombination, lane 1), type II (lane 2) and type I (lane 3) senescing <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; cells were digested with XhoI and the Southern blot revealed with a TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub><sup>32</sup>P-labeled probe. In both types of survivors, the disappearance of the non-Y&#x02032; fragments (migrating at &#x0223c;2.1, 2.3, 3.3 and 3.9 kb) attests to the occurrence of homologous recombination. In type II survivors, XhoI cutting reveals amplification of very long and heterogeneous TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> sequences (lane 2), located more distal than the single XhoI site that is present at the distal part of Y&#x02032; sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). In contrast, in type I survivors telomere erosion is evident after XhoI cutting (lane 3) in comparison with the mean size of the terminal telomere tracts in wild type corresponding to the broad band at &#x0223c;1.2 kb (lane 1), the amplified Y&#x02032; sequences being located more proximal than the XhoI site, as schematically represented. (<bold>B</bold>) Mec3 inhibits the generation of type II survivors in liquid assays. Individual spores from <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>mec3</italic>&#x00394; strains were grown in liquid YEPD for &#x0223c;130 generations, at 29&#x000b0;C, with a daily dilution of 10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml (see Materials and Methods). The conversion from types I to types II that is readily seen in liquid culture of telomerase-negative, otherwise wild-type, cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>) was largely inhibited in the absence of Mec3. Thus, the samples shown in lanes 12 and 13 were the only two ones, among the 15 ones shown here, to exhibit many XhoI fragments of different sizes, which entitle them as type II survivors, those amplifying the TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> tracts. <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>MEC3</italic><sup>+</sup> cells generated 100% type II survivors (data not shown), like shown for wild-type cells in (A) above.

(<bold>A</bold>) Telomerase-negative cells (tlc1) bearing a null mutation in either <italic>CLB2</italic> (clb2) or <italic>DDC1</italic> (ddc1), as indicated, and also overexpressing or not <italic>CLB2</italic> (2 &#x003bc; plasmid, under endogenous promoter) were propagated in liquid cultures for &#x0223c;130 generations, from the time the strains were created, at 29&#x000b0;C. As usual, this procedure resulted in the generation of 100% type II survivors in telomerase-negative cells (tlc1) due to the growth advantage of types II over types I in liquid cultures (survivor type has been labeled below each lane). <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>clb2</italic>&#x00394; mutants were defective in generating type II survivors, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>), as were <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>ddc1</italic>&#x00394; mutants.

Cells were grown in liquid cultures for about 200 generations, at 29&#x000b0;C, after the senescence crisis and processed for Southern blot analysis using either a telomeric TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> (leftmost panel) or Y&#x02032; probe (rightmost panel) following DNA digestion with XhoI in both cases. In leftmost panel, non-recombining DNA fragments, that appear to be non-Y&#x02032; fragments have been labeled with a black dot on the leftmost panel. These bands were not detected when the blot was re-probed with a probe detecting Y&#x02032; sequences (rightmost panel). Middle panel: Genomic DNAs from the same cells as those shown above in the left two panels were digested with a mixture of restriction enzymes (AluI, HaeIII, HinfI and MspI) using a 4 bp recognition sequence and the Southern revealed with a TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> probe. This allowed to discriminate between type I and type II recombination because these enzymes do not cut within TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). The slow migrating bands (labeled with the black dots in the leftmost panel) were no longer visible on the four base cutter blot, indicating that these bands are not the result of some limited type II recombination. DNAs from type II (lane 1) or type I (lane 11) survivors from a <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394; strain are shown for comparison.

Both YCp-<italic>rfa1</italic>-<italic>t11</italic>-<italic>RAD52</italic> and YEp-<italic>RAD52</italic> (but not YCp-<italic>RAD52</italic>) restored telomeric recombination, which, in both cases, was of type I (data not shown).
