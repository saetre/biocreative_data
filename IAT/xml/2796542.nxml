Tumor antigens that are differentially expressed during this transition are likely to play important roles in imparting prostate cancer cells with the ability to grow in a hormone-deprived environment and to metastasize to distal sites such as the bone and thus, are likely targets for therapeutic intervention. To identify those molecules and particularly cell surface antigens that accompany this transition, we studied the changes in cell surface antigenic profiles between a hormone-sensitive prostate cancer line LNCaP and its hormone-refractory derivative C4-2B, using an antibody library-based affinity proteomic approach. We selected a na&#x000ef;ve phage antibody display library to identify human single-chain antibodies that bind specifically to C4-2B but not LNCaP. Using mass spectrometry, we identified one of the antibody-targeted antigens as the ICAM-1/CD54/human rhinovirus receptor. Recombinant IgG1 derived from this single-chain antibody binds to a neutralizing epitope of ICAM-1 and blocks C4-2B cell invasion through extracellular matrix in vitro. ICAM-1 is thus differentially expressed during the transition of the hormone-sensitive prostate cancer cell line LNCaP to its hormone-refractory derivative C4-2B, plays an important role in imparting the C4-2B line with the ability to invade, and may therefore be a target for therapeutic intervention.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer</kwd><kwd>Mass spectrometry</kwd><kwd>LNCaP</kwd><kwd>C4-2B</kwd><kwd>ICAM-1/CD54/rhinovirus receptor</kwd><kwd>Human single-chain antibodies</kwd><kwd>Neutralizing human IgG</kwd></kwd-group><contract-num rid="CA1">R01 CA118919-04 ||CA</contract-num><contract-num rid="CA1">R01 CA118919-03 ||CA</contract-num><contract-num rid="CA1">R01 CA118919-02 ||CA</contract-num><contract-num rid="CA1">R01 CA118919-01 ||CA</contract-num><contract-sponsor id="CA1">National Cancer Institute : NCI</contract-sponsor></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">A major challenge of prostate cancer treatment is the transition from a hormone-sensitive localized form of the disease to a hormone-refractory metastatic tumor.

We hypothesized that those differentially expressed cell surface antigens may impart prostate cancer cells with the ability to thrive in a hormone-deprived environment and to colonize at distal organ sites such as the bone and may thus be targets for therapeutic intervention. As a model system for the transition, we studied the hormone-sensitive prostate cancer line LNCaP that does not metastasize to the bone and its hormone-refractory derivative C4-2B that metastasizes to the bone. The C4-2B line was derived from LNCaP following serial passages in vivo and selective recovery of cells from the bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>] and has been widely used to study hormone-sensitivity/refractory status and bone tropism of prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>].</p><p id="P4">We have previously developed and utilized a na&#x000ef;ve phage antibody display library to identify internalizing human single-chain antibodies targeting several solid human tumors including prostate tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>].

Using mass spectrometric analysis, we identified ICAM-1/CD54/human rhinovirus receptor precursor as the target antigen of one of our C4-2B-targeting scFvs. We have further demonstrated that this antibody binds to a neutralizing epitope of ICAM-1 and that a human IgG1 derived from this scFv effectively blocks prostate cancer invasions in vitro through extracellular matrix components.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Reagents</title><p id="P5">For scFv and IgG purification and characterization: CHO-S-SFM II media and G418 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 1 L spinner flask (Corning, Corning, NY, USA), Cellgro&#x02122; Stirrers (Barnstead, Dubuque, IA, USA), HisTrap&#x02122;HP, HiTrap protein A HP and HiTrap desalting columns (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA).

This model system has been widely used by investigators to study prostate cancer development, affording an opportunity to identify meaningful cell surface changes accompanying prostate tumor progression. We have identified 32 unique human scFvs that bind selectively to C4-2B but not LNCaP cells. We have found that one of the C4-2B-targeting scFvs is identical in sequence to a previously identified scFv, M10A12. We used a full-length human IgG1 developed from the M10A12 scFv to immunoprecipitate tumor antigens from prostate cancer cell lysates and used mass spectrometric analysis to identify the target antigen as ICAM-1, also known as CD54 or human rhinovirus receptor. Furthermore, through a competition study with a known neutralizing murine mAb targeting human ICAM-1, we found that the M10A12 IgG1 binds to the same neutralizing epitope and inhibits invasion of the C4-2B cells through extracellular matrix. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that ICAM-1 is differentially expressed during the transition from the parental LNCaP cells to hormone refractory bone-metastasizing C4-2B cells and may play important roles in mediating prostate cancer invasion and metastasis.</p><p id="P17">Human ICAM gene family members have been implicated in prostate development and progression by genetic studies. A large genome-wide association study identified a loci on chromosome 19 that is associated with predisposition to breast and prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. By high-density single nucleotide polymorphism mapping, the extent of association was found to span 20 kb and include the ICAM-1 gene and two other genes in the ICAM family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. A genome-wide characterization of gene expression variations and DNA copy number changes in prostate cancer cell lines also found that ICAM-1 is associated with an enhanced malignant potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. Despite this genetic evidence and gene expression studies, exactly how ICAM-1 mediates prostate cancer progression remains undetermined. Our study suggests that ICAM-1 mediates invasive behavior of prostate cancer cells, and thus is likely to play an important role in tumor metastasis to distal sites.</p><p id="P18">We have developed a full-length human neutralizing mAb (M10A12 IgG1) that blocks C4-2B invasion through extracellular matrix components, making this antibody a potential candidate for therapeutic development. However, further studies are needed to evaluate if this neutralizing anti-ICAM-1 human IgG1 can block prostate cancer cell metastasis in vivo.</p><p id="P19">While we have demonstrated that ICAM-1 is differentially expressed by C4-2B cells and plays a key role in mediating invasion through extracellular matrix by these cells, we have not directly studied if ICAM-1 expression is sufficient to allow the hormone sensitive LNCaP cells to achieve hormone independence and metastasize to the bone. It also remains to be determined if ICAM-1 expression is necessary for C4-2B cells to maintain hormone independence and propensity to localize to the bone. Further studies with appropriate prostate cancer animal models are needed to address these issues.</p><p id="P20">ICAM-1 is also known as the receptor for human rhinovirus, a causative agent for the common cold. In addition, ICAM-1 is a part of the receptor complex for other Picornavirus family members such as the Coxsackievirus A21. Recently, researchers have exploited ICAM-1 expression on prostate cancer cell lines to achieve efficient infection by oncolytic viruses and observed potent tumor cell killing in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. It would be interesting to see if oncolytic viruses can be developed into therapeutic agents to effectively kill in vivo metastatic hormone-refractory prostate tumors that express ICAM-1.</p><p id="P21">To summarize, our antibody library-based approach is effective in identifying antibodies targeting cell surface molecules that are functionally important for prostate cancer progression. These tumor-targeting scFvs and their derivatives such as IgGs are human in sequence, providing a direct route to the clinic. ICAM-1 has been identified as a cell surface antigen that is differentially expressed in the hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer cell line C4-2B, and a fully human neutralizing IgG1 blocks C4-2B invasion through extracellular matrix. In addition to ICAM-1, other antigens defined by this panel of scFvs remain to be identified. Using mass spectrometric analysis described in this report and other novel expression cloning strategies described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>], we are identifying additional antigens that play important roles in mediating various functions in advanced prostate tumors including hormone-independence and the propensity to metastasize to the bone and other distal sites.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S16"><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>The work is supported in part by grants from the National Institute of Health (R01 CA118919, P50 CA89520, P41 RR01614, and RR012961).
