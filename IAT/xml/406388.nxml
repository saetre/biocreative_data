Failure to block S-phase entry in response to damaged DNA or to repair the DNA leads to genomic instability, the hallmark of cancer cells. DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are particularly harmful to cells; if unrepaired, DSBs generate aneuploidy and chromosomal translocations. DSBs activate a network of signaling pathways that coordinate the sensing and repair of the damage with cell cycle arrest. The major signaling pathway triggered by DSBs involves ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) protein kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-Zhou1">Zhou and Elledge 2000</xref>). ATM is a serine-threonine kinase related to the PI3 kinase family. DSBs activate ATM by promoting its autophosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-Bakkenist1">Bakkenist and Kastan 2003</xref>). Activated ATM phosphorylates protein substrates involved in DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis.</p><p>Phosphorylation of Nbs1 by ATM is critical for S-phase checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-Gatei1">Gatei et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-Lim1">Lim et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-Zhao1">Zhao et al. 2000</xref>). Nbs1 forms a trimeric complex with Mre11 and Rad50 (MRN) that is needed for DSB repair by homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-Haber1">Haber 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-DAmours1">D'Amours and Jackson 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-Symington1">Symington 2003</xref>). The three proteins are also essential for vertebrate embryonic development and cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-Luo1">Luo et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-Yamaguchi-Iwai1">Yamaguchi-Iwai et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-Zhu1">Zhu et al. 2001</xref>).

A-T is characterized by cerebellar degeneration, immunodeficiency, radiation sensitivity, chromosomal instability, and cancer predisposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-Gatti1">Gatti et al. 2001</xref>).</p><p>Hypomorphic mutations in <italic>Mre11</italic> and <italic>Nbs1</italic> give rise, respectively, to an A-T-like disease (ATLD) and Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-Digweed1">Digweed et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-Stewart1">Stewart et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-Tauchi1">Tauchi et al. 2002</xref>). The clinical presentations of A-T and ATLD are indistinguishable. NBS patients display the symptoms of A-T and ATLD and, in addition, microcephaly and mental deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-Tauchi1">Tauchi et al. 2002</xref>). All three diseases have similar cellular phenotypes. The mutant cells do not respond appropriately to DSBs and display chromosome abnormalities, hypersensitivity to ionizing radiations, radio-resistant DNA synthesis, and an S-phase checkpoint defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-Shiloh1">Shiloh and Kastan 2001</xref>). These similarities strongly suggest that ATM and MRN function in a common signaling pathway. However, the molecular connection between these proteins is yet to be determined.</p><p>Mre11 binds DNA and is both a 3&#x02032;-to-5&#x02032; exonuclease and an endonuclease that cleaves hairpin DNA structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-Paull2">Paull and Gellert 1999</xref>). Rad50 belongs to the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) family of proteins. Rad50 contains C-terminal and N-terminal Walker A and B domains separated by a long coiled-coil domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-de1">de Jager et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-Hopfner1">Hopfner et al. 2002</xref>). Intramolecular assembly of the coiled-coil domain brings the Walker A and B motifs together to generate a functional nucleotide-binding module. A zinc-binding motif (CXXC), or &#x0201c;zinc hook,&#x0201d; located at the base of the Rad50 coiled coil, mediates Rad50 dimerization through coordination of a zinc ion by four cysteine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-Hopfner1">Hopfner et al. 2002</xref>).</p><p>Rad50 dimer binds to two Mre11 molecules to form a stable tetrameric complex with enhanced nuclease activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-Trujillo1">Trujillo and Sung 2001</xref>). hRad50/hMre11 complexes tether linear duplex DNA molecules as demonstrated by scanning force microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-de1">de Jager et al. 2001</xref>). Based on these observations, a model has been proposed in which the Mre11/Rad50 complex bridges broken DNA ends or sister chromatids (van den Bosch 2003).</p><p>In yeast and mammalian cells, DSBs provoke the formation of defined nuclear structures called irradiation-induced foci (IRIF). IRIF are believed to originate by chromatin modification, such as H2AX phosphorylation, at the site of the DSB, followed by the recruitment of signaling and repair factors. MRN localizes to DSBs, independently of H2AX phosphorylation, and is critical for the formation of IRIF and the consequent response to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-Petrini2">Petrini and Stracker 2003</xref>). Thus, cells with mutations in <italic>Mre11</italic> or <italic>Nbs1</italic> form IRIF inefficiently. In ATLD cells, which carry a defective <italic>Mre11</italic>, ATM activation is inhibited. Furthermore, ATM fails to localize to sites of DSBs in cells lacking functional MRN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-Uziel1">Uziel et al. 2003</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that MRN plays an early and essential role in assembly of functional signaling complexes at the sites of DNA damage. Furthermore, they place MRN upstream of ATM in the DNA damage signaling pathway.</p><p>Cell-free extracts derived from <italic>Xenopus</italic> eggs recapitulate signaling pathways triggered by DNA damage and have been instrumental in unraveling the functions of <italic>ATM</italic> and <italic>Mre11</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-Costanzo1">Costanzo et al. 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-Costanzo2">2001</xref>). Using this system, we show below that fragmented DNA assembles with proteins into macromolecular structures enriched in activated ATM and MRN. Their assembly requires MRN but not ATM. A truncated form of <italic>Mre11</italic> associated with ATLD does not support DNA&#x02013;protein complex assembly or DSB-induced activation of ATM. This work provides a direct molecular connection between ATM and MRN that can explain the similarities between A-T and ATLD.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>A Rapid Assay for the Response to DNA DSBs</title><p>Addition of fragmented DNA to <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts triggers the ATM-signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-Costanzo1">Costanzo et al. 2000</xref>). We previously demonstrated this reaction by measuring an ATM-dependent block to DNA replication in extracts treated with DNA fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-Costanzo1">Costanzo et al. 2000</xref>). We now describe a rapid assay to monitor the activation of DSB-responsive protein kinases and to assess the contribution of ATM and related protein kinases. Histone H2AX, a well-characterized substrate for DSB-activated protein kinases, is phosphorylated in vivo at serine 139 by ATM and the ataxia-telangiectasia-related protein (ATR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-Rogakou1">Rogakou et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-Burma1">Burma et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-Costanzo2">Costanzo et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-Ward1">Ward and Chen 2001</xref>). We used the C-terminal peptide of mouse H2AX (PAVGKKA<bold>S<sub>134</sub></bold>QA<bold>S<sub>139</sub></bold>QEY) as a reporter substrate to monitor the response to DSBs. This peptide contains two putative SQ phosphorylation sites for ATM or ATR: serines 134 and 139. To test the specificity of the kinase(s) activated by DSBs, we synthesized four peptides: wild-type and alanine substitutions at serine 134 (S134A), serine 139 (S139A), and serines 134 and 139 (S134A/S139A).</p><p>Incubation of interphase extracts for 30 min with fragmented DNA dramatically enhanced phosphorylation of H2AX peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020110-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Phosphorylated H2AX peptide could be detected as early as 5 min after addition of fragmented DNA (data not shown). S134A peptide was phosphorylated to a level equivalent to wild-type peptide, whereas S139A and S134/139A peptides were not modified. Thus, phosphorylation of S139 in cell-free extracts in response to DSBs mimics the in vivo situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-Rogakou1">Rogakou et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-Burma1">Burma et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-Costanzo2">Costanzo et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-Ward1">Ward and Chen 2001</xref>).</p><p>We next monitored phosphorylation of H2AX peptide in extracts in which specific DNA damage response signaling pathways were inhibited. X-ATM- and X-ATR-neutralizing antibodies were used to abrogate ATM- and ATR-dependent signaling, respectively.

H2AX peptide phosphorylation was significantly reduced in extracts treated with either X-ATM or X-ATR antibodies. Inhibition of both ATR and ATM further decreased H2AX peptide phosphorylation to 20&#x00025; of control levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020110-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, column 4). Inhibition of DNA-PK by depletion of Ku70 did not further reduce H2AX peptide phosphorylation in the ATM/ATR-inhibited extract. Finally, caffeine completely abrogated H2AX peptide phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020110-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, column 6).

We asked whether MRN was required in our system for DSB-dependent activation of H2AX peptide phosphorylation. We have previously established that Mre11 can be quantitatively depleted from extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-Costanzo2">Costanzo et al. 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020110-g001">Figure 1</xref>C shows that depletion of extracts for Mre11 abrogated the response to DSB-containing DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020110-g001">Figure 1</xref>C, open squares).

To investigate interactions between Mre11 and damaged DNA, interphase extract was incubated with <sup>32</sup>P-labeled, 1 kb linear double-strand DNA molecules and applied to a BioGel A15m column. This large-pore gel filtration resin includes most proteins and small DNA fragments, but excludes protein&#x02013;DNA complexes larger than 1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> kDa (Yuzakhov et al. 1999).

Control extracts or extracts incubated with fragmented DNA were chromatographed, and fractions 9&#x02013;12 from the excluded volume and fractions 25&#x02013;28 from the included volume were PEG-precipitated and processed for Western blotting.

Relative to the total protein content of the fractions, both Mre11 and ATM were enriched 18-fold and 46-fold respectively in the excluded fraction, as determined by image analysis. This confirms that the high molecular weight protein&#x02013;DNA complexes contain Mre11, and additionally establishes the presence of ATM in the complex. Strikingly, Mre11 in the DNA&#x02013;protein complex was in the active, phosphorylated form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-Costanzo2">Costanzo et al. 2001</xref>).

ATM and ATR protein kinase activities were inhibited with the specific neutralizing antibodies described above. DNA-PK activity was inhibited by vanillin, a specific inhibitor of DNA-PK (Durant and Karran 2003). Most H2AX kinase activity in fraction 10 was due to ATM, and to a lesser extent, to ATR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020110-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). Vanillin had little effect on kinase activity, indicating that the contribution of DNA-PK was small in this fraction.

We previously determined that depletion of Mre11 and its associated protein partners lead to DSB formation during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-Costanzo2">Costanzo et al. 2001</xref>). We used a similar strategy to relate MRN inactivation and ATM function.</p><p>We provide several lines of evidence that indicate an MRN requirement for ATM activation.

We show that depletion of Mre11 from our extracts abolishes DSB-dependent phosphorylation of H2AX peptide, a readout for this cascade. ATM is the major contributor to H2AX phosphorylation in these extracts. Our data strongly suggest that MRN specifically activates ATM. Fragmented DNA incubated in extracts forms high molecular weight DNA&#x02013;protein complexes that include MRN and ATM. Of H2AX kinase activity in the complex in fraction 10, 75&#x00025; is inhibited by antibodies to ATM. Furthermore, addition of recombinant MRN to extracts increases the yield of complex and associated H2AX kinase activity. The enhanced activity is entirely ATM-dependent.</p><p>ATR also contributes significantly to H2AX phosphorylation in extracts treated with DSB-containing DNA. However, ATM is activated earlier than ATR (data not shown). ATR activation might be triggered by processing of DSBs into single-strand DNA (ssDNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-Zou1">Zou and Elledge 2003</xref>)<bold>.</bold> We previously showed that ssDNA specifically stimulates ATR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-Costanzo3">Costanzo et al. 2003</xref>). Since Mre11 depletion completely prevents H2AX phosphorylation, we propose that Mre11 regulates both ATM-dependent early signaling from DSBs and, possibly by its DNA exonucleolytic activity, delayed signaling by ATR. Whereas caffeine completely inhibits H2AX kinase, treatment with ATM/ATR antibodies combined inhibits only 80&#x00025; of H2AX kinase. This could be accounted by an additional kinase such as ATX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-Abraham1">Abraham 2001</xref>).

We have isolated DNA&#x02013;protein complexes from extracts incubated with fragmented DNA as an excluded fraction from a sizing column. The complexes require Mre11 for assembly, contain linear DNA, and are highly enriched in Mre11 and ATM. Immunoprecipitation studies with Mre11 antibodies show the presence of tripartite complexes (Mre11&#x02013;ATM&#x02013;fragmented DNA) in the excluded but not the void volume (data not shown).</p><p>We believe that the formation of these complexes is a critical step in the kinase cascade that leads to the G1&#x02013;S checkpoint. Several lines of evidence support this idea: (1) Mre11-depleted extracts do not form complexes and fail to activate ATM in response to DSBs. (2) Mre11 is concentrated 18-fold in the DNA&#x02013;protein complexes and is heavily phosphorylated. We previously established that phosphorylation of Mre11 correlates with increased nuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-Costanzo2">Costanzo et al. 2001</xref>).

This activity is principally accounted for by DNA-PK.</p><p>Both MRN components Mre11 and Nbs1 are phosphorylated in response to DSBs.

Once recruited and activated within the signaling complex, ATM might phosphorylate Nbs1 and Mre11, stabilizing the complex and enhancing signaling activity. How might DNA&#x02013;MRN complexes initiate the cascade of events leading to ATM activation? One of the critical steps could be to bring ATM in close proximity with &#x0201c;chromatinized&#x0201d; DNA fragments. Indeed, it was shown previously that ATM had affinity for DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-Andegeko1">Andegeko et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020110-Uziel1">Uziel et al 2003</xref>).

We also determined that H2AX phosphorylation at 100 ng/&#x003bc;l of linear DNA is partially Mre11-independent (data not shown).

Thus, the mutation cannot abrogate the essential role of Mre11, although the mutant Mre11 is defective in the damaged DNA response. We were able to dissociate the two Mre11 reactions using simple biochemical readouts. MRN-ATLD1/2 cannot activate ATM or form DNA&#x02013;protein complexes in response to DSBs. It can, however, prevent accumulation of DSBs during chromosomal DNA replication. We speculate that MRN-ATLD1/2 has reduced affinity for damaged DNA, resulting in labile interactions with fragmented DNA and an inability to activate ATM.</p><p>What differentiates the essential function of Mre11 during DNA replication from its ability to activate ATM? We suggest that MRN association with chromatin during DNA replication and, possibly, during meiotic recombination differs from its association with fragmented DNA.
