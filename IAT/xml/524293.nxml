Our data showed that the presence of 2&#x02032; modifications at these positions affected cleavage site recognition, ground state binding of substrate and&#x0002f;or rate of cleavage. Cleavage of 2&#x02032; amino substituted substrates at different pH showed that substitution of Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> by Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (or Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>), identity of residues at and near the cleavage site, and addition of C5 protein influenced the frequency of miscleavage at &#x02212;1 (cleavage at the correct site is referred to as &#x0002b;1). From this we infer that these findings point at effects mediated by protonation&#x0002f;deprotonation of the 2&#x02032; amino group, i.e. an altered charge distribution, at the site of cleavage. Moreover, our data suggested that the structural architecture of the interaction between the 3&#x02032; end of the substrate and RNase P RNA influence the charge distribution at the cleavage site as well as the rate of cleavage under conditions where the chemistry is suggested to be rate limiting. Thus, these data provide evidence for cross talk between the &#x0002b;73&#x0002f;294 interaction and the cleavage site in RNase P RNA mediated cleavage. We discuss the role metal ions might play in this cross talk and the likelihood that at least one functionally important metal ion is positioned in the vicinity of, and use the 2&#x02032;OH at the cleavage site as an inner or outer sphere ligand.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Catalytic RNAs or ribozymes catalyze a large number of different reactions including cleavage of other RNA molecules, RNA polymerization and peptide bond formation. Ribozymes can be divided into classes based on size and reaction products. Large ribozymes such as RNase P RNA, Group I and Group II introns catalyze reactions that generate 3&#x02032; hydroxyls and 5&#x02032; phosphates as cleavage products. The hairpin, hammerhead and hepatitis delta virus RNA are referred to as small ribozymes and yield 2&#x02032;, 3&#x02032;-cyclic phosphates and 5&#x02032; hydroxyls upon cleavage of other RNA molecules [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c1">1</xref>) and references therein].</p><p>RNase P RNA is a naturally occurring <italic>trans</italic>-acting ribozyme and is the catalytic subunit of RNase P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c2">2</xref>), an endoribonuclease responsible for generating the 5&#x02032; end of mature tRNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c3">3</xref>). In bacteria, RNase P consists of two subunits, RNase P RNA and the C5 protein, in a 1:1 ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c5">5</xref>). The protein moiety of RNase P is essential for activity <italic>in vivo</italic> whereas <italic>in vitro</italic>, RNase P RNA cleaves various substrates correctly and efficiently in the absence of C5 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c2">2</xref>). As with other large ribozymes, RNase P RNA requires the presence of divalent metal ions for activity. Considering both correctness&#x0002f;accuracy and efficiency of cleavage, Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> is the preferred divalent metal ion [e.g. see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c6">6</xref>) and references therein]. The roles of Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> in RNase P RNA mediated cleavage are to promote correct folding, facilitate substrate binding and participate in the chemistry of cleavage [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c8">8</xref>) and references therein].</p><p>To understand RNA catalysis in general, an important task is to identify Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ions that have specific functions and&#x0002f;or metal-ion-binding sites that are unique for a specific functional trait. Phosphorothioate modifications of the non-bridging oxygens at the RNase P cleavage site and analysis of the resulting substrates in the presence of hard (Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>) and soft (Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and Cd<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>) metal ions suggest that Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> coordinates to the <italic>R</italic>p-oxygen via inner sphere interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c11">11</xref>). Substitution of the 2&#x02032;OH at the cleavage site (at &#x02212;1) results in significant reduction in the rate of cleavage under single turnover conditions, and available data have been interpreted to indicate that the absence of the 2&#x02032; hydroxyl influences metal ion binding in the vicinity of the cleavage site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c16">16</xref>). Recently we suggested that Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> is positioned in the vicinity of and stabilizes the &#x02018;73&#x0002f;294-interaction&#x02019;, where the &#x02018;73&#x0002f;294-interaction&#x02019; is part of the &#x02018;<underline>RCC</underline>A-RNase P RNA interaction&#x02019; [interacting residues underlined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c17">17</xref>)]. We argued that this Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> cross talk with the Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ion(s) involved in generating the nucleophile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c19">19</xref>). To investigate the role of divalent metal ions in RNase P RNA mediated cleavage we decided to revisit the importance of the 2&#x02032;OH at the &#x02212;1 position and study cleavage of various model substrates carrying 2&#x02032; amino modifications at &#x02212;1. The idea was to use the metal ion switch approach that has successfully been used to reveal functionally important metal ions in the Group I ribozyme system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c23">23</xref>). This approach is based on the observation that the 2&#x02032; amino group is a better ligand for Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> compared to Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. Thus, monitoring changes in RNase P RNA cleavage site recognition, substrate binding and&#x0002f;or activity due to the presence of a 2&#x02032; amino group at &#x02212;1 in the substrate in combination with metal ion substitution is therefore a rational approach to study the role of the 2&#x02032;OH for metal ion binding in cleavage promoted by RNase P RNA. We will refer to the 2&#x02032; amino group as 2&#x02032;N throughout this study.</p><p>Here we have used this approach and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RNase P RNA (M1 RNA) to investigate the role of the 2&#x02032;OH at the cleavage site. Based on our findings we suggest that the 2&#x02032;OH is involved in coordination (inner or outer sphere) of a functionally important metal ion. In addition, we used the 2&#x02032;N at the cleavage site as a probe to monitor the possibility of cross talk in RNase P RNA mediated cleavage. Here, our data suggested that the structural architecture of the &#x0002b;73&#x0002f;294 interaction influences the charge distribution at the cleavage site (i.e. ionization state of the 2&#x02032;N when present at the cleavage site) as well as the rate of cleavage under conditions where the chemistry is suggested to be rate limiting. These findings provide evidence for cross talk between the &#x0002b;73&#x0002f;294 interaction and the cleavage site in the reaction catalyzed by RNase P RNA. These data will be discussed in the perspective of the role metal ions in cleavage of RNA by RNase P RNA and for RNA based activities in general.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Preparation of substrates and M1 RNA</title><p>The various pATSer derivatives were purchased from Dharmacon, USA, purified, labeled at the 5&#x02032; end and gel purified according to standard procedures as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c24">24</xref>).

These modified substrates are derivatives of the model substrate pATSer, which is a well-characterized RNase P substrate that is not rate-limited by product release [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c30">30</xref>); data not shown]. The residue preceding the 3&#x02032; CCA-motif in the model substrates corresponds to position &#x0002b;73 in tRNA precursors and will therefore be referred to as position &#x0002b;73. As a model system, we used M1 RNA in the absence of the C5 protein unless stated otherwise. First, we compared cleavage by M1 RNA of pATSerUA and pATSerU<sub>am</sub>A, where the latter carried 2&#x02032;N at &#x02212;1. Note that replacement of the 2&#x02032;OH at &#x02212;1 with 2&#x02032;N does not result in any apparent change in the overall structure as revealed by Pb<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> cleavage analysis (M. Br&#x000e4;nnvall and E. Kikovska, unpublished data). The experiments described below were conducted under single turnover conditions except for cleavage in the presence of C5 protein (see Materials and Methods).</p><p>As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh883f2">2</xref>A, in the Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> promoted reaction the all-ribo substrate was cleaved only at the correct position &#x0002b;1 while cleavage of pATSerU<sub>am</sub>A at both &#x02212;1 and &#x0002b;1 was observed. Thus, replacement of the 2&#x02032;OH with a 2&#x02032;N at &#x02212;1 influenced cleavage site recognition under our standard assay conditions i.e. buffer A at pH 7.2. The correct cleavage site is between residues &#x02212;1 and &#x0002b;1 whereas miscleavage occurs between &#x02212;1 and &#x02212;2. Hence, we will refer to cleavage at these positions as cleavage at &#x0002b;1 and at &#x02212;1, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh883f1">1</xref>).</p><p>Our previous data suggest that residues &#x02212;1 and &#x0002b;73 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh883f1">1</xref>) are important for cleavage efficiency and site recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c31">31</xref>). We therefore decided to investigate the influence of these residues in the context of cleavage of substrates with 2&#x02032;N at position &#x02212;1. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh883f2">2</xref>B (data not shown for pATSerC<sub>am</sub>A), irrespective of identity of the residue at &#x02212;1 and&#x0002f;or &#x0002b;73 (except pATSerC<sub>am</sub>G, which was only cleaved at &#x02212;1 under the same assay conditions at pH 7.2) cleavage at both position &#x02212;1 and &#x0002b;1 in the Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> alone reaction was observed. These findings are in contrast to the cleavage pattern of the corresponding all-ribo substrates (except pATSerCG), which were cleaved only at the correct position &#x0002b;1. The pATSerCG was cleaved with a low frequency at &#x02212;1 as previously reported [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c30">30</xref>); data not shown]. Thus, the observed miscleavage at &#x02212;1 due to the presence of 2&#x02032;N does not appear to depend on the identity of the residue at &#x02212;1 and&#x0002f;or &#x0002b;73. Note that miscleavage of pATSerU<sub>am</sub>U was observed in particular at low pH (see below).</p><p>Changing the metal ion, i.e. replacing Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> with Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, resulted in a reduced frequency of &#x02212;1 miscleavage and increased cleavage at &#x0002b;1 compared with the Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> alone reaction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh883f2">2</xref>A shows the data only for the cleavage of pATSerU<sub>am</sub>A; see also below). In contrast, substitution of Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> with Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> resulted in a significant shift of the cleavage site such that cleavage mainly occurred at the &#x02212;1 position (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh883f2">2</xref>A). Switching the metal ion gave no miscleavage of the all-ribo substrate, pATSerUA, in keeping with our previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c19">19</xref>). This indicated that switching to the softer metal ion Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> suppressed miscleavage of the substrate carrying an amino group at the 2&#x02032; position. We emphasize that we previously have identified Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> as an inducer of miscleavage using several different all-ribo pATSer derivatives [e.g. see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c30">30</xref>)].</p></sec><sec><title>The influence of protonation of the 2&#x02032;N at the RNase P RNA cleavage site on cleavage site recognition</title><p>The p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> value of the 2&#x02032;N of dinucleotides has been determined by NMR spectroscopy to be 6.0&#x02013;6.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c33">33</xref>). In cleavage by the Group I ribozyme, the data suggest that the 2&#x02032;OH at the cleavage site is involved in stabilizing the oxyanion leaving group. This was based on the finding that the rate of cleavage of a substrate carrying a 2&#x02032;N was stimulated below pH 6.5 relative to cleavage of a substrate with a 2&#x02032;OH at the cleavage site and that a protonated amine is a good H-donor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c23">23</xref>). To investigate whether the frequency of cleavage at &#x0002b;1 versus &#x02212;1 changed due to protonation of the 2&#x02032;N at &#x02212;1 we studied cleavage of pATSerU<sub>am</sub>G at different pH values. Among unmodified pATSer substrate derivatives, pATSerUG is the most efficiently cleaved substrate in the M1 RNA alone reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c19">19</xref>). Moreover, the p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> values for U and G are &#x0003e;9 while for C and A the corresponding values are close to 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c34">34</xref>). Thus, in the experiments where we studied cleavage as a function of pH, we increased the likelihood that we monitored changes at the 2&#x02032;N at &#x02212;1 by using pATSerU<sub>am</sub>G and pATSerUG as substrates. We also included pATSerdUG (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh883f1">1</xref>) to investigate whether the presence of a 2&#x02032;H at &#x02212;1 changed the miscleavage pattern in the pH range used here.</p><p>As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh883f3">3</xref>, a decrease in pH resulted in an increased frequency of cleavage at &#x02212;1 relative to &#x0002b;1. It is also apparent that cleavage at &#x02212;1 diminished with increasing pH (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh883f2">2</xref>B). Control experiments in which we studied cleavage of the all-ribo substrate, pATSerUG, showed no shift of the cleavage site at 40 mM Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> as a function of pH (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh883f2">2</xref>A). The cleavage pattern of pATSerU<sub>am</sub>G at different pH was essentially unchanged when the Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration was increased to 160 mM (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh883f2">2</xref>, see also Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh883tb1">1</xref>). However, an increase in Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration to 160 mM resulted in a low frequency of miscleavage at &#x02212;1 using pATSerUG that did not change under single turnover conditions in the pH range 5.0&#x02013;8.6 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh883f2">2</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh883f3">3</xref>). Moreover, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh883f2">2</xref>C and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh883f3">3</xref> pATSerdUG (with 2&#x02032;H at &#x02212;1) was cleaved both at &#x0002b;1 and &#x02212;1 at 160 mM Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. However, note that the frequency of cleavage at &#x02212;1 increased rather than decreased, as was observed for the 2&#x02032;N substituted substrate, with increasing pH. Taken together, these findings provided support for the idea that we were monitoring protonation of the 2&#x02032;N at &#x02212;1 by changing pH and therefore also the presence&#x0002f;absence of a positive charge at the cleavage site. Furthermore, this suggested to us that the 2&#x02032;N at &#x02212;1 could be used as a tool to probe for factors influencing the charge distribution at the cleavage site.</p><p>Plotting relative frequency of cleavage at &#x02212;1 as a function of increasing pH gave a pH-value of 6.6 that corresponds to the pH where we observed equal frequency of cleavage at &#x0002b;1 and &#x02212;1. We will refer to this pH value as pH<sup>50</sup> (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh883tb1">1</xref>). Cleavage of the other substrates with substitutions at &#x02212;1 and&#x0002f;or &#x0002b;73 as a function of pH revealed similar results for cleavage of pATSerU<sub>am</sub>G, pATSerU<sub>am</sub>A and pATSerC<sub>am</sub>A, i.e. pH<sup>50</sup> values were approximately the same (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh883tb1">1</xref>). This is in contrast to the study by Hartmann and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c35">35</xref>) who observed a difference in pH<sup>50</sup> value as a result of substituting the residue U at &#x02212;1 with a C. The reason for this discrepancy could be differences in reaction conditions and&#x0002f;or substrate, i.e. a hairpin model versus a tRNA precursor substrate. The pH<sup>50</sup> value for cleavage of pATSerU<sub>am</sub>U was estimated to be &#x0003c;6 while for pATSerC<sub>am</sub>G we only observed a modest cleavage at &#x0002b;1 at higher pH and we were unable to determine a pH<sup>50</sup> value for this substrate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh883f2">2</xref>B and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh883tb1">1</xref>). However, note that the all-ribo substrate pATSerCG was cleaved with an increased frequency at &#x02212;1 with increasing pH (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh883f2">2</xref>C). Therefore it is possible that the observed high pH<sup>50</sup> value in cleavage of pATSerC<sub>am</sub>G is due to an increased miscleavage at higher pH and&#x0002f;or that the C<sub>-1</sub> residue in pATSerC<sub>am</sub>G being base paired with G<sub>&#x0002b;73</sub> [Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh883f1">1</xref>, see also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c30">30</xref>)]. A shift of the cleavage site with increasing pH is in keeping with earlier observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c36">36</xref>).</p><p>Given that we were monitoring protonation of the 2&#x02032;N at &#x02212;1, we conclude that the presence of a protonated amino group at the correct cleavage site influences cleavage by RNase P RNA negatively.

For those substrates with C and&#x0002f;or A at &#x02212;1 and &#x0002b;73, respectively, we cannot conclusively exclude that protonation&#x0002f;deprotonation of C and&#x0002f;or A affected the result (see above).</p></sec><sec><title>Metal ion substitution or addition of the RNase P protein influences cleavage of the 2&#x02032; amino substituted substrate by changing pH<sup>50</sup></title><p>Cleavage in the presence of the softer metal ion Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> suppressed (while Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> accentuated) miscleavage of the substrate carrying an amino group at the 2&#x02032; position (see above). Hence, we decided to study the cleavage pattern of pATSerU<sub>am</sub>G as a function of pH in the presence of Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. With Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, we noted to our surprise that equal frequency of cleavage at &#x0002b;1 and &#x02212;1 was observed at a lower pH relative to cleavage in the Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> alone reaction. We estimated pH<sup>50</sup> to be 5.8 for Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. In contrast, a higher estimated pH<sup>50</sup> value of 8.1 was observed when cleavage was performed in the presence of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh883f2">2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh883f3">3</xref>; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh883tb1">1</xref>). Approximately similar shifts of the pH<sup>50</sup> values in cleavage of the other 2&#x02032; amino substituted substrates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh883f1">1</xref>) were observed when cleavage was studied with increasing pH in the presence of Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh883f2">2</xref>B, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh883tb1">1</xref>, and data not shown). In the control experiments, cleavage of the all-ribo substrates at different pH in the presence of Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> showed no change of the cleavage site (data not shown). The differences in the observed pH<sup>50</sup> values in the presence of Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> correlate with the difference in p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> for these metal ions 10.6, 11.4 and 12.7, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c37">37</xref>).

These data also indicated that the observed suppression (see above) of miscleavage by Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> is due to a decreased pH<sup>50</sup> value.</p><p>The RNase P protein, C5, has been suggested to interact with residues in the 5&#x02032; leader of the substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c38">38</xref>). This, together with our findings, prompted us to investigate cleavage of the 2&#x02032; amino substituted substrates in the presence of C5 protein at different pH. Surprisingly, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh883f2">2</xref>D (cleavage of pATSerU<sub>am</sub>A and pATSerU<sub>am</sub>G), we only observed cleavage of these substrates at the correct position &#x0002b;1 irrespective of pH. M1 RNA cleaved the all-ribo substrate both in the presence and in the absence of C5 protein only at &#x0002b;1 (data not shown). Moreover, the other 2&#x02032; amino substituted substrates (pATSerC<sub>am</sub>A, pATSerU<sub>am</sub>U and pATSerC<sub>am</sub>G) were also cleaved mainly at the correct position &#x0002b;1 in the presence of the RNase P protein C5 (data not shown). Taken together, replacement of the 2&#x02032;OH with a 2&#x02032;N revealed a difference in the cleavage pattern comparing cleavage by M1 RNA and the reconstituted holoenzyme, irrespective of the identity of residues at &#x02212;1 and&#x0002f;or &#x0002b;73 under the conditions tested.</p></sec><sec><title>A 2&#x02032;N (or 2&#x02032;H) at &#x02212;1 affects ground state binding and the rate of cleavage</title><p>To investigate whether replacement of the 2&#x02032;OH with 2&#x02032;N (or 2&#x02032;H) at &#x02212;1 influenced the interaction with M1 RNA, we determined the apparent binding constant, app<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>, for pATSerUG, pATSerU<sub>am</sub>G and pATSerATdUG at pH 6.0 using a spin-column assay (see Materials and Methods). From the data presented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh883tb2">2</xref> it is evident that M1 RNA bound the all-ribo substrate significantly (17-fold) better compared to the 2&#x02032;N substituted substrate. Moreover, a raise in pH to 7.2, where the 2&#x02032;N is mainly in the deprotonated state, only resulted in a slight improvement in binding of pATSerU<sub>am</sub>G. For the 2&#x02032;H substituted substrate we also detected a significant change in app<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of the same order of magnitude as for the substrate with 2&#x02032;N. We conclude that the presence of the 2&#x02032;N (or 2&#x02032;H) at the cleavage site affected ground state binding of the hairpin model substrate emphasizing the importance of a 2&#x02032;OH at this position in keeping with previous data (see Introduction).</p><p>To study the influence of the 2&#x02032;N (or 2&#x02032;H) on the rate of cleavage at the cleavage site we determined the rate constant, <italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub>, under saturating single turnover conditions in the presence of Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> at pH 6.1 and 7.2. Cleavage of pATSerUG at different pH showed linear dependence of <italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub> on [OH<sup>&#x02212;</sup>] between pH 5.5 and 6.5 indicating that the chemistry is rate limiting in this pH range. In contrast, the rate of cleavage showed linear dependence on [OH<sup>&#x02212;</sup>] up to pH &#x0003e;8.1 in cleavage of the 2&#x02032;N and 2&#x02032;H substituted substrates, pATSerU<sub>am</sub>G and pATSerdUG, respectively (data not shown). These findings are in keeping with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c35">35</xref>). As shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh883tb3">3</xref>, the 2&#x02032; amino as well as the 2&#x02032;H modification resulted in a dramatic drop (1200-fold) in <italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub> at pH 6.1. Based on the discussion above, a significant fraction of the 2&#x02032;N is most likely in the protonated state at pH 6.1. We therefore determined <italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub> at pH 7.2 where the majority of the 2&#x02032;N is in the deprotonated state. Here the difference in <italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub> was 133-fold for cleavage of the all-ribo and 2&#x02032;N modified substrates while only a 2-fold difference was observed for cleavage of the 2&#x02032;N and 2&#x02032;H substituted substrates. The chemistry is not rate limited for cleavage of pATSerUG at pH 7.2 and therefore this difference might be larger that 133- and 290-fold, respectively. These findings are in keeping with kinetic measurements (using the 2&#x02032;N substituted substrate) performed under multiple turnover conditions where a decrease in k<sub>cat</sub> was observed with decreasing pH (M. Br&#x000e4;nnvall and E. Kikovska, unpublished data). Taken together, the presence of 2&#x02032;N (or 2&#x02032;H) at the cleavage site influenced the rate of cleavage significantly, in addition to the effect on ground state binding, indicating the importance of the 2&#x02032;OH at &#x02212;1 for the chemistry of cleavage of hairpin model substrates.</p></sec><sec><title>Cross talk between the 73&#x0002f;294-interaction and the cleavage site</title><p>We recently suggested that the structural architecture of the &#x0002b;73&#x0002f;294 interaction in M1 RNA substrate (RS-) complexes affects the binding of a functionally important metal ion in its vicinity. Moreover, we argued that this metal ion is involved in cross talk with metal ion(s) positioned in the vicinity of the cleavage site (see Introduction). Hence, based on this and together with our findings discussed above, we decided to use the 2&#x02032;N at the cleavage site as a probe to investigate whether the structural architecture of the &#x0002b;73&#x0002f;294 interaction influences protonation&#x0002f;deprotonation of the 2&#x02032;N (i.e. charge distribution) and thereby obtain information about possible cross talk between the &#x0002b;73&#x0002f;294 interaction and the cleavage site. The M1 RNA variants we used carried substitutions at position 294 in M1 RNA (U to C or G). For M1<sub>C294</sub> RNA this will give a G<sub>&#x0002b;73</sub>&#x0002f;C<sub>294</sub> interaction (for wild-type G<sub>&#x0002b;73</sub>&#x0002f;U<sub>294</sub>) in cleavage of pATSerUG derivatives while in the case of cleavage of pATSerUU derivatives with M1<sub>G294</sub> RNA we will have a U<sub>&#x0002b;73</sub>&#x0002f;G<sub>294</sub> interaction (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh883f4">4</xref>).</p><p>First, we studied cleavage of pATSerU<sub>am</sub>G by M1<sub>C294</sub> RNA that harbored a U to C substitution at 294. This M1 RNA variant was determined to be 2- to 3-fold reduction in the rate of cleavage of pATSerUG and pATSerU<sub>am</sub>G under single turnover conditions relative to wild type (data not shown). Also, M1<sub>C294</sub> RNA binds the substrate with similar app<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> as wild type (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh883tb2">2</xref>). Moreover, cleavage of pATSerUG using this M1 RNA variant showed linear dependence of the rate of cleavage on [OH<sup>&#x02212;</sup>] between pH 5.5 and 6.5 suggesting that the chemistry is rate limiting at pH &#x0003c; 6.5 (data not shown). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh883f5">5</xref>, cleavage by M1<sub>C294</sub> RNA resulted in significantly higher frequency of miscleavage at &#x02212;1 at pH 6.1 compared to wild type indicating a higher pH<sup>50</sup> value for M1<sub>C294</sub> RNA relative to wild type.</p><p>Next, we compared the cleavage patterns of pATSerU<sub>am</sub>U variants using wild-type M1 RNA and M1<sub>G294</sub> RNA. As demonstrated above, wild type cleaved pATSerU<sub>am</sub>U with an estimated pH<sup>50</sup> value &#x0003c;6 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh883tb1">1</xref>), while the pH<sup>50</sup> value for cleavage of the same substrate with the G294 variant was increased (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh883tb1">1</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh883f5">5</xref>). Furthermore, previous data suggest that the 2&#x02032;OH at &#x0002b;73 is involved in metal ion binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c19">19</xref>). Therefore, we also used substrates where the 2&#x02032;OH at position &#x0002b;73 had been replaced with 2&#x02032;N, pATSerUU<sub>am</sub> and pATSerU<sub>am</sub>U<sub>am</sub>, where the latter carried a 2&#x02032;N modification both at &#x02212;1 and at &#x0002b;73 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh883f1">1</xref>). These substrates were cleaved at pH 6.1. At this pH we observed increased miscleavage at &#x02212;1 for pATSerU<sub>am</sub>U<sub>am</sub> using wild-type M1 RNA compared to cleavage of pATSerU<sub>am</sub>U (2&#x02032;N at &#x02212;1 and 2&#x02032;OH at &#x0002b;73). In contrast, for M1<sub>G294</sub> RNA a decrease in miscleavage using pATSerU<sub>am</sub>U<sub>am</sub> was detected compared to cleavage using pATSerU<sub>am</sub>U. No miscleavage of pATSerUU<sub>am</sub> harboring a 2&#x02032;N only at &#x0002b;73 was observed irrespective of M1 RNA, wild type or G294 (data not shown). These findings suggested that changes in the structural architecture of the &#x0002b;73&#x0002f;294 interaction (including the 2&#x02032;OH at &#x0002b;73) influence protonation&#x0002f;deprotonation of the 2&#x02032;N at the cleavage site.</p><p>Finally, we asked whether a change in the structural architecture of the &#x0002b;73&#x0002f;294 interaction (including the 2&#x02032;OH at &#x0002b;73) had an impact on the rate of cleavage for substrates with 2&#x02032;OH at the cleavage site. Hence, we determined the rate constants (<italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub>) for cleavage of pATSerUU and pATSerUU<sub>am</sub> for wild type and M1<sub>G294</sub> RNA under saturating single turnover conditions at pH 6.1. Cleavage of pATSerUU as well as pATSerUU<sub>am</sub>, with wild type or M1<sub>G294</sub> RNA, showed a linear dependence of the rate of cleavage on [OH<sup>&#x02212;</sup>] up to pH 6.5 suggesting that the chemistry is rate limiting at pH 6.1 in keeping with the discussion above (data not shown). As shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh883tb3">3</xref>, substitution of the 2&#x02032;OH with 2&#x02032;N at &#x0002b;73 gave a modest (2-fold) decrease in <italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub> for wild type while for the G294 variant an almost 3-fold increase was observed. This experiment was followed by determination of app<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values for the same combinations (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh883tb2">2</xref>). Here we observed a slightly weaker binding (&#x0223c;2.5-fold) for wild type due to the presence of the 2&#x02032;N at &#x0002b;73 whereas the opposite was the case for M1<sub>G294</sub> RNA, i.e. &#x0223c;5-fold stronger binding. Thus, weaker binding correlated with decreased <italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub>, in particular when comparing cleavage of pATSerUU and pATSerUU<sub>am</sub> with wild type or G294, respectively. We conclude that the structural architecture of the &#x0002b;73&#x0002f;294 interaction influences catalysis and ground state binding. Taken together, these data provide evidences for cross talk between the &#x0002b;73&#x0002f;294 interaction and the cleavage site.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Involvement of the 2&#x02032;OH at the cleavage site in metal ion binding</title><p>The main consequence of replacing the 2&#x02032;OH at &#x02212;1 is a significant reduction in the rate of cleavage [this report; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c39">39</xref>)]. But replacement of the 2&#x02032;OH with 2&#x02032;N at the cleavage site for RNase P RNA also resulted in cleavage both at the correct position, &#x0002b;1, and at &#x02212;1. However, the frequency of miscleavage at &#x02212;1 changed with decreasing pH. In contrast cleavage of a 2&#x02032;H modified substrate resulted in a low and reproducible frequency of miscleavage at &#x02212;1 that increased with increasing pH, while cleavage of the corresponding all-ribo substrate at &#x02212;1 did not change within this pH range (this report). The 2&#x02032;H cannot be protonated and it is very unlikely that the 2&#x02032;OH is protonated within this pH range. The p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> value for a 2&#x02032;N in the context of dinucleotides is 6.0&#x02013;6.2 as determined by NMR spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c33">33</xref>). This is close to the pH<sup>50</sup> values (&#x0223c;6.5) for the cleavage, in the presence of Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> of some of the substrates used in this report (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh883tb1">1</xref>). Moreover, the pH<sup>50</sup> value shifted as a result of replacing Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> with Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> such that the shift correlated with the difference in p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> for these metal ions. No apparent change in the conformation of M1 RNA was observed substituting Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> by Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c40">40</xref>). We also note that addition of Hg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> to DNA can result in deprotonation of the N3 of thymidine such that the equilibrium of binding is pH-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c41">41</xref>). Taken together, we conclude that the reduction of cleavage at the correct position with lowering pH is most likely due to protonation of the 2&#x02032;N at &#x02212;1 and that the presence of a protonated amine, i.e. a positive charge, at the correct cleavage site influences cleavage by M1 RNA negatively. Moreover, together with previous data [see above and also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c42">42</xref>)], we suggest that the 2&#x02032;OH at the cleavage site is involved in metal ion coordination either as inner or outer sphere ligand. An alternative reason to the observed shift of cleavage site for the 2&#x02032;N substituted substrates with increased pH would be differences in the rate-limiting steps for cleavage at &#x0002b;1 and &#x02212;1. For example, one possibility is that the rate-limiting step for cleavage at &#x0002b;1 and &#x02212;1 is the chemistry and binding, respectively. This would favor cleavage at &#x0002b;1 with increasing pH. However, <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> for cleavage of pATSer derivatives is approximately the same irrespective of the cleavage site [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c30">30</xref>); M. Br&#x000e4;nnvall and E. Kikovska, unpublished data] and cleavage of pATSerdUG at &#x02212;1 increased with increasing pH (this report). We therefore consider this possibility less likely and favor the conclusion that protonation of the 2&#x02032;N at &#x02212;1 is the reason for the observed shift of the cleavage site with decreasing pH.</p><p>Our conclusion is in keeping with the recent work by Hartmann and coworkers in which they used full-size precursor tRNA variants with 2&#x02032; modifications at &#x02212;1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c35">35</xref>). However, this study complements their study emphasizing the importance of metal ion identity and the use of another type of substrate. Note that RNase P interacts and cleaves a large number of substrates with different structures, e.g. precursors to tRNA and 4.5S RNA, where the latter has a hairpin-like structure, similar to the model substrate used in the present study [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c3">3</xref>)]. Based on this, it is important to study cleavage under various conditions using different types of substrates in order to elucidate the cleavage mechanism and importance of various chemical groups in RNase P RNA mediated cleavage. Moreover, our data and the data of Persson <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c35">35</xref>) are in contrast to the Group I ribozyme system where the presence of a protonated 2&#x02032;N at the cleavage site makes a positive contribution to the cleavage reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c23">23</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Possible role of the metal ion coordinated at the cleavage site</title><p>For the hammerhead ribozyme it has been suggested that a metal ion bound in the vicinity of the 2&#x02032;OH at the cleavage site functions either as a general base or as a Lewis acid, thereby activating the nucleophile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c44">44</xref>). The cleavage products in the hammerhead cleavage reaction as well as in the metal ion induced cleavage of RNA are 5&#x02032; hydroxyls and 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cyclic phosphates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c37">37</xref>) while cleavage by RNase P RNA generates a 5&#x02032; phosphate and a 3&#x02032; OH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c2">2</xref>). Therefore, a metal ion acting as a general base, i.e. interacting with the 2&#x02032;OH at &#x02212;1 at the RNase P RNA cleavage site via an outer sphere interaction could result in a nucleophilic attack on the phosphate and &#x02018;incorrect&#x02019; cleavage products, i.e. a 5&#x02032; OH and a 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cyclic phosphate. In fact, metal ions cleave precursor tRNA and model substrates at and close to the cleavage site in the absence of M1 RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c45">45</xref>). Moreover, the (<italic>pro</italic>)-Rp oxygen is a ligand for Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> at the cleavage site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c11">11</xref>). This would make the phosphorous more electrophilic and vulnerable for a nucleophilic attack. The strategy for RNase P RNA must therefore be to prevent the 2&#x02032;OH at &#x02212;1 (when coordinated to a divalent metal ion as we suggest here) from acting as a nucleophile and favor an attack on the phosphorous from the other side of the phosphate to ensure &#x02018;correct&#x02019; cleavage products, i.e. a 5&#x02032; phosphate and a 3&#x02032; OH. This strategy is also relevant to the other two large ribozymes, Group I and Group II, since both these ribozymes give the same cleavage products as RNase P RNA. For the Group I ribozyme it has been conclusively demonstrated that the proton of the 2&#x02032; OH is shared between the 2&#x02032; and the 3&#x02032; oxygen in the transition state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c23">23</xref>). In addition, the 2&#x02032; OH is engaged in hydrogen bonding with the 2&#x02032; OH of residue A207 [e.g. see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c46">46</xref>)]. For the Group II ribozyme it has been suggested that a metal ion is directly coordinated to both the 3&#x02032; oxygen and the 2&#x02032;OH in the transition state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c47">47</xref>). To conclude, it is therefore conceivable that a metal ion is coordinated in a similar way in the cleavage reaction mediated by RNase P RNA as in the Group II ribozyme system (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh883f6">6</xref>). Possibly the positioning of this metal ion prevents the 2&#x02032;OH from acting as a nucleophile in addition to its plausible involvement in stabilization of the (3&#x02032;) oxyanion in the transition state. Alternatively, the Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> could be coordinated via inner sphere interactions both to the 2&#x02032;OH and the (<italic>pro</italic>)-Rp oxygen. This type of Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> binding was hypothesized to exist in the Group I system but was rejected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c23">23</xref>). In this situation, we envision that there is an increased probability that the 2&#x02032;OH will act as a nucleophile and attack the phosphorous center (see above), arguing against this alternative. Irrespective of the alternative there is also the possibility that N7 and&#x0002f;or O6 of the &#x0002b;1 G residue is involved in Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> binding. At present we do not exclude other alternatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c35">35</xref>).</p><p>It has been suggested that the 2&#x02032;OH at &#x02212;1 mediate an interaction with RNase P RNA and that this interaction plays a role for positioning the scissile bond in the active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c16">16</xref>). Recent data suggest that the residue at the &#x02212;1 position interacts with A248 in M1 RNA via Watson&#x02013;Crick base pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c48">48</xref>). As discussed in these studies the 2&#x02032;OH at &#x02212;1 plays an essential role and probably act in concert with the interaction between residues &#x02212;1 and 248. Apart from ensuring cleavage at the correct site, the function of these interactions might be to prevent the 2&#x02032;OH to act as a nucleophile. Thus, it is not excluded that replacing the 2&#x02032;OH at &#x02212;1 with a 2&#x02032;N (or 2&#x02032;H) would affect the &#x02212;1&#x0002f;248 interaction and&#x0002f;or the proposed interaction between the 2&#x02032;OH and M1 RNA. Given that Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> is positioned in the vicinity of the 2&#x02032;OH at &#x02212;1 makes it therefore plausible that Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> plays an active role in establishing these interactions.</p></sec><sec><title>Cross talk in M1 RNA mediated cleavage</title><p>We have suggested that to ensure correct and efficient cleavage the &#x0002b;73&#x0002f;294 interaction operates in concert with displacement of residue &#x02212;1 [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c30">30</xref>) and references therein]. The &#x0002b;73&#x0002f;294 interaction is part of the &#x02018;RNase P RNA-RCCA&#x02019; interaction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh883f4">4</xref>). Disruption of the &#x02018;RNase P RNA-RCCA&#x02019; interaction, i.e. the base pairing between C<sub>&#x0002b;75</sub> and G<sub>292</sub> in M1 RNA, resulted in miscleavage at &#x02212;1 of a substrate with a 2&#x02032; deoxy substitution at &#x02212;1 while cleavage still occurred mainly at the correct site when the corresponding all-ribo substrate was cleaved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c35">35</xref>). Moreover, base substitution of the &#x02212;1 residue affects both the rate of cleavage and cleavage site recognition [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c49">49</xref>) and references therein]. These data are in keeping with the fact that at least one determinant for cleavage site recognition has been disrupted&#x0002f;changed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c50">50</xref>). Here, we demonstrated that changes in the structural architecture of the &#x0002b;73&#x0002f;294 interaction affected the charge distribution at the cleavage site (ionization state of the 2&#x02032;N at &#x02212;1), ground state binding and the rate of cleavage under conditions where the chemistry is suggested to be rate limiting (pH 6.1). Thus, the present findings extend and increase our understanding of the function of the &#x02018;RNase P RNA&#x02013;RCCA&#x02019; interaction by providing evidence for cross talk between the &#x0002b;73&#x0002f;294 interaction and the cleavage site. Moreover, the pH<sup>50</sup> value in cleavage of pATSerU<sub>am</sub>A by wild-type M1 RNA decreased when the Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration was increased to 160 mM while for pATSerU<sub>am</sub>G it remained essentially unchanged (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh883tb1">1</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh883f2">2</xref>C). This is in keeping with the fact that the structural architecture of the &#x0002b;73&#x0002f;294 interaction, including the 2&#x02032;OH at &#x0002b;73, in the M1 RNA substrate complex influence metal in coordination in its vicinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c19">19</xref>). It is conceivable that this cross talk influences the charge distribution and&#x0002f;or Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> coordination at the cleavage site such that substrates with different &#x0002b;73 base identities (resulting in a different structural architecture of the &#x0002b;73&#x0002f;294 interaction) are cleaved with different efficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c19">19</xref>). Furthermore, it is also plausible that the interaction between M1 RNA and the &#x02212;1 residue (including the 2&#x02032;OH) actually depend on the formation of the &#x0002b;73&#x0002f;294 interaction (see also above). This would be consistent with the proposal that cleavage at &#x02212;1 does not depend on the &#x0002b;73&#x0002f;294 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c30">30</xref>). We envision that Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ions (or other metal ions when present) might play important&#x0002f;essential roles in mediating this cross talk where Mg<sub>A</sub> is proposed to stabilize the &#x0002b;73&#x0002f;294 interaction [Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh883f6">6</xref> and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c6">6</xref>)]. In this context, we note that in the revised mechanism for alkaline phosphatase, Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> is not directly coordinating the serine nucleophile but there is a correlation with Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> binding and the conformation of this serine that affects deprotonation of the serine nucleophile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c51">51</xref>). This suggests that Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> can indeed influence catalysis without being directly bound to the active site. Moreover, the data from Harris and coworkers suggested the existence of a polynuclear binding site in the vicinity of the P4 helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c52">52</xref>). We do not exclude the possibility that these metal ions are positioned close to Mg<sub>A</sub> and&#x0002f;or Mg<sub>B</sub>, however, whether this is the case or not remains to be seen.</p></sec><sec><title>Influence of the RNase P protein C5</title><p>Surprisingly, addition of the RNase P protein C5 resulted in cleavage of the 2&#x02032;N substrates almost exclusively at the correct site &#x0002b;1 irrespective of pH. This could indicate that the presence of the C5 protein influences the chemical environment either by allowing the presence of a positive charge (protonated amino group) at the 2&#x02032; of the &#x02212;1 residue or following the discussion above by perturbing p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> for the 2&#x02032;N. Cross-linking experiments suggests that the C5 protein is located in close proximity to substrate residues &#x02212;3, &#x02212;4 and &#x02212;5 in the 5&#x02032; leader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c38">38</xref>). Therefore it is plausible that interaction between these residues and the C5 protein affects the environment at the cleavage site perhaps by mediating cross talk along the 5&#x02032; leader of the RNA. Recent data actually suggest cross talk from the first to the sixth nucleotide residue in an RNA hexamer that results in changes in the local electronic environment along the RNA chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c53">53</xref>). Also, based on the structure of the 50S ribosomal subunit it has been suggested that a buried phosphate (between A2450 and A2451) might result in a perturbed p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> of A2451, which is positioned in the peptidyl transferase center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c54">54</xref>). Moreover, data suggest that the C5 protein enhances Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> affinity of the pre-tRNA RNase P RNA complex indirectly in the <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c55">55</xref>). Therefore Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> might be involved in mediating cross talk along the 5&#x02032; leader. Another possibility is that the positioning of the C5 protein near residues &#x02212;3 to &#x02212;5 in the 5&#x02032; leader results in a more rigid complex than when the C5 protein is absent, and this rigidity prevents cleavage at alternative sites in the 5&#x02032; leader, i.e. at &#x02212;1 [for a recent three-dimensional model of the RNase P holoenzyme in complex with its substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c56">56</xref>)]. In this context, we note that the presence of a 2&#x02032;H at &#x02212;1 in a similar hairpin model substrate (as used here) resulted in a significant reduction in cleavage in the RNA alone reaction and that addition of the C5 protein suppressed this reduction in cleavage efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c12">12</xref>). Obviously, further experiments are required to explain our findings. But, nevertheless our data stresses the importance of the C5 protein in the cleavage site recognition process [e.g. see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c58">58</xref>)].</p></sec><sec><title>Metal ions and regulation of RNA based activities</title><p>Available structural and biochemical data suggest that p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> values for specific chemical groups can be perturbed and that this perturbation is of biological importance. For example in the peptidyl transferase center on the 50S ribosomal subunit, the p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> for N1 (or N3) of residue A2451 (<italic>E.coli</italic> numbering) has been suggested to be 7.6, which is &#x0223c;4 pH units higher than the p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> for N1 (or N3) of the nucleotide base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c59">59</xref>). For protein-based activities it is clear that binding of different metal ions to, for example, the active site affects activity e.g. specificity and processivity [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c60">60</xref>)]. Also, it is known that addition of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> inhibits charging of tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> by mammalian and <italic>E.coli</italic> alanyl-tRNA-synthetase [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c61">61</xref>), L. A. Kirsebom, unpublished data] and RNase P RNA mediated cleavage [e.g. see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c6">6</xref>)]. Recently we raised the possibility that the intracellular concentrations of the bulk biological ions Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> influence the activity of biocatalysts that depend on RNA for activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c6">6</xref>). From structural studies it is evident that different metal ions such as Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> can bind to RNA if not to the same at least to overlapping sites [e.g. see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh883c62">62</xref>)]. Therefore based on our present findings it is conceivable that binding of different metal ions e.g. Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, to RNA results in different degrees of perturbation of p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> values for specific chemical groups. As a consequence this could give changes in activity such that the activity is either up- or downregulated and&#x0002f;or result in stabilization&#x0002f;destabilization of interaction with other factors.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh883f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> The predicted secondary structure of the model substrate pATSerUG is depicted.
