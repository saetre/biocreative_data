At 2 hours following an intraperitoneal injection of thioglycollate, there was a 4.5-fold increase in blood neutrophil numbers, which was inhibited 84% and 72% by prior administration of blocking mAbs against either the chemokines KC/MIP-2 or G-CSF, respectively. An intraperitoneal injection of G-CSF acted remotely to stimulate neutrophil mobilization, but did not elicit recruitment into the peritoneum. Further, in vitro G-CSF was neither chemotactic nor chemokinetic for murine neutrophils, and had no priming effect on chemotaxis stimulated by chemokines. Here, we show that, in vitro and in vivo, G-CSF induces neutrophil mobilization by disrupting their SDF-1&#x003b1;&#x02013;mediated retention in the bone marrow.

Intraperitoneal injection of 3% thioglycollate into Balb/c mice induced a 4.5-fold increase in circulating neutrophil numbers and a concomitant 200-fold increase in peritoneal neutrophil numbers after 2 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Administration of blocking antibodies against either KC or MIP-2 alone inhibited the rise in circulating neutrophil numbers by 45% and 55%, respectively, as well as neutrophil recruitment into the peritoneal cavity by 56% and 35%, respectively. While neutralization of both KC and MIP-2 significantly inhibited the rise in circulating neutrophil numbers by 84% and neutrophil recruitment into the peritoneal cavity by 71%, blockade of G-CSF also inhibited the increase in blood neutrophils by 72% and their recruitment into the peritoneal cavity by 40%. In contrast, blockade of GM-CSF had no effect on neutrophil numbers in the blood or peritoneal cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). In these experiments, we observed most effective inhibition, with respect to both blood and peritoneal numbers of neutrophils, by neutralizing both chemokines. This is consistent with previous studies that have shown that MIP-2 and KC are functionally redundant and that it is necessary to neutralize both chemokines to reduce neutrophil accumulation at the site of inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref></sup></p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>KC/MIP-2 and G-CSF but not GM-CSF contribute to blood and tissue neutrophilia in TG-induced peritonitis.</bold> Neutralizing antibodies against KC (50 &#x003bc;g), MIP-2 (20 &#x003bc;g), KC and MIP-2, G-CSF (150 &#x003bc;g), GM-CSF (50 &#x003bc;g), or rat isotype-control mAb (mixture of control isotype IgGs) were administered intraperitoneally 20 minutes before intraperitoneal injection of 3% thioglycollate (TG).

Further, when neutrophils were preincubated for 30 minutes with G-CSF, the response to chemokines was not enhanced (data not shown), indicating that G-CSF did not prime murine neutrophils. Finally, addition of G-CSF to both the upper and lower wells did not stimulate neutrophil migration, indicating that G-CSF was not chemokinetic for murine neutrophils. These data suggest that the effect of G-CSF on murine neutrophils is neither chemotactic nor chemokinetic, and that G-CSF has no priming effect with respect to chemokine-stimulated chemotaxis.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>G-CSF does not stimulate the chemotaxis or chemokinesis of murine neutrophils.</bold> Freshly isolated murine bone marrow neutrophils were used in a chemotaxis assay.

In this study, we have identified a unique combinatorial effect of the ELR + CXC chemokines KC/MIP-2 and the cytokine G-CSF with respect to the rapid mobilization of neutrophils from the bone marrow in a model of acute peritonitis. While it is well documented that ELR + CXC chemokines play an important role in the recruitment of neutrophils from the blood into tissues during inflammation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref></sup> this is the first report that ELR + CXC chemokines contribute to neutrophil mobilization from the bone marrow during acute inflammatory reactions.</p><p>Interestingly, we show that at these early time points (2 hours), G-CSF also plays a critical role in mobilizing neutrophils from the bone marrow. In contrast, GM-CSF, a cytokine required for emergency granulopoiesis in response to infection and inflammation, a response that occurs over several days,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref></sup> is not required for the rapid neutrophil mobilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). We have previously shown that the cytokine IL-5 drives the mobilization of eosinophils from the bone marrow in models of allergic airway inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref></sup> Others have recently shown that chemokines play a central role in mobilizing monocytes from the bone marrow in models of chronic inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref></sup> This is therefore the first demonstration that chemokines, in combination with a cytokine, are required for leukocyte mobilization during a specific inflammatory reaction.</p><p>To directly assess whether locally generated chemokines and G-CSF can act remotely to mobilize neutrophils from the bone marrow, we examined the effect of a single intraperitoneal injection of these factors on neutrophil recruitment into the blood and tissue. The results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> indicate that MIP-2 acts both systemically to increase circulating neutrophil numbers and locally to promote neutrophil recruitment into the tissue. In this regard, it is interesting that the same chemokine can stimulate mobilization and recruitment, as it suggests that neutrophils are not desensitized by the initial mobilizing response to the chemokine. This may reflect the low concentrations of chemokines that actually promote these responses in vivo as compared with high levels of CXCR2 expression on mature neutrophils.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref></sup> In contrast, G-CSF although administered intraperitoneally did not stimulate the local recruitment of neutrophils into the peritoneum, but rather acted systemically to stimulate neutrophil mobilization.</p><p>The lack of effect of G-CSF with respect to local recruitment from the blood into the peritoneum suggested to us that G-CSF was not chemotactic for murine neutrophils. In fact, in vitro chemotaxis assays showed that G-CSF was neither chemotactic nor chemokinetic for murine bone marrow neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). It should be noted that previous results have been reported with respect to the chemokinetic/chemotactic effects of human G-CSF on human peripheral blood neutrophils.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref></sup> As we can find no reports of effects of G-CSF stimulating the migration of murine neutrophils, there may be a species difference in this context. Finally, we were not able to show a priming effect of G-CSF with respect to chemokine-stimulated chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), again an effect reported with human neutrophils.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref></sup></p><p>Mature neutrophils in the bone marrow reserve are present in the hematopoietic compartment, and mobilization is dependent on their migration across the bone marrow endothelium into the bone marrow sinuses. We believe that chemokines in the blood create a gradient across the bone marrow sinusoidal endothelium, thereby stimulating neutrophil migration out of the bone marrow into the blood. Indeed, using an in situ perfusion system of the femoral bone marrow, we have shown directly that infusing the ELR plus CXC chemokines KC (CXCL1) and MIP-2 (CXCL2) into the bone marrow vasculature stimulates the rapid mobilization of neutrophils.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref></sup> In addition, we have previously shown that the cytokine IL-5, which stimulates eosinophil chemokinesis, mobilizes eosinophils from the bone marrow in vivo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref></sup> Furthermore, we have shown a synergistic effect between the chemokinetic effect of IL-5 and the chemotactic effect of the chemokine eotaxin, with respect to eosinophil migration in vitro and mobilization in situ.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref></sup> In contrast, in this study we found that G-CSF alone or in combination with chemokines does not stimulate neutrophil migration in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Thus, we believe that G-CSF acts in a distinct manner to the chemokines to mobilize neutrophils from the bone marrow.</p><p>SDF-1&#x003b1; is expressed constitutively in the bone marrow, and numerous lines of evidence support the hypothesis that the SDF-1&#x003b1;/CXCR4 chemokine axis plays an important role in the retention of neutrophils within the bone marrow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref></sup> Chronic treatment of mice with G-CSF over 4 to 5 days stimulates neutrophil granulopoiesis and mobilization. It has been proposed that mobilization may be due to a reduction in the levels of SDF-1&#x003b1; in the bone marrow,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref></sup> inhibition of CXCR4 expression,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref></sup> or cleavage of CXCR4 from the cell surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref></sup> The role of proteases in this response has recently been excluded.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref></sup> In this study, experiments performed in vitro show for the first time that G-CSF can rapidly inhibit the retention signal delivered by SDF-1&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). G-CSF can therefore stimulate the acute mobilization of neutrophils from the bone marrow by disrupting the CXCR4/SDF-1&#x003b1; chemokine axis in the same way that the CXCR4 antagonist induces a rapid blood neutrophilia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref></sup> Indeed, this mechanism of G-CSF&#x02013;stimulated mobilization is further supported by the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref> showing that the CXCR4 antagonist reverses the inhibition of neutrophil mobilization from the bone marrow caused by administration of the G-CSF&#x02013;neutralizing mAb.</p><p>The fact that in the model of peritonitis blockade of either the chemokines or G-CSF alone resulted in a greater than 70% inhibition of blood neutrophilia suggests that G-CSF and the chemokines may act in a coordinated manner with respect to mobilization. To assess this directly, we used an in situ perfusion system of the mouse femoral bone marrow. We show here that while neutrophils were mobilized in response to direct infusion of G-CSF and KC alone, a more than additive effect was observed with respect to mobilization when KC and G-CSF were infused together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), suggesting that these factors may indeed act in a coordinated fashion in vivo. It has been shown that transgenic mice, which carry a targeted (knock-in) mutation of their G-CSFR such that the cytoplasmic (signaling) domain of the G-CSFR is replaced with that of the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR), exhibit near-normal levels of mature neutrophils in the bone marrow, while treatment with G-CSF fails to induce significant mobilization of neutrophils to the blood. In accordance with our data, these GEpoR mice show normal chemokine-stimulated mobilization of neutrophils from the bone marrow, indicating that the chemokine-induced mobilization of neutrophils is indeed G-CSF&#x02013;independent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref></sup></p><p>Taken together, our data suggest a new paradigm for the acute mobilization of neutrophils from the bone marrow, requiring the coordinated actions of both G-CSF and the CXC chemokines KC and MIP-2 acting via distinct mechanisms. Thus, under acute inflammatory conditions, systemically acting chemokines promote mobilization by stimulating the chemotaxis of neutrophils across the bone marrow sinusoidal endothelium, a process facilitated by G-CSF that acts by blocking the retention signal delivered by bone marrow&#x02013;derived SDF-1&#x003b1;.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment.
