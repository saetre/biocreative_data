Our kinetic primer extension studies demonstrate that the bypass polymerase Dpo4 preferentially inserts C opposite oxoG, and also preferentially extends from the oxoG&#x02022;C base pair, thus achieving error-free bypass of this lesion. We have determined the crystal structures of preinsertion binary, insertion ternary, and postinsertion binary complexes of oxoG-modified template-primer DNA and Dpo4. These structures provide insights into the translocation mechanics of the bypass polymerase during a complete cycle of nucleotide incorporation. Specifically, during noncovalent dCTP insertion opposite oxoG (or G), the little-finger domain&#x02013;DNA phosphate contacts translocate by one nucleotide step, while the thumb domain&#x02013;DNA phosphate contacts remain fixed. By contrast, during the nucleotidyl transfer reaction that covalently incorporates C opposite oxoG, the thumb-domain&#x02013;phosphate contacts are translocated by one nucleotide step, while the little-finger contacts with phosphate groups remain fixed. These stepwise conformational transitions accompanying nucleoside triphosphate binding and covalent nucleobase incorporation during a full replication cycle of Dpo4-catalyzed bypass of the oxoG lesion are distinct from the translocation events in replicative polymerases.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Crystal structures of the bypass polymerase Dpo4 at different stages of lesion-bypass reveal how the cell copes with oxidative DNA damage.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Y-family polymerases are able to bypass a variety of DNA lesions that impede high-fidelity replicative DNA polymerases.

Since translesion bypass of oxidatively damaged DNA templates by Dpo4 has not been previously investigated to our knowledge, we first surveyed the kinetics of translesion bypass of oxoG in order to select the most appropriate dNTP to be inserted opposite this lesion in our subsequent co-crystal structural studies.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Fidelity of Translesion Synthesis and Primer Extension Kinetics</title><p>The results of steady-state, one-step primer extension experiments are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040011-t001">Table 1</xref>.

As a result, the contacts between the thumb domain and the backbone DNA phosphate groups shift by one nucleotide step (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040011-g007">Figure 7</xref>D). The nucleotidyl transfer reaction and release of the pyrophosphate provide the driving force for this transition. The nascent base pair retains its contacts with the finger domain (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040011-g007">Figure 7</xref>C), and there are no proofreading interactions between this base pair and the Dpo4 polymerase.</p><p>The structures of the unmodified preinsertion binary and insertion ternary Dpo4 complexes are identical to their oxoG-modified counterparts with the exception of a different location of the oxoG phosphate group and Arg 332 in the insertion ternary complex (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040011-g003">Figure 3</xref>F).
