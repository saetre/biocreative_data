Clinicopathologic analysis was conducted to assess the potential of TRIP-Br2 as a novel prognostic marker of human cancer.

TRIP-Br2 is frequently overexpressed in both cancer cell lines and multiple human tumors. Clinicopathologic correlation indicates that overexpression of TRIP-Br2 in hepatocellular carcinoma is associated with a worse clinical outcome by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.

To date, the E2F family of proteins has been shown to be involved in the regulation of genes whose expression is pivotal for normal cell cycle progression and numerous other cellular processes such as DNA repair, programmed cell death and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The TRIP-Br/SERTAD (henceforth referred to as TRIP-Br) family of novel mammalian transcriptional coregulators has recently been shown to modulate E2F-dependent transcriptional activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Family members include TRIP-Br1/p34<sup>SEI-1</sup>/SERTAD1/SEI-1 (henceforth referred to as TRIP-Br1), TRIP-Br2/SERTAD2/SEI-2 (henceforth referred to as TRIP-Br2), TRIP-Br3/HEPP/CDCA4/SEI-3 (henceforth referred to as TRIP-Br3), RBT1 (Replication Protein A Binding Transactivator 1)/SERTAD3 (henceforth referred to as RBT1) and the recently-identified SERTAD4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In addition, the TRIP-Br homolog in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, TARANIS (TARA), was identified in a screen for functional partners of the homeotic loci and was shown to represent a novel member of the trithorax group (trxG) of regulatory proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Members of the TRIP-Br protein family possess three key regions that we have previously coined TRIP-homology domains (THD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. THD1 contains a cyclin A-binding motif (including a conserved nuclear localization signal, KRK) at the amino terminal, followed by heptad repeats that have been shown to be essential for protein-protein interactions. THD2 consists of one or more PEST signals rich in proline, serine and threonine residues, while THD3 harbors a novel PHD zinc finger- and/or bromodomain-interacting motif and an acidic transactivation domain at its carboxyl-terminus. The heptad repeats in THD1 have been shown to be conserved in the TRIP-Br family and were renamed as the SERTA (<bold>SE</bold>I-1, <bold>R</bold>BT1 and <bold>TA</bold>RA) domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. It has been further shown that most of the SERTA domain in TRIP-Br1 consists of a cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4)-binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p><italic>TRIP-Br1 </italic>and <italic>RBT1 </italic>have recently been shown to be localized in tandem within a 19q13 amplicon frequently found in human tumors, consistent with their putative role as oncogenes that promote tumor growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Indeed, cytogenetic studies have revealed a gain of chromosomal region 19q13.1-13.2 in more than 30% of ovarian carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] as well as a variety of other tumors including pancreatic carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and lung cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Although <italic>TRIP-Br1 </italic>has been further demonstrated to be amplified and overexpressed in several ovarian cancer cell lines as well as in ovarian carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], the association of <italic>RBT1 </italic>amplification to human cancers remains elusive. As a proof-of-principle that at least a subset of the <italic>TRIP-Br </italic>gene family consists of novel protooncogenes that play important roles in cellular proliferation and human cancer, the knockdown of <italic>TRIP-Br1 </italic>or <italic>RBT1 </italic>in cultured cell lines has been shown to reduce cell growth and colony formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Apart from their role as coactivators in the stimulation of E2F-dependent transcription, the corepressor function of TRIP-Br proteins has also been described. Overexpression of TRIP-Br1 has been found to suppress CREB-mediated transcription and this suppression could be overcome by ectopic overexpression of CBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In addition, <italic>TRIP-Br3 </italic>has been recently identified as a novel E2F-responsive gene and as a repressor of E2F-dependent transcriptional activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>While most of the TRIP-Br family members have recently been extensively characterized and shown to be involved in a variety of important cellular processes including E2F-mediated cell cycle progression, p53-dependent stress response and cancer pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], the physiological role of TRIP-Br2 in mammalian cells remains poorly understood and its direct link to cancer pathogenesis has not been established. We previously reported that transcriptional downregulation of <italic>TRIP-Br2 </italic>in primary cell lines, achieved through DNA enzyme knockdown or global knockout strategies, results in cellular proliferation arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In the present study, we have validated the oncogenic potential of TRIP-Br2. Overexpression of TRIP-Br2 resulted in the upregulation of E2F-mediated transcription, the transformation of NIH3T3 fibroblasts and the promotion of tumor growth in athymic nude mice. We further performed high-throughput expression profiling of TRIP-Br2 in comprehensive human tumor tissue microarrays and showed that TRIP-Br2 is frequently overexpressed in cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Analysis of TRIP-Br2 gene structural organization, prediction of TRIP-Br2 protein subcellular localization and in silico profiling of TRIP-Br2 gene expression</title><p>The gene structural organization of human <italic>TRIP-Br2 </italic>was analyzed by NCBI Entrez Gene, NCBI AceView and BLAST/ClustalW <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/"/>.

Transformed cellular phenotypes were associated with dysregulation of the E2F/DP-transcriptional pathway through upregulation of a subset of key E2F-responsive genes, such as <italic>CYCLIN E</italic>, <italic>CYCLIN A2, CDC6 </italic>and <italic>DHFR</italic>. Furthermore, we have shown in our knockdown/knockout and overexpression studies that <italic>CYCLIN E </italic>is indeed a TRIP-Br-coregulated gene. Ongoing microarray studies will help us to identify other candidate TRIP-Br-coregulated genes and to establish the mechanism by which TRIP-Br proteins promote growth and tumor progression.</p><p>As overexpression of TRIP-Br2 resulted in the transformation of NIH3T3 fibroblasts, we hypothesized that TRIP-Br2 expression is dysregulated in human cancer. We found TRIP-Br2 to be overexpressed in many cancer cell lines and observed its localization to the nucleus. We subsequently showed that TRIP-Br2 was also overexpressed in many human cancers, including prostate carcinoma, squamous cell lung carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, ovarian cystadenocarcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, osteosarcoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. Notably, we observed that the expression pattern of TRIP-Br2 in these multiple human tumors <italic>in vivo </italic>matched that observed in cultured cells originally derived from these tumors. For instance, in both osteosarcoma tissues and U2OS cells, TRIP-Br2 was overexpressed and localized to the nucleus. No nuclear presence and little or no cytoplasmic expression of TRIP-Br2 were observed in normal prostate, lung, breast, gastric, ovary, colon, skin or kidney sections (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). These data demonstrate that TRIP-Br2 is frequently and highly expressed in tumors, but not in the corresponding normal tissues and suggests that TRIP-Br2 expression and localization may be dysregulated in tumors. We have also observed overexpression of TRIP-Br2 in the cytoplasm of a small subset of these tumor specimens (data not shown), suggesting that TRIP-Br2 may perform novel functions in the cytoplasm and/or intracellular organelles to support oncogenesis in these tumor subsets. Collectively, our data suggest that <italic>TRIP-Br2 </italic>is a <italic>bona-fide </italic>protooncogene and that its overexpression may be associated with poor prognosis in human cancers, as demonstrated in the case of hepatocellular carcinoma.</p><p>We envisage that the mechanism of overexpression of TRIP-Br proteins may exist at the post-translational level in human cancers and may involve dysregulation of protein turnover. Indeed, we have recently shown that mutation of leucine residue 238 of the highly conserved nuclear export signal (NES) motif of TRIP-Br2 led to the nuclear entrapment of TRIP-Br2 and abolished it protein turnover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Ongoing high-throughput DNA sequencing of the corresponding human tumor samples identified in our TMA immunoscreen will help us to identify novel disease-inducing mutations in the coding sequence, and the 5' and 3' regulatory regions of TRIP-Br2. We further validated the potential of <italic>TRIP-Br2 </italic>as a novel transcription-based chemotherapeutic target for human cancers by demonstrating that siRNA knockdown of <italic>TRIP-Br2 </italic>inhibited cell-autonomous growth of serum-deprived HCT-116 cells. Notably, we have also shown that antagonism of the TRIP-Br integrator function by synthetic decoy peptides, which compete with TRIP-Br for binding to PHD zinc finger- and/or bromodomain-containing proteins, arrests proliferation and induces caspase-3-independent sub-diploidization in cancer cells <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>In summary, we have identified TRIP-Br2 as a novel protooncogene that is aberrantly overexpressed in human cancers. By making use of a comprehensive and high-throughput tissue microarray technology, we were able to advance rapidly from experimental validation of the protooncogenic role of TRIP-Br2 to identifying its value in translational medicine for the potential treatment of a wide variety of human cancers.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>All authors have read and approval the final manuscript.
