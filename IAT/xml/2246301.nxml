As a consequence, living systems have to adapt to environmental conditions by adjusting their physiology accordingly. Chemicals from natural sources or manmade pollution can represent rather adverse environmental conditions with a fatal outcome if the organism fails to adapt. It is a well-established fact that xenobiotics such as dioxin or cadmium can induce changes in gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The responsive genes include adaptive genes that are involved in detoxification or protection against oxidative or other cellular stresses and may also comprise genes that are directly responsible for the fatal effects of the toxicants. The early life stages of vertebrates are generally the most susceptible to adverse chemical impact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Yet we do not have a detailed picture of the transcriptional response profiles of these early life stages.</p><p>There is a high demand by regulators and industry for reliable and ethically acceptable methods to evaluate the developmental toxicity of pharmaceuticals, industrial chemicals and waste products. For example, several tens of thousands of chemicals need to be assessed within the European Union REACH (Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals) initiative for the safety testing and risk assessment of chemicals in the next years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Cheap and reliable alternative methods are needed to cope with this enormous screening effort.</p><p>Toxicogenomics is a powerful tool for studies of toxicological mechanisms and for the detection of toxicity profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] as it allows the simultaneous assessment of thousands of genes. To obtain the full potential of toxicogenomics for the evaluation of developmental toxicity, however, animal systems have to be used. The zebrafish embryo is a vertebrate system with great merits for this undertaking. The zebrafish was introduced more than two decades ago as a model to study development and neurobiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In parallel, the zebrafish embryo has evolved into a model for studies of chemical impact: it permits efficient compound screens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and is, for example, used in a standardized assay for sewage testing in Germany, replacing traditional toxicological tests with adult fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Given the experimental advantages such as small size of the embryo, cheap maintenance, availability of a genome sequence and many mutants, the zebrafish embryo is one of the most promising vertebrate systems for studies of toxicological mechanisms and toxicogenomics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Most assays using zebrafish, however, rely on morphological endpoints, which display little discrimination between different toxicants.</p><p>Expression profiling has just recently entered zebrafish research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and only a few toxicogenomic studies exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Dioxin (TCDD) impairs fin regeneration in adult zebrafish, and expression profiling revealed TCDD-induced changes in the expression of genes involved in extracellular matrix formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Exposure of zebrafish to arsenic leads to changes in gene expression in adult zebrafish liver very similar to those reported for mammals, suggesting damage to protein and DNA and increased oxidative stress in the livers of arsenic-treated animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In another pilot study, zebrafish embryos were exposed to the reference compound 3,4-dichloroaniline and seven genes were significantly regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Despite these advances, however, it is not known whether there are different responses to different toxicants and at different developmental stages. Would different toxic chemicals induce different genomic profiles, which might even be diagnostic for particular toxicants, or does the genome of the embryo respond in a general stress response. Would the sensitivity of whole-embryo exposure experiments be high enough to detect responses of genes that are restricted to small numbers of cells?</p><p>We established the toxicogenomic profiles of 11 toxicants. The gene-expression patterns induced by the 11 toxicants are related but sufficiently different to recognize toxicant-specific profiles and developmental stage-specific gene responses were also evident. Moreover, we could detect gene-expression changes at concentrations that do not have phenotypic consequences. We found synergistic effects when a mixture of compounds was applied at low doses, suggesting that the genomic response provides a more sensitive readout than morphological effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Model compounds cause similar teratological and toxic effects in zebrafish embryos</title><p>We chose 11 model compounds, namely methylmercury chloride (MeHg), CdCl<sub>2 </sub>(Cd), PbCl2 (Pb), As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>(As), Aroclor 1254 (PCB), acrylamide (AA), tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ), 4-chloroaniline (4CA), 1,1-bis-(4-chlorophenyl)2,2,2-trichloroethane (DDT), 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and valproic acid (VA). These are compounds known for their environmental toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and VA is a teratogen and an anti-epileptic drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. VA is known to inhibit histone deacetylases and Wnt signaling in mammals, thus adding an additional mode of toxic action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>We first established exposure protocols with which one can trigger toxicogenomic alterations with high likelihood and at the same time cause only a small amount of cell death or embryo mortality. We limited the exposure time to 20-24 hours in the expectation of focusing predominantly on primary responses rather than indirect, secondary effects. Finally, we decided to carry out these assays in embryos before they begin to feed, that is, before 120 hours post-fertilization (hpf). We tested a range of toxicant concentrations to determine the one that caused a morphologically visible toxic/teratological effect in the treated embryos after exposure at 96-120 hpf (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, Additional data file 1). We were not able to discriminate unequivocally between toxicant-specific morphological effects (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Frequently the tails were bent, and the animals had difficulty swimming correctly; in some instances they developed pericardial edema (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). Vehicle-treated embryos did not show alterations (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1l-n</xref>) or did so only at very low frequency. Cell death as monitored by acridine orange staining was not, or only rarely, obvious immediately after treatment when animals were sacrificed for microarray analysis.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Toxicants induce similar morphological changes in 120 hpf zebrafish embryos.

This may be due to the fact that different toxicants caused similar gene effects at 24 hpf. For example, the expression of the gene for fast muscle troponin T (BE693169) was downregulated by Cd, MeHg, TCDD, and VA in embryos treated between 4 and 24 hpf but not at later stages (data not shown). Furthermore, many genes that are involved in organ physiology may not yet be responsive by 24 hpf, as organ development has not proceeded far enough. In agreement with this, the expression levels of only 57 genes were significantly altered by the 4-24 hpf treatment. In contrast, the expression levels of 476 and 311 genes were significantly affected by the 24-48 hpf and 96-120 hpf treatment regimens, respectively (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). Moreover, very few genes in the 4-24 hpf treatment set overlapped with the 24-48 and 96-120 hpf treatment groups (15 and 10 genes, respectively). The latter groups (24-48 h and 96-120 hpf) shared more gene responses (74 genes) but 393 and 233 gene responses were stage specific (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). The smaller number of affected genes in the 4-24 hpf regimen may also have been caused by the lower concentrations of toxicants that we had to apply to ensure sufficient survival at these younger stages. Irrespective of this, these data indicate a high stage specificity of the toxicogenomic effects in the three treatment windows.</p></sec><sec><title>The toxicogenomic responses triggered by different toxicants are highly specific</title><p>We focused further analysis on the 96-120 hpf stage and used the full set of 11 toxicants by including treatments with AA, PCB, As, tBHQ and Pb. Replicate hybridizations with mRNA from at least three independent toxicant treatments were performed (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Toxicant effects were clustered based on their Euclidean distance to each other and the similarity of gene responses was determined by a Pearson correlation proximity measure. The expression profiles summarize clustering results for a subset of 199 genes across all 11 toxicant responses (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The gene-selection criteria applied take into account the extent and significance of changes in gene expression (at least twofold, <italic>p</italic><sub>adj </sub>&#x0003c; 0.025) as well as differences and similarities in expression changes between toxicants (see Materials and methods). Distinct patterns of gene expression were noted for each of the 11 compounds. However, similarities in gene responses were also detected. One group of chemicals with related gene responses comprises Pb, As, Cd, tBHQ, MeHg and VA (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, lanes 6 to 11). Another subgroup of related responses was induced by TCDD, 4CA, DDT and AA (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, lanes 2-5), whereas the PCB triggered a more distinct expression profile (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, lane 1).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Toxicants induce highly specific toxicogenomic profiles.

Fourteen out of the 15 chemicals were unambiguously identified (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). In the case of 4CA, close matches were scored to the 4CA, the DDT and the AA response profiles (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Thus, we identified the correct group of chemicals (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, lanes 2-4). Taken together, the results from these blind trials underscore the reliability of the toxicogenomic profiles and furthermore suggest that it is possible to derive signatures of toxicogenomic responses

In summary, these <italic>in situ </italic>expression studies show that the microarray procedure used permits detection of organ- and cell-specific gene responses with very high sensitivity. Moreover, these results also suggest that the gene responses occur in almost all of the embryos exposed to the toxicants.</p></sec><sec><title>The genome responds to very low toxicant concentrations</title><p>The concentrations of the toxicants were adjusted in the initial experiments so that they caused morphologically visible defects in exposed animals. We asked next whether one could measure changes in the expression profiles at lower concentrations that do not have apparent morphological effects. TCDD, DDT, Cd, 4CA, MeHg, and VA were used as a set of test compounds. We could detect significant changes in gene expression (at least twofold and <italic>p</italic><sub>adj </sub>&#x0003c; 0.025) in response to 0.5 mg/l Cd, 6 &#x003bc;g/l MeHg, 5 mg/l VA, 25 mg/l 4CA, 15 mg/l DDT, and 50 ng/l TCDD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a-c</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">6</xref>, and data not shown). With the exception of 6 &#x003bc;g/l MeHg and 25 mg/l 4CA, these low concentrations did not cause obvious morphological or behavioral defects (data not shown), suggesting that this assay can detect responses to toxicant concentrations that do not cause acute morphological effects. It is clear, however, that the number of genes with a significant response to the toxicants decreases (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">6</xref>). Cytochrome P4501a1 was fivefold upregulated by 50 ng/l TCDD, oncomodulin A was reduced 4.5-fold by 0.5 mg/l Cd and peroxiredoxin was still 3.5-fold induced by 6 &#x003bc;g/l MeHg. Thus, even though fewer genes respond to these lower concentrations, the measured changes in transcript levels are robust.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>The concentration dependence of toxicogenomic responses and the synergistic effects of low doses. <bold>(a-c) </bold>Embryos were exposed to decreasing concentrations of Cd (a, lane 1, 5 mg/l: lane 2, 2.5 mg/l; lane 3, 0.5 mg/l), or MeHg (b, lane 1, 60 &#x003bc;g/l; lane 2, 30 &#x003bc;g/l; lane 3, 6 &#x003bc;g/l) or TCDD (c, lane 1, 500 ng/l; lane 2, 250 ng/l; lane 3, 50 ng/l).

The components of these mixtures could act synergistically, thereby potentiating the toxic effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. We therefore investigated whether synergistic effects of compound mixtures can be observed in toxicogenomic profiles. To this end, 96-hpf embryos were exposed to a mixture of low concentrations of Cd (50 &#x003bc;g/l), Pb (280 &#x003bc;g/l), MeHg (6 &#x003bc;g/l) and As (7.9 mg/l). About twice as many genes (158 genes) were significantly up- or downregulated (absolute change at least twofold, <italic>p</italic><sub>adj </sub>&#x0003c; 0.025) than the sum of the genes regulated by exposure to the individual toxicants (81 genes: Cd 48 genes; As 12 genes; MeHg 5 genes; Pb 16 genes). Complex expression profiles composed of both additive and synergistic as well as novel patterns of gene responses (at least twofold change, <italic>p</italic><sub>adj </sub>&#x0003c; 0.025; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6d</xref>) were scored for the mixture. In the case of the genes with similarity to peroxiredoxin (BI980610) or the solute carrier family members 6 and 9 (BE016639, AW421040), the response to the mixture appears to be purely additive (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6d</xref>, dots; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">6</xref>, and Additional data file 13). In other instances, for example the Hsp70-related genes (AB062116, AF210640, AF006007) or the sequestosome1 gene (AW343560), the mixture induced a strong increase in transcript levels, whereas significant gene responses (more than twofold, <italic>p</italic><sub>adj </sub>&#x0003c; 0.025) were not induced by administration of the individual compounds (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6d</xref>, arrowheads, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">6</xref>, Additional data file 13). These genes can, however, be induced by higher concentrations of the individual compounds (see Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a,b</xref> and Additional data files 10, 11), suggesting that the observed synergy is the result of a lowered response threshold. Curiously, we also noted loss of gene responses on exposure to the compound mixture (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6d</xref>), suggesting suppressive effects of the combination. For example, the transcript levels of glutathione-<italic>S</italic>-transferase omega 1 (AW019036) are significantly altered by exposure to PbCl<sub>2</sub>, but not by the mixture (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> and Additional data file 13). In a few instances we observed opposing effects, such as in the case of suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (BI878700), which was 4.9-fold downregulated by As and 2.6-fold upregulated by the mixture (see Additional data file 13). Taken together, these results show potentiated, additive, and nonadditive effects of the mixture in comparison to the individual compounds.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We have shown that a diverse set of 11 chemicals induces highly specific gene responses in the zebrafish embryo. Moreover, synergy effects and responses to low-dose exposure were detectable in the genome-wide transcriptional response. Our work provides proof of principle that the zebrafish embryo can serve as a specific and highly sensitive whole-animal model to monitor the toxicogenomic impact of chemicals.</p><p>Although vertebrate cell lines and other <italic>in vitro </italic>test methods have great merits in assessing toxicological effects of drugs and pollutants, they cannot replace whole animal test systems entirely. The classical animal models such as mice, rats and rabbits are expensive and attract concerns from animal-rights groups. Zebrafish embryos before the feeding stage offer a cheap and ethically acceptable vertebrate model that will not only be useful in the toxicological assessment of the tens of thousands of compounds to be tested under the REACH program but can also help to evaluate the developmental toxicity of novel compounds at an early stage of drug development.</p><p>The requirement for adequate animal models for assessing developmental toxicology is further underscored by the remarkable stage dependence of the observed toxicogenomic profiles. These differences in gene responses are likely to be a reflection of the dynamics of cell differentiation and morphogenesis, which will be impossible to model in all their aspects in cell culture and other <italic>in vitro </italic>systems. The differences in gene responses were particularly striking at early stages, presumably reflecting the fact that many organs exist only as rudiments at these times and have not fully acquired their physiological function. It is also possible that the inter-embryonic variability of the gene responses is higher at this stage, blurring the gene-expression changes in the pooled cDNA.</p><p>Previous work showed that the sensitivity of the zebrafish embryo to toxicants equals that of the commonly used tests on adult freshwater fish, allowing a reliable prediction of the toxic potential of chemicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The embryonic DarT assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] uses an exposure paradigm from cleavage stages to 48 hpf and relies on a set of morphological endpoints and lethality. Morphological readouts provide little discrimination between the effects of different compounds, especially in the case of environmental toxicants with a broad spectrum of toxic effects on the embryo. In marked contrast to the morphological endpoints, we found highly specific patterns of transcriptional changes, resulting in barcode-like patterns of gene responses. With one exception, we were able to predict the chemical unequivocally by its pattern of induced gene-expression changes. In most cases, these patterns are related, forming distinct subgroups of profiles, but are still sufficiently different from one another to discriminate the individual compounds.</p><p>Strikingly, a general response to oxidative stress or protein damage does not seem to exist in the zebrafish embryo. A number of the chemicals (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>) induced genes involved in the cellular systems that combat the effects of oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. However, the induced oxidative-stress genes differed between chemicals, suggesting toxicant-specific effects (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). A similar observation was made with respect to chaperones (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). The tissue-specific expression of these genes as well as restricted tissue effects of the toxicant may be important in this context. For example, the expression of the thioredoxin-like gene is restricted to a small number of neurons in the brain. In <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization experiments, strong elevation of thioredoxin-like mRNA levels in response to Cd and MeHg was also noticed in the hair cells of the lateral line as well as in the brain. The differences in the type of induced defense genes and their tissue-restricted expression suggest tissue-specific effects of the different toxicants.</p><p>Another Gene Ontology (GO) group that is differentially regulated by exposure to a number of toxicants is represented by members of the solute carrier (SLC) family (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>). These transmembrane proteins have key roles in the transport of small molecules including neurotransmitters across vesicular and plasma membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. It is tempting to speculate that the specific downregulation of the GABA transporter SCL6 member 1 by VA (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>) may be related to the therapeutic effect of VA as a suppressor of epileptic seizures.</p><p>The concentrations that elicited toxicogenomic responses are in the range of pollutant levels prevailing in the environment. We did not, however, exclude the possibility that compounds accumulate in the embryo, resulting in higher intra-embryonic concentrations than in the environment. Toxicogenomic responses were triggered by TCDD, Cd, DDT, and VA at concentrations that did not cause changes in morphology. Thus the genomic response appears to be more sensitive to toxic insult than is morphogenesis. A crucial question is whether the gene responses that are not obviously correlated with pathological alterations are indeed deleterious to the animal. For example, TCDD was shown to induce a battery of genes in the mouse paw (including homologs of genes we scored in our study) without obvious teratological consequences to paw development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Future work will need to address whether the low-level effects on gene expression could be correlated with, and hence used to predict, chronic effects of long-term exposure.</p><p>The lowest concentration of MeHg (6 &#x003bc;g/l) triggered significant changes in gene expression. In addition, we also noted teratological effects on movement and tail development at these concentrations (L.Y. and J.R.K., unpublished work), indicating that low concentrations of MeHg are acutely toxic in the zebrafish embryo. Disturbingly, blood serum levels of MeHg in humans can be in the same concentration range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The zebrafish embryo may be much more susceptible to MeHg, but defining blood serum levels that are regarded as safe in humans is an active area of research.</p><p>Application of a mixture of MeHg, Cd, As, and Pb at low concentrations resulted in synergistic effects with more than additive numbers of genes affected and also novel patterns of gene-expression changes. Clearly, some of the genes affected by exposure to the mixture would be induced or repressed by higher concentrations of the individual chemicals. Examples are the thioredoxin and Hsp70 genes. Thus, it appears that the threshold at which induction occurs is lowered. This agrees with previous studies of mixture effects that support the notion of 'concentration addition', in which a component of the mixture can be replaced by an equipotent concentration of another compound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The patterns of gene-expression changes induced individually by the four chemicals differed, however, suggesting that other effects have to be taken into account that cannot be explained by an additive mechanism of action.</p><p>Expression levels of genes, and presumably also responses to environmental toxicants, can vary dramatically between individuals. In a systematic study of variation in gene expression in natural populations of fish of the genus <italic>Fundulus</italic>, significant differences in gene expression were noted in 18% of the 907 genes analyzed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In this respect, zebrafish embryos have a big advantage over mammalian systems as one can easily obtain large numbers of embryos and can thus average the individual gene responses by using pooled cDNA prepared from many embryos. In the cases where we confirmed the gene responses by <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization, we found that most individuals showed the expected upregulation, suggesting that many of the observed responses have a high penetrance.</p><p>While the complete development outside of the mother and the transparency of the zebrafish embryos are certainly important advantages for observation, the small size of the embryos limits the possibility of dissecting particular organs for toxicogenomic analysis. To overcome these limitations, one can use transgenic animals expressing green fluorescent protein and fluorescence-activated cell sorting to enrich for particular cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Moreover, even whole-embryo exposure protocols as we used here permit detection of highly tissue-restricted gene responses such as those seen, for example, in the lateral line, which comprises only a very small fraction of the whole embryo.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The induction of the Hsp70 gene was previously shown to be a sensitive biomarker in zebrafish for exposure to Cd and other heavy metals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The work presented here adds a long list of other highly sensitive biomarkers to be developed as transgenic biosensors. We believe that the zebrafish could become a key model for molecular developmental toxicology. Functional studies of TCDD toxicity in the zebrafish embryo well illustrate this (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]). Forward genetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], targeting-induced local lesions in genomes (TILLING) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], morpholino knockdown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], transgenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and <italic>in situ </italic>expression studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] at cellular resolution represent a powerful technical repertoire for dissecting toxicological pathways. Moreover, a large number of developmental mutants have been isolated, some of which may serve as direct targets for drugs and toxicants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. We believe that the work on the toxicogenomics of zebrafish embryos reported here is a fundamental contribution to the use of the zebrafish embryo as a model system for molecular developmental toxicology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Chemicals and embryo treatment</title><p>AA (acrylamide; CH<sub>2 </sub>= CHCONH<sub>2</sub>), PCB (Aroclor 1254), As (arsenic (III) oxide; As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), tBHQ (tert-butylhydroquinone; (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>CC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>3</sub>-1,4-(OH)<sub>2</sub>), Cd (cadmium chloride; CdCl<sub>2</sub>2H<sub>2</sub>O), 4CA (4-chloroaniline; ClC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>), DDT (1,1-bis-(4-chlorphenyl)-2,2,2-trichlorethane; ClC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CHCCl<sub>3</sub>), Pb (lead (II) chloride; PbCl<sub>2</sub>), MeHg (methylmercury chloride; CH<sub>3</sub>ClHg), TCDD (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin) and VA (valproic acid; CH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO).</p><p>Wild-type zebrafish strains AB, ABO and T&#x000fc;bingen were kept and bred as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].

In contrast, proximity between two genes is derived as the arc cosine transformed Pearson correlation coefficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>].</p><p>GO analysis of toxicant-affected genes was carried out by extracting the human homologs from the Zebrafish Chip Annotation Database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. The GO trees and categories were established with the web-based GoTreeMachine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. The number of genes with significant alterations in expression levels in response to TCDD, DDT, and AA were too few to be analyzed by GoTreeMachine.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression analysis</title><p><italic>In situ </italic>hybridization and RT-PCR were carried out using standard procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. The sequences of the primers used in RT-PCR are listed in Additional data file 14. Embryos and RNA samples were derived from independent toxicant exposures. Cell death was monitored by acridine orange staining and examination by fluorescence microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Additional data files</title><p>Additional data is available online with this paper.
