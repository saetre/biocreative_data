This process is based on the capability of the HSC to replenish itself through a process called self-renewal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and to differentiate into all hematopoietic lineages. Consequently, analysis of the mechanisms underlying HSC self-renewal and differentiation is fundamental for understanding the maintenance of the normal hematopoietic system. At present, our knowledge of these processes on the molecular and cellular level is limited, since studies on HSCs are hampered by their low abundance in hematopoietic organs and are thus difficult to access in sufficiently large quantities for direct studies. An increase in the number of HSCs occurs under normal physiological conditions in the liver during embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], indicating that the microenvironment in the fetal liver efficiently promotes self-renewal of HSCs. Elucidation of the mechanisms responsible for the expansion of the hematopoietic system during embryonic development might therefore offer insights into the mechanisms of self-renewal in the hematopoietic system.</p><p>The expansion of the hematopoietic system is intimately connected with the development of the liver, suggesting over-lapping molecular mechanisms of these processes. Liver development in the mouse is initiated at embryonic day 8 (E8) when a distinct region of the ventral foregut endoderm receives inductive signals from two adjacent tissues, the septum transversum mesenchyme and the pre-cardiac mesoderm [reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]]. Ventral foregut endodermal cells committed to hepatic fate proliferate and form a liver bud from which hepatoblasts migrate and intermingle with cells of the septum transversum mesenchyme. The mesenchymal cells originating from the septum transversum thereby contribute to the mesenchymal part of the liver, and development into a functional organ relies on continuous interactions between the mesenchymal and endodermal portions of the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. At E10 the liver has become a distinct organ with discernible lobes and is infiltrated by numerous hematopoietic cells and cells with HSC properties can be detected in the liver by E11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Members of the LIM-homeodomain transcription factor family play critical roles during embryonic development in both vertebrates and invertebrates by controlling processes such as asymmetric cell division, tissue specification and differentiation of specific cell types [reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]]. One member of this family, <italic>Lhx2</italic>, is of particular interest, based on its function in the development of several different tissues via mesenchymal-epithelial interactions and regulation of stem/progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. <italic>Lhx2 </italic>is expressed in the liver-associated septum transversum mesenchyme that becomes an integral part of the liver and its expression is maintained during liver development until adult stage in hepatic stellate cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. <italic>Lhx2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos display a decreased size of the liver manifested already at E10.5, suggesting that <italic>Lhx2 </italic>is required for expansion of the fetal liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The mutant phenotype is due to the presence of activated hepatic stellate cells causing a fibrotic and disorganized liver containing phenotypically abnormal endodermal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The mesenchymal defect in the liver of <italic>Lhx2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice cause a lethal anemia, which is cell non-autonomous since the <italic>Lhx2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>hematopoietic cells appears to be normal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], suggesting that the mutant microenvironment is unable to support hematopoietic development. These observations indicate that <italic>Lhx2 </italic>expression in hepatic stellate cells is involved in mesenchymal-epithelial cell interactions important for liver expansion, organization, differentiation and formation of the hematopoietic microenvironment in the fetal liver.</p><p>To further elucidate the putative role of Lhx2 in the hematopoietic system we ectopically expressed Lhx2 in hematopoietic progenitor/stem cells derived from embryonic stem (ES) cells differentiated <italic>in vitro </italic>and from adult bone marrow (BM) cells. This approach allowed for the generation of immortalized multipotent and Steel factor-dependent hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The HPC lines share several characteristics with normal HSCs such as response to specific cytokines/growth factors, expression of transcription factors and interactions with stromal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The pattern of cell surface markers expressed by HPC lines derived from ES cells and adult BM is similar to that of early fetal and adult HSCs, respectively. The HPC lines derived from adult BM can generate erythroid, myeloid and lymphoid cells following transplantation into lethally irradiated recipients, and can long-term engraft stem cell-deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The cells engrafting the stem cell-deficient mice maintain high level of expression of <italic>Lhx2 in vivo</italic>, which eventually leads to a chronic myeloproliferative disorder resembling human chronic myeloid leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Thus, ectopic Lhx2 expression in hematopoietic cells allows for the generation of HSC-like cell lines, and molecular analyses of these HSC-like cell lines would give information of the role of Lhx2-induced self-renewal of HSCs, and hence novel insights into stem cell physiology and pathology.</p><p>In order to elucidate the molecular basis of <italic>Lhx2</italic>-induced self-renewal of HSCs we generated HSC-like cell lines from ES cells differentiated <italic>in vitro </italic>with <italic>Lhx2 </italic>expression controlled by a tetracycline-responsive element, and hence dependent on the presence of the tetracycline-analogue doxycyclin (dox) in the culture media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. These dox-dependent hematopoietic progenitor cell (DoxHPC) lines down-regulate <italic>Lhx2 </italic>expression almost two orders of magnitude within 24 hrs after dox withdrawal, leading to rapid differentiation into various myeloid cell types. We used the DoxHPC lines to analyse <italic>Lhx2 </italic>function by comparing global gene expression in the presence of dox to different time points after dox withdrawal using cDNA array technology. This approach identified 267 genes differentially expressed at all time points, and thus putatively involved in <italic>Lhx2 </italic>function in stem cell self-renewal and / or differentiation, and during organ development.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Generation of HPC lines from the ES cells with inducible <italic>Lhx2 </italic>expression</title><p>Previously, when generating HPC lines, we used ES cells transduced with retroviral vectors containing <italic>Lhx2 </italic>cDNA that were subsequently differentiated <italic>in vitro </italic>into embryoid bodies (EBs). The HPC lines were established by expanding progenitor cells expressing <italic>Lhx2 </italic>present in colonies showing a distinct morphology that appeared in the clonal assays of EB cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. A similar approach was used here, however, since we were unable to identify distinct colonies in the clonal assays containing dox (probably due to the efficient up-regulation of <italic>Lhx2 </italic>expression in all cells), 96 colonies generated in the factor combination supplemented with dox were randomly picked and expanded individually in medium containing SF, IL-6 and dox. Stable doxycyclin-dependent hematopoietic progenitor cell (DoxHPC) lines could be established from 66 (69%) of these 96 colonies. The pattern of cell surface marker expression was similar to that previously reported for the HPC lines generated from day 6 EBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], e.g. c-kit<sup>+</sup>/CD45<sup>+</sup>/CD41<sup>+</sup>/Sca-1<sup>-</sup>/Lin<sup>- </sup>(data not shown). All DoxHPC lines expressed <italic>Lhx2 </italic>and transcription of <italic>Lhx2 </italic>was efficiently down-regulated (&#x0003e;90%) within 24 hours after dox withdrawal and was undetectable after 72 hours (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). In the DoxHPC7 line where GFP was linked to <italic>Lhx2 </italic>expression, flow cytometry analyses revealed similar instantaneous and efficient down-regulation of GFP expression after dox withdrawal (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Rapid cellular changes appeared immediately after dox withdrawal with respect to differentiation status and fraction of apoptotic cells. The fraction of apoptotic cells increased from a background level of 5% (cells in the presence of dox) to a maximum of 35% five days after dox withdrawal. The fraction of apoptotic cells decreased thereafter to background level within ten days after dox withdrawal (data not shown). Under these culture conditions (SF+IL-6 without dox), differentiation into various myeloid cells such as neutrophilic granulocytes, macrophages and megakaryocytes, could usually be observed after 4&#x02013;5 days (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>), with concomitant up-regulation of lineage specific cell surface markers (data not shown). Although the distribution of the various myeloid cells differed between different DoxHPC lines after dox withdrawal, all DoxHPC lines maintained in SF+IL-6 without dox generated mast cells and beyond eight days this cell type dominated the cultures (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). Immature hematopoietic progenitor cells can functionally interact with stromal cells <italic>in vitro </italic>by generating cobblestone areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] in long-term bone marrow culture) and are referred to as cobblestone area forming cells (CAFCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. We have previously shown that the HPC lines derived from ES cells differentiated <italic>in vitro </italic>efficiently generated cobblestone areas when seeded onto stromal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The DoxHPC lines only formed cobblestone areas when seeded onto stromal cells in the presence of dox (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), whereas rapid differentiation into macrophages occurred in the absence of dox (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Thus, this is a reproducible and efficient system amenable for global gene expression analyses comparing <italic>Lhx2</italic><sup>+ </sup>stem cells to their immediate <italic>Lhx2</italic><sup>- </sup>progeny.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of gene expression changes caused by down-regulation of <italic>Lhx2</italic></title><p>We used cDNA microarray technology to investigate the genome-wide transcriptional effects of down-regulation of <italic>Lhx2 </italic>expression in the DoxHPC1 and DoxHPC7 lines. Gene expression at 36, 72 and 96 hours after dox withdrawal were analysed to elucidate differential gene expression early after <italic>Lhx2 </italic>down-regulation, but prior to the time point when the majority of the cells are committed myeloid cells. The hybridizations were carried out using the design depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>. The number of features that remained on each array after filtering was high (82&#x02013;92%) and the majority of the excluded features were removed by the first filtering step (i.e. GenePix and manual flagging).</p><p>We used an empirical Bayes moderated t-test to identify differential gene expression. Genes with a false-discovery rate adjusted p-value lower than 0.01 were considered differentially expressed. However, several of these showed small fold-changes, and therefore only genes with an absolute M-value higher than 0.4 (corresponds to a 1.3-fold difference) were included in further analysis. The results are summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>, and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>. Complete results are available as supplementary data. Comparison of the two independent cultures within each <italic>Lhx2</italic>-expressing cell line at time-point 0 (D-comparisons) indicated no differential expression (data not shown). On the other hand, the comparison between DoxHPC1 and DoxHPC7 lines (E-comparison) indicated that a large number of genes differed in their expression levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). In total, 646 differentially expressed array probes were identified (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">Additional file 2</xref>), which could be further divided into 265 probes (206 genes) with higher expression in DoxHPC1 and 381 probes (295 genes) with higher expression in DoxHPC7. Interestingly, the expression of <italic>Lhx2 </italic>is 2.7-fold higher in DoxHPC1 as compared to DoxHPC7, which may at least partly explain the difference between the cell lines. To identify genes differentially expressed as a consequence of <italic>Lhx2 </italic>down-regulation, we combined the data for DoxHPC1 and DoxHPC7 cell lines. This analysis revealed 463 probes (365 genes) at 36 hours, 695 probes (525 genes) at 72 hours and 699 probes (528 genes) at 96 hours to be differentially expressed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C&#x02013;H</xref>). A large proportion of these genes were differentially expressed at all three time-points (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file 1</xref>). This shared set of 267 genes included 141 down-regulated and 126 up-regulated genes. The array data confirms the dox-dependent regulation of <italic>Lhx2</italic>, as <italic>Lhx2 </italic>is the gene with the largest decrease in expression (down by ~90%) after dox withdrawal (indicated by the arrows in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B&#x02013;H</xref>). Agreement in the M and p-values was observed in cases where several independent probes represented different regions of the same gene (data not shown), further validating the accuracy of the method. Differential expression of 10 down-regulated and 10 up-regulated selected genes was confirmed by using real-time PCR to compare gene expression in the DoxHPC1 line in the presence of dox to three days after dox withdrawal (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><p>Twenty-six of the 337 probes that were differentially expressed at all three time points were not included in UniGene build 144. We used Blast sequence similarity searches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] to annotate the corresponding ESTs and the results are provided in the (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file 1</xref>). Several of the unknowns map to either 5' or 3' UTRs, but also partly to known genes such as <italic>Wbscr5</italic>, <italic>Map3k7</italic>, and <italic>Eifay/Eifax</italic>. Also, one of the probes [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="CX207886">CX207886</ext-link>] has no matches in any public sequence repository. Whether these transcripts correspond to novel genes or novel splice variants of already defined genes remains to be determined.</p></sec><sec><title>Gene Ontology functional analysis of differentially expressed genes</title><p>We used the Gene Ontology classification of the 267 differentially expressed genes for a two-step functional analysis to define the overall Gene Ontology category representation and to identify themes that were over-represented compared to the complete mouse transcriptome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. A Gene Ontology annotation was assigned to approximately 50% of the 141 down-regulated and 126 up-regulated genes. Within the 'Biological processes' branch of Gene Ontology, the largest groups that changed their expression upon <italic>Lhx2 </italic>down-regulation were 'macromolecule metabolism' (20 down-regulated / 42 up-regulated), 'signal transduction (19/20), 'cell growth and/or maintenance' (18/19), 'nucleobase, nucleoside, nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolism' (18/17) and 'biosynthesis' (8/20). A complete listing, which also includes the 'Molecular function' and 'Cellular component' branches of the Gene Ontology classification, is available as Supplementary data (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">Additional file 3</xref>). The themes 'regulation of signal transduction', 'organogenesis' and 'cell death' were significantly over-represented among the down-regulated genes (i.e. self-renewal-specific) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). Several metabolism-related genes were significantly enriched among the up-regulated genes (i.e. differentiation-specific), which was also evident when the data was analysed using the KEGG metabolic pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). Of note is that ten genes encoding components of the glycolytic pathway, including a glucose transporter (<italic>Slc2a3</italic>) and glycogen synthase, are among the genes up-regulated after dox withdrawal (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>), suggesting that this metabolic pathway is important when stem cells are initiating differentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with HSC gene expression signatures</title><p>Global gene expression in murine HSCs has previously been studied using Affymetrix arrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Both studies analysed the transcriptome of HSCs by comparing gene expression in stem cell-enriched populations to that of more differentiated cells (late progenitors and Lin-positive mature blood cells in Ivanova <italic>et al</italic>., and the main cell population of the bone marrow in Ramalho-Santos <italic>et al</italic>.). We compared the genes enriched in these HSCs populations to our list of differentially expressed genes (at UniGene transcript level 275 UniGene clusters correlated to the previously defined 267 differentially expressed genes, where 144 Unigene clusters were down-regulated and 131 were upregulated). In the comparison with the data from Ivanova <italic>et al</italic>. (Signature 1 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>), we divided their dataset into two groups; "HSC and early progenitor-enriched" (groups i-iv in Ivanova <italic>et al</italic>.) or "Late progenitor and mature blood cell-enriched" (groups v-vii). Of our differentially expressed Unigene transcripts 46 overlapped with those in the "HSC and early progenitor-enriched" transcripts and 25 overlapped with those in the "Late progenitor and mature blood cell-enriched" transcripts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). A majority (30 or 65%) of the 46 Unigene transcripts overlapping with the "HSC and early progenitor-enriched" signature were down-regulated after dox withdrawal, and a majority of the transcripts overlapping with the late progenitors (20 genes or 80%) were up-regulated after dox withdrawal. The comparison between the HSC-enriched transcripts from the study by Ramalho-Santos <italic>et al</italic>. (Signature 2 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>) and our set of differentially expressed transcripts showed an overlap of 57 genes. Also in this comparison many transcripts (33, or 58%) were found to be down-regulated after dox withdrawal (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Thirteen genes were found in common between all three studies (Smo, Tes, Upp1, Laptm4b, Slco3a1, Fkbp1a, Itga6, A530057M15Rik, 6430596G11Rik, 1810009M01Rik, 1110004D19Rik, D13Ertd275e, and AA536749).</p><p>Collectively these results show that <italic>Lhx2 </italic>expression partly maintains the HSC signature and hence, the DoxHPC lines with inducible <italic>Lhx2 </italic>expression is a relevant model system for normal HSCs also at the level of global gene expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Genes most affected by <italic>Lhx2 </italic>expression</title><p>The fifty genes that show largest fold-change (up- or down-regulated) after dox withdrawal are presented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>. The list of down-regulated genes contains two members of the serpin family of protease inhibitors, <italic>Serpina3g </italic>and <italic>Serpina3n</italic>, where the former is the most highly differentially expressed gene. In general, serpins are involved in diverse processes such as coagulation, extra cellular matrix degradation, complement activation, fibrinolysis and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The expression pattern of Serpina3n has not been well characterized, but expression of <italic>Serpina3g </italic>is highly enriched in normal HSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], and in the hematopoietic precursor cell line FDCP-Mix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The exact biological function of <italic>Serpina3g </italic>is not known, but has been shown to involve inhibition of caspase-independent cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. This is in agreement with the observed increase in apoptosis after turning <italic>Lhx2 </italic>expression off, which is also reflected by the observation that two pro-apoptotic genes, <italic>Bnip3 </italic>and <italic>Perp </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], are among the 25 most up-regulated genes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Over-expression of <italic>Serpina3g </italic>in FDCP-Mix cells caused delay in differentiation and increased clonogenic potential of these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], suggesting similar function in the <italic>Lhx2 </italic>expressing HPC lines and normal HSCs.</p><p>Most genes encoding enzymes within the glycolytic pathway were up-regulated after <italic>Lhx2 </italic>expression was turned off, but one highly differentially expressed gene within this pathway, <italic>Bpgm </italic>(2,3-bisphosphoglycerate mutase), was an exception as it showed a decrease by 75%. This enzyme is known to be present in erythrocytes where it is involved in the reaction generating the metabolite 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, which is important for the oxygen-hemoglobin interaction.

We therefore wanted to elucidate whether any of the differentially expressed genes, particularly genes that were down-regulated upon dox withdrawal, also were expressed in tissues/organs where <italic>Lhx2 </italic>is expressed during embryonic development. Although we were comparing differential expression in hematopoietic cells, 6 of 13 (46 %) of the genes down-regulated after dox withdrawal that we have analysed thus far, <italic>Nuak1</italic>, <italic>Tmem2</italic>, <italic>Etv5</italic>, <italic>Enc1</italic>, <italic>Csrp2</italic>, and <italic>Tgfb1i1 </italic>(Transforming growth factor &#x003b2;1 induced transcript 4), showed partly over-lapping expression pattern with <italic>Lhx2 </italic>in different tissues. <italic>Lhx2 </italic>is expressed by cells in the liver, the hair follicles, the developing cerebral cortex of the forebrain and the olfactory epithelium, and examples of genes showing overlapping gene expression with <italic>Lhx2 </italic>in two or more of these tissues are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>. <italic>Tmem2 </italic>is expressed in all four tissues, <italic>Nuak1 </italic>and <italic>Enc1 </italic>are expressed in olfactory epithelium, hair follicles, cortex area of the forebrain but not within the liver lobes, whereas <italic>Etv5 </italic>is expressed hair follicles, cortex area of the forebrain, weakly within the liver lobes but not in olfactory epithelium (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).

Self-renewal of these DoxHPC lines, is strictly dependent on <italic>Lhx2 </italic>expression, since down-regulation of <italic>Lhx2 </italic>expression leads to loss of CAFCs and rapid and efficient differentiation into a variety of myeloid cells. To elucidate the putative function of <italic>Lhx2 </italic>in stem cells, we used microarray technology to compare global gene expression in these cell lines in the presence of dox (<italic>Lhx2 </italic>expression on) to different time points after dox withdrawal (<italic>Lhx2 </italic>expression off). We identified 267 genes (141 down-regulated and 126 up-regulated) that showed differential expression at all time points (36, 72 and 96 hours) after <italic>Lhx2 </italic>expression was turned off. Gene Ontology classification revealed that genes related to 'regulation of signal transduction', 'organogenesis' and 'cell death' were over-represented among the down-regulated genes (i.e. "stem cell-specific"), and that metabolism-related genes were over-represented among the up-regulated genes (i.e. "differentiation specific").</p><p>We have previously shown that the HPC lines generated by <italic>Lhx2 </italic>expression resemble normal HSCs in many basic molecular, cellular and biochemical aspects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Moreover, the HPC lines derived from bone marrow that engrafted stem cell-deficient mice maintained <italic>Lhx2 </italic>expression <italic>in vivo </italic>and caused myeloproliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. We therefore anticipated identifying genes involved in both physiological and pathological processes affecting HSCs by analyses of global gene expression of the DoxHPC lines. A comparison of the differentially expressed genes to previously defined HSC gene expression signatures revealed that a majority of the overlapping genes expressed in HSC-containing populations were those down-regulated after <italic>Lhx2 </italic>expression was turned off. Thus, although we have used a different microarray platform, the genes defined as stem cell-specific in our system (e.g. the 144 Unigene clusters that belonged to group of genes down-regulated after dox withdrawal), reveal a 21 and 23 % overlap with genes defined as HSC-specific in the two different stem cell databases, respectively (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">Additional file 4</xref>). Furthermore, thirteen of the 144 Unigene clusters (9 %) defined as stem cell-specific in our study overlapped with both HSC databases (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">Additional file 4</xref>). In interpreting the results from the comparison between our stem cell-specific genes and the HSC-enriched genes in Ivanova <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and Ramalho-Santos <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], it should be noted that the probes on the arrays in those studies only has an overlap in our array of 50 and 57%, respectively. The overlap from our model system for HSCs could be further viewed in relation to a study showing that the overlap between three different HSC-specific datasets varied between 19 and 32 % [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. It should be noted that, despite the fact that these studies were carried out using the same Affymetrix GeneChips, identical analysis approaches and essentially the same cell populations, there is still considerable variability between the different HSC-specific datasets. Moreover, a majority of the genes that were up-regulated after <italic>Lhx2 </italic>expression was turned off were preferentially expressed in differentiated cell populations. These results suggest that there is molecular overlap in the self-renewal and differentiation process between the DoxHPC lines and normal HSCs also at global gene expression level. We could also identify genes linked to malignant transformation of hematopoietic cells and one such example is Sox4, which was recently shown to cause acute leukemia if over-expressed in HSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Sox4 has also been identified as a frequent insertional mutagenesis target in murine myeloid leukemias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], further supporting a role of this gene in malignant transformation. Since <italic>Lhx2 </italic>is always integrated into the same position, close to the <italic>Hprt1 </italic>gene in the DoxHPC lines, expression of insertional mutagenesis target genes is not due to insertional mutation, as has been suggested for retroviral integration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], hence, these genes are more likely to be linked to <italic>Lhx2 </italic>function and/or stem cell function. Human chronic myeloid leukemia cells have been reported to express <italic>Lhx2 </italic>although its function in the disease is not clear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Another gene down-regulated after <italic>Lhx2 </italic>expression is turned off is <italic>Prkd2 </italic>(Protein kinase D2, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file 1</xref>), which has also been shown to be a substrate for the BCR-ABL fusion protein present in chronic myeloid leukemia cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. These results reveal a putative functional link between <italic>Lhx2 </italic>and the BCR-ABL fusion protein. However, both <italic>Sox4 </italic>and <italic>Prkd2 </italic>have been shown to be preferentially expressed in HSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], which suggests overlapping molecular mechanism regulating both HSC physiology and pathology. By using our inducible system it would be possible to dissect these processes on the molecular, cellular and biochemical level.</p><p>It has been suggested that the Notch pathway and pathways activated by different morphogens such as Wnt, Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) and hedgehog, are important regulators of stem cell function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. We have previously shown that the <italic>Lhx2</italic>-induced HPC lines self-renew by a cell nonautonomous mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and the anemia in <italic>Lhx2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mouse embryos is due to a cell nonautonomous mechanism, suggesting that <italic>Lhx2 </italic>regulates genes encoding proteins involved in cell-cell interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, we have not found any evidence for differential expression of major mediators of the Notch or Wnt pathways in the DoxHPC lines after turning <italic>Lhx2 </italic>expression off. Although the microarrays we used do not contain all mediators of these pathways, the results suggest that the mechanism whereby <italic>Lhx2 </italic>expression generates HPC lines is partly or completely independent of at least the Wnt and Notch pathways. We did find consistent down-regulated expression of the hedgehog receptor <italic>Smo </italic>(Smoothened) after <italic>Lhx2 </italic>expression was turned off (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file 1</xref>), and <italic>Smo </italic>has also been shown to be preferentially expressed in normal HSCs (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">Additional file 4</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. However, expression of the ligands (Sonic, Indian and Desert hedgehog) was very low to undetectable by real-time PCR analyses of the cell lines (data not shown). Thus, the functional role, if any, of hedgehog signalling in these cells remains to be determined. Furthermore, <italic>Tsg </italic>(Twisted gastrulation), which is a soluble modulator of BMP-signalling, was identified among the genes down-regulated after <italic>Lhx2 </italic>expression was turned off (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file 1</xref>), and is also defined as an HSC-specific gene (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">Additional file 4</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The functional relevance of this observation remains to be determined as Tsg protein has been show to act as a BMP antagonist as well as a BMP agonist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>].</p><p><italic>Lhx2 </italic>appears to play an important role during embryonic development in the formation of several different tissues via mesenchymal-epithelial interactions and/or regulation of stem/progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. One of our aims was therefore to identify gene(s) directly or indirectly regulated by <italic>Lhx2</italic>, possibly providing insights into the function of <italic>Lhx2 </italic>in these processes. A caveat to this assumption is that it is not known whether <italic>Lhx2 </italic>functions as a transcriptional activator, repressor, or both. The only reported target genes putatively regulated by <italic>Lhx2 </italic>in a direct manner are those encoding olfactory receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>] and these receptors are not expressed in <italic>Lhx2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>olfactory epithelia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. These observations suggest that genes activated by <italic>Lhx2 </italic>are down-regulated in <italic>Lhx2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>animals, and conversely, genes repressed by <italic>Lhx2 </italic>are up-regulated in <italic>Lhx2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>animals. A putative example of the latter is <italic>P4ha1 </italic>as this gene was up-regulated after <italic>Lhx2 </italic>is turned off in DoxHPC lines, and the expression of this gene was also up-regulated in the liver of <italic>Lhx2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos compared to wild type embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Although our analysis was made in hematopoietic cells, almost 50% of the genes analysed among those down-regulated after dox withdrawal (<italic>Lhx2 </italic>expression turned off), showed similar expression pattern as <italic>Lhx2 </italic>in different non-hematopoietic organs/cells during embryonic development. Preliminary data suggests, however, that several of these genes show maintained expression pattern in <italic>Lhx2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos, suggesting that these genes are not direct transcriptional targets for <italic>Lhx2</italic>. A plausible explanation for this observation is that different genes exert their function via parallel pathways in the regulation, formation or differentiation of a certain tissue but are not dependent on each other for their expression in that particular tissue. An illustrative example of such parallel but equally important pathways during organ formation can be observed during eye development, where both <italic>Lhx2 </italic>and <italic>Pax6 </italic>null mutant (Sey) embryos show a developmental arrest at the optic vesicle stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. However, the expression of these genes appear to be independent of each other since <italic>Pax6 </italic>isexpressed in the arrested optic vesicle in the <italic>Lhx2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos and <italic>Lhx2 </italic>is expressed in the arrested optic vesicle in <italic>Pax6</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Whether the genes identified in this study play an equally important role as <italic>Lhx2 </italic>in the development of the respective organ remains to be determined. Our approach may therefore have identified both genes that are directly or indirectly regulated by <italic>Lhx2</italic>, and genes that play an important role together with <italic>Lhx2 </italic>via parallel pathways but are independent of <italic>Lhx2 </italic>expression, similar to the <italic>Lhx2</italic>/<italic>Pax6 </italic>example during eye formation. These results suggest that elucidation of <italic>Lhx2 </italic>function in various organs would give further insights into <italic>Lhx2 </italic>function in the DoxHPC lines and hence both physiological and pathological processes regulating normal HSCs. Conversely, elucidation of <italic>Lhx2 </italic>function in DoxHPC would give insights into <italic>Lhx2 </italic>function in various basic processes during embryonic development, such as mesenchymal-epithelial interactions and regulation of stem/progenitor cells in non-hematopoietic tissues. We are at present time exploring all alternatives of <italic>Lhx2 </italic>function presented above.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Expression of the LIM-homeobox gene <italic>Lhx2 </italic>in hematopoietic cells derived from both ES cells differentiated in vitro and from bone marrow, allows for the generation of HSC-like cell lines. To address the molecular basis of <italic>Lhx2 </italic>function, we have analysed global gene expression in HSC-like cell lines with inducible Lhx2 expression. This approach identified 267 differentially expressed genes where 141 (144 Unigene clusters) were down-regulated and 126 (131 Unigene clusters) were up-regulated when Lhx2 expression was turned off. The relevance of this model system for normal HSC function was revealed by that the majority of the differentially expressed genes overlapping with HSC-specific datasets were defined as stem cell-specific in our system, and the majority of the differentially expressed genes overlapping with more differentiated hematopoietic cell population were defined as differentiation- or commitment-specific in our system. Moreover, gene expression analyses in various tissues during embryonic development of the down-regulated genes revealed that almost half of these genes showed overlapping expression patterns with <italic>Lhx2</italic>, suggesting a functional link to the development and regulation of various tissues and stem/progenitor cells.

Scanning was carried out at 10-&#x003bc;m resolution using the G2565BA DNA microarray scanner (Agilent Technologies) for which the photo multiplier tube was set to 100. The obtained TIFF-images were analysed using the GenePix Pro 5.1 software (Axon Instruments, Ca, USA). For each slide the foreground and background signal intensities were separated using the irregular feature-finding algorithm implemented in the software. A manual inspection was carried out to verify the results. The raw data, including several quality parameters, is available from the ArrayExpress data repository using the experiment accession number E-MEXP-431.</p></sec><sec><title>Microarray data analysis</title><p>Data processing and identification of differentially expressed genes was carried out in the R environment for statistical computing and programming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>] using the Bioconductor package bundle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>], Limma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>], aroma package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>] and the kth-package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. As a first step the Cy3 and Cy5 intensities without background subtraction were converted to M (=log<sub>2 </sub>[red channel/green channel]) and A (=log<sub>2 </sub>[red channel*green channel]/2) format using the median intensity values for both channels. A feature was considered unreliable and removed from further analysis if GenePix flagged it as "Not Found" or if it was manually flagged as "Bad"during the image analysis step. Furthermore, if a feature satisfied one of the following criteria it was considered unreliable: a) both channels were saturated (above 65190 intensity units), b) the percentage of foreground pixels above the local background plus two of its standard deviations were below 70 for both channels of a feature, or c) the signal-to-noise ratio (defined as [mean foreground-mean background]/background standard deviation) for both channels was below 3. Remaining data was normalized using the intensity-dependent print-tip lowess method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>] and differentially expressed genes identified using the empirical Bayes moderated t-test implemented in the Limma package. As a first step the signal intensities for duplicate features on each array were averaged. Replicated hybridizations are expected to have a higher correlation than the repeated cell cultures for each cell line. This was considered in the linear model by first estimating the between-replicates correlation by using restricted maximum likelihood methods to estimate a common correlation for all probes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>]. Secondly, a linear model was fit for each probe using generalized least squares that takes into account the between-replicates correlation. In the third step an empirical Bayes approach was used to shrink the gene-wise standard errors towards a common value and a moderated t-statistic was calculated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]. To compensate for multiple testing, the p-values associated with this t-statistics were adjusted using a false-discovery rate approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>] implemented in R. Finally, probabilities for differential expression (B-values) were calculated for each gene. For these calculations the a priori assumption of differentially expressed genes was set to 0.01.</p><p>Classification into Gene Ontology functional groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and analysis of over-represented themes was carried out using the EASE-package available at [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. The complete mouse transcriptome was used for calculation of the expected frequencies in the over-representation analysis, and a Gene Ontology theme (detail level 3) was considered over-represented if the calculated EASE score was below 0.1.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of differentially expressed genes by real-time PCR</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from cell pellets with TRizol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized by using the First-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Biosciences). Real-time PCR reactions were carried out in triplicates using SYBR green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems, Ca, USA) and PCR products were detected with an ABI prism 7000 instrument (Applied Biosystems). The expression levels of the genes tested were normalized to the expression levels of Gapdh and confirmed with two additional housekeeping genes: Hprt1 (hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1) and Tbp (TATA box binding protein) (data not shown).

A. </bold>Design of the experiment. This study includes 30 hybridizations using cDNA arrays (ArrayExpress accession numbers A-MEXP-175 and E-MEXP-431). Fourteen slides were allocated for profiling each of the DoxHPC1 and DoxHPC7 lines. Technical replicates were included at three different levels (replicated cell cultures of both cell lines, replicated hybridizations in each comparison using reciprocal dye assignments and repeated measurements using probes printed twice on each array). The hybridization scheme also includes two hybridizations between the two cultures within each cell line, as well as two hybridizations between the different <italic>Lhx2</italic>-expressing cell lines. The 36, 72 and 96 hours refer to the time after <italic>Lhx2 </italic>expression was down-regulated through withdrawal of dox from the culture medium. Each arrow denotes one hybridization. The tip and the base of the arrow indicate Cy5 and Cy3 assignments of the dyes, respectively. Letter assignments by the arrows (A, B, C and D) are used to describe the comparisons in the text. Figure <bold>C, D </bold>and <bold>E </bold>show the MA-plots for the comparisons at 36 (A), 72 (B) and 96 hours (C) respectively. Figure <bold>B, F-H </bold>show the statistical significance (1 - log of p-value) for each probe to be differentially expressed versus the M-value in a volcano-shaped plot; <bold>B </bold>between the cell lines DoxHPC1 and DoxHPC7 in E-comparison at time 0 hours and <bold>F-H </bold>corresponding values for the A-C comparison.
