It is becoming recognized that the absolute level of a specific transcription factor is also an important component for cell fate specification and differentiation, e.g., myogenin for skeletal muscle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>) and Sox2 for retinal progenitor cell differentiation and for the patterning and differentiation of anterior foregut endoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>). In pancreatogenesis, reduced dosage of <italic>Pdx1</italic> by deleting promoter elements of <italic>Pdx1</italic> causes a block in ventral pancreas specification and impaired dorsal pancreas development, resulting in glucose intolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>).</p><p><italic>Ptf1a</italic> (<italic>PTF1-p48</italic>), a bHLH transcription factor, is indispensable for the formation of the exocrine pancreas and the correct spatial organization of the endocrine pancreas in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>). Originally, <italic>Ptf1a</italic> was reported as a transcriptional regulator for acinar cell&#x02013;specific genes such as elastase 1 and amylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>). Using Cre-mediated lineage tracing, we previously showed that all pancreatic exocrine cells and most endocrine cells derive from <italic>Ptf1a</italic>-expressing progenitors. Furthermore, by combining gene knockout and lineage tracing, we showed that <italic>Ptf1a</italic>-inactivated cells revert to an intestinal cell fate, demonstrating its function as a switch between pancreatic and intestinal cell fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>). Supporting this notion, we and other groups recently demonstrated that ectopic expression of <italic>Ptf1a</italic> in the <italic>Pdx1</italic>-expressing undifferentiated endoderm results in a pancreatic cell fate and induces the full-scale pancreatic developmental program in mice and <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>). Very recently, it was shown that <italic>Ptf1a</italic> is one marker of early pancreatic multipotent progenitor cells located in the tips of the developing pancreatic epithelial tree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>). <italic>Ptf1a</italic> is not essential for pancreatic endocrine differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>), and <italic>Ptf1a</italic> is not expressed in mature pancreatic endocrine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>). Nevertheless, in humans, nonsense mutations in <italic>Ptf1a</italic> were recently identified as a cause of permanent neonatal diabetes associated with pancreatic agenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>). The death of <italic>Ptf1a</italic>-null mice soon after birth has not allowed further insight into the pathogenesis of the disease; therefore, it is still unclear how much pancreatic endocrine function is dependent on <italic>Ptf1a</italic> in mammals. Moreover, there is no information about gene-dosage effect of <italic>Ptf1a</italic> on pancreas development and function in mice.</p><p>In the present study, we used a combination of hypomorphic and null alleles of <italic>Ptf1a</italic> and a Cre-mediated lineage-tracing approach to show that reduced dosage of <italic>Ptf1a</italic> results in pancreatic hypoplasia and glucose intolerance in mice. We provide evidence that there is a threshold of <italic>Ptf1a</italic> dosage by which pancreatic progenitor cells proceed along the normal developmental pathway; they otherwise are misspecified to other organs (common bile duct &#x0005b;CBD&#x0005d;/duodenum) and cannot adequately expand in number. We also show defects in endocrine pancreas development (total &#x003b2;-cell number, ratios of endocrine cell types, and islet architecture) in <italic>Ptf1a</italic> hypomorphic mutant mice.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p><italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>), <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cbll/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>), and <italic>ROSA26r</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>) were crossed in the C57BL/6 background and interbred to produce <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/&#x0002b;</sup>;ROSA26r</italic>, <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/cbll</sup>; ROSA26r</italic>, <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/cre</sup>;ROSA26r</italic>, and <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cbll/cbll</sup></italic> mice.

We used quantitative real-time RT-PCR to evaluate the expression level of <italic>Ptf1a</italic> in pancreata from <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/&#x0002b;</sup></italic>, homozygous <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cbll/cbll</sup></italic>, and compound trans-heterozygotes of <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre</sup></italic> and <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cbll</sup></italic> (<italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/cbll</sup></italic>) compared with that in wild-type mice at two stages: e12.5, when <italic>Ptf1a</italic> is expressed in the multipotent progenitor phase of pancreas development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>), and postnatal day 1 (P1), when <italic>Ptf1a</italic> is expressed in exocrine cells in pancreas. <italic>Ptf1a</italic> RNA levels in pancreatic rudiments from <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/&#x0002b;</sup></italic>, <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cbll/cbll</sup></italic>, and <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/cbll</sup></italic> mice were substantially reduced to 55 &#x000b1; 8, 32 &#x000b1; 10, and 14 &#x000b1; 4&#x00025;, respectively, compared with wild-type mice at e12.5, and they were reduced to 60 &#x000b1; 7, 48 &#x000b1; 4, and 30 &#x000b1; 6&#x00025;, respectively, at P1 (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>).</p><p>Hypomorphic <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/cbll</sup></italic> and <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cbll/cbll</sup></italic> mice were born at the expected Mendelian ratio. <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/cbll</sup></italic> mice appeared small and dehydrated at birth. Some <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/cbll</sup></italic> mice survived to P30 (the longest survival up to P45), but the rest died before &#x0223c;P14. On the other hand, <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/&#x0002b;</sup></italic>, <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cbll/cbll</sup></italic>, and wild-type mice were almost indistinguishable from each other at birth and were viable. As shown in <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic>&#x02013;<italic>D</italic></xref>, postnatal growth retardation and small body size persisted into the weaning stage in <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/cbll</sup></italic> and <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cbll/cbll</sup></italic> mice.

Macroscopically, the pancreas of hypomorphic <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/cbll</sup>;R26r</italic> mice was dramatically smaller than that of <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/&#x0002b;</sup>;R26r</italic> mice at birth (data not shown), at P7, and at P30, and <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cbll/cbll</sup></italic> mice exhibited moderate pancreatic hypoplasia (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>E</italic>&#x02013;<italic>J</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Cell fate conversion of pancreatic precursors into the CBD and duodenal cells in <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/cbll</sup>;R26r</italic> mice.</title><p>Pancreas development can be divided into four phases in mice: The first phase is the specification and formation of dorsal and ventral pancreatic buds from foregut endoderm (specification). During the second phase, extensive proliferation and branching of the pancreatic epithelium occur (branching morphogenesis). The third phase involves differentiation of large numbers of endocrine, exocrine, and duct cell lineages (cytodifferentiation). The fourth phase consists of maturation of the islet architecture and function in the postnatal period (islet morphogenesis). Developmentally, as shown in <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic>&#x02013;<italic>H</italic></xref>, pancreas was small from the beginning of pancreatic bud formation at e10.5 in <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/cbll</sup>;R26r</italic> mice compared with <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/&#x0002b;</sup>;R26r</italic> littermates, and this size difference became more apparent as development proceeded.</p><p>In our previous study, lineage-labeled &#x003b2;-galactosidase (&#x003b2;-gal)-positive cells were observed in the duodenum in both the dorsal and ventral regions in <italic>Ptf1a</italic>-null (<italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/cre</sup>; R26r</italic>) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>). A subset of &#x003b2;-gal&#x02013;positive cells were found to protrude from the gut tube in the ventral region at e12.5, but the cell fate of these cells was not identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>). In hypomorphic <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/cbll</sup>;R26r</italic> mice, at the dorsal side, ectopic <italic>Ptf1a</italic> lineage-labeled areas were observed in the duodenum at P7, similar to <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/cre</sup>;R26r</italic> mice at e17.5 (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>G</italic></xref> and <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>J</italic></xref>). Notably, at the ventral side, not only the duodenum but also the CBD contained ectopic <italic>Ptf1a</italic> lineage-labeled cells in <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/cbll</sup>;R26r</italic> at e17.5 and P7 (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>H</italic> and <italic>L</italic></xref>) and in <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/cre</sup>;R26r</italic> mice at e17.5 (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>K</italic></xref>). Histologically, substantial proportions of <italic>Ptf1a</italic> lineage-labeled cells were misspecified and adopted a Cdx2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>)-positive duodenal epithelial cell fate or cytokeratin-positive CBD epithelial cell fates including cells of the peribiliary glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>) in <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/cbll</sup>;R26r</italic> mice (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>M</italic>&#x02013;<italic>Q</italic></xref>). These results indicate that a threshold level of <italic>Ptf1a</italic> expression is required for the acquisition of a pancreatic cell fate in the primitive foregut endoderm and that reduction of <italic>Ptf1a</italic> dosage results in misspecification of pancreatic progenitors into the CBD and duodenum. Thus, together with reduced pancreatic bud size at early developmental stages, reduction of <italic>Ptf1a</italic> dosage results in a decrease in the final cell population that adopts a pancreatic cell fate.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell proliferation of the early pancreatic precursors is decreased in hypomorphic <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/cbll</sup></italic> mice.</title><p>Next, we investigated whether reduction of <italic>Ptf1a</italic> dosage affects the growth of pancreatic precursor cells. Quantification revealed that significantly more pancreatic precursor cells are proliferating in <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> mice (12.0 &#x000b1; 2.1&#x00025; of the total <italic>Ptf1a</italic> lineage-labeled pancreatic epithelial cells) than in <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/cbll</sup></italic> mice (5.9 &#x000b1; 1.9&#x00025;) (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 4, five to seven sections analyzed per embryo) at e10.5, as detected by the mitosis maker phosphorylated histone H3 (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>D</italic></xref>). At e12.5, although the difference was not significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.071), more pancreatic precursor cells were proliferating in <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> mice (6.3 &#x000b1; 1.2&#x00025;) than in <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/cbll</sup></italic> mice (3.8 &#x000b1; 1.2&#x00025;) and <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/cre</sup></italic> mice (2.3 &#x000b1; 0.6&#x00025;) (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic>&#x02013;<italic>C</italic> and <italic>E</italic></xref>). On the other hand, TUNEL staining revealed that apoptotic cells are only rarely observed in both <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> and hypomorphic mutant mice at e10.5 and e12.5 (data not shown), suggesting that apoptosis does not contribute to the hypomorphic pancreas of the mutants.</p></sec><sec><title>Delayed branching morphogenesis and reduced pancreatic exocrine differentiation with exocrine dysfunction in <italic>Ptf1a</italic> hypomorphic mice.</title><p>As reported previously, <italic>Ptf1a</italic>-null mice completely lack exocrine cytodifferentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>). In <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/&#x0002b;</sup>;R26r</italic> mice, extensive branching morphogenesis of the pancreatic epithelial tree was observed as early as e12.5, and amylase-positive cells were detected at e14.5 (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>.<italic>C</italic>). In <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/cbll</sup>;R26r</italic> mice, almost no branching morphogenesis of the pancreatic epithelial tree was seen, even at e14.5 (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic> and <italic>E</italic></xref>). Exocrine cytodifferentiation was also markedly delayed and reduced (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>H</italic></xref>, <italic>K</italic>, <italic>N</italic>, and <italic>Q&#x02013;T</italic>). Amylase-positive cells began to appear at P1 in small areas in <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/cbll</sup></italic> mice, but they were morphologically immature in that the nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio in <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/cbll</sup></italic> mice at P1 was as large as that in <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> mice at e14.5 (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic> and <italic>K</italic></xref>). At P7, pancreatic acinar structures were observed in restricted ventral regions, but the majority of the cells resembled immature duct-like epithelial structures that phenotypically corresponded to those at &#x0223c;e14.5 in <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>N</italic> and <italic>Q</italic></xref>). In the adult stage, amylase-positive acinar structures were detected in the ventral pancreas and proximal dorsal pancreas, but the majority of dorsal pancreas was composed of immature duct-like epithelial cells that rarely expressed amylase (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>R</italic>&#x02013;<italic>T</italic></xref>). Persistent <italic>Pdx1</italic> expression was observed in the immature duct-like epithelial cells at P1, P7, and P30, while normal duct cells do not express <italic>Pdx1</italic> at these stages (<xref rid="f8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8<italic>E</italic>&#x02013;<italic>G</italic> and <italic>I</italic></xref> and data not shown). Thus, the reduced dosage of <italic>Ptf1a</italic> falls below the threshold required to elicit the proper pancreatic exocrine differentiation program, and many pancreatic duct-like epithelial cells appear to remain in an undifferentiated state until the adult stage. These results also indicate regional (ventral vs. dorsal and distal vs. proximal) differences in the exocrine differentiation program of the dorsal pancreas related to the <italic>Ptf1a</italic> dosage. <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cbll/cbll</sup></italic> mice showed intermediate delay in branching morphogenesis and exocrine cytodifferentiation during embryogenesis, but exocrine cytodifferentiation was fully restored by adulthood (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>D</italic></xref>, <italic>G</italic>, <italic>J</italic>, <italic>M</italic>, and <italic>P</italic>). Actually, the body weights of <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cbll/cbll</sup></italic> mice were almost similar to those of wild-type mice by &#x0223c;3 months of age. As expected from the histological findings, <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/cbll</sup></italic> mice showed exocrine pancreas dysfunction at P22, demonstrated by the abundant Oil red O&#x02013;stained lipid droplets in stool smears (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>U</italic></xref>). A small amount of lipid droplets was also observed in stool smears from <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cbll/cbll</sup></italic> mice, but it was very rare. Thus, we hypothesize that exocrine pancreas dysfunction is, at least in part, one of the causes of growth retardation as well as impaired metabolic homeostasis in <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/cbll</sup></italic> mice (see below).</p></sec><sec><title>Abnormal islet formation with insufficient insulin secretion and glucose intolerance in <italic>Ptf1a</italic> hypomorphic mutants.</title><p>During embryogenesis, the timing of pancreatic endocrine cytodifferentiation was indistinguishable between <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/&#x0002b;</sup></italic>, <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cbll/cbll</sup></italic>, and <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/cbll</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic>&#x02013;<italic>L</italic></xref>).

These findings are implicated in possible pathogenesis of pancreatic hypoplasia and neonatal diabetes in humans.</p><sec><title>The crucial role of <italic>Ptf1a</italic> dosage as a determinant of pancreatic size.</title><p>We have observed dosage-dependent pancreatic hypoplasia in <italic>Ptf1a</italic> hypomorphic mutant mice. Accounting for hypoplastic pancreas, we have revealed that reduction of <italic>Ptf1a</italic> dosage results in a decrease of the final cell population that adopts a pancreatic cell fate. Furthermore, we have shown that subsequent growth of early pancreatic precursors is also reduced in <italic>Ptf1a</italic> hypomorphic mutants. Recently, it was reported that Pdx1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Ptf1a<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cMyc<sup>high</sup> Cpa1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> multipotent progenitor cells are located in the tip of the branching pancreatic epithelial tree, while the trunk region of branches is composed of endocrine and duct cell precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>). In <italic>Ptf1a</italic> hypomorphic mutants, it is conceivable that reduced branching morphogenesis might result in the decrease in the number of &#x0201c;multipotent tip cells.&#x0201d; In addition, consistent with the recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>), we have demonstrated that <italic>Ptf1a</italic> dosage is crucial for the activation of <italic>Pdx1</italic> in early pancreatic progenitors in vivo. Considering that <italic>Pdx1</italic> inactivation results in early growth arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>) and that <italic>Pdx1</italic> positively regulates <italic>Ptf1a</italic> in the early pancreatic buds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>), it is concluded that Pdx1 and Ptf1a mutually activate each other in early pancreatic precursors, establishing the pancreatic domains in the primitive endoderm and promoting subsequent growth of pancreatic precursors. It is noteworthy that <italic>Ptf1a</italic> dosage is one of the &#x0201c;intrinsic&#x0201d; determinants of pancreatic size, which is relevant to a recent study suggesting that the pancreas size is determined by an intrinsic factor that is not amendable to growth compensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>). It remains possible that substantial pancreatoneogenesis is still occurring at P1, although there is currently no evidence for multipotent progenitor cells that express <italic>Ptf1a</italic> at P1 and afterward.</p></sec><sec><title>The critical role of <italic>Ptf1a</italic> dosage in cell fate specification.</title><p>It is interesting that the cells expressing reduced <italic>Ptf1a</italic> adopted different cell fates, including the CBD, duodenum, and pancreas in <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/cbll</sup></italic> mice. Considering that the expression level of <italic>Ptf1a</italic> per cell appears to not be same in pancreatic buds at the early developmental stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>), it is likely that the cells that express <italic>Ptf1a</italic> above a certain threshold level are specified to pancreas and those cells expressing <italic>Ptf1a</italic> below this level are specified to the CBD or duodenum. It is possible that the cells most likely to be misspecified are those at the duodenal junction, since they could potentially still be receiving some kind of gut fate-inducing signals that are stronger than in the more distal cells. On the other hand, it is still an open question as to how pancreatic endocrine versus exocrine cell fate specification is determined. In the recent study, one striking observation is that Cpa1 becomes downregulated in the cleft region when the branching tips divide and Cpa1-expressing cells become incorporated into the trunk region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>). In this study, we have found that pancreatic exocrine cytodifferentiation is markedly delayed and reduced in <italic>Ptf1a</italic> hypomorphic mutants, whereas endocrine cytodifferentiation is less affected. Together with the report from Zhou et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>), our findings lead to an intriguing hypothesis that <italic>Ptf1a</italic> dosage might be a determinant of cell fate specification of pancreatic exocrine versus endocrine lineage: The pancreatic progenitor cells that express <italic>Ptf1a</italic> at a higher level are specified to exocrine lineage, whereas those that express <italic>Ptf1a</italic> at lower level are specified to endocrine lineage. It will be of considerable interest to test this hypothesis by chimeric mouse experiments using <italic>Ptf1a</italic> hypomorphic alleles.</p></sec><sec><title>The role of <italic>Ptf1a</italic> dosage in endocrine pancreas development and glucose homoeostasis.</title><p>The present study shows that <italic>Ptf1a</italic> dosage affects total &#x003b2;-cell number and the balance of endocrine cell types as well as their relative spatial relationships in late-stage endocrine cell formation, although <italic>Ptf1a</italic> is not essential for endocrine cytodifferentiation. It has been suggested that the surrounding environment might be important for proper islet formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>). In <italic>Ptf1a</italic> hypomorphic mutants, appropriate acinar tissues are not formed during embryognenesis and the neonatal period; therefore, it is possible that lack of production of the appropriate acinar tissue affects islet formation. Alternatively, it is possible that downregulation of <italic>Pdx1</italic> in early pancreatic multipotent progenitors affects a proportion of endocrine cell types in the mutants. Reducing <italic>Pdx1</italic> expression by deleting promoter elements of <italic>Pdx1</italic> gene results in disrupted proportion of each islet cell type and its distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>). Other mouse models of disorganized islet architecture, including transgenic overexpression of hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>) and dominant-negative HNF-1&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>), also result in glucose intolerance. In all of these models, Glut2 is absent or largely reduced; therefore, &#x003b2;-cell dysfunction, including glucose sensing, is a main cause of diabetes. In <italic>Ptf1a</italic> hypomorphic mice, however, insulin-producing cells express normal amounts of Pdx1 and Glut2, suggesting their functional maturation. We consider the main cause of glucose intolerance to be the inadequate number of total &#x003b2;-cells. From the observations during embryonic stages, two mechanisms might be responsible: First, as a consequence of reduced <italic>Ptf1a</italic> expression, substantial proportion of foregut epithelial cells are misspecified to the duodenum and CBD, resulting in the reduction of the final cell population that adopts a pancreatic cell-fate. Second, reduced proliferation during early pancreatogenesis causes inadequate expansion of endocrine precursor pools in <italic>Ptf1a</italic> hypomorphic mutant mice. Supporting this notion, preliminary analyses showed that <italic>Ngn3</italic> expression in pancreatic rudiments are reduced in <italic>Ptf1a</italic> hypomorphic mutants (50 &#x000b1; 13&#x00025; in <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/cbll</sup></italic> mice and 50 &#x000b1; 6&#x00025; in <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cbll/cbll</sup></italic> mice) compared with wild-type mice at e12.5 (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 3), although the expression level of <italic>Ngn3</italic> per cell is unclear. Reduced <italic>Pdx1</italic> expression might affect Ngn3-expressing cell formation during early pancreatigenesis in <italic>Ptf1a</italic> hypomorphic mutants because loss of <italic>Pdx1</italic> results in no Ngn3-expressing cell formation in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>). At the same time, islet dysmorphology itself (disturbed ratio of each cell type and its localization) might be associated with decreased function. Mixing of peripheral cell types with &#x003b2;-cells might disrupt the gap junctional or other coupling that is involved in an efficient insulin release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical implications for <italic>Ptf1a</italic> hypomorphic mutant mice.</title><p>We have already reported that hypomorphic <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cre/cbll</sup></italic> and <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cbll/cbll</sup></italic> mice exhibit cerebellar agenesis similar to that of <italic>Ptf1a</italic>-null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>). The levels of <italic>Ptf1a</italic> transcripts in <italic>Ptf1a<sup>cbll/cbll</sup></italic> embryos are dramatically reduced in the cerebellum (26.3-fold reduction), whereas they are more mildly affected in the hindbrain (4.5-fold reduction) and pancreas (3.1-fold reduction) (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>). The precise mechanism that accounts for this difference is currently unknown; however, our previous report and current findings suggest that threshold levels to acquire specific cell fates differ among different organs. A nonsense mutation in <italic>Ptf1a</italic> has been recently identified as a cause of autosomal recessively inherited permanent neonatal diabetes associated with pancreatic and cerebellar agenesis in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>). Although hypomoprphic <italic>Ptf1a</italic> alleles have not been identified so far, our data predict a possible involvement of hypomorphic <italic>Ptf1a</italic> alleles in congenital pancreatic hypoplasia and diabetes in humans either by mutations in the <italic>Ptf1a</italic> coding region or deletions or single nucleotide polymorphisms in its regulatory sequence that are pivotal in pancreatic <italic>Ptf1a</italic> expression. In addition, our findings are also implicated in possible islet regeneration therapy for diabetes, since controlling gene dosage or levels/duration of gene expression might be one of the important factors for producing pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells in vitro.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</p><p>We thank Dr. P.
