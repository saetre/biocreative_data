The transcript from loss of exon 14 results in a shift in the normal reading frame, resulting in a premature chain termination codon which, if utilized, would result in a truncated polypeptide that is 605 aa in length, of which the first 580 aa correspond to the normal Apc protein.</p><p>Southern blot analysis of tail DNA from F1 offspring of both <italic>Apc<sup>CKON</sup></italic> and <italic>Apc<sup>&#x00394;580</sup></italic> lines confirmed the germline transmission of modified <italic>Apc</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g001">Figure 1</xref>B).

The mutant mice of the genotype <italic>K14-cre; Apc<sup>CKO/CKO</sup></italic> (hereafter, KA mutant) were born, but the observed frequency of KA mutants was much less than expected (78 of 458 &#x0005b;17.0&#x00025;&#x0005d;; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0005 Chi-square analysis, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020146-t001">Table 1</xref>). To assess the basis for the neonatal lethality of KA mutants, we monitored three litters from birth to weaning by measuring the body weight of each pup every day. A total of 25 pups were born from three litters, of which 7 (28&#x00025;) were confirmed to be <italic>K14-cre; Apc<sup>CKO/CKO</sup></italic> by genotyping, indicating that KA mutants were born in the expected Mendelian ratio. The KA mutant pups were nursed normally, and there was milk in their stomachs during the first 2 or 3 d after birth, but they failed to thrive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g002">Figure 2</xref>). By postnatal day (P) 8&#x02013;10, at the time of genotyping, many KA mutant pups were considerably smaller than their littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g002">Figure 2</xref>B&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g002">2</xref>F) and some have died at or prior to this age. None of KA mutants survived to weaning age.</p><p>The ability of whole embryos to exclude blue dye was used to examine the epidermal barrier, normally acquired beginning at E16 and complete by E18.5 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020146-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. Analyses of E17.5&#x02013;E18.5 KA mutants showed that they were able to exclude blue dye, indicating that the epidermal barrier was intact (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020146-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). At these embryonic ages, there were no differences in size between the mutants and their littermates, but the mutants showed a patch of &#x0201c;birthmark&#x0201d; or dark pigmentation on their foreheads and a dark median line that ran caudally from head to tail. Their external ears or pinnae were shriveled in appearance and pigmented compared to those of littermates.</p><p>External characteristics of KA mutants that were evident at E18.5 persisted after birth and became more prominent as they grew (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g002">Figure 2</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g002">2</xref>F). Growth of pelage hair was generally delayed in the mutants. At around P8, the KA mutants were hairless and had wrinkled skin while their phenotypically normal littermates had a smooth thin coat of hair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). At this age, two lower incisors start to erupt in normal littermates and these were absent in the KA mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g002">Figure 2</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g002">2</xref>D). Animals also tended to be smaller and around P10&#x02013;P12 displayed abnormally short and misshapen vibrissae and short, shaggy pelage hairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g002">Figure 2</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g002">2</xref>D). Development of thick ridges in their skin, particularly around the ears, eyelids, forehead, nose, and paws, became noticeable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g002">Figure 2</xref>E). These regions looked scaly, and these animals hardly kept their eyes open. In contrast to the normal littermates that consistently increased their body weight with age, surviving KA mutants started to lose weight from P10 onwards; by P16&#x02013;P17 they were all lethargic, and none of them survived to weaning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g002">Figure 2</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g002">2</xref>F). At the time of autopsy all the mutants were toothless, without incisors or molars, and their stomachs were consistently small and had no solid food, unlike their age-matched littermates, suggesting that the observed weight loss could be the result of failure to ingest solid food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g002">Figure 2</xref>F). Interestingly, changes in body weights and timing of hair growth varied considerably among mutant pups even if they were from the same litter, whereas those of phenotypically normal littermates tended to be similar. This difference was also reflected in the variation in timing of death in mutants: some mutant pups were born alive but died within a day or two, some survived close to the weaning age. This variability of the mutant phenotypes suggests possible variation in the timing and efficiency of <italic>cre</italic>-mediated <italic>Apc</italic> deletion. It is possible that the genetic background has a role to play in this variability.</p><p>Gross examination of internal organs also showed that the mutants' thymi were consistently inconspicuous and were very small for their age, whereas those of their littermates were very prominent in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g002">Figure 2</xref>G). This difference was evident as early as P3. Quite frequently mutant thymi in P12&#x02013;P17 mutant mice also contained black deposits within the tissue (unpublished data).

The outer root sheath (ORS) is contiguous with and biochemically similar to the basal layer of the epidermis. The inner layers of the hair follicle include three concentric layers of inner root sheath and three concentric layers of hair-producing cells. At the base of the hair follicle is the germinative hair follicle bulb, which contains rapidly proliferating &#x0201c;matrix&#x0201d; cells that differentiate to populate all of the layers of the inner root sheath and the hair shaft itself &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020146-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. During the anagen phase of the hair cycle (until P15), hair follicles of phenotypically normal mice grew deeply into the subcutaneous fat and were uniformly spaced and aligned in parallel arrays at a specific angle relative to the skin surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). In contrast, KA mutant follicles were irregularly spaced and often seen as disoriented and clamped invaginations at P3 that became even more remarkable at P12 when the mutant mice were covered by fur coat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g004">Figure 4</xref>F). Bulbs were often bent in addition to being irregularly angled to one another and their sizes and locations were often variable. Clusters of multiple invaginations or dysplastic follicular structures were frequently observed throughout the epidermis, whereas other regions showed gaps with no follicles. Serial sectioning indicated that some of the hair follicles in the P12 mutant skin were not properly formed or shorter than normal. Taken together, these features could account for the apparently delayed, followed by outgrowth, of the short and shaggy-looking fur coat of these mutant mice.</p><p>Apc is a regulator of &#x003b2;-catenin that is important for Wnt signaling. We examined the patterns of expression of &#x003b2;-catenin in the affected tissues. In the normal skin, &#x003b2;-catenin, a member of the adherens junction complex, was found in the ORS of hair follicles and basal layer of epidermis, where K14 expression is also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g004">Figure 4</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g004">4</xref>D), whereas the expression of K1, involucrin, and loricrin (markers for spinous and granular layers of epidermis) was only observed in the nonbasal epidermis (unpublished data). The patterns of expression of K14, K1, involucrin, and loricrin, in skin from mutant and normal littermate mice at P3&#x02013;P17, showed no significant differences in the terminal differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g004">Figure 4</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g004">4</xref>D, 4F&#x02013;4I). Similarly, the pattern of expression of K6, which is normally only expressed in the suprabasal or inner layer of the ORS of the hair follicle but not in the epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g004">Figure 4</xref>E), did not change. Due to the abnormal and disorganized structure of hair follicles themselves, K6 localization highlighted the histological abnormality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g004">Figure 4</xref>J). Yet as in the normal skin, K6 was principally seen only in the suprabasal layer of the ORS that did not colocalize with the basal markers, K14 or K5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g004">Figure 4</xref>I and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g004">4</xref>J).</p><p>In normal skin, proliferating cells were detected in either the basal layer of epidermis or in germinative hair follicle bulbs at the base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). In the mutant skin, either BrdU incorporation or Ki67 expression was observed not only in cells in bulbs at the base of the hair follicle but also in bulb-like structures that were budding out from the ORS of the existing hair follicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g004">Figure 4</xref>G and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g004">4</xref>G&#x02032;). Each budding tip was becoming like a hair follicle bulb containing proliferating cells.

The exact locations of hair follicle bulbs were not as easy to define for some mutant follicles due to their disorganized structures. Interestingly, in the mutant skin, in addition to diffuse membrane-bound localization as in the normal skin, cells with strong cytosolic &#x003b2;-catenin localization were also observed frequently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g004">Figure 4</xref>H and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g004">4</xref>H&#x02032;). These elevated &#x003b2;-catenin&#x02013;expressing cells were usually surrounded by proliferating cells, forming bulb-like structures. Comparison of immunochemically stained serial sections showed that these intense cytosolic &#x003b2;-catenin stainings were usually found in either K14-positive K1-negative basal epidermis or K14-positive K6-negative basal ORS cells, and are surrounded by proliferating cells.</p><p>To determine the initiation of hair follicle morphogenesis in these mutants, we examined the expression pattern of <italic>Sonic hedgehog (Shh),</italic> a factor expressed in hair bulbs in embryonic skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The aberrant hair follicle morphogenesis is evident as early as E14.5 in mutant embryonic skin, by multiple apolarized expression of <italic>Shh</italic> throughout the epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g005">Figure 5</xref>B), whereas that of control embryos was well polarized and regularly spaced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). With development, control mouse hair follicles invaginate downward in a polarized manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g005">Figure 5</xref>C), whereas those of mutant embryos were completely irregular and apolarized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g005">Figure 5</xref>D). It was also noted that the size of each &#x0201c;budding&#x0201d; follicle, as detected by <italic>Shh</italic> expression, was variable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g005">Figure 5</xref>D). The intensity of <italic>Shh</italic> staining was generally stronger in mutant skin than in the normal skin. The aberrant initiation of multiple hair placodes during early hair follicle morphogenesis was also evident by the whole-mount in situ hybridization (ISH) of E15.5 mutant embryos for &#x003b2;-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g005">Figure 5</xref>F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g005">5</xref>F&#x02032;). The expression pattern of &#x003b2;-catenin in embryos clearly demonstrated the formation of regular arrays of hair placodes in the normal embryonic skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g005">Figure 5</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g005">5</xref>E&#x02032;), but such regular patterning was lost, and often tightly clustered abnormal hair placodes were initiated in mutant embryonic skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g005">Figure 5</xref>F&#x02032;). Aberrant hair placodes were also evident throughout the skin surface of limbs in E15.5 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g005">Figure 5</xref>F), whereas those of the control embryos had not yet formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g005">Figure 5</xref>E). Most interestingly, in the mutant footpads, where hair placodes do not normally form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g005">Figure 5</xref>G), we also found ectopic irregularly sized and spaced hair placodes, indicating that the footpads still have the potential to form hair placodes in the absence of the <italic>Apc</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g005">Figure 5</xref>H).</p><p>These results collectively suggest that the terminal differentiation does take place normally in the mutant skin, but initiation of embryonic hair follicle morphogenesis is severely disrupted, accompanied by a continuous ectopic hair follicle morphogenesis in postnatal mutant skin.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Effects of <italic>K14-cre</italic>&#x02013;Driven Loss of <italic>Apc</italic> in Other Epidermal Appendages</title><p>Similar to the biology of hair follicles, <italic>K14-cre</italic>&#x02013;driven loss of <italic>Apc</italic> also affected the development of other epidermal appendages that depend on epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal interactions for their formation. The most striking of these was dental dysplasia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g004">Figure 4</xref>K&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g004">4</xref>R).

Despite the grossly toothless phenotype of KA mutants, histological analysis of their oral cavities revealed the formation of multiple tooth buds at each location. These aberrant teeth obviously failed to grow out during the dietary transition from milk to solid food. Analogous to the expression patterns of K14 and &#x003b2;-catenin in the normal skin, diffuse membrane-bound expression of &#x003b2;-catenin was detected in K14-expressing oral epithelium and ameloblasts of normal mice.

It represents the primary lymphoid organ for thymocyte development and selection. Distinct population of TECs of cortex and medulla mediates both of these critical functions. Cortical and medullary TEC subsets are characterized by differential expression of four keratin species: K8, K18, K5, and K14.</p><p>The normal thymus is a lobulated lymphoid organ, each lobule clearly showing the two distinct TEC compartments, an outer cortex and an inner medulla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g006">Figure 6</xref>). There were no major differences in the histology of thymus between the ages P3 to P17 in phenotypically normal littermates. As shown in the H&#x00026;E staining of thymus, the cortex was formed of dense lymphoid tissue that lacks nodules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). Since the stroma of the medulla is less heavily infiltrated with lymphocytes than the cortex, the medulla stained more lightly than the cortex. In normal mice, the thymus retains its size until the young adult age and regresses thereafter by atrophy. In the normal young mice we examined (P3&#x02013;P17), it is evident that thymocytes were mitotically active in the cortex as determined by BrdU immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). Immunohistochemistry of normal thymus from P3 to P17 mice showed a similar staining pattern for K14 in that its expression was restricted to a small population of TECs in the inner medullary region and in the keratinocytes in Hassall's corpuscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g006">Figure 6</xref>D). Diffuse cytoplasmic staining for &#x003b2;-catenin was also detected in the medullary epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g006">Figure 6</xref>C). In contrast to K14 expression, diffuse staining for K8 was observed in epithelial cells both in the medulla and cortex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020146-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). K1 staining was not detected in young mice at P3 but in older mice it was detected in differentiated keratinocytes in some of Hassall's corpuscles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020146-sg003">Figure S3</xref>).</p><p>The histological abnormalities of thymus were evident as early as P3 in KA mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g006">Figure 6</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g006">6</xref>H). The thymus was made of two lobules as in the normal mice but the mutant thymus was significantly smaller in size than that of the age-matched controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g002">Figure 2</xref>G). Interestingly, variations in the phenotypic severity of the mutant pups at P3 were prominently reflected in the extent of histological abnormalities of thymus. A P3 KA mutant pup that showed milder phenotype with a comparable body weight to its normal littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, M2) showed milder thymus abnormalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g006">Figure 6</xref>E) compared to its more severe mutant littermate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, M1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g006">Figure 6</xref>H). The milder P3 mutant thymus was already much smaller in size compared to those of normal littermates (data not shown) but two epithelial compartments of thymus were histologically still distinguishable, with colonization of thymocytes evident in the cortex. However, there were small populations of lightly stained cells by H&#x00026;E extending from the edge of the outer cortex towards inner medulla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g006">Figure 6</xref>E), and these cells showed intense nuclear &#x003b2;-catenin staining whereas the rest of the medullary cells showed diffuse &#x003b2;-catenin staining pattern similar to that of the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g006">Figure 6</xref>F). Localization of K14 was limited to a few cells in the medulla and some overlapped with K8 localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g006">Figure 6</xref>G).</p><p>In the other P3 mutant thymus the distinct thymic epithelial compartments have been lost completely, and only a few lymphocytes were remaining at the edges and some in the middle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g006">Figure 6</xref>H). Proliferative activities were no longer observed in thymocytes as prominently as in the normal thymus, but the epithelial cells seemed to be forming concentric structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g006">Figure 6</xref>I). Unlike in the normal or mild mutant thymi, the severe P3 mutant thymus showed extensive K14 expression that overlapped with K8 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g006">Figure 6</xref>K). These cells were more like basal cells of the skin than TECs and were adjacent to the most immature looking cells that were showing strong nuclear and cytoplasmic &#x003b2;-catenin staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g006">Figure 6</xref>J). The nuclear staining of &#x003b2;-catenin was not observed in the normal age-matched thymus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g006">Figure 6</xref>C). Most notably, the K14 and &#x003b2;-catenin staining patterns were mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g006">Figure 6</xref>J and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g006">6</xref>K).</p><p>At P10&#x02013;P13, the mutant thymus consisted of numerous enlarged Hassall's corpuscle&#x02013;like structures, made of arrays of K14- and K8-expressing keratinizing epithelial cells surrounding large keratin deposits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g006">Figure 6</xref>L and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g006">6</xref>O). There were numerous neutrophils and macrophages infiltrating the thymus in response to these keratins; hence, these structures could be called pyogranuloma. Varying degrees of differentiation-specific markers depending on the age of mice, in this case K1 and involucrin that are normally present only in Hassall's corpuscles, were also detected in mutant thymi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020146-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). In these mice no thymocytes were detectable. BrdU incorporation was only observed in very few keratinizing epithelial cells, looking somewhat similar to the pattern of mature skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g006">Figure 6</xref>M). The diffuse expression of &#x003b2;-catenin was also present in these epithelial cells, and at this age fewer cells were positive for nuclear &#x003b2;-catenin staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g006">Figure 6</xref>N). As in the younger mutant mice, however, nuclear localization of &#x003b2;-catenin was only observed in K14-negative cells that looked like undifferentiated basal cells. In older P17 mice, the histopathology and keratin expression pattern of the mutant thymus was similar to that of P13 except for the fact that &#x003b2;-catenin expression became increasingly diffuse and appeared to colocalize with K8/K14 expression (data not shown). This coincided with fewer immature cells in the older mutant thymus.</p><p>Collectively, these results suggest that loss of <italic>Apc</italic> and consequent stabilization of &#x003b2;-catenin in K14-expressing TECs lead to their aberrant proliferation and differentiation to keratinocytes, causing massive squamous metaplasia, rather than to form either medullary or cortical TECs.

Of interest are the phenotypic similarities and differences between our KA mutant mice and the previously described K14-&#x00394;N87&#x003b2;cat transgenic mice expressing stable &#x003b2;-catenin under the control of <italic>K14</italic> promoter &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020146-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d; and K14-<italic>Lef1</italic> transgenic mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020146-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. Surprisingly, our mutant mice shared more similarities with the K14-<italic>Lef1</italic> mice than the K14-&#x00394;N87&#x003b2;cat transgenic mice. For example, the KA mutant mice displayed the disoriented and short, curly whiskers seen in K14-<italic>Lef1</italic>but not in K14-&#x00394;N87&#x003b2;cat transgenic mice. In addition, KA mutant mice displayed a disorganized hair coat beginning with the emergence of neonatal hairs, similar to that observed in K14-<italic>Lef1</italic> mice, whereas in K14-&#x00394;N87&#x003b2;cat mice, embryonic hair follicle morphogenesis was unaffected and other skin changes only emerged postnatally. The reason for this difference could be attributed to one or all of three possible contributing factors. (1) Although the K14 promoter itself is known to initiate the expression at E9.5 and elevated dramatically by E13.5&#x02013;E14.5 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020146-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020146-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;, many factors could influence the expression of promoter/transgene construct in transgenic mice. One of the most important considerations has to do with the integration site of the transgene in the mouse genome. Depending on the location of integration, the transcriptional activity of even the same transgene could vary considerably. It is possible that the apparent lack of &#x00394;N87&#x003b2;cat function in embryogenesis could be due to the delayed or weak expression of the K14-&#x00394;N87&#x003b2;cat transgene compared to the intrinsic promoter. In contrast, Cre-mediated recombination is seen in E13.5 skin of <italic>K14-cre</italic> transgenic mice used in this study &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020146-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d; and <italic>K14-cre</italic>&#x02013;mediated truncation of the <italic>Apc</italic> gene is likely to have occurred by then, in time for the second wave of hair follicle morphgenesis. (2) Another important fact is that in the aforementioned transgenic model the overexpression of transgene is confined to the basal cells of the epidermis and the ORS of hair follicles, where the <italic>K14</italic> promoter is active. The expression of transgene is hence transient and stops once K14-expressing cells terminally differentiate. In contrast, in our model, <italic>K14-cre</italic>&#x02013;mediated deletion of <italic>Apc</italic> would result in <italic>Apc</italic> mutation not only in <italic>K14</italic> promoter active cells, but remain so in all cell layers that derived from the <italic>K14</italic> promoter active progenitors. These derivatives include the suprabasal epidermis and the entire epithelium of the hair follicle. Stabilization of &#x003b2;-catenin in a broader population of cells could account for some of the phenotypic differences. However, we did not detect any elevated &#x003b2;-catenin expression in either K1- or K6-positive differentiated cells in postnatal mutant skin. This indicates that despite the absence of Apc and potential stabilization of &#x003b2;-catenin in derivatives of K14-expressing progenitors, elevated &#x003b2;-catenin expression, and subsequent cell fate determination may only take place in basal cells. (3) We cannot exclude the possibility that given the multifunctional properties of Apc, disruption of its functions other than down-regulation of &#x003b2;-catenin may also have contributed to the observed overt phenotype.</p><p>While some features of our mutant mice were similar to these transgenic mice, other phenotypic aspects were largely distinct. In addition to aberrant hair follicle morphogenesis, <italic>K14</italic>-driven loss of <italic>Apc</italic> caused formation of multiple tooth buds that, like hair follicles, were known to develop through inductive interactions between the epithelium and mesenchyme. This observation was similar to the ectopic tooth buds found in animals misexpressing Lef1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020146-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;, but more severe and was also present at birth, indicating the effect of <italic>Apc</italic> loss during the initiation of embryonic tooth development, which was evident by aberrant <italic>Shh</italic> expression in E15.5 embryonic oral epithelium (unpublished data). It should be noted that although multiple tooth buds were histologically visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g004">Figure 4</xref>O and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g004">4</xref>P), these teeth never broke out and the KA mutant mice appeared toothless. This unusual severe tooth defect is unique to these mutant mice. In addition, neither of the two transgenic mice was postnatally lethal as in the KA mutant mice. We did not find any obvious histopathological abnormalities in the internal organs of KA mice that could contribute to the lethality. However, the fact that all the mutants had lower weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g002">Figure 2</xref>F) with hardly any evidence of solid food in their stomach indicates that the mutants might have died of starvation. Dermal fat was reduced in the mutant skin, possibly as a consequence of poor nutrition caused by the absence of teeth. Since the weight loss in KA mutants started from P8&#x02013;P10 while pups were still nursed by their mothers, starvation due to lack of teeth cannot be the sole cause of death, but is likely to be a contributing factor. Absence of teeth and mammary glands have been observed in mice deficient in Lef1 and ectopically expressing Dkk1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020146-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020146-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d; but their absence was due to the block in development before the bud stage. Hence, neither loss nor excess of tooth bud formation allows proper development of teeth for mice to have a healthy diet and normal life. Mechanistic studies to understand how increased levels of &#x003b2;-catenin leads to altered skin and tooth phenotypes are under way.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title><italic>Apc</italic> and Thymus Organogenesis</title><p>In this study, we observed that <italic>K14</italic>-driven loss of <italic>Apc</italic> resulted in a small thymus with severe squamous metaplasia leading to the formation of numerous pyogranuloma and loss of proper meshwork structure for thymocyte maturation, rendering the mice athymic. Previous studies have shown that in normal adult thymus K14 expression is found together with K5 in the stellate medullary TECs, but not in association with K5<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> TECs in the cortex or at the cortico-medullary junction. In addition, it has been demonstrated that K14<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> TECs do not coexpress K8; hence, there are two distinct medullary subsets, namely a K8<sup>&#x02212;</sup>K14<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> stellate subset and a K8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>K14<sup>&#x02212;</sup> globular subset &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020146-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. In agreement with the previous results, in P3 normal thymus K14 expression was restricted to stellate medullary TECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g006">Figure 6</xref>D), whereas K8 expression was found throughout the TECs (unpublished data). We could not clarify whether these two keratins were coexpressed in the same TECs without double-staining. There were individual differences among mutants and these were prominently reflected in the histological abnormalities of the thymus at P3, but as the older surviving mutants all showed the same histopathologies of the thymus, the mutant thymi eventually seem to result in the same fate. It is unclear when <italic>K14-cre</italic> induction actually takes place in the mutant thymus, but as the population of cells showing a strong nuclear &#x003b2;-catenin staining as well as the cells expressing K14 were small and thymic epithelial compartments still existed in a mild P3 mutant thymus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g006">Figure 6</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020146-g006">6</xref>F), it seems that initial differentiation to medullary and cortical TECs and thymocyte colonization have already taken place prior to the major effects of <italic>K14</italic>-driven <italic>Apc</italic> loss. However, cells with nuclear &#x003b2;-catenin and K8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>K14<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> double-positive epithelial cells increased subsequently, associated with active proliferation in the latter group of cells and loss of TEC compartments. With age, &#x003b2;-catenin expression pattern became more diffuse and fewer epithelial cells showed nuclear localization but K8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>K14<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells remained, forming concentric structures of epithelial cells filled with hard keratin deposits and infiltrated with vast number of neutrophils and macrophages. Only a few epithelial cells were dividing and hardly any thymocytes were present by this time. These results suggest that with the deletion of <italic>Apc</italic> in TECs, stabililization and nuclear localization of &#x003b2;-catenin took place and subsequently these cells differentiated into keratinocytes that expressed both K14 and K8, similar to the basal cells of the skin, instead of TEC subsets. The expansion and differentiation of these keratinocytes lead to loss of proper thymic epithelial compartments and in turn produced and deposited the hard keratins that consequently caused vast amount of neutrophils and macrophages to infiltrate the thymus. These aberrant epithelial structures eventually have overtaken the whole of the thymus and driven out the colonized thymocytes. <italic>K14</italic>-driven loss of <italic>Apc</italic> and subsequent constitutive expression of &#x003b2;-catenin in TECs have therefore misdirected them to wrong epithelial cell fate, not allowing proper differentiation to either cortical or medullary TECs, which is essential for normal thymocyte development. This is not only evident from the lack of dividing thymocytes in the mutant thymus by P13, but also by the differential expression pattern of keratins, which were more skin-like than TEC-like. The importance of Apc function in thymic development has been demonstrated by thymocyte-specific loss of <italic>Apc</italic> by crossing a different strain of <italic>Apc</italic> conditional mice and LckCre transgenic mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020146-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. Here, by <italic>K14</italic>-driven TEC-specific loss of <italic>Apc,</italic> we have demonstrated its importance in thymus development not only in thymocytes but also in TECs.</p><p>It is of interest that dental abnormalities, such as supernumerary and impacted teeth similar to those observed in our mutant mice, are frequently seen in patients with Gardner's syndrome, carriers of <italic>APC</italic> germline mutation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020146-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;.

The PGK-neomycin cassette was inserted within intron 14 by recombineering technique. This cassette is sandwiched by 2 FRT sites that could be removed by crossing to FLPe-expressing mice. Positions of PCR primers used for genotyping PCR (F2, R2, R4) and RT-PCR (F546 and R721) are indicated. Positions of probe used for Southern blot analysis with NdeI sites are also shown.
