Since conversion of retinaldehyde to RA by retinaldehyde dehydrogenase type II (ALDH1A2, a.k.a RALDH2) is critical for cardiac development, we screened patients with congenital heart disease (CHDs) for genetic variation at the ALDH1A2 locus.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>One-hundred and thirty-three CHD patients were screened for genetic variation at the ALDH1A2 locus through bi-directional sequencing. In addition, six SNPs (rs2704188, rs1441815, rs3784259, rs1530293, rs1899430) at the same locus were studied using a TDT-based association approach in 101 CHD trios. Observed mutations were modeled through molecular mechanics (MM) simulations using the AMBER 9 package, Sander and Pmemd programs. Sequence conservation of observed mutations was evaluated through phylogenetic tree construction from ungapped alignments containing ALDH8 s, ALDH1Ls, ALDH1 s and ALDH2 s. Trees were generated by the Neighbor Joining method. Variations potentially affecting splicing mechanisms were cloned and functional assays were designed to test splicing alterations using the pSPL3 splicing assay.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We describe in Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) the mutations Ala151Ser and Ile157Thr that change non-polar to polar residues at exon 4. Exon 4 encodes part of the highly-conserved tetramerization domain, a structural motif required for ALDH oligomerization. Molecular mechanics simulation studies of the two mutations indicate that they hinder tetramerization. We determined that the SNP rs16939660, previously associated with spina bifida and observed in patients with TOF, does not affect splicing. Moreover, association studies performed with classical models and with the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) design using single marker genotype, or haplotype information do not show differences between cases and controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, our screen indicates that ALDH1A2 genetic variation is present in TOF patients, suggesting a possible causal role for this gene in rare cases of human CHD, but does not support the hypothesis that variation at the ALDH1A2 locus is a significant modifier of the risk for CHD in humans.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Congenital heart disease (CHD) was thought to be a multi-factorial, polygenic disease whose genes were as inscrutable as its postulated environmental agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Nowadays, some familial forms of CHD such as Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), Atrial Septal Defects (ASD), Ventricular Septal Defects (VSD) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] are explained by reduced dosage (haploinsufficiency) of genes with major roles in cardiac development such as transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], sarcomeric proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], extracellular matrix proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and ionic channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Haploinsufficiency of a number of these genes can produce similar phenotypes (locus heterogeneity) and the same mutation is often not manifested (incomplete penetrance), or is expressed as a different anatomical/functional entity in the context of single families (variable expression) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Therefore, CHD is heterogeneous even in the familial setting, suggesting that it has a more complex genetic basis than pure haploinsufficiency. It is likely that the instability caused by insufficient dosage of genes that are critical or permissive throughout cardiac development weakens cardiac morphogenesis, predisposing the embryo to a host of morphogenetic defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In this probabilistic view, defects could be triggered by unfavorable combinations of allelic variants of minor effect of cardiac development genes, by environmental insults such as changes in nutritional status (e.g. vitamin A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], or by exposure to toxic chemicals (e.g. alcohol) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In this sense, the morphological consequences of these alterations would be contingent on the particular developmental processes that were at play when regulatory mechanisms were overcome.</p><p>Genes belonging to retinoic acid (RA) metabolic and signaling pathways are targets for investigation as direct causal agents, or modifiers of CHD. RA is a powerful morphogen utilized during early development for axial patterning and, at later stages, for organogenesis. The vertebrate heart is particularly affected by variations in RA signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and either deprivation, or excess of its precursor (Vitamin A or retinol) at multiple developmental stages produces cardiac and vascular malformation in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>RA is a carotenoid that cannot be synthesized <italic>de novo </italic>by animals and thus, must be obtained from preformed animal-derived precursors such as retinyl esters and retinol (Vitamin A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], suggesting a direct link between nutritional status and teratogenesis. There are multiple metabolic routes to generate RA and these pathways require oxidative steps (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]). In humans, RA is synthesized from vitamin A (retinol). Retinol freely crosses membranes, but it is also transported to cells by retinol binding protein (RBP), which transfers retinol to cells via STRA-6, a membrane receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. STRA-6 is a target in congenital human diseases manifested by defects in eye, lung, heart and skeletal muscle, as well as by mental retardation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Within cells, retinol is successively oxidized to retinaldehyde and, then, to RA. The first step is reversible and is catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs), or by short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDRs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The second step is the irreversible conversion of retinaldehyde to RA. In vertebrates this reaction is catalyzed by retinaldehyde dehydrogenases (a.k.a. RALDHs) that belong to two aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) families, the ALDH1 s (all-trans and 9-cis retinaldehyde dehydrogenases ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2 and ALDH1A3) and the 9-cis retinaldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH8 s (a.k.a. RALDH4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Among RALDHs, ALDH1A2 is the major form involved in early embryonic and in cardiac development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The most severe form of RA signaling deprivation is the genetic deficiency of ALDH1A2, which is lethal at 8.5 days post-fertilization in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>In this study we used ALDH1A2 as an entry point to understand the relationship between RA metabolism and human CHD. Our goal was to establish whether the ALDH1A2 gene is a target for genetic alterations that could produce or, at least, modify the expression of human CHD. We utilized a two-pronged strategy based on a genetic screen to detect mutations carrying the potential to alter enzyme activity and a family-based genetic association study to inquire whether genetic variation at the ALDH1A2 locus modulates the risk to develop CHD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>A total of 133 trios (non-syndromic congenital heart disease patients with their parents) and seen at the Pediatric Cardiology Outpatient Clinic of the Heart Institute, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil were invited to participate in the study. Venous blood was obtained for genomic DNA extraction from each participant of the study. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of S&#x000e3;o Paulo Medical School and all participants read and signed an approved informed consent.</p></sec><sec><title>PCR and DNA sequencing</title><p>Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes by means of a salting-out procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. We have created specific genotyping assays for each genotyped marker. Briefly, the studied polymorphisms were detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay (PCR-RFLP). A 30-cycle PCR was carried out in a PTC-DNA Engine Tetrad2 using a 10 &#x003bc;L reactive solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 100 &#x003bc;M of each dNTP, 0.3 U Easy Taq DNA Polymerase, 5 pmol of each primer and 1 &#x003bc;L of genomic DNA template. PCR products were digested with 1 U of restriction enzyme and visualized by 3% agarose gel electrophoresis. Quality control for these assays was assessed by randomly selecting and re-assaying 40 samples. To genotype the A151G polymorphism we employed a direct sequencing strategy using primers directed against flanking regions of human ALDH1A2 exon 4. The DNA sequences were determined by bi-directional sequencing. For sequencing, the PCR products were purified with E.Z.N.A. Cycle-Pure Kit (200), Omega Bio-Tek, USA, according to manufacturer's instructions. Bidirectional direct sequencing was carried out using the Applied Biosystems (ABI, Foster City, CA) v3.1 Dye-Terminator Sequencing Kit and an ABI 377 Sequencer. The same strategy was employed to sequence the ALDH1A2 gene (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> - Supplemental table S1).</p></sec><sec><title>Bioinformatics tools</title><p>The localization (chromosome 15) and structure of ALDH1A2 gene was obtained from Ensembl <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/geneview?gene=ENSG00000128918">http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/geneview?gene=ENSG00000128918</ext-link>.

The stereo chemical quality of the structures was analyzed with Procheck [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The leap program, of AMBER 9 package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] was used to prepare the structure for molecular mechanics (MM) simulations. MM was carried in explicit solvent and MM trajectories were calculated using Sander and Pmemd programs, of AMBER 9 package. A cutoff of 8 &#x000c5; was used for electrostatic interactions. The solvated complex was equilibrated by carrying out a short steepest descent minimization, followed by 50 ps of heating (0 to 300 K) and 50 ps of density equilibration with weak restraints on the complex, ending with 6 ns of conformational exploration at 300 K. All simulations were run using the shake approach on hydrogen atoms, a 2 fs time step, and Langevin dynamics for temperature control. We calculated the potential energy for 600 monomer conformations wild type and mutant structures produced along the MM using the MM_PBSA program of AMBER9 package. To find the more energetically stable regions in the conformational space we estimated the inverse coefficient of variation (CV<sup>-1</sup>) for each 1 ns window of the MM simulation run. The most stable monomer configurations were identified as those with the lowest mean energy and highest CV<sup>-1 </sup>Mutant dimer and tetramer models were built using non-crystallographic symmetry obtained from PDB <ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="2BI9">2BI9</ext-link> for monomer configurations of lowest energy.

A possible association between presence of a particular genotyped allele and disease was tested through the TDT test, performed with Haploview 3.2. Haplotype analyses were conducted using the Haploview TDT association test. We considered p values less than 0, 05 on a 2-sided test as significant. Using the Quanto software Version 1.2.3 and considering the tested sample and markers we anticipate an eighty percent statistical power to detect an effect size (odds ratio) of 3,0 for the rarer observed haplotype (0,05) and 2,3 for the commonest observed haplotype (0,31).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Mutation screening in CHD</title><p>To test whether the ALDH1A2 gene is a target for mutations in human CHD we employed DHPLC (denaturing high performance liquid chromatography) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] followed by bi-directional DNA sequencing in a group of patients with multiple CHD etiologies (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> - Supplemental table S3). DNA fragments corresponding to all ALDH1A2 exons were PCR amplified and submitted to DHPLC, and those displaying altered elution profiles were selected for bi-directional sequencing. This first screening in a heterogeneous CHD setting revealed 6 alterations: one c.A453G transition previously characterized as a synonymous, p.Ala151Ala, polymorphism (rs16939660) associated with spina bifida [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and five intronic alterations (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). None of these changes occurred within the Kozak sequence. As these alterations are potentially associated with only a modest to low risk of genetic defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], we hypothesized that the failure to detect ALDH1A2 variants associated with high risk of CHD was due to insufficient numbers of patients in each of the CHD categories represented.

Very often, the structural and functional importance of a particular amino acid is underscored by its evolutionary conservation. To evaluate the extent to which Ala151 and Ile157 are conserved, and, therefore, more likely to be required for protein structure and function, we produced an alignment of vertebrate ALDH1As.

In these analyses the wild-type structure yielded four highly stable conformations (-8,264 Kcal/mol for the most stable of them) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>), while p.Ala151Ser and p.Ile157Thr mutant proteins produced four and seven highly stable conformations, with -8,105 Kcal/mol and -8,296 Kcal/mol for the most stable conformations of p.Ala151Ser and p.Ile157Thr mutants, respectively (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref> - Supplemental Figure S1).</p><p>The superimposition of stable mutant structures upon the native structure generated RMSDs (root mean square deviations) of 3.18 &#x000c5; and 7.36 &#x000c5; for Ala151Ser and p.Ile157Thr, respectively, indicating that p.Ile157Thr produces more pronounced structural changes than p.Ala151Ser. Since both p.Ala151Ser and p.Ile157Thr are located at the tetramerization domain, which is the oligomerization structure responsible for formation of protein dimers and tetramers, we evaluated whether these mutations would interfere with the ability of monomers to associate in dimers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E-I</xref>), or with the capability of dimers to join in as tetramers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2J-M</xref>). We first evaluated the effects of mutations upon dimer formation. As indicated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>, both mutations change the conformation of the three stranded beta-sheet of the tetramerization domain. This disrupts the delicate interaction network that occurs between the dimerization surfaces of interacting monomers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I</xref>). By its turn, disruption of interactive surfaces induces alterations in dimer coupling that are also reflected in the protein surfaces utilized for tetramerization These effects are demonstrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2L</xref>, which depicts a large clashing region that includes the three-stranded beta-sheets of the tetramerization domains of p.Ile157Thr mutant and wild type heterotetramers.

This analysis indicated that the non-conservative p.Ala151Ser (G451T transversion) and the synonymous mutation p.Ala151Ala (c.A453G transition) both map to a putative binding site (CGAAGGC) for the splicing factor SF2/ASF within exon 4 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A-C</xref>).

This indicates that the mutation increased, rather than decreased, the splicing strength of exon 4. In contrast, the p.Ala151Ala/c.A453G polymorphism is not associated with significant changes in the ability to correctly splice exon 4 (28,0 &#x000b1; 2,9% exclusion of exon 4 for mutant c.A453G, versus 24,0 &#x000b1; 2,8% for the wild type; p = 0.36; two-tailed, paired T-test) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>).</p><p>Since synonymous changes can also affect splicing function by interfering with mRNA secondary structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], we investigated whether the c.A453G transition was consistent with significant changes in this parameter.

Our results indicate that there are, indeed, rare non-conservative mutations at deeply conserved positions in the ALDH1A2 molecule that carry an elevated risk of functional consequences. The frequency of these ALDH1A2 mutants is low, but not appreciably different from the frequency displayed by cardiac-enriched transcription factors such as Nkx2-5 or GATA-4 in sporadic CHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Therefore, our results with ALDH1A2 mutations in TOF are consistent with the emerging view that CHD is a highly heterogeneous disease that does not display a clear group of major genes responsible for most cases.</p><sec><title>Evidence for a functional importance of ALDH1A2 mutations in TOF</title><p>Several lines of evidence point towards the functional consequences of the observed mutations. First, they are very rare mutations, not present in any of the chromosomes from 150 normal individuals and only observed in two single probands from more than 100 screened CHD probands. Second, they lie in extremely conserved regions of the protein, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. Third, structural modeling of the mutated amino acids predicts severe shifts in ALDH1A2 spatial conformation, with disruptive influences in dimerization and tetramerization. The modeling strategy used in the present manuscript is robust. Molecular mechanics simulation has advanced to the point that it is possible to model mutations accurately, providing direct structural tests of enzyme catalysis models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Moreover, ALDH1 enzymes are extremely well characterized from structural and functional standpoints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and their substrate preferences have been accurately established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. This makes this class of enzymes appropriate for structural modeling approaches that extract insights into enzyme properties without the necessity for biochemical analyses. Finally, the phenotypes associated with each of the two mutations that we describe are tightly linked to mature structures that receive critical contributions from embryonic tissues such as conotruncal ridges, atrioventricular cushions and muscular interventricular septum, tissues which have been previously documented as major targets for imbalances produced by genetic manipulation of the RA signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Limited penetrance of ALDH1A2 mutations in TOF</title><p>The mutations that we described are present in unaffected parents of the studied probands. The simplest explanation for the lack of correlation between mutation and a cardiac phenotype in the parents of probands is that the mutation is not causally related to the phenotype. However, there are multiple and well known alternative reasons why mutations may not be associated with obvious cardiac manifestations in parents. In addition to producing exuberant cardiac phenotypes such as hypoplastic ventricles, large ventricular septal defects and double outlet right ventricle, mice haploinsufficient for the key retinoic acid receptor RXRalpha also display minor cardiac defects such as cleft mitral or tricuspid valve, disorganized trabeculae and displastic papillary muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These subtle phenotypes may easily escape detection, either because they were manifested only transiently during embryogenesis, or because they are not enough to promote symptoms, even if present in adults. It is also well known that defective RA signaling stemming from Aldh1a2 haploinsufficiency in mice can be expressed as non-cardiac alterations such as vascular, laryngeal, tracheal, thymus and parathyroid defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Some of these non-cardiac defects are subtle and will only be detected by specific diagnostic procedures. In addition, they may not have reached enough physiological significance to be noticed at the time of physical examination of parents. Thus, extra cardiac defects may have gone unnoticed in parents and may not have been deemed important in the familiar history. Unfortunately, we were not able to screen other members of these families, nor could we submit the non-penetrant individuals, namely the father of the proband harboring the Ala151Ser mutation, nor the mother of the proband harboring the p.Ile157Thr mutation, to more detailed phenotypic assessments such as trans-esophageal echocardiography, or multislice computed tomography, which could have unveiled even some of the subtle phenotypes mentioned above. In sum, the ALDH1A2 mutations that we describe in TOF may not be fully penetrant. However, non-penetrance is not restricted to the mutations we described, but is, rather, a common feature in most, if not all, of the described genes that may cause CHD in humans such as PTPN11 in Noonan Syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], KCNQ1 in Long QT Syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] and troponin T in Familial Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p><p>Taken together, our data suggest that these rare mutations display a concrete potential to disrupt activity of the ALDH1A2 gene and contribute to the expression of congenital defects in CHD. Nonetheless, we acknowledge the tentative nature of our conclusions and point out that further functional assays and reproduction of these mutations in the context of genetically modified animals (e.g. knock-in mice) is required before any definitive conclusions can be reached.</p></sec><sec><title>Association between the ALDH1A2 Ile157Thr mutation, TOF and Wilms Tumor</title><p>The complex phenotype displayed by the proband harboring the ALDH1A2 p.Ile157Thr mutation calls into question the possibility that TOF in this patient was caused by the same factor (s) underlying Wilms tumor disease. We believe this possibility is extremely unlikely. CHD and, in particular, TOF, is an exceptionally rare component in the constellation of Wilms tumor manifestations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], with only two cases of TOF associated with Wilms tumor, but in the context of trisomy 18 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].

Of germ line mutations, most are de novo cases and only a minority of those is manifested in families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Furthermore, neither TOF, nor other cardiac outflow tract malformations have been reported for WT-1-null mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. It is highly unlikely that the unilateral Wilms tumor displayed by the proband harboring the Ile157Thr is causally related to his TOF phenotype. We believe that the most probable scenario is that a germ line Aldh1a2 mutation is causally linked to TOF, while somatic mutation (s) are responsible for the unilateral Wilms tumor. Finally, it should be noted that no other syndromic features were observed in this patient, and that he did not present a clinical diagnosis compatible with other conditions associated with childhood tumors and congenital heart disease (i.e., Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome or the conditions associated with RAS/MAP kinase pathway mutations).</p></sec><sec><title>Exon 4 as a hot spot for ALDH1A2 variants?</title><p>Our attention has been drawn by the fact that three out of five exonic alterations that we found in the ALDH1A2 gene in CHD are concentrated in exon 4, which encodes part of the tetramerization domain. The silent p.Ala151Ala mutation (c.A453G transition) and the non-conservative p.Ala151Ser mutation map to the same cistron, while the p.Ile157Thr is located only 6 cistrons apart. As demonstrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, the p.Ala151Ser impacts exon 4 splicing. p.Ala151Ser has a strong positive effect upon exon 4 splicing, virtually eliminating mRNAs that exclude exon 4, while p.Ala151Ala does not significantly decreases the ability to correctly splice exon 4. These results suggest that exon 4 is normally controlled by weak splicing signals and that it may be susceptible to splicing mutations. The skipping of exon 4 has severe consequences for the protein. Besides losing 60% of the tetramerization domain (23 amino acids), it introduces a frame shift after Ala121, which creates 26 aberrant amino acids followed by a termination codon that truncates the protein (data not shown). In summary splicing alterations involving exon 4 and the tetramerization domain are bound to have significant effects on protein structure and function.</p></sec><sec><title>Lack of association between the silent mutation p.Ala151Ala (rs16939660) and CHD</title><p>Silent mutations have been reported to be associated and/or to produce phenotypes through multiple mechanisms such as: splicing effects, i.e. by disrupting splicing signals (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>], or by changing mRNA folding/structure so as to induce conformational changes in the regions of exonic splicing enhancers that interfere with splicing factor binding (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]; mRNA stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>], or due to the switch from common to rare codons, which could, in principle, produce delays in protein synthesis and changes in protein folding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Therefore, the identification of a silent p.Ala151Ala mutation previously associated to spina bifida [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] in our group of TOF patients prompted us to investigate the potential functional consequences of this mutation in splicing and in predicted mRNA structure. We have shown that p.Ala151Ala is associated with a minor, non-significant reduction of exon 4 splicing and with a major predicted change in mRNA folding. Overall, we believe that those features of the p.Ala151Ala silent mutation merit further investigation, but that current evidence is not consistent with any sizeable functional effects in the specific context of CHD. Our current interpretation is supported by our study with the p.Ala151Ala mutation, which failed to provide evidence for an association between this polymorphism and CHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Lack of evidence for ALDH1A2 as a modifier in CHD</title><p>In this work we also explored the possibility that the ALDH1A2 gene is a modifier of the risk to develop CHD. Using known polymorphic markers, we established that the ALDH1A2 gene encompasses only two LD blocks in the studied population and that none of the alleles investigated, whether, singly or in combination, were associated with a statistically significant protection or predisposition towards CHD. It should the highlighted, however, that the tested sample size would only have significant statistical power to detect effect sizes (odds ratio) in the order of 2,0 to 3,0, depending on the tested allele or haplotype (see Methods section).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our screen indicates that non-conservative ALDH1A2 mutations are associated with rare cases of human CHD and that ALDH1A2 polymorphisms (e.g. c.A453G) display functional differences in mRNA splicing and mRNA half-life that merit further functional investigation in the context of cell culture or genetically modified animals. In conclusion, our screen is the first pass of a research program to probe the role of ALDH1A2 in human CHD. While it represents a limited view of the CHD universe, it is sufficient to cast doubts on any major role for the ALDH1A2 gene as a determinant of CHD or as a modulator of its risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>Pavan, M.; Ruiz V.F.; Silva, F.A., Cravo R.M.; Vasconcelos, M. and Marques, L.P. conducted mutation screening, and genotyping; Sobreira, T.J.P. conducted structural modeling dynamics; Pavan, M. performed splicing experiments; Mesquita, S.M.F.; and Lopes, A.A.B. were responsible for patient selection; Oliveira, P.S.L. supervised structural modeling dynamics; Krieger, J.E.; Pereira, A.C., and Xavier-Neto J. conceived the investigation program.
