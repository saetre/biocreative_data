One cannot dismiss the possibility that at least a small fraction of the large number of novel ORPhan genes detected in pan-genome and metagenomic studies arose by overprinting.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The origin of novelty is one of the central questions in evolutionary biology. Paralogy, orthology, and xenology, as well as domain shuffling between genes, account for a large part of the evolution of protein families at the sequence level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. All these mechanisms require the previous existence of coding sequences. Whether novel sequences in cells could arise from spontaneous point mutation remains an open question.</p><p>In some cases, two or more genes are known to be encoded in the same DNA region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Overlapping genes have been known since the beginning of virus complete genome sequencing, as exemplified by the gene B of the single stranded DNA bacteriophage &#x003d5;X174, which is completely contained within gene A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. It has been suggested that overlapping genes originate by spontaneous point mutation due to a mechanism known as overprinting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Overlapping genes could arise by: a) extension of one ORF into other by loss of a stop codon; b) shift to an upstream initiation codon in adjacent genes; or by c) generation of a totally new ORF inside a previous existing ORF by point mutation. The different ways in which two overlapping genes can be coded are known as phases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and the different phases determine, in turn, the evolutionary pressure that overlapping genes exert on each other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>In has been shown that overprinting is an important mechanism for the origin of new genes in viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Overlapped genes are also a relative common feature of prokaryotic genomes. For instance, it has been suggested that in prokaryotes, where approximately 80% of the overlaps comprise less than 30 base pairs, the phase of coding and their distribution, among other characteristics of overlapping genes are most consistent with the hypothesis that overlaps participate in the regulation of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. A comparative study among the genomes of <italic>Mycoplasma genitalium </italic>and <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae </italic>found that most overlapped genes were generated primarily due to the loss of a stop codon, the absence of which resulted in elongation of the 3' end of the gene's coding region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Overlapped genes can also be classified according to their direction of transcription into three categories, namely "convergent" (-&#x0003e; &#x0003c;-), "unidirectional" (-&#x0003e; -&#x0003e;) and "divergent" (&#x0003c;- -&#x0003e;). In a study that included the analysis of complete genome sequences from 50 bacterial species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] it was shown that most overlapped genes are coded following the unidirectional pattern. This pattern was confirmed in a comparative study among nine bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Overlapped genes have also been found in mitochondria. For instance, a small protein [UniProtKB: Q6EMS7] of 66 amino acids (gene A6L) overlaps 40 bases into the gene coding for ATPase-6 in bovine mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Because the formation of overlapping genes necessarily involves the evolution of a coding region from non-coding DNA or from a different frame in coding DNA, their study might help to understand <italic>de novo </italic>evolution of coding regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The pattern of natural selection among 71 pairs of 3' overlapping genes (all of them having an overlap larger than 15 nucleotides) conserved at least in two prokaryotic genomes showed a statistically significant bias toward the 123/132 phase, thus ensuring the least mutual constraint on non-conservative amino acid replacements in both overlapping coding sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Here, we show that the mechanism of overprinting has also contributed to the origin of a new gene of identifiable function in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We have identified a possible case of evolution of a new gene and a new function by overprinting in <italic>E. coli </italic>K12.

The genes are coded in the 123/213 phase (<italic>htgA </italic>in the (+) strand, and <italic>yaaW </italic>in the (-) strand), meaning that the third nucleotide of the (+) codon overlaps with the 3 nucleotide of the (-) codon.

With the advent of the molecular structure of nucleic acids and proteins, the concept of homology was further refined to describe more precisely the phylogenetic relationships among genes (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]). Accordingly, genes separated by speciation events are referred as <italic>orthologs</italic>, genes duplicated inside the same genome are named as <italic>paralogs</italic>, and horizontally transferred genes are known as <italic>xenologs</italic>. Further on, in symbiogenesis lineages of homologous genes previously separated by lineage divergence, became associated in a single cellular system. The term <italic>synology </italic>has been proposed to describe the phylogenetic relationship among such genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, no terminology has been employed to describe the phylogenetic relationship between homologous overlapping genes. We suggest the term <italic>janology </italic>(from the two-faced Roman deity <italic>Jano</italic>) for the homology relationship among the sequences sharing the same DNA.</p><p>Other cases of novel genes have been described (i.e., <italic>Jingwey</italic>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]; <italic>Sphinx</italic>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>];<italic>Morpheus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]) and the origin of novel sequences through overprinting in viruses is well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a novel gene originated through overprinting has been carefully described in a cell.</p><p>Caution should be taken since the existence of the <italic>htgA </italic>gene remains controversial. Although the gene has been cloned and its product originally characterized as a positive regulator of sigma 32 heat shock promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], a recent study shows that this gene is not induced by sigma 32 as previously suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Moreover, the initiation codon of <italic>htgA </italic>have recently being changed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and one of the predicted copies of <italic>htgA </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) has a smaller size due to a non-sense mutation. Given that there has not been more experimental work carried on <italic>htgA</italic>, we rely on indirect evidence of its existence based on the statistically significant lowering rate of evolution of those sequences putatively coding for <italic>htgA</italic>. It is worth mentioning that available evidence for the role of <italic>htgA </italic>included cloning of the <italic>htgA </italic>gene, RNA isolation and Northern (RNA) blots, protein labeling, and promoter mapping experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. One possibility for the lack of sigma 32 induction is that, as suggested by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], <italic>htgA </italic>either requires additional regulators or is not recognized by sigma 32. Our study should stimulate more research on this subject in order to elucidate the true nature of <italic>htgA</italic>.</p><p>There is no available experimental evidence of the existence of the protein product of <italic>yaaW</italic>. Nevertheless, <italic>i</italic>) the existence of homolog sequences to <italic>yaaW </italic>in different genomes; <italic>ii</italic>) the fusion of <italic>yaaW </italic>sequences to other protein domains (a GTPase domain in this case); and <italic>iii</italic>) the higher ratio of <italic>ps </italic>versus <italic>pn </italic>substitutions, strongly suggest that <italic>yaaW </italic>truly codes for a functional polypeptide. Here we propose that <italic>htgA </italic>originated by overprinting (<italic>de novo </italic>origination of a new gene from a non-coding frame in DNA in a prokaryotic genome) at some moment in the clade leading to <italic>E. coli </italic>and <italic>Shigella flexneri </italic>species.</p><p>Recently, a survey of genetic diversity on the Sargasso Sea using shot-gun technology showed the existence of large number of previously undetected new genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Using a different approach, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] have shown the existence of an open pan-genome for the species <italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic>. This indicates that the genome of <italic>S. agalactiae </italic>is constantly exchanging genes with other organisms in its environment and that novel sequenced genomes from this species will exhibit an approximate of 30 new genes not previously found in the other strains. In a recent re-annotation of <italic>E. coli </italic>genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], it was shown that despite much effort in understanding the functions of each gene, there still a number of uncharacterized genes unique to the genome of <italic>E. coli </italic>(the gene products of unknown function are divided into those containing a conserved domain (N = 145, 3.3%), those with (N = 233, 5.3%) or without (N = 238, 5.3%) a detectable homolog in the sequence databases). All these approaches suggest the existence of a large number of as yet uncharacterized new genes in the biosphere. This opens the possibility that some of such novel genes arose through point mutation from coding (overprinting) as well as non-coding sequences. It also suggests that the origin of the <italic>novo </italic>sequences is an ongoing process in prokaryotic evolution.</p><p>The number of gene and protein families in the biosphere continues to be an open area of research. For instance, the 1.69 release of SCOP database has 1536 superfamilies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and this is certainly an underestimate. The origin of each one of these families continues to be a matter of debate and several mechanisms may be involved. Overprinting is a clear example of how new protein families can originate independently from non-coding sequences. If the new gene (or the new region of the gene resulting from the loss of a stop codon) is in a different strand or in a different coding frame than the other overlapping gene, a new coding sequence is being generated <italic>de novo</italic>. If this new coding region is transcribed and translated and the product is able to fold properly, natural selection could recruit this protein for some function, and if successful, it can be fixed in the population, and may in the long term represent the origin of a new protein/domain family.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have described the origin of a novel gene of known function through overprinting in a prokaryote. Due to the wider phylogenetic distribution of <italic>yaaW</italic>, parsimony favors the origin of <italic>htgA </italic>by overprinting inside an already existing <italic>yaaW </italic>gene. The evidence of <italic>htgA </italic>being a functional gene is experimental [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], while the evidence for <italic>yaaW </italic>comes from: <italic>i</italic>) the existence of homolog sequences to <italic>yaaW </italic>in different genomes; <italic>ii</italic>) the fusion of <italic>yaaW </italic>sequences to other protein domains (a GTPase domain in this case); and <italic>iii</italic>) and the higher ratio of <italic>ps </italic>versus <italic>pn </italic>substitutions among <italic>yaaW </italic>sequences. Intriguingly there is no evidence of the action of positive natural selection among <italic>htgA </italic>homologs. This can be explained by a high degree of restriction imposed by <italic>yaaW </italic>due to the 123/213 phase of the overlap. The lower rate of evolution of <italic>yaaW </italic>sequences having an overlapped <italic>htgA </italic>gene is explained by the higher constraints of a DNA sequence coding for two genes. If our interpretation of the above evidence is correct, it is likely that the origin of <italic>de novo </italic>sequences from non-coding DNA in prokaryotes is an ongoing process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We have searched for all strict pairs of completely overlapped genes in available <italic>E.coli </italic>complete genomes. We have found 227 pairs of such genes (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). After the exclusion of all overlapped genes annotated as: a) hypothetical; b) related to phages; c) lack of homologs to one (or both) of the overlapped genes, there are 7 pairs left. Among these seven pairs, there is experimental evidence for the existence of the hypothetically newer gene (the one with fewer homologs) only the <italic>htgA</italic>-<italic>yaaW </italic>pairs (three pairs). Among the four pairs left, the pair conformed by the molecular chaperone DnaK (GI identification number: 26245936; 500 homologs found) and the putative glutamate dehydrogenase (GI identification number: 26245935; 6 homologs found) looks like a promising alternative.
