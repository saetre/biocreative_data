Variants of <italic>HFE </italic>are relatively common in the general population and are most commonly associated with iron overload, but can promote subclinical cellular iron loading even in the absence of clinically identified disease. The effects of the variants as well as the resulting cellular iron dyshomeostasis potentially impact a number of disease-associated pathways. We tested the hypothesis that the two most common HFE variants, H63D and C282Y, would affect cellular secretion of cytokines and trophic factors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We screened a panel of cytokines and trophic factors using a multiplexed immunoassay in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells expressing different variants of HFE. The influence of cellular iron secretion on the potent chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) was assessed using ferric ammonium citrate and the iron chelator, desferroxamine. Additionally, an antioxidant, Trolox, and an anti-inflammatory, minocycline, were tested for their effects on MCP-1 secretion in the presence of HFE variants.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Expression of the HFE variants altered the labile iron pool in SH-SY5Y cells. Of the panel of cytokines and trophic factors analyzed, only the release of MCP-1 was affected by the HFE variants. We further examined the relationship between iron and MCP-1 and found MCP-1 secretion tightly associated with intracellular iron status. A potential direct effect of HFE is considered because, despite having similar levels of intracellular iron, the association between HFE genotype and MCP-1 expression was different for the H63D and C282Y HFE variants. Moreover, HFE genotype was a factor in the effect of minocycline, a multifaceted antibiotic used in treating a number of neurologic conditions associated with inflammation, on MCP-1 secretion.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results demonstrate that HFE polymorphisms influence the synthesis and release of MCP-1. The mechanism of action involves cellular iron status but it appears there could be additional influences such as ER stress. Finally, these data demonstrate a pharmacogenetic effect of HFE polymorphisms on the ability of minocycline to inhibit MCP-1 secretion.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Iron accumulation in various brain regions is associated with the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases. The relationship between loss of brain iron homeostasis and the diseases appears to be generation of oxidative stress and exacerbation of inflammatory responses. The degree to which loss of iron homeostasis contributes to cell dysfunction and loss is not clear. Cellular iron homeostasis involves the complex interaction of numerous proteins, and genetic variants in genes encoding these proteins may influence this process and hence pathogenesis and disease progression. Polymorphisms in the <italic>major histocompatibility complex class 1-like </italic>gene known as <italic>HFE </italic>have been proposed as genetic modifiers of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], Alzheimer's disease (AD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], Parkinson's disease (PD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The HFE protein is primarily thought to regulate transferrin-mediated cellular iron intake through its interaction with the transferrin receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], but a recent study from our laboratory suggests a potentially broader role in cell function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The H63D HFE variant appears deficient in reducing the affinity of the transferrin receptor for transferrin, while the C282Y HFE variant aggregates in the endoplasmic reticulum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. These HFE variants are thought to underlie the iron overload disorder known as hemochromatosis, but appear to have low penetration rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Nonetheless, there is little disagreement that HFE variants impact iron status at the cellular level independent of clinical disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Cellular iron dysregulation has the potential to indirectly impact numerous disease-associated pathways. Our study is focused on the link between cellular iron regulation and secretion of soluble mediators of inflammatory reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Iron dysregulation in neuronal cells induces toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], potentially resulting in recruitment of inflammatory cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. One factor proposed to contribute to the relentless progression associated with many neurodegenerative diseases is the recruitment and activation of microglia in the regions of neuronal death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. As mediators of innate immunity in the central nervous system, microglia respond to a variety of cytokines and chemokines and in turn secrete a variety of inflammatory mediators and trophic factors which likely contribute to neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis.</p><p>By influencing cellular iron homeostasis, we hypothesize that HFE variants may differentially impact secretion of cytokines and trophic factors, which may explain the association of these alleles with various diseases. In the current study we determine the influence of HFE variants and iron regulation on cellular secretion of factors relevant to neurodegenerative disease and explore mechanisms underlying these relationships.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell lines and human astrocytoma cell lines U251 and U138 MG, were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA).

This cell line was chosen because it lacks endogenous HFE expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. As a control, we also transfected cells with vector alone. Transfected cells were maintained in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine, 1&#x000d7; nonessential amino acids, 1.8 g/L sodium bicarbonate, and 250 &#x003bc;g/mL Geneticin. Prior to use, cells were differentiated for four to six days in 10 &#x003bc;M all-trans retinoic acid and the genotype of each cell line was confirmed by sequencing. Vector control cells were included in analyses to control for phenotypic changes associated with the cell transfection. The more direct control for the HFE polymorphisms, however, is the Wt HFE transfected cells, because of the effect of Wt/Wt HFE on cellular iron status that does not occur in the cells transfected with vector alone which do not express HFE (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Confirmation of cell transfection</bold>.

Prior to use, cells were differentiated with 10 &#x003bc;M all-trans retinoic acid to induce a neuronal phenotype. Expression of FLAG-tagged HFE was confirmed in the cells, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>. Relative iron levels were determined in cells using the iron sensitive dye calcein-AM, whose fluorescence is quenched by binding iron. The cells transfected with vector alone do not contain HFE and have iron levels similar to the cells carrying the H63D alleles. Intracellular iron is decreased by the presence of the Wt HFE, consistent with the known functions of the HFE protein, compared to the vector alone group as well as the cells carrying the HFE allelic variants. To determine the effects of HFE polymorphisms, the comparisons are limited to the cells expressing HFE and thus do not include the vector alone transfected cells. The intracellular level of labile iron was affected by the presence of HFE in these cells in the pattern of C282Y (p &#x0003c; 0.001 vs. Wt) &#x0003e; H63D (p &#x0003c; 0.05 vs. Wt) &#x0003e; Wt (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).

These data suggest MCP-1 is regulated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels and that the mutant proteins or iron status can affect the regulation.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>MCP-1 mRNA expression and nuclear NF-&#x003ba;B</bold>.

Therefore, as an additional model, we utilized two human astrocytoma cell lines, U251 and U138, to study the effect of cellular iron status on MCP-1 secretion. Both cell lines were genotyped for the <italic>H63D </italic>and <italic>C282Y HFE </italic>variants (S.Y. Lee, unpublished). The <italic>Wt/Wt HFE </italic>U251 cells were characterized by higher intracellular labile iron levels (p &#x0003c; 0.01) compared to the <italic>H63D/Wt HFE </italic>U138 cells and had higher constitutive MCP-1 release (p &#x0003c; 0.001) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). In order to determine if iron levels were related to the differences in MCP-1 secretion, cells were treated with DFO or FAC. Following treatment with DFO (50 &#x003bc;M), the secretion of MCP-1 was reduced by 77% (p &#x0003c; 0.001) in U138 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>) and by 66% (p &#x0003c; 0.05) in U251 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). Iron loading (100 &#x003bc;M FAC) resulted in a 41% increase of MCP-1 secretion in U138 cells (p &#x0003c; 0.01) with, but this concentration of FAC had no effect in U251 cells. A doubling of the FAC concentration to 200 &#x003bc;M did increase MCP-1 secretion by 107% in U251 cells (p &#x0003c; 0.001). Thus, regardless of endogenous <italic>HFE </italic>genotype in the astrocytoma cell lines, secretion of MCP-1 was reduced by similar concentrations of an iron chelator, and MCP-1 secretion could be induced by iron; the effective concentration of iron did differ based on HFE genotype. Additionally, the influence of iron on MCP-1 secretion was studied in mouse microglial BV-2 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). Iron chelation with 20 &#x003bc;M DFO produced a maximal inhibition of MCP-1 release of 22% (p &#x0003c; 0.01), and treatment with 100 &#x003bc;M FAC produced a maximal increase in MCP-1 release of 22% (p &#x0003c; 0.05).

Iron status also affects the level of cellular oxidative stress. Therefore to investigate the possibility that oxidative stress could be influencing the release of MCP-1, the stably transfected SH-SY5Y cells were treated for 48 hours with Trolox, a water-soluble form of vitamin E. Additionally, cells were treated with minocycline, an antibiotic with iron chelation, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and mitochondria-protective properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], because this drug has been explored for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

MCP-1 is known to recruit and enhance the activation of cells of the monocyte lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Higher levels of MCP-1 have been found in CSF and plasma in association with diseases characterized by excessive inflammation including ALS and AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and in both of these diseases multiple reports exist that <italic>HFE </italic>gene variants, particularly the <italic>H63D </italic>polymorphism, are risk factors for the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Additionally, previous studies from our group and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] have determined a positive correlation between age and expression of MCP-1, which may play a role in the higher incidence of neurodegenerative diseases at advanced ages. Furthermore, Lawless et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] demonstrated that individuals with hemochromatosis who were homozygous for the <italic>C282Y </italic>allele had lower median plasma levels of MCP-1. Those hemochromatosis patients with at least one <italic>H63D </italic>allele, however, had higher median plasma levels of MCP-1 compared to <italic>Wt/Wt </italic>control subjects. These findings are consistent with the data using neuroblastoma cells reported herein.</p><p>In this study we have utilized a stably-transfected human neuroblastoma cell culture model to elucidate the consequences of <italic>HFE </italic>gene variants on MCP-1 expression. There are two key observations in this study. First is that H63D-expressing neuroblastoma cells have more iron than Wt HFE cells and secrete more MCP1. Secondly, the relationship between MCP1 secretion and iron is altered in the presence of the C282Y HFE variant via a mechanism which appears to be post-transcriptional or post-translational. The decreased expression of MCP-1 in the C282Y HFE cells may be related to the increased expression of Hsp70 in these cells. Our results on MCP-1 secretion in the C282Y cells are not consistent with a report using transiently-transfected HEK-293 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Our data suggest that iron could be a driving factor behind the secretion of MCP-1 and the transient transfection of cells already expressing Wt HFE may not compare well to our model. The expression of both Wt and C282Y forms of HFE in a cell model may have a confounding effect on MCP-1 secretion. It is also possible that the effect on MCP-1 secretion, as shown with the non-transfected astrocytoma cells in our study, is cell specific.</p><p>To determine the effect of cellular iron status on MCP-1 secretion, the cells were treated with either an iron chelator or iron was added to the media. In both the neuroblastoma cells and astrocytoma cells, the Wt and H63D cells and the non-HFE expressing vector control neuroblastoma cells, chelating the iron with DFO resulted in a decrease in MCP-1 expression. Iron chelation failed to decrease MCP-1 expression in the C282Y HFE cells. The addition of iron increased MCP-1 expression only in Wt neuroblastoma cells and both genotypes in the astrocytoma cells. Thus in general, it appears that the expression of MCP-1 can be manipulated by altering iron status. There is, however, an interaction of genotype and cell type that influences the MCP-1 expression independent of iron status. For example, the Wt neuroblastoma cells have less iron and less MCP-1 expression than the H63D-expressing cells. However, the reverse occurs in the astrocytoma cell lines; the Wt cells have more iron in the labile iron pool and more MCP-1 expression than the cells carrying the H63D allele. The astrocytoma cells are heterozygotic for the H63D variant and thus the baseline differences in iron status from Wt/Wt and the effect on MCP-1 secretion may reflect a heterozygotic effect. The astrocytoma cells also differ in genetic background. In the context of our study, regardless of cell type and <italic>HFE </italic>genotype, MCP-1 secretion was increased by increasing cellular iron and decreased by iron chelation, with the exception of cells expressing C282Y HFE. Thus it appears that C282Y HFE has an independent effect on secretion of MCP-1 that negates the effects of iron.</p><p>These data suggest that there is an additional function of the C282Y HFE mutant protein that is impacting MCP-1 secretion. Effects of the C282Y HFE variant contributing to the iron overload condition, hereditary hemochromatosis, have been suggested to result from induction of the ER overload and unfolded protein responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Subsequent effects of these latter responses include activation of NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and potential activation of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], which have been associated with overexpression of C282Y HFE in one cell model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. However, we found no difference in nuclear localization of NF-&#x003ba;B in our cell lines and have suggested a post-transcriptional or post-translational effect on MCP-1 that may be directly influenced by the mutant HFE protein.</p><p>The relationship between iron status, HFE status, and MCP-1 secretion prompted analysis of the known regulatory mechanisms for MCP-1 in these cells. MCP-1 is thought to be regulated mainly at the transcriptional level, responding to a variety of transcription factors. In neuroblastoma cell lines, the presence of the H63D and C282Y forms of HFE were associated with higher levels of MCP-1 mRNA than in the wildtype cells. The levels of MCP-1 mRNA were similar to that seen in the vector only cells. A large number of studies have explored the upregulation of MCP-1 by NF-kB, an oxidative stress-sensitive transcription factor which might explain the relationship between increased iron and MCP-1. However, nuclear localization of NF-&#x003ba;B did not vary by <italic>HFE </italic>genotypes, and thus iron status, in our model, consistent with a previous report that iron status did not affect baseline nuclear NF-&#x003ba;B in microglial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>A likely mechanism through which cellular iron status affects cell stress and MCP-1 regulation is through the formation of reactive oxygen species. In the present study the antioxidant Trolox had no significant effect on MCP-1 secretion in any of the SH-SY5Y cell lines. It is possible that the length of treatment (72 hours) was not sufficient to impact MCP-1 synthesis or release; however, longer duration of treatment showed evidence of cellular toxicity (data not shown).</p><p>An additional pharmaceutical intervention we examined was minocycline. Minocycline has been explored for use in treating a number of neuroinflammatory conditions including ALS, AD, PD, multiple sclerosis, and ischemic stroke. This compound has iron chelation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], antioxidant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], anti-inflammatory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], caspase-inhibitory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], and mitochondria-protective properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In the present study, effects of treating cells with minocycline varied with <italic>HFE </italic>genotype, significantly decreasing MCP-1 release in the two SH-SY5Y cell lines with the highest MCP-1 secretion.</p><p>The multifaceted nature of minocycline causes uncertainty of the specific contribution of each mechanism of action. Minocycline, like other tetracyclines, has iron chelation properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The ability to reduce intracellular iron levels may explain the benefit of minocyline in reducing MCP-1 secretion in the relatively iron-laden H63D HFE cells. The lack of effect seen in Wt HFE cells, which responded to iron chelation with DFO, may result from other effects of minocycline, or simply reflect the relative differences in chelator strengths between DFO and minocycline. An alternative explanation for the differential effects of minocycline involves its actions on mitochondria. Minocycline has been shown to have mitochondrial protective properties, including reduction of mitochondrial swelling and permeability transition pore opening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Mitochondrial dysfunction in the presence of HFE gene variants has been suggested for both the C282Y allelic variant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and the H63D HFE variant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Additionally, we have determined that the H63D HFE variant is associated with elevated cytosolic calcium levels (manuscript under review), that may result from altered mitochondrial function. Mitochondrial dysfunction and elevated calcium levels are mechanisms proposed to induce transcription of MCP-1; however, the association of mitochondrial function with MCP-1 regulation is mostly regulated through NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Thus, in contrast to its other actions, the data herein suggest that the effects of minocycline on MCP-1 secretion involve iron chelation. Although the exact mechanism of minocycline is not identified in these cells, these data strongly suggest that HFE genotype should be considered when assessing treatment efficacy of minocycline, and perhaps other pharmacological agents. The lack of benefit of minocycline in the treatment of humans with ALS, for example [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], despite its benefit in the mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], may be due to patient heterogeneity for HFE alleles. Additional studies of minocycline in patients with ALS may be warranted if they include stratification by <italic>HFE </italic>genotype because approximately 30% of ALS patients carry at least one <italic>H63D or C282Y HFE </italic>allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Given the broad effects of HFE on regulation of MCP-1, such stratification may be justified in other clinical trials as well.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AD: Alzheimer's disease; ALS: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; ANOVA: analysis of variance; &#x003b2;2M: beta 2 microglobulin; CNS: central nervous system; CSF: cerebrospinal fluid; DFO: desferroxamine; DMEM: Dulbecco's modified Eagles Medium; ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; FAC: ferric ammonium citrate; HIF: hypoxia inducible factor; HRP: horseradish peroxidase; Hsp: heat shock protein; MCP-1: monocyte chemoattractant protein-1; MHC: major histocompatibility complex; MTS: 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium; NF-&#x003ba;B: nuclear factor-kappa B; PD: Parkinson's disease; qRT-PCR: quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction; SEM: standard error of the mean; TBS-T: Tris-buffered saline-Tween; Wt: wildtype.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>RMM, WTR, ZS and JRC designed the experiments.
