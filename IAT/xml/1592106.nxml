Apoptosis, or programmed cell death is essential for the homeostatic regulation of cells, restriction of intracellular pathogens and also for stimulation of the host adaptive immune response. Virulent mycobacteria modulate host cell apoptosis to create a protected niche within cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and downregulate protective host cytokines such as, TNF&#x003b1; and IFN&#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] to reduce effector T cell and macrophage responses to the pathogen. Virulent <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>and <italic>M. bovis </italic>induce lower levels of apoptosis than avirulent strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Virulent mycobacteria such as <italic>M. leprae </italic>induce reduced activation of pro-inflammatory cytokine such as TNF&#x003b1;, as compared with the non-pathogenic <italic>M. bovis </italic>BCG strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The apoptotic response to mycobacteria is found to be dependent on cytokine activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] whereby, TNF&#x003b1; has been shown to activate mycobacterium-induced apoptosis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], while IL-10 downregulates apoptosis in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p><italic>M. leprae </italic>causes a disease spectrum ranging from disseminated multibacillary (MB) leprosy to restricted paucibacillary (PB) disease. T cell and macrophage responses are less affected in PB leprosy than in MB, where effector T cell and macrophage responses are severely compromised. Multibacillary leprosy granulomas show increased expression of Fas ligand which may protect these sites from attack by Fas-expression cytotoxic T lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF&#x003b1; is found to be greater in PB disease as compared with MB disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Although apoptotic proteins are activated in leprosy lesions from all patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], reports indicate that apoptosis is greater in PB disease, correlating with increased TNF&#x003b1; secretion. A role for TNF&#x003b1; is further corroborated as <italic>M. leprae </italic>induced apoptosis is reduced by treatment with TNF&#x003b1; inhibitor pentoxyfylline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] or anti-TNF&#x003b1; antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Regulation of programmed cell death occurs via either the intrinsic pathway, involving mitochondrial release of cytochrome C and activation of caspase 9, or the extrinsic pathway, involving the stimulation of death receptors expressed on the cell surface and activation of caspase 8. The Bcl 2-family of proteins comprise of anti-apoptotic members; Bcl-2, Bcl-x<sub>L </sub>and Mcl-1, and pro-apoptotic members; Bad, Bid, Bax and Bak. Pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins located in the cytosol act as sensors of cellular stress and damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Upon activation, they relocate to the mitochondrial surface where anti-apoptotic proteins are located. Activation of Bax or Bad and blockade of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins are pivotal steps in the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Bad positively regulates cell apoptosis by forming heterodimers with Bcl-x<sub>L </sub>and Bcl-2 and reversing their death repressor activity. Pro-apoptotic Bak is sequestered by Mcl-1 and Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>; but not Bcl-2 until displaced by Bid, Bad or Bak [17]. When there is an excess of pro apoptotic proteins, cells are more sensitive to apoptosis.</p><p>Mycobacteria interfere with host apoptosis by modifying expression of Bcl-2 proteins. Virulent <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>has been shown to repress apoptosis by upregulation of Bcl-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and Mcl-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and by deactivation of Bad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and Bax [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].

A time course of infection was carried out at 6, 18 and 48 h post-stimulation. Viability was determined after infection with <italic>Mycobacterium </italic>at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 and 20 in each case. Neither <italic>M. leprae </italic>nor BCG induced any significant loss in cell viability at the earlier 6 h time interval studied (data not shown). After 18 h of culture <italic>M. leprae </italic>did not cause any significant loss of viability in THP-1 cells at MOI-10 however, cell death was evident in cells infected at MOI-20 (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B&#x02013;C</xref>. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, <italic>M. leprae </italic>induced significant cell death induction at MOI-20 (P &#x0003c; 0.01) at 18 h but not at either MOI 10 or MOI-20 (P = 0.052) by the later 48 h time interval. In contrast, BCG infection of THP-1 cells resulted in a significant increase in cell death at both MOIs 10 and 20 at 18 h (P &#x0003c; 0.01) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D&#x02013;E</xref>) and this effect was also evident at 48 h (P &#x0003c; 0.01) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2.A2</xref>).</p><p>The pattern of genomic DNA fragmentation in mycobacterium infected cells was determined in order to investigate the cause of loss in cell viability observed at 18 h post-infection. BCG-infection of cells resulted in DNA laddering characteristic of apoptotic cells, with an increase in apoptosis with dose from MOI-10 to MOI-20 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).

The <italic>M. bovis </italic>BCG strain served as a comparison of a non-pathogenic species, while heat-killed BCG was employed as a control for BCG viability in the assays. Heat-killed BCG at the lower infection dose of MOI-10 did not cause any significant loss in THP-1 viability but did so at MOI-20 (P &#x0003c; 0.05) at 18 h. However, cell death was not induced by heat-killed BCG at 48 h post-infection (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>M. leprae </italic>is a poorer inducer of TNF&#x003b1; than <italic>M. bovis </italic>BCG</title><p>A role for TNF&#x003b1; is indicated in mycobacterium-induced apoptosis. <italic>M. leprae</italic>-induced apoptosis in primary macrophages has been shown to be dependent on TNF&#x003b1; activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], while BCG-induced apoptosis in THP-1 cells is dependent on an endogenous TNF response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].

We investigated <italic>M. leprae </italic>induced TNF&#x003b1; secretion and mRNA expression in THP-1 cells to determine whether the low level of apoptosis observed could be associated with a lack of TNF&#x003b1; activation in the assay. <italic>M. leprae </italic>and BCG -induced cytokine secretion was measured at 6, 18 and 48 h post-stimulation. BCG infection of cells induced TNF&#x003b1; secretion within 6 h of stimulation (mean values: BCG10, 40 pg/ml; BCG20, 80 pg/ml) with peak secretion at 18 h (mean values: BCG10, 238 pg/ml; BCG20, 299 pg/ml) and a decrease at 48 h (mean values: BCG10, 165 pg/ml; BCG20, 204 pg/ml). <italic>M. leprae </italic>did not induce any detectable TNF&#x003b1; secretion in THP-1 cells at either MOI 10 or 20 at 6 h, with negligible secretion (ML10, 0 pg/ml; ML20, 4 pg/ml) at the 18 h peak interval. However, <italic>M. leprae </italic>induced TNF&#x003b1; mRNA expression upon infection of cells but at a lower level than as compared with BCG (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Bak and Bad gene expression is down-regulated in <italic>M. leprae </italic>infected THP-1 cells</title><p><italic>M. leprae </italic>infection of peripheral blood monocytes has been shown to result in the activation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bad and induction of Bak mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In this study we did not observe apoptosis in THP-1 cells infected with <italic>M. leprae</italic>, while cells infected with BCG showed increased apoptosis. To investigate the mechanism responsible for this difference we measured <italic>Mycobacterium</italic>-induced mRNA expression of pro-apoptotic (Bad and Bak) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) genes at 6, 18 and 48 h post infection. Gene expression was compared relative to that of the &#x003b2;-actin housekeeping gene in each case. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> illustrates the changes in gene expression observed in response to <italic>M. leprae </italic>and BCG infection of cells at MOIs of 10 and 20. <italic>M. leprae </italic>induced negligible effect on Bcl-2 mRNA at both infection doses, while Bad mRNA expression appeared to be reduced at MOI-10 but increased at MOI-20 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). <italic>M. leprae </italic>downregulated Bak expression at both infection doses studied. In contrast, BCG infection of monocytes downregulated Bcl-2 mRNA but upregulated Bad mRNA expression at both MOIs 10 and 20, while it had negligible effect on Bak mRNA expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). The data shown is of one representative experiment and some variation is evident between background levels of mRNA expression in different experiments. To account for this, in each case mRNA levels for each gene were normalized to baseline levels of &#x003b2;-actin within the same experiment. Further time course kinetics of apoptotic mRNA expression based on data from 3 independent experiments is presented in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>. The effect of heat-killed BCG on THP-1 cells is also included. Negligible change was observed in Bad or Bak gene expression in response to <italic>M. leprae </italic>or BCG (live and heat-killed) at the earlier 6 and 18 h time intervals. However by 48 h, <italic>M. leprae </italic>induced downregulation of mRNA expression both pro-apoptotic genes Bad (30 %) and Bak (26 %) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A, D</xref>). In contrast, live BCG induced negligible change in either Bad or Bak mRNA expression at 48 h post-infection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B, E</xref>). Killed BCG induced downregulation of Bad mRNA (34 %) but upregulation of Bak mRNA (46 %) at 48 h post-infection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C, F</xref>).</p><p>Outcome of cellular viability/apoptosis is determined not only by the expression of specific pro- and anti-apoptotic genes, but is dependent on the ratio between pro and anti apoptotic genes. Therefore, to further understand <italic>Mycobacterium</italic>-induced change in host apoptotic gene expression we determined Bad/Bcl-2 and Bak/Bcl-2 expression ratios. We chose to evaluate gene expression at 18 h post-infection, the time interval at which differential cell death induction is evident between <italic>M. leprae </italic>and BCG (MOI-10 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). <italic>M. leprae </italic>infection of THP-1 cells resulted in a 39 % decrease in Bad/Bcl-2 and a 23 % reduction in Bak/Bcl-2 gene expression as compared with unstimulated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A&#x02013;B</xref>) while <italic>M. leprae </italic>at MOI 20 caused a 54 % decrease in Bad/Bcl-2 and 15 % decrease in Bak/Bcl-2 mRNA expression (data not shown). BCG infection of cells at MOI-10 increased Bad/Bcl-2 by 29 % and reduced Bak/Bcl-2 mRNA expression by 4 %, with a further increase in Bad/Bcl-2 mRNA at MOI-20 and similar change in Bak/Bcl-2 mRNA. Killed BCG had a limited effect on Bad/Bcl-2 (1&#x02013;13 %) and Bak/Bcl-2 (4&#x02013;6 %) mRNA expression at MOIs 10 and 20 (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>M. leprae </italic>upregulates Mcl-1 mRNA expression</title><p>Survival of <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>infection in THP-1 cells has been linked to the upregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, a role for Mcl-1 in <italic>M. leprae </italic>or BCG infection of cells is not known. Therefore, we investigated <italic>M. leprae </italic>and BCG induced Mcl-1 gene expression in THP-1 cells. A time course of <italic>Mycobacterium-</italic>induced Mcl-1 expression was determined at 6, 18 and 48h. Mcl-1 was evaluated relative to that of the housekeeping gene human ribosomal protein (HuPO), which has been shown to be optimal for real-time PCR quantification of gene expression in human cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. At the earlier 6 h time point neither <italic>M. leprae </italic>nor BCG infection of THP-1 cells had any effect on Mcl-1 mRNA expression as compared with unstimulated cells (data not shown). <italic>M. leprae </italic>induced an increase in Mcl-1 expression by 2.9 % at 18 h post-infection with a further (12 %) increase at 48 h. In contrast, BCG induced a decrease in Mcl-1 mRNA by 15 % at 18 h and 12 % by 48 h (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study shows that <italic>M. leprae </italic>inhibits apoptosis in the THP-1 monocytic cell line by downregulation of proapoptotic genes Bak and Bad and concomitant upregulation of anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 mRNA. In contrast, the increased apoptosis evidenced by BCG infection of THP-1 cells is coordinated by an increase in Bad mRNA expression relative to Bcl-2 and a downregulation of Mcl-1 mRNA.</p><p>Our data correlates with previous reports that virulent mycobacteria induce lower levels of cell death than avirulent mycobacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. We did not observe <italic>M. leprae-</italic>induced loss in cell viability in cells infected at MOI-10 at 18 post-infection. While, some THP-1 cell death was caused by <italic>M. leprae </italic>at MOI 20 by 18 h post-infection, this was not accompanied by the characteristic DNA laddering pattern found in apoptotic cells. Therefore, it is possible that the loss of viability observed here could be due to an alternate mechanism of cell death such as, necrosis, and could also be attributed to the increased mycobacterial load in the THP-1 cells. However, at the later time interval of 48 h <italic>M. leprae </italic>-induced cell death was not observed at either infection dose. This may be attributed to the time required for <italic>M. leprae </italic>-induced modification of host gene expression which facilitates persistence of the pathogen within cells. This is further evidenced by the time course changes in mRNA expression of the Bcl-2 family of proteins observed in this study.</p><p>Cell death induced by BCG was dose dependent as shown previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. BCG-induced apoptosis (as shown by DNA laddering of cells) increased with time from 18 to 48 h post-infection. Loss in cell viability was observed in response to heat-killed BCG at 18 h but was no longer apparent by 48 h. The earlier response to non-viable BCG observed at 18 h may be the result of non-specific binding and entry of the mycobacterium into the host cell which may trigger host defenses. Initial cell attachment and uptake of BCG into host macrophages has shown to be common amongst live and dead mycobacterium, with subsequent differences occurring later due to differential trafficking of live and dead organisms within host the endosomal/lysosomal pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. As BCG-induced apoptosis is most probably dependent on bacterial viability it is therefore only sustained in the case of live BCG.</p><p><italic>M. leprae-</italic>induced less TNF&#x003b1; secretion and gene expression than BCG did. A role for TNF&#x003b1; has been defined previously in BCG-induced apoptosis in THP-1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In addition, <italic>M. leprae</italic>-induced apoptosis in primary monocytes has been shown to be TNF&#x003b1; dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and inhibition of TNF&#x003b1; via treatment with anti-TNF&#x003b1; inhibitors or pentoxyfylline is found to reduce host inflammation and cell death in reactional leprosy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Therefore, in the case of <italic>M. leprae </italic>infection, the reduced levels of TNF&#x003b1; activation coordinate with the downregulation of pro-apoptotic gene expression would contribute to apoptosis inhibition in the cells.</p><p>We found <italic>M. leprae </italic>to downregulate expression of pro-apoptotic genes Bak and Bad relative to both &#x003b2;-actin and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2. This correlates with previous studies where reduced Bax and increased Bcl-2 mRNA expression has been shown to be responsible for slowly progressive murine tuberculosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The role of Bad gene expression in determining outcome of cellular viability is further indicated where cell wall lipoarabinomannan (LAM) from <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-induces survival in monocytes by phosphorylation of the protein Bad, hence preventing it from binding Bcl-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. However, our work differs from that by Hernandez, <italic>et </italic>al. who demonstrate that infection of primary monocytes with irradiated <italic>M. leprae </italic>resulted in apoptosis due to activation of apoptotic genes, Bax and Bak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. This apparent discrepancy can be attributed to differential outcome of mycobacterial infection dependent on host cell type, as evidenced by the variation in apoptosis induction by <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>observed in alveolar epithelial cells and U937 macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In addition, Hernandez et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] showed that <italic>M. leprae </italic>increases apoptosis in monocytes-derived macrophages of leprosy patients. However, macrophages from leprosy patients are more prone to apoptotic death than those from healthy individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]<bold>. </bold>Therefore, the spontaneous activation of apoptotic genes in leprosy patients may make the cells more prone to extracellular triggers such as infection with mycobacteria.</p><p>We demonstrate a role for Mcl-1 in <italic>M. leprae </italic>mediated inhibition of apoptosis in the THP-1 cells. The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member gene Mcl-1 has been shown to play a role in cell survival of human polymorphonuclear cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Virulent <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>H37Rv has been shown to persist in THP-1 cells by upregulation of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member gene Mcl-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Pro-apoptotic Bak is sequestered by Mcl-1 [17] therefore upregulation of Mcl-1 expression would result in a coordinate decrease in available Bak leading to further downregulation of apoptosis.</p><p>We found BCG-induced apoptosis to be accompanied with increased expression of Bad/Bcl-2 mRNA. Previously, BCG-induced apoptosis has been shown to be a consequence of downregulated Bcl-2 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and also by activation of caspases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. We show for the first time in our study that BCG induces downregulation of anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 mRNA. Overall, our results indicate that the differential effect of virulent <italic>M. leprae </italic>and non-pathogenic BCG on host cellular survival is determined by the combined gene expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic genes Bad, Bak, Bcl-2 and Mcl-1.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p><italic>M. leprae-</italic>induced downregulation of Bad and Bak genes coordinate with a reduced TNF&#x003b1; response and upregulation of Mcl-1 results in the inhibition of apoptosis in THP-1 monocytes. Therefore, leading to a more efficient mechanism for dissemination of leprosy infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Mycobacterial strains used</title><p><italic>M. bovis </italic>BCG (Montreal vaccine strain) was used as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].
