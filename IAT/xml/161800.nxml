Eight of these sequences were derived from previously unidentified genes and expression of these genes in testis was confirmed by Northern blotting.

The proteins encoded by these genes included a new member of the kinesin superfamily, a SET/MYND-domain protein, and six proteins for which no specific function could be predicted. Each gene was expressed primarily in testis, suggesting that they may play roles in the development and/or function of testicular cells.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The initial publication of two draft versions of the human genome led to intense debate over the exact number of genes in the human genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Current estimates suggest that the human genome encodes approximately 35,000 to 38,000 although the final number must await the complete annotation of each genome sequence. The search for additional genes not discovered during early annotation attempts has involved the use of several different approaches. These have included the sequencing of randomly selected cDNAs from various tissue sources, the development of computer-based prediction programs of ever-increasing accuracy, and the direct comparison between the human genome and the genome sequences of other vertebrates and invertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Using these approaches, fully annotated genomes of numerous species will be available within a relatively short time.</p><p>We approached the problem of gene identification by using a combination of experimental and <italic>in silico </italic>techniques. Specifically, we initiated a project designed to sequence expressed sequence tags from the hamster testis and used these sequences to identify unannotated, or incompletely annotated, genes in the human and other vertebrate genomes. The hamster has not been used extensively in genomics research; however, it has been used extensively in various areas of investigation including circadian rhythm research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and also in investigations in a number of areas of research in reproductive biology. For example, the study of hamster gametes has revealed significant information concerning the mechanisms underlying species-specific sperm-egg interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and the deleterious effects of endocrine disruptors on male and female reproductive development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The hamster, mouse and rat are all members of the family Muridae, however both mice and rats belong to the subfamily Murinae while hamsters belong to the subfamily Cricetinae. Three hamster species that are commonly used in research are <italic>Mesocricetus auratus </italic>(Syrian golden hamster), <italic>Cricetulus griseus </italic>(Chinese hamster) and <italic>Phodopus sungorus </italic>(Siberian hamster). Therefore, sequence information from any hamster species should complement information gained from other closely related species.</p><p>The testis was chosen for these studies as it represents a viable source for the identification of novel genes. The adult testis is a complex organ consisting of numerous different somatic cell types as well as germ cells at all stages of spermatogenesis from the gonocyte stem cells to the mature sperm cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Consequently, several unique gene populations, including those involved in the regulation of meiosis, as well as those specific to the various testicular cell types, are expressed in the testis. A recent gene discovery study performed in the testis of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster </italic>found that 47% of greater than 1500 sequenced cDNAs did not match to ESTs previously identified in this organism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Likewise the testis of the cynomolgus monkey has yielded several novel gene sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Therefore, we reasoned that the sequencing of ESTs from hamster testis might reveal the existence of novel genes conserved in other species that may function in controlling testicular development and/or function. In this report, we describe our initial results from the sequencing of randomly-selected cDNAs from the testes of male Syrian golden hamsters. In particular we identified eight cDNAs that appear to be derived from genes that were not previously annotated in the human genome. We describe the detailed analysis of two of these genes, which encode a new member of the kinesin superfamily of microtubule-based molecular motors and a protein likely to be involved in chromatin remodeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Generation and sequence analysis of a Hamster testis cDNA library</title><p>Random clones from a hamster testis cDNA library were selected and sequenced as described in materials and methods. The sequences were screened to remove ribosomal RNA and vector sequences, which yielded 735 distinct sequences. The sequence of each clone was compared to sequences in public databases to identify its closest match. Each sequence was then assigned to a functional group based on this comparison (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The genes were distributed amongst all of the functional groups listed with the highest numbers in groups associated with protein synthesis and degradation (11%), metabolism (6%), gene regulation and RNA processing (8%) and intracellular signaling (5%). Overall, the data set contains examples of numerous testis-specific genes as well as genes that display less limited patterns of expression.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Classification of sequenced hamster cDNAs</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold>Classification</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Number of clones</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"> Transcription </td><td align="center">23 (21)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Chromatin associated</td><td align="center">20 (17)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">RNA processing</td><td align="center">17 (15)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">DNA synthesis</td><td align="center">2</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Cell cycle</td><td align="center">9</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Cell surface antigens</td><td align="center">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Cell adhesion</td><td align="center">4</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Receptors</td><td align="center">2</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Extracellular signaling</td><td align="center">2</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Intracellular signaling</td><td align="center">36 (33)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Stress proteins</td><td align="center">13 (6)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Trafficking</td><td align="center">11 (10)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Metabolism</td><td align="center">41 (37)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Translation</td><td align="center">31 (26)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Protein modification</td><td align="center">21 (18)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Protein turnover</td><td align="center">30 (29)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Apoptosis</td><td align="center">3</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Cytoskeleton</td><td align="center">30 (23)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Functionally unclassified</td><td align="center">239 (222)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Unknown</td><td align="center">200</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Each of the hamster ESTs was compared against public sequence databases using BLAST. Each clone was then functionally classified based on the results of these searches. The number of unique fragments belonging to gene in each functional category is listed first, followed in parentheses by the total number of unique genes represented once the occurrence of multiple fragments from the same gene is accounted for.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>We next considered the overall complexity of the sequences in our database as our cloning strategy made it possible to obtain multiple fragments from the same cDNA. We identified only 40 instances where more than one fragment was derived from the same gene (data not shown). In addition, only 17 fragments appeared more than two times in the database and only 6 fragments appeared more than three times. The most common sequences were derived from genes that are known to be highly expressed in the testis in other organisms and include heat shock protein 90A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], chitobiase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], outer dense fiber of sperm tails [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and kinectin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Therefore, the majority of sequences were represented only once or at most two times in the data set. The fact that most sequences were not identified multiple times suggests that we have not exhaustively sequenced all of the <italic>DpnII </italic>fragments from cDNAs expressed in the hamster testis. This is not surprising as conservative estimates suggest that there are many thousands of unique transcripts expressed in the various somatic and germ cell lineages in the testis.</p><p>The largest group of sequences identified in this project falls into the functionally unclassified group (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). This group includes a small number of named genes for which no function has yet been assigned but primarily contains the results of full-length cDNA sequencing projects or genes predicted by gene finding software. Approximately one third of these clones (78 out of 239) were originally isolated from testis libraries, suggesting that a large number of genes remain to be functionally characterized in the testis.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of novel testis specific genes</title><p>200 sequences could not be sorted into the various functional groups described above and represented a potential source of novel genes that had not previously been recognized by EST or genome sequencing. However, there were several other possible origins for such sequences. These included contamination of the original cDNA sample with genomic DNA (note that the testis total RNA was treated with DNase before mRNA purification) or artifactual joining of unrelated sequences into chimeric fragments that resulted in matches that were not detected in our screen. As we synthesized cDNA from total RNA and not cytoplasmic RNA, it was possible that some fragments could be derived from RNAs that were incompletely processed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Furthermore, these fragments could be derived from alternatively spliced exons of known genes or from genes that are only expressed in hamster. Therefore, several clones were selected for further examination based on their sequence similarity to unannotated regions of the human genome (see below) and for Northern analysis using hamster RNAs prepared from various tissues. Eight clones yielded specific signals in RNA from hamster testis while two clones also detected signals in other tissues (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Subsequent analysis has revealed that each clone is derived form a bona fide gene and the evidence for this conclusion is provided below for each gene (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).

Northern analysis using the hamster 1030 probe detected a single band in testis RNA and weak signals in several other tissues including brain, heart and lung (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

Partial cDNAs from human and macaque also mapped to the same genetic locus (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).

Three discrete products were observed and are indicated with asterisks. These products were isolated, subcloned and sequenced and corresponded to cDNAs resulting from alternatively spliced mRNAs. The relative proportions of the three products varied in different cDNA preparations although the shortest product was generally the predominant product (data not shown).

This represents the first such study carried out in hamster, as dbEST listed just twenty-seven entries from hamster in January 2003 (release 012403). It has been widely speculated that the sequencing of additional mammalian genomes will aid in the annotation of the human genome, particularly in the identification of previously unidentified coding regions through the mapping of conserved regions in different genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. We describe here our initial characterization of eight genes that were not annotated on human genome sequences at the beginning of our study. Although predicted structures for some of these genes have appeared recently, our data represents the first experimental verification of their existence in several cases, particularly in the testis. We were unable to predict specific functions for the proteins encoded by six of the genes, however, the other two genes encoded a new member of the kinesin superfamily (KIF27) and a protein predicted to play a role in chromatin remodeling.</p><sec><title>KIF27: a new kinesin family member</title><p>Our studies revealed the existence of a new member of the kinesin superfamily of microtubule-based molecular motors, which we have named KIF27. KIF27 RNA was detected primarily in hamster testis but weaker signals were also present in several other tissues, suggesting that this protein may function in numerous cell types. Significant characteristics of the KIF27 genes mapped in human, mouse and rat included a conserved 18 exon arrangement and the existence of at least three mRNAs that resulted from alternative splicing, at least in human. Although partial cDNAs existed for the human and macaque genes in public databases, we were able to construct full length cDNA sequences for human, mouse and rat from genomic comparisons, and to assemble a corresponding sequence from macaque by joining two previously reported cDNAs. Kinesins are characterized by a conserved motor domain of approximately 350 amino acids that may be located at the amino terminus (KIN-N), carboxy-terminus (KIN-C) or within the polypeptide (KIN-I) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and the motor domain of KIF27 is located in the N-terminus of the protein. Based on this arrangement and the sequence of the adjacent neck domain, we assigned KIF27 to the N-5 phyogenetic group of kinesins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The N-5 subgroup is defined by the human KIF4 protein, which is primarily localized to the nuclear matrix and associates with chromosomes during mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In cell division, nuclear kinesins of this chromokinesin class appear to be important for the maintenance of sister chromatids on the metaphase plate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. However, additional functions for nuclear kinesins have recently been uncovered. For example, KIF17a, a member of the N-4 subgroup that is predominantly expressed in germ cells, was recently shown to possess transcriptional regulatory properties by controlling access of the transcriptional activator protein CREM to a coactivator, ACT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Clearly, functional analysis of the KIF27 polypeptide will be needed to determine the subcellular location of this protein to determine whether it may add to the growing number of kinesins that function in the nucleus. In this regard, although the carboxy terminal regions of KIF27 and KIF4 display little significant sequence similarity, both contain a putative topoisomerase domain that may be important for nuclear functions (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In addition, several clusters of basic amino acids that may function as nuclear localization signals are located in the KIF27 polypeptide.</p></sec><sec><title>SMYD2: a putative chromatin remodeling protein</title><p>The final clone isolated in our search encodes a 433 amino acid protein whose sequence was highly conserved from human to pufferfish. This protein, now named SMYD2, contains SET and MYND domains that are characteristic of proteins with chromatin remodeling capabilities. The SET domain is a common feature of proteins with histone lysine methyl transferase (HKMT) activity and has been identified in hundreds of proteins in organisms ranging from bacteria and viruses to humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The SMYD2 SET domain is separated into two parts (i.e. a S-ET domain) and is followed by a short cyteine-rich region that is common in many SET domain proteins (figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref>). The MYND domain is located between the two halves of the SET domain and similar domains have been identified in a number of proteins that function as transcriptional repressors, including the ETO protein that is fused to the AML-1 transcription factor in the t(8;21) translocation in acute myeloid leukemias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The MYND contains two zinc finger motifs and is a protein-protein interaction interface responsible for the recruitment of corepressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>This domain organization is conserved in several proteins in public databases, including the recently described SMYD1 (aka BOP) family of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Three isoforms of SMYD1 have been reported thus far (referred to by their original names, m-BOP1, m-BOP2 and t-BOP) that are products of a single gene that result from either alternative splicing or promoter usage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. m-BOP is essential for cardiac differentiation and morphogenesis while t-BOP is expressed in cytotoxic T lymphoctes. Studies are currently underway to examine the function(s) of SMYD2 in testis and heart.</p></sec><sec><title>Genomic studies in the hamster</title><p>The impetus for this study arose from the need to perform microarray experiments to investigate the molecular changes elicited by environmental toxicants on male reproduction function in hamster. Comparisons performed between the limited numbers of hamster sequences in public databases with ortho logous sequences from the mouse suggested that, despite the close taxonomic relationship between hamster and mouse, evolutionary divergence in coding sequences was sufficiently great in certain cases that reagents developed for the mouse would be of limited use for genomic studies in the hamster. This conclusion was supported by experimental observations in our laboratories indicating that probes derived from rat and mouse cDNAs yield inconsistent results in Northern blotting under stringent hybridization conditions (data not shown). The reagents described here will now permit the initiation of genomic studies in the hamster.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>RNA, cDNA and plasmid preparation</title><p>Total RNA was prepared from testes of adult Syrian golden hamsters (<italic>Mesocricetus auratus</italic>).

Bethesda, MD). Each clone was named according to its position in the original 96-well plate, for example, clone 1030 came from position 30 in plate 1. Vector sequences were first scanned in batch mode for the presence of vector-derived sequences using Contig Express and these sequences were trimmed before proceeding. In some cases, manual processing of the sequences was necessary using the VecScreen program at the National Canter for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/VecScreen/VecScreen.html"/>. The presence of <italic>DpnII </italic>sites at either end of the clone simplified the removal of vector sequences. The sequences were concatenated in batches of 96 into a text file using FASTA format and submitted for a batch BLASTN search using the interface program BLASTCL3. This search returned the three top matches into an output file. No further analysis was performed in those cases where a match with a known gene was clearly established, and the clone was annotated as the hamster orthologue of a known gene. A series of additional comparisons were performed if a clear relationship between a hamster clone and known sequence was not established by this initial search. The most useful additional comparison was a BLASTX search, which compares the translated sequence of the input clone in all six frames to the peptide sequences in GenBank. This search clarified the identity of several additional hamster clones. 200 clones did not match to known sequences and were analyzed to determine whether they might represent potentially novel genes. First, the output sequences were translated in all frames to determine whether a complete open reading frame (ORF) was present. If so, the clones were resequenced on both strands to ensure that the sequence was correct. Promising sequences were compared to the public version of the annotated human sequence (v 9.30a.1) at Ensembl <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org"/> to find matches with human chromosomal sequences. Further comparisons were performed against the mouse (v 9.3a.1), rat (v 9.1.1), zebrafish (v 9.08.1), pufferfish (v 9.1.1) and mosquito (v 9.1a.1) genome sequence in the same database. When matching genomic loci were identified, approximately 100,000 bp of genome sequence surrounding the match was imported into Vector NTI and submitted to gene prediction software programs to determine if the hamster sequences were located within exons of predicted genes. Two gene prediction programs were used FGENESH <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.softberry.com/berry.phtml"/> and GENEMARK <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://opal.biology.gatech.edu/GeneMark/eukhmm.cgi?org=H.sapiens"/>. Predicted cDNA sequences were then assembled into contiguous files and subjected to further comparisons against cDNA and EST databases at NCBI. Genome structures were further examined using PipMaker, a program that supports comparisons of large DNA fragments and identifies short conserved regions of similarity, such as exons. The predicted protein sequences of the derived cDNAs were analyzed for the presence of functional domains using the conserved domain function of BLAST at NCBI as well as the Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de"/>. Protein structures were annotated in Vector NTI and published in Canvas v7.0 (Deneba Systems, Inc., Miami, FL).

The Human Genome Organization (HUGO) nomenclature committee has approved proposed gene names.</p></sec><sec><title>Northern analysis</title><p>Total RNA was purified from various hamster tissues using TriZol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). 20 &#x003bc;g of each RNA was electrophoresed through a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to a Nylon membrane (Micron Separations, Westborough, MA). The RNA was cross-linked to the membrane by exposure to UV light and hybridized with specific probes labeled with <sup>32</sup>P-dCTP (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) using the Prime-It random prime labeling kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The hybridization procedure was performed as described before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Several duplicate membranes were prepared and the radioactive probe was stripped after each round of hybridization by boiling for 10 minutes in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 1% SDS. The specific probes were prepared by digesting the appropriate pBluescript plasmid with <italic>XbaI </italic>and <italic>EcoRI</italic>, separating the fragment on a 1.5% agarose gel followed by extraction using the Qiaex II extraction kit (Qiagen).</p></sec><sec><title>PCR cloning of human KIF27 cDNAs</title><p>PCR primers based on the predicted human KIF27 genomic sequence were designed for PCR cloning of overlapping regions of human KIF27 cDNAs. PCR reactions were performed using human testis Marathon RACE-Ready cDNA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using conditions described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. PCR products were subcloned in to the pGEM-Teasy plasmid and sequenced. The sequences were then assembled into full length cDNAs using the Vector NTI sequence analysis suite of programs. The primers used for the reaction shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> were: 5' AACTAGATGTAGAAGTCGTTCATGGATTC 3' and 5'TTCCAGTAAGTTCAGGCGAGTTG 3'.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>S.O. performed cDNA cloning of the KIF27 isoforms and performed sequence analysis</p><p>J.L.C. characterized and analyzed the cDNA library</p><p>S.K. performed Northern analysis</p><p>W.J.H. provided hamster tissues and assisted in sequence analysis</p><p>S.A.K. assisted in sequence analysis</p><p>S.C.W. designed the project, performed cDNA synthesis and sequence analysis</p><p>All authors read and approved the manuscript</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We appreciate the assistance of Natalya Klueva in the Texas Tech University Center for Biotechnology and Genomics for assistance with sequencing and sequence analysis.
