Even though nocturnal rodents prefer to forage at night, daytime food anticipatory activity (FAA) is observed prior to short meals presented at a scheduled time of day. Under this restricted feeding regimen, rodents exhibit two distinct bouts of activity, a nocturnal activity rhythm that is entrained to the light-dark cycle and controlled by the master clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) and a daytime bout of activity that is phase-locked to mealtime. FAA also occurs during food deprivation, suggesting that a food-entrainable oscillator (FEO) keeps time in the absence of scheduled feeding. Previous studies have demonstrated that the FEO is anatomically distinct from the SCN and that FAA is observed in mice lacking some circadian genes essential for timekeeping in the SCN. In the current study, we optimized the conditions for examining FAA during restricted feeding and food deprivation in mice lacking functional BMAL1, which is critical for circadian rhythm generation in the SCN. We found that BMAL1-deficient mice displayed FAA during restricted feeding in 12hr light:12hr dark (12L:12D) and 18L:6D lighting cycles, but distinct activity during food deprivation was observed only in 18L:6D. While BMAL1-deficient mice also exhibited robust FAA during restricted feeding in constant darkness, mice were hyperactive during food deprivation so it was not clear that FAA consistently occurred at the time of previously scheduled food availability. Taken together, our findings suggest that optimization of experimental conditions such as photoperiod may be necessary to visualize FAA in genetically modified mice. Furthermore, the expression of FAA may be possible without a circadian oscillator that depends on BMAL1.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>For an animal to flourish in its niche, food-seeking behavior must be spatially and temporally optimized.

In contrast, the mechanisms underlying entrainment to food and timekeeping in the FEO remain enigmatic, which may be partially attributable to unsuccessful attempts to identify the locus of the FEO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004860-Mistlberger1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004860-Landry1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Two putative timing mechanisms have been purported to account for FAA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004860-Mistlberger1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. First, FAA could be the output of an interval timer, such that when the depletion of nutrients reaches a critical threshold, anticipatory activity ensues. The interval timer could also measure the time between a meal and the phase of the LEO or another circadian oscillator. Alternatively, the second model proposes that a self-sustained oscillator that is anatomically distinct from the SCN, and persists in the absence of restricted feeding, controls FAA.</p><p>Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the FEO is not an interval or hourglass timer that measures the depletion of nutrients. For example, even though FAA disappears during <italic>ad libitum</italic> feeding following a restricted feeding regimen, it reappears at approximately the same time of prior entrainment to feeding during food deprivation, suggesting that the FEO continues to run during <italic>ad libitum</italic> feeding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004860-Mistlberger1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, entrainment of FAA is limited to periods between 20 and 28 hours in non-SCN lesioned rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004860-Bolles1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004860-Bolles2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. This limited range of entrainment is similar to the SCN, which is theoretically limited by the maximum phase shift that can occur during a single period <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004860-Johnson1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004860-Refinetti1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. These data suggest that FAA relies on an oscillator since an hourglass timer should be functional regardless of the interval between meals. Finally, transient cycles of FAA occur after phase shifts of mealtime <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004860-Stephan5">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004860-Stephan6">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Transient cycles of nocturnal activity are also observed when the LD cycle and the underlying LEO are phase-shifted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004860-Refinetti1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004860-MooreEde1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Even if the FEO is an oscillator, it may not operate in the same way as circadian oscillators in the SCN and periphery. The molecular mechanism of endogenous rhythm generation in the SCN and in peripheral oscillators is modeled as interlocking positive and negative transcriptional and translational feedback loops of circadian gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004860-Ko1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. According to this model, the transcription of three <italic>Period</italic> homologs (<italic>Per1, 2, 3</italic>) and two <italic>Cryptochrome</italic> genes (<italic>Cry 1, 2</italic>) is activated by CLOCK and BMAL1 protein heterodimers.

A secondary feedback loop composed of REV-ERb&#x003b1; and ROR&#x003b1; drives the rhythmic transcription of <italic>Bmal1</italic>. BMAL1 is critically important for the function of the circadian oscillator in the SCN since BMAL1-deficient mice in constant darkness have arrhythmic locomotor activity and circadian gene expression in the SCN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004860-Bunger1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. NPAS2 is a transcription factor that is expressed predominantly in the forebrain and is highly related in primary amino acid sequence to CLOCK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004860-Garcia1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004860-Zhou1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004860-King1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.

Although Garcia et al. showed that NPAS2 is not expressed in the SCN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004860-Garcia1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, DeBruyne et al. demonstrated that wheel-running running behavior is rhythmic when the <italic>Clock</italic> gene is nonfunctional, but arrhythmic in mice deficient in both NPAS2 and CLOCK, suggesting that NPAS2 is expressed in the SCN and is functionally redundant with CLOCK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004860-DeBruyne1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>If the LEO and FEO use the same molecular mechanisms to keep time, then they should respond similarly to biochemical and genetic alterations of the clock.

A recent study also reported that BMAL1-deficient mice, that are arrhythmic in constant darkness (DD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004860-Bunger1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, do not anticipate daily meals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004860-Fuller1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, multiple lines of evidence suggest that the LEO and FEO use distinct timekeeping mechanisms. First, homozygous <italic>Clock</italic> mutant mice, which express a dominant negative form of CLOCK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004860-King2">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, show FAA during restricted feeding and food deprivation in DD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004860-Pitts1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> when nocturnal activity is arrhythmic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004860-Vitaterna1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Second, <italic>Cry1/Cry2</italic> double knockout mice exhibit FAA, albeit abnormal, in DD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004860-Iijima1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref> when nocturnal activity is arrhythmic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004860-vanderHorst1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Third, <italic>Npas2</italic>-deficient mice display mostly normal wheel-running activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004860-DeBruyne1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> but take longer to acquire FAA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004860-Dudley1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that NPAS2 is not essential for timekeeping in the LEO, but is important for acquisition of food entrainment in the FEO. Finally, deuterium oxide administered to rats lengthens the free-running period of nocturnal activity (LEO), but does not affect FAA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004860-Mistlberger2">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The majority of studies investigating FAA have been performed in rats because of their ability to adapt to restricted feeding regimens and because they can survive several days of food deprivation. However, the development of mice with genetically altered circadian mechanisms makes them an attractive species for investigating the molecular components of the FEO. While studies of FAA in mice have become more prevalent, the conditions which foster high-resolution expression of FAA in mice have not been optimized. The use of sub-optimal experimental conditions may have led to erroneous conclusions that FAA is not observed in circadian mutant mice. To circumvent this problem, we optimized the conditions for examining FAA in BMAL1-deficient mice. By varying the experimental conditions, we found that BMAL1-deficient mice exhibited robust FAA during restricted feeding, suggesting that the expression of FAA may not require a BMAL1-dependent circadian oscillator.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Optimization of food deprivation</title><p>After restricted feeding and <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to food, rats exhibit activity at the approximate time of previous food availability during food deprivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004860-Mistlberger1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. FAA disappears during <italic>ad libitum</italic> feeding between restricted feeding and food deprivation, suggesting that rats must be sufficiently &#x0201c;hungry&#x0201d; or that some resource must be depleted beyond a critical level in order to observe FAA. FAA during food deprivation is easily observed in rats since they readily survive several days of fasting. In contrast, the length of food deprivation in mice must be limited to about 48 to 60 hours to ensure their survival. Therefore, the timing of food deprivation relative to the previous time of food availability may be critical for observing FAA during fasting. If food is removed only a few hours before the time of previous food availability, then mice may not be &#x0201c;hungry&#x0201d; enough to express FAA on the first day of food deprivation. To test this hypothesis, wildtype mice were fed for 4 hrs/day, from zeitgeber time (ZT) 6 to ZT10, for 9 days, then fed <italic>ad libitum</italic> for 6 days, and then wheel-running activity was assessed during 48 hours of food deprivation that began at either ZT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004860-g001">Fig. 1A, B</xref>) or ZT12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004860-g001">Fig. 1C, D</xref>). When food was removed at ZT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004860-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>), minimal FAA was observed on the first day of food deprivation (72&#x000b1;55), but FAA increased significantly on the second day of fasting (2178&#x000b1;1261; <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.03). In contrast, FAA was robust on both the first (2187&#x000b1;3191) and second (5701&#x000b1;7547) days of food deprivation when food was removed at ZT12 (<italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.37). It is possible that mice that began fasting at ZT3 were not &#x0201c;hungry&#x0201d; enough at ZT6 to display FAA on the first day of food deprivation. In contrast, mice that began fasting at ZT12 had 18 hours to become &#x0201c;hungry&#x0201d; and therefore displayed clear FAA at ZT6 the following day. Furthermore, FAA was observed on the second day of food deprivation in both conditions, suggesting that a certain period of food deprivation must be experienced before FAA is fully expressed. Since FAA was apparent on both days of fasting when food was removed at ZT12, we began fasting mice 18 hours before the time of previously scheduled food availability for all subsequent food deprivation experiments.</p><fig id="pone-0004860-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004860.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>The timing of food deprivation affects food anticipatory activity (FAA).</title><p>Diagrams of restricted feeding protocols when mice are food deprived starting at ZT3 (A) or ZT12 (C).

We predict that FAA would have been observed in <italic>Bmal1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice in their study if food availability had been gradually reduced over several days and if food had been placed on the bottom of the cage.</p><p>Current and previous studies of FAA in <italic>Bmal1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice during restricted feeding and food deprivation suggest that the light-dark cycle plays an important role in molding the expression of FAA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004860-Mistlberger3">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. FAA during restricted feeding is evident in both 12L:12D and 18L:6D. The mechanism for FAA expression in the light-dark cycle in <italic>Bmal1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice could rely on an LEO with residual function. While the LEO is disabled <italic>Bmal1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice in DD, as evidenced by arrhythmic locomotor activity and endogenous <italic>Per1</italic> and <italic>Per2</italic> gene expression in the SCN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004860-Bunger1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> and by arrhythmic <italic>Per2</italic> enhancer-driven luminescence in cultured SCN explants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004860-Yoo1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, it may be functional in the light-dark cycle. For example, in the light-dark cycle, wheel-running behavior in <italic>Bmal1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice occurs more often during the dark than during the light phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004860-Bunger1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> suggesting that the LEO may respond to light even if the oscillator is not fully functional. It is unclear whether the LEO is arrhythmic in <italic>Bmal1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice in the light-dark cycle since circadian gene expression has not been assessed under these conditions. However, the expression of FAA in <italic>Bmal1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice should not be influenced by the LEO or by masking in DD when the LEO is disabled. It is noteworthy then that we observe robust FAA in <italic>Bmal1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice during restricted feeding in DD.</p><p>In 18L:6D FAA reappears in some mice at the time of previous entrainment to food availability when <italic>Bmal1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice are food deprived. In contrast, we could not clearly distinguish FAA during food deprivation in 12L:12D. These findings show that experimental conditions, such as photoperiod, must be optimized during restricted feeding in circadian mutant mice. Interestingly, the activity of <italic>Bmal1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice during food deprivation in DD does not resemble that in the light-dark cycle. Instead, nearly continuous or robust ultradian wheel-running activity is induced by food deprivation in DD. Sometimes activity occurs at the approximate time of food availability, but often does not. It is possible that the FEO is free-running in DD so that the timing of FAA is offset from the time of previous food availability. However, similar patterns of wheel-running activity are observed during food deprivation prior to restricted feeding and after restricted feeding, suggesting the possibility that this behavior is a direct response to lack of food, hunger, alteration in glucose levels, or other physiological changes associated with fasting. This process may take a couple of hours since there is very little wheel-running activity by <italic>Bmal1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice for about 2 hours after food is removed during food deprivation before and after restricted feeding (time 12 of food deprivation I and II activity profiles).</p><p>Our findings that BMAL1-deficient mice display FAA during restricted feeding in the light-dark cycle raise a couple of possibilities regarding the nature of the FEO. First, the FEO may be a circadian oscillator that is composed of molecular timekeeping mechanisms that are unique from the LEO and cannot be explained by the current model of circadian transcriptional and translational feedback loop(s). Second, it is possible that the mechanism that generates FAA in BMAL1-deficient mice is not a self-sustaining oscillator, but instead it is an interval timer that measures the time between feeding and the phase of the LEO. If the latter is true, then FAA should disappear in <italic>Bmal1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice in DD when the LEO is disabled. Our observation that <italic>Bmal1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice display FAA during restricted feeding in DD suggests that the FAA can be expressed in the absence of the LEO if a daily feeding cycle is present. Findings from 30 years ago that SCN-lesioned rats anticipate food availability supported the hypothesis that the FEO must be a distinct circadian oscillator since it operated in the absence of the LEO. Since then numerous circadian oscillators located throughout the brain and body (i.e. retina, liver) have been described and additional oscillators will probably be identified in the future <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004860-Tosini1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004860-Yamazaki1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, it is possible that FAA observed in <italic>Bmal1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice could be the product of an interval timer or damped oscillator that is coupled to a circadian oscillator that is distinct from the SCN and does not require <italic>Bmal1</italic> for timekeeping. Finally, our finding that FAA in <italic>Bmal1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice in DD does not regularly occur at the time of previous entrainment (or at a consistent phase relative to previous food availability) during food deprivation after restricted feeding, and that the pattern of wheel-running activity is similar during food deprivation before and after restricted feeding, raises the possibility that the mechanism for FAA is simply responding to the time of feeding in <italic>Bmal1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice. In the absence of food, heightened activity occurs regardless of the previous feeding protocol. If this is the case, we cannot rule out that <italic>Bmal1</italic> is an important molecular component of the wildtype FEO, and that in the absence of <italic>Bmal1</italic>, the mechanism that controls the expression of FAA becomes an interval timer.</p><p>After 70 years of laboratory investigation of food entrainment in rodents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004860-Richter1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004860-Mistlberger1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, the anatomical location and molecular timekeeping mechanism of the FEO remain elusive. The development and investigation of genetically altered mice have created new models for exploration of FAA. Our findings suggest that investigation of these genetically altered mouse models requires careful optimization of restricted feeding protocols. Furthermore, the expression of FAA may not be dependent on a circadian oscillator that requires BMAL1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals</title><p>Experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Vanderbilt University. <italic>Bmal1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004860-Bunger1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> (generated by Dr. Chris Bradfield, University of WI) were obtained from Dr. Joseph Takahashi (Northwestern University) after they had been backcrossed for 9 generations (N9) with the C57BL/6J strain (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). We performed additional backcrosses of <italic>Bmal1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice with wildtype C57BL/6J mice so that mice were N13 to N15 when the experiments were performed.

The mice were bred and group-housed in the Vanderbilt University animal facility in a 12h-light/12h-dark cycle (12L:12D) with food and water provided <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Male and female mice, aged 6 to 15 weeks at the beginning of the experiment, were used.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Activity recording</title><p>For all experiments, na&#x000ef;ve mice, which had never been exposed to an RF regimen, were used. Mice were singly housed in a cage (33&#x000d7;17&#x000d7;14 cm) with unlimited access to a running wheel (diameter: 11 cm) and water. The cages were placed in light-tight, ventilated boxes. The light intensity in each cage was approximately 350 lux. Wheel running activity was monitored by a micro-switch-activated signal using the ClockLab system (Actimetrics Inc.) and was collected by computer every minute.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Restricted Feeding</title><p>Mice were fed LabDiet&#x000ae; 5001 Rodent chow (20&#x00025; protein and 4.5&#x00025; fat; Purina, Richmond, IN). In preliminary experiments, we found that <italic>Bmal1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice became lethargic and nearly unresponsive to manual stimulation during the restricted feeding protocol when food was provided on the wire-top of the cage. By placing additional food on the bottom of the cage, we found that <italic>Bmal1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice were healthy for the duration of the restricted feeding procedure. Therefore, for the experiments presented herein food was placed on the bottom of the cage for restricted feeding of <italic>Bmal1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> and <italic>Bmal1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>. Food was provided only on the wire-top for wildtype control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004860-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Mice were allowed to eat as much as they desired during the time when food was available. When food was removed the light-tight box was opened and all food was removed from the wire-top and from the bottom of the cage and then the box was closed. During restricted feeding experiments performed in DD, an infrared viewer (FIND-R-SCOPE Infrared viewer, FJW Optical Systems, Inc., Palatine, IL) was used to add and remove food to cages so that mice were not exposed to visible light. During periods of <italic>ad libitum</italic> feeding and food deprivation, the light-tight boxes were not opened in order to avoid any external cues associated with food availability. During this time, the well-being of the mouse was monitored by assessing wheel-running data collected by the computer.</p><p>Wildtype mice were transferred from the breeding room to light-tight boxes (lights on from 06:00 to 18:00 local time). Following at least 3 days of <italic>ad libitum</italic> feeding, mice were food deprived for 24 hours (starting at ZT4, 10:00 local time) and then fed 8 h/day for 2 days and 6 h/day for 2 days (feeding started at ZT4). After this gradual reduction in food availability, mice were fed 4 h/day starting at ZT6 for at least 9 days, fed <italic>ad libitum</italic> for 6 days, and then food deprived for 48 hours starting at ZT12. Some WT mice were fasted for 48 hours starting at ZT3.</p><p>For experiments assessing wheel-running activity in <italic>Bmal1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> and <italic>Bmal1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice in 12L:12D, mice were transferred from the breeding room to light-tight boxes (lights on from 06:00 to 18:00 local time). Following at least 3 days of <italic>ad libitum</italic> feeding, mice were food deprived for 48 hours starting at ZT12.

For experiments assessing wheel-running activity in DD, mice were transferred from the breeding room (lights on 06:00 to 18:00 local time) to light-tight boxes and maintained in DD for at least 6 days with food provided <italic>ad libitum</italic>, and then were fasted for 48 hours starting at 18:00 local time.</p><p>Following 48 hours of fasting, all mice were fed <italic>ad libitum</italic> for 3 days, and then fed 8 h/day for 2 days and 6 h/day for 2 days (feeding started at ZT4, ZT6, or 10:00 CST in 12L:12D, 18L:6D, or DD, respectively). Then, mice were fed 4 h/day (starting at ZT6, ZT8, or 12:00 local time in 12L:12D. 18L:6D, or DD, respectively) for 10 days. In the light-dark cycle, mice were fed <italic>ad libitum</italic> for 6 days and then food deprived for 48 hours (starting at ZT12 or ZT16 in 12L:12D or 18L:6D, respectively). In DD, mice were fed <italic>ad libitum</italic> for 3 days and then food deprived for 48 hours (starting at 18:00 local time). Since it is possible that the FEO could free-run (with an unknown period) in DD during <italic>ad libitum</italic> feeding, we fed <italic>ad libitum</italic> for only 3 days to minimize the change in the phase of FAA when mice were fasted.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Analysis</title><p>ClockLab software was used for behavioral analysis. Group average activity profiles were generated by averaging the counts per 10-minute bin for all mice in each group. The SEM in the mean activity profile graphs represents the variability among the mice in the group. FAA during restricted feeding was defined as the number of wheel revolutions per minute from 4 hours before feeding time to the end of feeding time (total of 8 hours). FAA for each mouse was averaged over 9 days of restricted feeding. Then, the mean FAA during restricted feeding was calculated by averaging the FAA for all mice. FAA during food deprivation was defined as the total number of wheel revolutions per minute from 4 hours before feeding time to the end of previous feeding time (total of 8 hours). Wheel-running FAA for each mouse was determined separately for the first or second day of food deprivation and the mean FAA was calculated from averaging the mice in each group. Nocturnal activity per day was determined by totaling the number of wheel revolutions during the dark portion of the LD cycle (ZT12 to ZT24 for 12L:12D and ZT18 to ZT24 for 18L:6D). The reported value of nocturnal activity represents the mean nocturnal activity averaged over 3 days for ALI, 6 days for ALII, and 9 days for restricted feeding. Total activity per day during <italic>ad libitum</italic> feeding was determined by measuring the total number of wheel revolutions for the entire 24-hour day. Then, mean total activity was calculated by averaging activity over 3 days of <italic>ad libitum</italic> feeding or 2 days of food deprivation.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Statistics</title><p>Data (FAA during restricted feeding and food deprivation) are presented as the mean&#x000b1;standard deviation.
