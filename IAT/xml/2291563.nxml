They play a role in protein homo- and hetero-interactions in processes ranging from signal transduction to RNA binding. In addition, mutations in SAM domain and SAM-mediated oligomers have been linked to several diseases. To date, the observation of heterogeneous SAM-mediated oligomers <italic>in vivo</italic> has been elusive, which represents a common challenge in dissecting cellular biochemistry in live-cell systems. In this study, we report the oligomerization and binding stoichiometry of high-order, multi-component complexes of (SAM) domain proteins Ste11 and Ste50 in live yeast cells using fluorescence fluctuation methods. Fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) and 1-dimensional photon counting histogram (1dPCH) confirm the SAM-mediated interaction and oligomerization of Ste11 and Ste50. Two-dimensional PCH (2dPCH), with endogenously expressed proteins tagged with GFP or mCherry, uniquely indicates that Ste11 and Ste50 form a heterogeneous complex in the yeast cytosol comprised of a dimer of Ste11 and a monomer of Ste50. In addition, Ste50 also exists as a high order oligomer that does not interact with Ste11, and the size of this oligomer decreases in response to signals that activate the MAP kinase cascade. Surprisingly, a SAM domain mutant of Ste50 disrupted not only the Ste50 oligomers but also Ste11 dimerization. These results establish an <italic>in vivo</italic> model of Ste50 and Ste11 homo- and hetero-oligomerization and highlight the usefulness of 2dPCH for quantitative dissection of complex molecular interactions in genetic model organisms such as yeast.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Determining the state of protein complex formation is critical for understanding many signaling and structural pathways.

For example, the average brightness of Ste50-GFP could be explained by a distribution of dimers and trimers, but could also be explained by a distribution of monomers and high-order oligomers, or any other combination.

Again, a one-specie model did not adequately fit the data (average chi<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;4.1); a two-component fit was necessary (average chi<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1.2). The data reveal a dominant specie (N comprises approximately 65 to 75&#x00025; of the total particles from the fit) with a mCherry average brightness (2400&#x000b1;150) consistent with that of a monomer (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.12) and a GFP average brightness of 4980&#x000b1;230, which is indistinguishable from the 1dPCH GFP-GFP dimer brightness (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.7). Thus, the data suggests a dominant complex in the yeast cytosol consisting of monomeric Ste50 and dimeric Ste11. A second abundant specie revealed by the 2dPCH consisted of a high order oligomer of Ste50 that is not associated with Ste11. This data reveals a mutual exclusiveness between Ste50 homo-oligomerization and Ste50 forming a complex that contains two molecules of Ste11. Based on 1dPCH data, we expected a small fraction of a third specie, consisting of monomeric Ste11, but a three-component fit cannot be confirmed with statistics provided by the live cell measurements. Consistent with the lack of cross-correlation reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001931-g002">Figure 2</xref>, 2dPCH of Ste11-GFP, Ste50<sup>L73A-L75A</sup>-mCherry did not fit with a one-specie model (average chi<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6.8), but rather a two-species model (average chi<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1.2), with non-interacting, monomeric species. This result confirms the FCCS and 1dPCH results that the Ste50 SAM domain is required for homo-oligomerization of Ste50, interaction of Ste50 with Ste11, and it plays a role in stabilization of the Ste11 dimer.</p><p>The effects of activation of the mating pathway and osmotic stress pathway were subtle, with the dominant specie in either case still consisting of monomeric Ste50 interacting with Ste11. The average GFP brightness value of this dominant complex under these conditions were lower than that in cycling cells; this decrease was statistically significant at the 95&#x00025; level for high salt conditions relative to wt (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.05) but not at the 95&#x00025; confidence limit for &#x003b1;-factor treated cells (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.11). The trend is consistent with a lower average brightness of the Ste11 component of this complex, and perhaps a distribution of interacting species that varies between 2&#x02236;1 and 1&#x02236;1 Ste11&#x02236;Ste50. The average brightness of the Ste50 high-order oligomer observed by 2dPCH was significantly reduced upon activation of the pheromone pathway (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.02), while the average brightness of the oligomer upon activation of the osmotic stress pathway was not reduced at a statistically high confidence level (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.24).</p><p>Thus, a possible effect of activation of these pathways is a trend toward a reduction in the size of the high-order Ste50 oligomer. This is consistent with change observed by 1dPCH as the decreased average brightness of Ste50-GFP upon activation of the signaling pathways. However, at this point we are uncertain how brightness of mCherry containing complexes scales with number of mCherry subunits at high stoichiometry. The brightness of GFP complexes scales well with GFP subunits, as demonstrated by the fit of the average brightness of the monomeric, dimer, and trimeric controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001931-g005">Figure 5</xref>). We revisited the 1dPCH data of Ste50-GFP to attempt to better quantify the stoichiometry of the high-order, Ste50 oligomer. The result that the dominant specie of Ste50 was a monomer, as shown by 2dPCH, provided an important constraint for fitting the 1dPCH data to a distribution. Therefore the 1dPCH data for Ste50-GFP was fit to a distribution consisting of a fixed monomer brightness and freely varied oligomer brightness. N for each species was also freely varied. The Ste50 1dPCH data was well fit (average chi<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.9) to a distribution that consists of a large percentage of monomer and a small percentage of high order oligomer, in percentages roughly equivalent with those found using 2dPCH. The constrained fits revealed that the treatment with &#x003b1;-factor or high salt led to a slightly decreased percentage of oligomer, and also a decreased oligomer brightness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001931-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Using this analysis, average brightness values of the Ste50 oligomer were approximately 12,500, 8900, and 7700 CPSM for cycling cells, &#x003b1;-factor treated cells, and cells at high salt, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001931-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Assuming that the linearity of GFP brightness continues to hold at a high number of subunits, we estimate the number of Ste50 subunits in this complex to be &#x0223c;5 to 6 in cycling cells, &#x0223c;4 in &#x003b1;-factor treated cells, and &#x0223c;3 to 4 in high salt condition. While the slight decrease in brightness of the Ste50 oligomer was also observed with mCherry in the 2dPCH data, it was not nearly as pronounced as that observed with 1dPCH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001931-g003">Figure 3D</xref>) or the global fit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001931-g005">Figure 5</xref>), raising the possibility that mCherry brightness may not scale linearly with subunit number at high stoichiometry, perhaps due to a self-quenching mechanism or increased propensity for photobleaching or photoblinking relative to GFP.</p><fig id="pone-0001931-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001931.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Constrained fits of the 1dPCH data to two-species allows for the examination of monomer and oligomer populations.</title><p>A.

Importantly, to verify the reliability of 1-photon PCH in live yeast, the brightness values for the control strains were linearly spaced, taking auto-fluorescence into account.</p><p>For 2dPCH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001931-Hillesheim1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001931-Chen3">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, the experimental set-up was identical to the cross-correlation set-up described above and previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001931-Slaughter1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Data were taken in ten-second increments, and arranged in a two-dimensional histogram of counts in each channel as a function of frequency for 50 &#x000b5;s bins. Data were fit to one or two components, and brightness values and particle number in each channel were allowed to freely vary. An F-test was used to validate the necessity of two-component fits (F&#x0003e;97&#x00025;). The plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001931-g004">Figure 4</xref> represent averages and standard deviations for N between 6 and 15 cells.</p><p>For fitting Ste50-GFP, 1dPCH data to a two-component model, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001931-g005">Figure 5</xref>, the brightness of a monomer specie was fixed. The number of monomer, brightness of oligomer, and number of oligomer were freely varied.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Giulia Rancati, Stowers Institute for Medical Research
