Recently, multiple covalent modifications of viral proteins that regulate virus-host protein interactions have been described, such as phosphorylation, acetylation and ubiquitination. Phosphorylation has been reported for almost all HIV-1 accessory proteins, including Vpu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], Vpr [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], Vif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], Nef [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and Rev [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Transcription of HIV-1 viral genes is induced by a viral transactivator protein (Tat) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The activation domain of Tat (amino acids 1&#x02013;48) interacts with host cell factors, whereas the positively charged RNA-binding domain (amino acids 49&#x02013;57) interacts with HIV-1 transactivation response (TAR) RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In cell-free transcription assays Tat induces exclusively elongation of transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. <italic>In vivo</italic>, Tat additionally induces initiation of transcription from the integrated HIV-1 promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Tat stimulates formation of transcription complex containing TATA-box-binding protein (TBP) but not TBP-associated factors (TAFs), thus indicating that Tat may enhance initiation of transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], apparently in agreement with the earlier observation that Tat binds directly to the TBP-containing basal transcription factor TFIID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Tat activates HIV-1 transcription by recruiting transcriptional co-activators that include Positive Transcription Elongation Factor b (P-TEFb), containing CDK9/cyclin T1; an RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and histone acetyl transferases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Whereas P-TEFb induces HIV-1 transcription from non-integrated HIV-1 template [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], histone acetyl transferases allow induction of integrated HIV-1 provirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Additional CTD kinases, including CDK2 and CDK7 were also reported to be activated by Tat and to induce functional CTD phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Tat itself is a subject for covalent modifications by host cell proteins. Tat is directly acetylated at lysine 28, within the activation domain, and lysine 50, in the TAR RNA binding domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Tat is also ubiquitinated at lysine 71 and its ubiquitination stimulates the transcriptional properties of Tat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Recently, Tat was shown to be methylated by the arginine methyltransferase, PRMT6 and the arginine methylation of Tat negatively regulated its transcriptional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Surprisingly, in spite of the interaction of Tat with P-TEFb and probably other kinases and its involvement in multiple protein phosphorylation reactions, the phosphorylation of HIV-1 Tat has only been reported <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], but not <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. HIV-2 Tat was reported to be phosphorylated <italic>in vivo </italic>presumably by CDK9, but this phosphorylation was not important for Tat-2 function as a transcriptional activator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. We previously reported that Tat dynamically interacts with CDK2/cyclin E and is also phosphorylated by CDK2/cyclin E <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. This dynamic interaction greatly stimulated the activity of CDK2/cyclin E toward phosphorylation of CTD <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In the present study we investigated whether Tat is phosphorylated <italic>in vivo </italic>and whether this phosphorylation has a regulatory role in Tat-activated HIV-1 transcription.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Tat is phosphorylated by CDK2 <italic>in vitro </italic>and Ser-16 and Ser-46 residues of Tat are potential phosphorylation sites</title><p>We previously showed that Tat is phosphorylated by recombinant CDK2/cyclin E <italic>in vitro </italic>and that Tat's Ser16 was a potential phosphorylation site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Indeed recombinant CDK2/cyclin E efficiently phosphorylates Tat (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, lane 1). Tat can also be phosphorylated by HeLa nuclear extract (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, lane 2). Immunodepletion of CDK2 from HeLa nuclear extract completely abolished Tat phosphorylation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, lane 3) suggesting that under these conditions Tat was largely phosphorylated by CDK2. Upon analysis of the sequence of Tat, the (S/T)<sub>0</sub>P<sub>1</sub>K<sub>2</sub>(K/R)<sub>3 </sub>consensus motif for serine phosphorylation by CDK2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] was not found, but several sequences were found that partially matched this motif: S<sup>16</sup>QP(K/R)<sup>19 </sup>, S<sup>46</sup>YGR<sup>49 </sup>, S<sup>68</sup>LSK<sup>71 </sup>. To determine potential phosphorylation sites, Tat phosphorylated <italic>in vitro </italic>was analyzed by Mass spectrometry. For this purpose, purified recombinant Tat was phosphorylated with recombinant CDK2/cyclin E <italic>in vitro </italic>followed by immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE purification, in-gel digestion with trypsin, and HPLC purification. Analysis of HPLC eluates showed presence of two peaks in the digest generated from phosphorylated Tat that were absent in digest of non-phosphorylated Tat (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). These two peaks were collected and subjected to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Masses of the peptides over 900 Da were acquired and analyzed with FindPep tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] using the sequence of Tat (MEPVDPNLEPWKHPGSQPRTACNNCYCKKCCFHCYACFTRKGLGISYGRKKRRQRRRAPQDSQTHQASLSKQ) as input. The masses of peptides that did not match to Tat were further compared with Tat peptides from which we subtracted 18 Da, assuming &#x003b2;-elimination of phosphoric acid which is likely to occur during MALDI-TOF analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Matched peptides shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, indicate that Peak I contains peptides with Serine 46 as a potential phosphorylation site, whereas Peak II contains peptides with Serine 16 as a potential phosphorylation site. All matched peptides contain internal lysine or arginine residues, and thus they are apparently products of incomplete digestion by trypsin, which could be a result of incomplete in-gel digestion. Also acquisition of peptide with masses over 900 Da would only allow detection of relatively large peptides. The data suggest that Tat is phosphorylated <italic>in vitro </italic>by CDK2 and that this phosphorylation might take place at Ser<sup>16 </sup>or Ser<sup>46 </sup>residues within S<sup>16</sup>QPR<sup>19 </sup>and S<sup>46</sup>YGR<sup>49 </sup>sequences that partially match to the (S/T)P&#x000d7;(K/R) consensus sequence for CDK2 phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Determination of sites of phosphorylation in Tat</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold>Peak</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Peptides matching to Tat</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>MW</bold></td><td align="center">-18Da</td><td align="center">Matching peptides</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><bold>I</bold></td><td align="center">(T)RKGLGISYG(R)</td><td align="center">950.606</td><td align="center">932.606</td><td align="center">932.606<break/>931.553</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="center">(L)GISYGRKKRR/(Q)</td><td align="center">1220.7</td><td align="center">1202.7</td><td align="center">1202.7<break/>1202.698</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="center">(S)YGRKKRRQRR/(R)</td><td align="center">1403.779</td><td align="center">1385.779</td><td align="center">1385.779<break/>1385.777</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>II</bold></td><td align="center">(L)EPWKHPGSQPRTACNNCYCK/(K)</td><td align="center">2319.272</td><td align="center">2301.272</td><td align="center">2301.272<break/>2301.274</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="center">(P)WKHPGSQPRTAC(N)</td><td align="center">1367.563</td><td align="center">1349.563</td><td align="center">1349.563<break/>1349.544<break/>1349.563<break/>1349.544</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="center">(P)WKHPGSQPRTACNN(C)</td><td align="center">1595.811</td><td align="center">1577.811</td><td align="center">1577.811,<break/>1576.779</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="center">(P)NLEPWKHPG(S)</td><td align="center">1077.606</td><td align="center">1059.606</td><td align="center">1059.606</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Analysis of HIV-1 Tat phosphorylated by CDK2/cyclin E <italic>in vitro</italic></bold>. <bold><italic>A</italic>, Tat is phosphorylated by CDK2</bold>.

We hypothesized that low level of Tat expression after transfection and/or rapid de-phosphorylation by cellular phosphatases might prevent detection of Tat phosphorylation <italic>in vivo</italic>. To overcome these difficulties, we expressed Flag-tagged Tat which we found to be expressed to a higher level in COS-7 cells than untagged Tat (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, compare lanes 3 and 4). To facilitate expression of Flag-Tat in HeLa cells we used adenovirus-mediated expression of Tat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. HeLa cells were infected with Adeno-Tat and incubated 48 hours post infection to allow expression of Tat. Then cells were pulsed with (<sup>32</sup>P)-labeled orthophosphate, and Tat was immunoprecipitated from cellular lysates using monoclonal anti-Flag or polyclonal anti-Tat antibodies. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 15% Tris-Tricine gel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and transferred to PVDF membrane. The membrane was probed with monoclonal anti-Tat antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>) using 3,3'-Diaminobenzidine enhancer system (DABM, Sigma), and also exposed to a PhosphoImager screen (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Both antibodies precipitated a well detectable amount of Tat protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, lanes 3, 4, 6 and 7). Under these experimental conditions, Tat was phosphorylated (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, compare lane 3 to lane 1 and lane 6 to lane 5). Next we treated cells with okadaic acid, an inhibitor of PPP-type phosphatases, to prevent rapid dephosphorylation of Tat in the cells and during the lysis procedure. Treatment with okadaic acid did not change the amount of precipitated Tat (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, lanes 3, 4, 6 and 7). In contrast, Tat phosphorylation was significantly enhanced when cells were treated with okadaic acid (Figs.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, lanes 4 and 7).

HeLa cells were infected with Adeno-Tat and subsequently transfected with siRNAs against CDK2. Transfection of HeLa cells with siRNAs against CDK2 decreased the level of expression of CDK2 by 2.5-fold (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, lane 3). A control non-targeting siRNA pool did not affect expression of CDK2 (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, lane 2). The non-targeting siRNA control was used to ensure that transfection itself did not affect CDK2 expression. Western blot analysis of tubulin and CDK9 was used as control for the specificity of siRNAs. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> transfection with both siRNAs did not affect the level of &#x003b1;-tubulin expression. To ensure that CDK2-directed siRNA decreased the enzymatic activity of cellular CDK2, CDK2 was immunoprecipitated from cells transfected with non-targeting or CDK2-directed siRNA and assayed for its enzymatic activity using recombinant Tat as a substrate. The activity of CDK2 was decreased in the cells transfected with CDK2-directed siRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, lane 2) as compared to the cells transfected with non-targeting siRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, lane 1). Next the cells were infected with Adeno-Tat, transfected with non-targeting or CDK2-directed siRNAs and pulse-labeled with (<sup>32</sup>P). In this experiment no okadaic acid was used. Inhibition of CDK2 by siRNA reduced the level of Tat phosphorylation by 3-fold (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>, compare lanes 2 and 3). Thus CDK2 is likely to mediate Tat phosphorylation in cultured cells. To analyze whether Tat and CDK2 might be present in the same molecular weight complex, we analyzed sedimentation of Tat and CDK2 by ultracentrifugation on a glycerol gradient (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Both Tat and CDK2 co-migrated in fractions 1&#x02013;8 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The CDK9 was present in most of the fractions with the peak in fractions 4&#x02013;5 and 9&#x02013;10 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), which is likely to correspond to low and high molecular weight P-TEFb complexes. HEXIM1, and Brd4 were mostly present in fractions 2&#x02013;6, although HEXIM1 was also detected in higher molecular weight fractions 10 and 11 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Neither Tat nor CDK2 co-migrated with RNAPII which was present in fractions 1&#x02013;13 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). We further analyzed association of Tat with CDK2 by immunoprecipitation. Flag-Tat was expressed in HeLa cells by infection with Adeno-Tat and precipitated from cellular extracts with anti-Flag antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). CDK2 co-precipitated with Tat (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>, lane 4). CDK2 was not precipitated with anti-Tat antiserum from non-infected cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>, lane 3) or not with non-specific preimmune serum from adeno-Tat infected cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>, lane 5). Inhibition of CDK2 expression by CDK2-specific RNAi significantly reduced CDK2 co-precipitated to Tat apparently due reduction of the expressed CDK2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>, compare lane 4 to lane 2). Association of Tat with CDK9 was slightly reduced (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>) but this reduction correlated to the decreased amount of Tat precipitated by anti-Flag antibodies. Binding of Tat-cyclin T1 was not reduced (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>, lanes 3 and 5). The cyclin T2 did not precipitate with Tat (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>), which indicated a specificity of the immunoprecipitation. Taking together, these results suggest that CDK2 associates with Tat in cultured cells, and that inhibition of CDK2 expression prevents Tat phosphorylation. Thus, CDK2 is likely to phosphorylate Tat directly in cultured cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>CDK2-directed siRNA inhibits CDK2 expression</bold>. <bold><italic>A</italic></bold>, CDK2-directed siRNA inhibits expression of CDK2.

This analysis indicates that S<sup>16 </sup>and S<sup>46 </sup>residues might be critical for HIV-1 replication. Because S<sup>16 </sup>and S<sup>46 </sup>residues were 100% conserved, it was not possible to analyze the effect of the mutation of these residues on the HIV-1 progression. We took advantage of the notion that a lysine or arginine present in the fourth position of the (S/T)<sub>0</sub>P<sub>1</sub>K<sub>2</sub>(K/R)<sub>3 </sub>consensus motif is critical for the recognition of the motif by CDK2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].

We have previously reported that Tat interacts directly or indirectly with host cell protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Tat binds to protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) and this binding is important for the induction of HIV-1 transcription by Tat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Tat interaction with PP1 is intriguing as PP1 regulates CDK9 phosphorylation <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. We recently showed that Tat binds to LIS1 protein, a product of lissencephaly gene which mutations cause a severe brain malformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. LIS1 resembles the B-subunit of PP2A and interacts with the catalytic subunit of PP2A; and LIS1 expression induces HIV-1 transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Thus Tat might also be able to interact with PP2A, although not directly with its catalytic subunit. The current study adds more complexity to the Tat function showing that Tat might undergo phosphorylation by CDK2/cyclin E.</p><p>We hypothesized here that CDK2 affects HIV-1 transcription by phosphorylating Tat and that Tat phosphorylation might be important for HIV-1 transcription. We show here that Tat undergoes phosphorylation <italic>in vivo </italic>on serine residues, and that CDK2 is involved in this phosphorylation. Our findings also indicate that phosphorylation of Tat is important for HIV-1 transcription and the activation of integrated HIV-1 provirus. In our previous work we demonstrated that CDK2/cyclin E phosphorylates the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]; that CDK2 was required for Tat-dependent transcription <italic>in vitro</italic>, and that CDK2 phosphorylates HIV-1 Tat <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. CYC202 (R-roscovitine), a pharmacological inhibitor of CDK2, efficiently inhibited replication of wild type and HAART resistant HIV-1 mutants in T-cells, monocytes and PBMCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] indicating that CDK2 activity is required for HIV-1 replication. Recently we showed that siRNA-directed against CDK2 inhibits Tat-induced HIV-1 transcription and HIV-1 viral replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Thus our present study as well as our previous studies point to CDK2 as an important regulator of HIV-1 transcription. Until recently CDK2/cyclin E was considered to be essential for cell cycle progression and that CDK2 regulates G1/S transition by phosphorylating Rb-sequestering factors, including E2F [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Recent findings challenged this role of CDK2. CDK2 knock-out mice were viable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], suggesting that CDK2 is dispensable for proliferation and survival of most cell types. Also, inhibition of CDK2 activity through expression of p27 Kip1, dominant-negative CDK2, antisense oligonucleotides or siRNA did not have an effect on growth of several tumor cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Therefore, not being essential for cellular viability, CDK2 might present a feasible target for anti-HIV-1 therapeutics.</p><p>Previous attempts to detect Tat phosphorylation <italic>in vivo </italic>were not successful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. It is possible that low level of Tat expression or fast dephosphorylation in the cells or during sample preparation may not allow easy detection of Tat phosphorylation. For example, in the early studies Ben Berkhout and his colleagues could only detect Tat expression in COS-7 cells but not in HeLa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. We found that expression of Flag-tagged Tat allowed higher levels of Tat expression especially with the adeno-virus mediated delivery. Treatment with okadaic acid, which inhibits phosphatases of the PPP-family including PP1 and PP2A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], significantly enhanced Tat phosphorylation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), suggesting that Tat may be dynamically dephosphorylated by a cellular PPP-type phosphatase. When we inhibited PP1 by over expression of the central domain of nuclear inhibitor of PP1 (NIPP1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] we did not detect changes in Tat phosphorylation (data not shown). Thus PP2A rather than PP1 is a candidate phosphatase to dephosphorylate Tat.</p><p>Our analysis showed that inhibition of CDK2 expression by siRNA substantially blocked Tat phosphorylation and prevented association of Tat with CDK2. Although these findings suggest that CDK2 might directly phosphorylate Tat, we also cannot rule out a possibility that inhibition of CDK2 reduces the activity of another kinase that in turn might be involved in Tat phosphorylation. Finding that Tat co-migrates with CDK2 on glycerol gradient and also co-precipitated with CDK2 confirms our previous observation that Tat-associated kinase activity contained CDK2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. CDK2-directed siRNA significantly reduced association of CDK2 to Tat, probably by reducing the amount of CDK2 available to interact with Tat.</p><p>We found that Tat is phosphorylated on serine residues <italic>in vivo</italic>. We previously suggested that the <sup>16</sup>SQPK<sup>19 </sup>and K<sup>41 </sup>&#x000d7; L<sup>43 </sup>sequences of Tat interact with CDK2 and cyclin E respectively, and that S16 is phosphorylated by CDK2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In the present study we found that both S<sup>16 </sup>and S<sup>46 </sup>of Tat are potential phosphorylation sites. As S<sup>46 </sup>is adjacent to the K<sup>41 </sup>&#x000d7; L<sup>43 </sup>sequence of Tat, it is likely that the K<sup>41 </sup>&#x000d7; L<sup>43 </sup>sequence participates in binding to CDK2 rather than to cyclin E, as we originally suggested. Interestingly, recombinant CDK2/cyclin E only phosphorylated full length Tat 1&#x02013;72 but not the 15 amino acid peptides of Tat, <sup>9</sup>EPWKHPGSQPKTACN<sup>23 </sup>or <sup>37</sup>CFTTKGLGISYGRKK<sup>51 </sup>(AIDS Research and Reference Reagents Program, NIH), containing only the phosphorylation sites (data not shown), which may indicate a requirement of additional sequences of Tat for its interaction with CDK2/cycline E. Another explanation is that full length Tat creates a favorable conformation for phosphorylation by CDK2. The sequences <sup>16</sup>SQP(K/R)<sup>19 </sup>and <sup>46</sup>SYGR<sup>49 </sup>only partially match the CDK2 (S/T)<sub>0</sub>P<sub>1</sub>K<sub>2</sub>(K/R)<sub>3 </sub>phosphorylation motif. Although the catalytic efficiency of CDK2-cyclin A is impaired 2000-fold, when Pro<sub>1 </sub>is substituted with Ala in a short synthetic peptide substrate, physiological substrates for both CDK2-cyclin A and CDK2-cyclin E often contain phosphorylation motifs replaced with sub optimal determinants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In such sub optimal substrates phosphorylation is enhanced by a cyclin-binding motif that compensates for otherwise poor catalysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Therefore, binding of cyclin E still might be important for efficient phosphorylation of Tat by CDK2.</p><p>Using mutation analysis, we found that S<sup>16 </sup>and S<sup>46 </sup>are equally important for activation of integrated proviral DNA. The single point mutants did not show a significant level of activation, and the double mutant Tat was completely inactive in HLM-1 cells. In contrast, mutation of S<sup>16 </sup>and S<sup>46 </sup>moderately reduced activation of HIV-1 transcription from the episomal promoter. Thus Tat S<sup>16 </sup>and S<sup>46 </sup>residues are important for transcription of a full genomic HIV-1 template containing natural chromatin structure. The effect of alanine mutation of S<sup>46 </sup>is at variance with the previously published observation that alanine mutation of S<sup>46 </sup>induces Tat-transactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. We did not see an increase of Tat transactivation with all mutants tested. Thus we cannot explain this discrepancy. Tat was proposed to form aggregates in the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Using yeast two-hybrid system, we found no evidence that Tat forms dimers in yeast cells (not shown). Therefore, it remains to be determined why Tat should undergo phosphorylation to be fully active as a transcriptional activator. We did not detect a difference between WT and mutant Tat in ability to bind to TAR RNA (not shown). We observed an increase in the expression of untagged Tat with mutations in the S<sup>16 </sup>or Ser<sup>46 </sup>Tat residues and particular of the double mutant of Tat (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). An increase in Tat expression was observed earlier by Rice and Carlotti with a mutant of Tat that lacked first 36 N-terminal amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Thus the amount of Tat expressed in the cells might be stringently controlled and the excess of Tat might have a negative effect on Tat transactivation. Another possibility is that Tat may need to undergo non-proteolytic ubiquitination by Hdm2 ubiquitin ligase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] to be fully active as a transactivator. It is possible that Tat phosphorylation may facilitate ubiquitination of Tat by Hdm2 similar to phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination of p53 by Hdm2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].</p><p>Analysis of Tat sequences available in the PubMed showed that Tat isolates contain from 4 to 11 serine residues. In addition to the highly conserved S<sup>16 </sup>and S<sup>46 </sup>residues, Tat contains less conserved serines at positions 23, 61, 62, 68, 70, 73, 74 and 75. Analysis of the <sup>16</sup>SQP(K/R)<sup>19 </sup>and <sup>46</sup>SYGR<sup>49 </sup>sequences of Tat, showed that R<sup>49 </sup>is conserved among different HIV-1 isolates. Interestingly, mutations in the (K/R)<sup>19 </sup>residue showed correlation with non-progression of HIV-1 disease. Thus (K/R)<sup>19 </sup>residue which is part of a putative CDK2 recognition site in Tat, may be important for progression of HIV-1 disease. Future study will address whether mutation of (K/R)<sup>19 </sup>residue is important for phosphorylation of Tat by CDK2 and whether mutations in this residue affect viral replication.</p><p>Taken together, our findings indicate that Tat is phosphorylated <italic>in vivo </italic>and that phosphorylation of Tat is important for the activation of integrated HIV-1 provirus. Our finding also indicates that CDK2 associates with Tat and thus is likely to phosphorylate Tat directly <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our findings open the door to the evaluation of the potential efficiency of presently available CDK2 inhibitors and specifically designed future inhibitors to disrupt CDK2-Tat association.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>293T cells and COS-7 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA).
