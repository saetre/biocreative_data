The icosahedral capsid consists of two structural proteins, VP1 (83 kDa) and VP2 (58 kDa), which are identical with the exception of 227 amino acids at the amino-terminal end of the VP1-protein, the so-called VP1-unique region (VP1u) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Although VP2 proteins predominate in the capsid of B19, VP1 is critical in eliciting an appropriate immune response in both human and animal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that antiserum produced by immunizing rabbits with a fusion protein containing the entire unique region sequence of VP1 neutralized the binding activity of B19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Recently, a phospholipase A2 (PLA2) motif has been linked to the B19-VP1u [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and mutation of B19-VP1u in the phospholipase domain causes a complete loss in enzymatic activity and viral infectivity (ex: D175A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Although parvovirus PLA2 has been classified as a group XIII PLA2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], the precise function of secreted phospholipases A (sPLA2) from B19-VP1u is still obscure.</p><p>Macrophages are part of the innate immune system and are derived from monocytes, which develop in the bone marrow and play important roles in providing the first line of host defense [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The migration of macrophages through peripheral tissues is an essential step in the host response to infection and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Additionally, pro-inflammatory cytokines are important mediators in the inflammatory process and are associated with the activation of macrophages, which leads to altered morphology and functional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Although various cytokines are elevated in serum from patients with B19 infection and have been associated with the regulation of macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], the role of B19 VP1u on induction of cytokines in macrophages is still obscure.</p><p>Activity of sPLA2 has been implicated in a wide range of cellular responses, including cell proliferation, signal transduction, host defense, and chemokinesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], which includes extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], production of ECM proteins, and the activity of ECM homeostatic enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP). Previous studies have reported that PLA2 promotes dramatic migration and ECM invasion by NIH3T3, mouse fibrosarcoma, and sarcoma cells, via its high affinity receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], which induces cell migration and MMP-2 activation via phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. These results indicate an association between sPLA2 and MMP activation.

However, little is known about the effects of B19-VP1u on macrophage activation. This is the first study to demonstrate the role of B19-VP1u and its sPLA2 enzymatic activity on the induction of macrophage responses that may contribute to inflammatory processes or diseases. Our results reveal the sPLA2 activity of recombinant B19-VP1u proteins can activate macrophages by significantly increasing migration and phagocytosis. Additionally, significant increases of MMP9 activity, IL-6 and IL-1b mRNA expression were detected in macrophages that were stimulated with B19-VP1u as well as the increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and JNK proteins.</p><p>Activity of sPLA2 has been implicated in a variety of physiological and pathological responses, including cell proliferation, chemokinesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], ECM remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], vascular inflammation, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and cerebral ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Recently, parvovirus B19-VP1u has been linked with sPLA2-like activity that is recognized as group XIII enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], a novel type of sPLA2 that may contribute to various pathological processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Additionally, a B19-VP1u mutant, B19-VP1uD175A, is mutated in the phospholipase domain and loses its enzymatic activity and viral infectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, little is known about the sPLA2 enzymatic activity of B19-VP1u in migration and phogocytosis of macrophages that is associated with a variety of inflammatory and immune responses. Notably, our experimental results reveal significant increases in migration and phagocytosis in RAW264.7 macrophage cells treated with recombinant B19-VP1u proteins as compared to the control group. In contrast, no induction of migration and phagocytosis was observed in the experimental group that was treated with B19-VP1uD175A. These experimental results strongly suggest that the sPLA2 enzymatic activity of B19-VP1u is crucial to activation of migration and phagocytosis of macrophages.</p><p>Indeed, phospholipase A2 is known to play important roles in many inflammatory processes and immune responses including atherosclerosis, pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, and cerebral ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Recent studies have demonstrated the association between extracellular-matrix-related proteins and inflammatory responses via activation of mitogen activated kinases (MAPKs). In a cerebral-ischemic animal model, ischemia and organ culture were demonstrated to induce the activation of p38, ERK 1/2 and SAPK/JNK in cerebral arteries and the expression of inflammatory and MMP9 genes in the wall of cerebral arteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Additionally, increased secretion of CXCL8 by sPLA(2)-IB is related to activation of NF-kB in human neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] Recently, various studies have postulated MMP9 may contribute to the development or pathogenesis of autoimmunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. However, the roles of B19-VP1u and its sPLA2 enzymatic activity on B19-related diseases have not been investigated. Notably, a similar phenomenon was observed in our experimental results. We demonstrated an increase in MMP-9 activity, IL-6 and IL-1&#x003b2; mRNA expression, and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and JNK proteins in RAW264.7 cells that were treated with recombinant B19-VP1u proteins. In contrast, no inductive effects on inflammatory related responses were observed in RAW264.7 cells treated with mutant B19-VP1uD175A protein or B19-VP1u with inhibitors. These experimental results strongly indicate the importance of sPLA2 activity of B19-VP1u in activation of macrophages and suggest the involvement of B19-VP1u and its PLA2 activity in inflammatory processes via activation of ERK1/2 and JNK signaling pathways in macrophages.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, parvovirus B19-VP1u and its sPLA2 enzymatic activity are critical for eliciting macrophage responses associated with a variety of inflammatory processes. Our experimental results demonstrate the effects of sPLA2 activity in B19-VP1u proteins by increasing migration, phagocytosis, and inflammatory responses such as significant increases of MMP9 activity, IL-6 and IL-1&#x003b2; mRNA expression in macrophages. This study strongly suggests the crucial role of sPLA2 activity of B19-VP1u in macrophage activation and may provide clues in understanding the role of B19-VP1u in the host response to B19 infection and B19-related diseases.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>BST and CCC conceived this study, drafted the manuscript, and performed the performed statistical analyses.
