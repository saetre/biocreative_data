The conversion of L-threonine to glycine occurs through a two-step biochemical pathway involving the enzymes L-threonine 3-dehydrogenase and 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate coenzyme A ligase. The L-threonine 3-dehydrogenase enzyme has been purified and characterised, but the L-threonine 3-dehydrogenase gene has not previously been identified in mammals.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Transcripts for L-threonine 3-dehydrogenase from both the mouse and pig are reported. The ORFs of both L-threonine dehydrogenase cDNAs encode proteins of 373 residues (41.5 kDa) and they share 80% identity. The mouse gene is located on chromosome 14, band C. The amino-terminal regions of these proteins have characteristics of a mitochondrial targeting sequence and are related to the UDP-galactose 4-epimerases, with both enzyme families having an amino-terminal NAD<sup>+</sup> binding domain. That these cDNAs encode threonine dehydrogenases was shown, previously, by tiling 13 tryptic peptide sequences, obtained from purified L-threonine dehydrogenase isolated from porcine liver mitochondria, on to the pig ORF. These eukaryotic L-threonine dehydrogenases also have significant similarity with the prokaryote L-threonine dehydrogenase amino-terminus peptide sequence of the bacterium, <italic>Clostridium sticklandii</italic>. In murine tissues, the expression of both L-threonine dehydrogenase and 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate coenzyme A ligase mRNAs were highest in the liver and were also present in brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, skeletal muscle, spleen and testis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The first cloning of transcripts for L-threonine dehydrogenase from eukaryotic organisms are reported.

The liver plays a critical role in regulating amino acid metabolism. Porcine-derived hepatocytes are being used in clinical studies of bioartificial liver organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The regulation of amino acid supply to bioartificial organs and maintaining the activity of the amino acid-metabolising enzymes will be important in their development. From a metabolic perspective, threonine is one of three indispensable amino acids. In biological tissues, there are two major and one minor L-threonine degradation pathways. L-threonine is either catabolised by L-threonine 3-dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.103; gene abbreviation TDH) to 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate or by L-serine/threonine dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.16; L-threonine deaminase, gene abbreviation SDH) to NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and 2-ketobutyrate in the major pathways and by threonine aldolase (EC 4.1.2.5; gene abbreviation GLY1) to yield glycine and acetaldehyde in the minor pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, the conversion of L-threonine via 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate to glycine takes place in a two-step process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. L-threonine dehydrogenase catalyses the reaction: L-threonine + NAD<sup>+</sup> = 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate + NADH. The subsequent reaction between 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate and coenzyme A to form glycine and acetyl-CoA is catalysed by 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate coenzyme A ligase (EC 2.3.1.29; gene name KBL). If not processed by 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate coenzyme A ligase, the highly reactive intermediate, 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate, rapidly undergoes decarboxylation to form aminoacetone and CO<sub>2</sub>. L-threonine dehydrogenase and 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate coenzyme A ligase have been found to be associated physically on the inner membrane-matrix of mitochondria where the two enzymes form a complex with a stoichiometry of one threonine dehydrogenase tetramer to two 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate coenzyme A ligase dimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The three-dimensional structure of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate coenzyme A ligase has been determined recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Recently, we have cloned the murine and human 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate coenzyme A ligase cDNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and wished to clone the first enzyme in this L-threonine catabolic pathway. The <italic>E. coli</italic> L-threonine dehydrogenase gene and its activity have been well characterised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. I describe the first isolation of eukaryotic cDNA sequences encoding L-threonine dehydrogenases that have significant identity to 13 peptide sequences from the purified porcine L-threonine dehydrogenase enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and the amino-terminus peptide of L-threonine dehydrogenase from the Gram+ Firmicutes bacteria, <italic>Clostridium sticklandii </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, they have no significant homology to the <italic>E. coli</italic> enzyme at the primary amino acid sequence level.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Previously we identified, by homology to the <italic>E. coli</italic> gene, both the mouse and human cDNAs for 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate coenzyme A ligase, the second enzyme in the biochemical pathway that converts L-threonine to glycine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In a search for the mouse cDNA of L-threonine dehydrogenase, which is the first enzyme in this pathway, I initially used the same approach. However, only expressed sequence tags belonging to sorbital dehydrogenase (and, with a much lower degree of homology, numerous isoforms of alcohol dehydrogenase) were identified. Nor were other candidate genes found in the human genomic sequence. Fortunately, Kao and Davis (1994) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] had previously purified and characterised the porcine L-threonine dehydrogenase protein, that they had isolated from liver mitochondria and partially peptide, sequenced. This peptide sequence was used to identify mouse ESTs with significant homology by a back translation to nucleotides search. The program ESTblast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] was used to construct a tentative mouse contiguous sequence from EST sequences. PCR primers were designed to match the 5' and 3' ends of the electronic contiguous sequence and used to amplify the gene from mouse liver and lung cDNA. After agarose gel electrophoresis, each primer set produced a single amplicon indicating that the gene is not alternatively spliced. The PCR products were cloned and sequenced. A blast search with the murine threonine dehydrogenase cDNA sequence of the pig EST database identified similar 5' and 3' ESTs (accession Nos. BE233801 and BI400146 respectively) and the sequence of these ESTs was utilised to design primers to amplify the pig L-threonine dehydrogenase from hepatocytes by RT-PCR.</p><sec><title>Analysis of murine and porcine L-threonine dehydrogenase cDNAs</title><p>The 1508 bp mouse sequence has an ORF which encodes a 373 residue protein and has a ATTAAA polyadenylation signal at 1460&#x02013;1465 (GenBank accession No. AY116662) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

The nematode, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> has a 5-exon gene located on chromosome V (encompassing only the first 5 exons of the predicted 10 exons of the hypothetical gene product F08F3.4, accession No. AAB04871). By extending the fifth exon to the next polyadenylation site a 1217 bp cDNA is formed, encoding a 359-residue protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The cDNA sequences of both these genes are supported by EST data. The fly and nematode proteins have over 52% identity and 88% similarity to the mammalian proteins in the 306-residue, central core of the enzyme. Four exon/exon boundaries are conserved in two or more of the genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The search also revealed similar L-threonine dehydrogenase ESTs in amphibians, bony fishes, tunicates, flies, moths, mites, nematodes and trypanosomes, but not in higher plants and yeasts. Similarly, the gene for the second enzyme in this pathway, KBL, is also absent from the yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and no L-threonine dehydrogenase activity has been found in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>That L-threonine dehydrogenase sequences have been evolutionarily conserved between the Gram+ bacteria and mammals is shown by the homology between mouse and the amino-terminus peptide sequence from the threonine dehydrogenase of the Gram+ Firmicutes bacteria, <italic>C. sticklandii</italic> which has 54% identity and 93% similarity over 28 residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). <italic>C. sticklandii</italic> is an amino acid fermenting anaerobic bacterium that can grow on threonine as a sole substrate.

GALE is a mixed alpha-helices/beta-sheet protein with a N-terminal NAD<sup>+</sup> binding Rossmann-fold and belongs to the tyrosine-dependent oxidoreductase protein family (also known as short-chain dehydrogenases).

By comparison with the crystal structures of the GALE proteins, two domains were identified and it is likely that the substrate, L-threonine, is located in the cleft between the two domains. The larger amino-terminus domain (residues 58&#x02013;231 on the mouse sequence) has a NAD<sup>+</sup> binding motif. There are 12 conserved residues in the murine L-threonine dehydrogenase protein that are likely to contact the nicotinamide cofactor (Gly-62, Gly-65, Gly-68, Asp-88, Ile-107, His-127, Leu-131, Asn-147, Ser-169, Tyr-195, Lys-199 and Tyr-222) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).

In a search for mammalian L-threonine dehydrogenase genes, clones were isolated from mouse and pig with ORFs very similar to sequenced peptides from the pig L-threonine dehydrogenase protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The mouse and pig L-threonine dehydrogenase proteins also have significant homology to amino-terminus peptide sequences from chicken (<italic>Gallus gallus</italic>) and the bacteria, <italic>C. sticklandii </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. I conclude that the cloned cDNAs encode L-threonine dehydrogenase genes.

Both short- and long-chain L-threonine dehydrogenases have no significant homology to the D-threonine dehydrogenase gene from <italic>Pseudomonas cruciviae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] that is a member of the 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase family.</p><p>However, both types of L-threonine dehydrogenase utilise NAD<sup>+</sup> as a co-factor, but the <italic>C. sticklandii</italic> enzyme only utilises NAD<sup>+</sup> as an electron acceptor whereas the <italic>E. coli</italic> enzyme also catalyses the reduction of 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide and thionicotinamide adenine dinucleotide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].

Probably, the 2 major pathways have different physiological roles with the cytosolic L-serine/threonine dehydratase enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] being highly inducible by a high protein diet, starvation and cortisone, and thought to aid the homoeostatis of blood glucose by mobilising threonine and serine for hepatic gluconeogenesis. Whereas the mitochondrial threonine dehydrogenase enzyme is thought to act in the maintenance of free somatic threonine concentration derived from dietary threonine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. With the identification of threonine dehydrogenase and L-serine/threonine dehydratase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] genes from rodents, the way is open to study their relative contribution to threonine catabolism under different physiological states.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The mouse and pig L-threonine 3-dehydrogenase cDNAs have been cloned.

In agreement with this, the predicted proteins have mitochondrial targeting sequences in their amino-termini followed by an NAD<sup>+</sup> binding domain. In murine tissues, the expression of L-threonine dehydrogenase mRNA was highest in the liver.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Molecular cloning of murine and porcine L-threonine dehydrogenase cDNAs</title><p>Clones encoding the mouse L-threonine dehydrogenase cDNA sequence were obtained by touchdown PCR amplification from mouse liver and lung cDNAs using the Advantage cDNA polymerase mix (Clontech, UK) on a Perkin-Elmer 2400 thermocycler. The cycle conditions for the first 10 cycles were 94&#x000b0;C for 5 sec, 72&#x000b0;C less 0.4&#x000b0;C per cycle for 3 min and for the next 20 cycles 94&#x000b0;C for 5 sec, 68&#x000b0;C for 10 sec, 72&#x000b0;C for 3 min per cycle using primers (100 nM) derived from the sequence of the mouse ESTs D21787, forward 5'-CCGGCTCCCGCGTGGCGTTCTCAGCATCCA-3' and AV100443, first reverse 5' TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTGATACTTAAATTG-3' and second reverse 5'-TTTTTTTTTTTGCAAGCGATCGTT-3' (Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech, UK).</p><p>The porcine (<italic>Sus scrofa</italic>) L-threonine dehydrogenase cDNA was cloned from primary hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] (generously provided by Dr Leonard J. Nelson, Liver Cell Biology Laboratory, University of Edinburgh, UK). Total RNA was extracted using guanidine thiocyanate and treated with DNase-I to remove any contaminating genomic DNA (SV total RNA isolation system, Promega, UK).</p><p>A comparison of the murine threonine dehydrogenase cDNA sequence with the pig EST database identified similar 5' and 3' ESTs (accession Nos. BE233801 and BI400146 respectively). From these EST sequences a gene-specific reverse transcriptase primer and PCR primers were designed to amplify a cDNA region encompassing the porcine L-threonine dehydrogenase ORF.</p><p>Total RNA was reversed transcribed with AMV RNase H- reverse transcriptase (ThermoScript, Life Technologies, UK) at 50&#x000b0;C using primer 5'-GTTTAATACAAATGTCACATACTTCCACAT-3'. The cDNA was amplified by touchdown PCR, as described above, with a final annealing temperature of 58&#x000b0;C using the PCR primers 5'-GGAAGGCTGTTGGCAGAGACC-3' and 5'-CGCTTCCTCCGGCACTTCA-3'. PCR products were examined by agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide. For cloning, PCR products were excised from low-melting point agarose gels and the agarose digested with agarase (Promega, U.K.). The PCR products were cloned into the T-A vector pCR-II-TOPO (Invitrogen, The Netherlands) and sequenced in both directions using the big dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit and AmpliTaq DNA polymerase FS and run on an ABI 373XL Stretch Sequencer (both from PE Applied Biosystems, UK).</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue distribution of L-threonine dehydrogenase mRNA by semiquantitative PCR</title><p>Murine cDNA from 8 tissues (BD Clontech, UK) was analysed for the relative expression of L-threonine dehydrogenase and the housekeeping gene, &#x003b2;-actin, by real time PCR. This was carried out on a GeneAmp 5700 Sequence Detection System using a SYBR Green I double-stranded DNA binding dye assay (both from AB Applied Biosystems). Approximately 0.4 &#x003bc;g of cDNA from each tissue was amplified by PCR using Taq Gold polymerase. Tissue master mixes were divided into gene specific mixes with the addition of PCR primers to a final concentration of 300 &#x003bc;M. The L-threonine dehydrogenase primers were; sense 5'-AAGCACGCGCCTGACTTC-3' and antisense 5'-CCGAGCATTGCTGTCATCTAGA-3' and produced a 99 bp amplicon. The 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate coenzyme A ligase primers were; sense 5'-TGCACGGTTGTCTTCTCAAATG-3' and antisense 5'-ACACAGCGGTCAATGTCTTCCT-3' and produced a 150 bp amplicon. The &#x003b2;-actin primers were; sense 5'-CAGAAGGAGATTACTGCTCTGGCT-3' and antisense 5'-GGAGCCACCGATCCACACA-3' and produced a 93 bp amplicon. The PCR primers were designed (with the aid of the Primer Express program, AB Applied Biosystems) to amplify cDNA with both sense primers located on the penultimate exon and the antisense primers located on the last exon. The &#x003b2;-actin primers were designed to amplify &#x003b2;-actin specifically and not other actin isoforms or pseudogenes. The amplification conditions were; a 10 min hot start to activate the polymerase followed by 40 cycles of 95&#x000b0;C for 15 sec and 60&#x000b0;C for 1 min. The number of cycles required for the SYBR Green I dye fluorescence to become significantly higher than background fluorescence (termed cycle threshold [C<sub>t</sub>]) was used as a measure of abundance. A comparative C<sub>t</sub> method was used to determine L-threonine dehydrogenase gene expression. Expression levels of L-threonine dehydrogenase in each tissue cDNA sample was normalised to the expression levels of the housekeeping gene &#x003b2;-actin (&#x00394;C<sub>t</sub>). The ratios of L-threonine dehydrogenase mRNA/&#x003b2;-actin mRNA from each tissue were standardised to that of liver which was taken as 100% (&#x00394;&#x00394;C<sub>t</sub>). The formula 2<sup>-&#x00394;&#x00394;Ct</sup> was used to calculate relative expression levels assuming a doubling of the DNA template per PCR cycle. To confirm amplification specificity, the PCR products from each sample were examined by melting curve analysis and subsequent agarose gel electrophoresis.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>I thank the Advanced Biotechnology Centre, Charing Cross Campus, Imperial College for DNA sequencing, and Drs Chris Murphy and Nadire Ali for their constructive comments on this paper.</p></sec></ack><ref-list><ref id="B1"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Keene</surname><given-names>JC</given-names></name><name><surname>Austic</surname><given-names>RE</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Dietary supplements of mixtures of indispensable amino acids lacking threonine, phenylalanine or histidine increase the activity of hepatic threonine dehydrogenase, phenylalanine hydroxylase or histidase, respectively, and prevent growth depressions in chicks caused by dietary excesses of threonine, phenylalanine, or histidine.</article-title><source>J Nutr Biochem</source><year>2001</year><volume>12</volume><fpage>274</fpage><lpage>284</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11382545</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/S0955-2863(01)00139-5</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B2"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Yuan</surname><given-names>JH</given-names></name><name><surname>Austic</surname><given-names>RE</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The effect of dietary protein level on threonine dehydrogenase activity in chickens.</article-title><source>Poult Sci</source><year>2001</year><volume>80</volume><fpage>1353</fpage><lpage>1356</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11558922</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B3"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Strain</surname><given-names>AJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Neuberger</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A bioartificial liver &#x02013; state of the art.</article-title><source>Science</source><year>2002</year><volume>295</volume><fpage>1005</fpage><lpage>1009</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11834813</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1126/science.1068660</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B4"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Dale</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Catabolism of threonine in mammals by coupling of L-threonine 3-dehydrogenase with 2-amino-3-oxobutyrate-CoA ligase.</article-title><source>Biochim Biophys Acta</source><year>1978</year><volume>544</volume><fpage>496</fpage><lpage>503</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">728468</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/0304-4165(78)90324-0</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B5"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Aoyama</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Motokawa</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>L-Threonine dehydrogenase of chicken liver.
