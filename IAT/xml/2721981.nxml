The endogenous ALF gene was characterized by RACE and RT-PCR for transcription start site usage, and by sodium bisulfite sequencing to determine its methylation status in somatic and oocyte tissues. Homology between the <italic>X. laevis</italic> ALF promoter sequence and those from human, chimpanzee, macaque, mouse, rat, cow, pig, horse, dog, chicken and <italic>X. tropicalis</italic> was relatively low, making it difficult to use such comparisons to identify putative regulatory elements. However, microinjected promoter constructs were very active in oocytes and the minimal promoter could be narrowed by PCR-mediated deletion to a region as short as 63 base pairs. Additional experiments using a series of site-specific promoter mutants identified two cis-elements within the 63 base pair minimal promoter that were critical for activity. Both elements (A and B) were specifically recognized by proteins present in crude oocyte extracts based on oligonucleotide competition assays.

This is due in part to the fact that germ cells cannot be propagated in cell culture and because cell-free extracts from complex tissues such as the testis are composed of contaminating subpopulations of germ cells and somatic cells. As a result, studies on the mechanisms of mammalian germ cell gene expression have tended to rely on somatic cell culture systems&#x02014;where germ cell genes should normally be off&#x02014;or on cell-free extracts derived from mixed somatic and germ cell populations from whole tissue sources.</p><p>Despite these issues, many regulatory factors have been proposed as regulators of germ cell gene expression. For a few of these, including CREM&#x003c4; and alternative general transcription factors such as TRF2 and TAF105, gene knockouts have demonstrated specific effects on fertility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006664-Nantel1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006664-Falender1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, it has been more difficult to show that regulatory factors identified in transfected somatic cells or those identified by <italic>in vitro</italic> protein-DNA interactions have genuine physiological roles in regulating germ cell genes.</p><p>In this report we ask whether frog oocytes, used in the early studies of gene regulation to define core promoter elements such as the TATA box, would be useful for characterizing germ cell promoter architecture and regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006664-Eisenberg1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006664-Brown1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. There are several advantages to this approach. First, immature oocytes (stages I-VI) from frogs are very large and promoter constructs can be tested for activity by direct injection into the oocytes themselves. Second, cell-free extracts can be made in sufficient quantities to allow biochemical studies. Third, the set of basal transcription factors responsible for promoter recognition in germ cells, including oocytes, consists of a physiologically appropriate set that includes TRF3, ALF, and several TAF variants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006664-DeJong1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006664-Freiman2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006664-Jallow1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. These factors are different from TFIID components used for promoter recognition and activation in somatic cells, making oocytes a natural environment for dissecting the mechanisms of germ cell gene regulation. Thus, the approach allows a germ cell-specific promoter to be matched with cells, in this case oocytes, where the endogenous gene would normally be on.</p><p>To evaluate the use of <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes as a germ cell transcription system we have used the ALF gene as the model. ALF is a paralog of the large (&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;) subunit of TFIIA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006664-Upadhyaya1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006664-Ozer1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> and it plays a TFIIA-like role in stabilizing TBP (TFIID) to TATA elements within promoter DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006664-Upadhyaya2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Characterization of the ALF promoter in mouse resulted in the identification of a number of candidate transcription factors, including possible somatic repressors. These factors included the zinc-finger proteins SP1, SP3, CTCF and the winged helix transcription factor RFX1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006664-Kim1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Studies on the ALF gene in <italic>Xenopus</italic> have shown that its expression is similar to that observed in mice and is restricted to spermatocytes and oocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006664-Han2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006664-Xiao1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. The germ cell-specific expression pattern suggests that the gene has retained the same functional role across these species and that the regulatory mechanisms that control expression are conserved.</p><p>In this report we have isolated the promoter from the <italic>Xenopus</italic> ALF gene using a PCR-based genome walking approach and characterized it with respect to initiation site by both RT-PCR and 5&#x02032;-RACE analysis. Interestingly, the low level of sequence homology between ALF promoters identified in <italic>X. laevis</italic>, <italic>X. tropicalis</italic>, mouse, rat, human, chimpanzee, chicken, and others made it difficult to predict regulatory elements on the basis of sequence homology alone. Nevertheless, functional assays showed that the promoter is able to drive high level expression of a downstream reporter in microinjected oocytes. Fine-scale deletion and mutational analysis resulted in the definition of a very small (63 bp) promoter, making it one of the smallest active germ cell promoter sequences identified thus far. Additional promoter constructs were used to show that the promoter consists of two discrete elements, A and B, both of which were necessary for activity. Finally, mobility shift assays using oocyte-derived extracts revealed multiple complexes which interacted with the A and B elements. Overall, the results showed that frog oocytes provide an effective system to study core promoter architecture and regulatory factor interactions for germ cell specific genes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Isolation of the X. laevis ALF promoter</title><p>The <italic>X. laevis</italic> ALF promoter was isolated with the Promoter-Finder system (Clontech).

One approach involved a series of upstream primers located at various positions within the putative promoter region. These primers were used in combination with a common downstream primer to generate RT-PCR products from oocyte RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006664-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). The downstream primer was positioned so that amplification would occur only from spliced mRNAs and not from contaminating genomic DNA. Control reactions included a primer (S0) that was located a known distance (256 bp) upstream of the common primer. Results with primers S3, S4, S5, and S6 all generated PCR products corresponding in size to primer location, indicating that ALF mRNAs spanning these regions did exist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006664-g001">Figure 1C</xref> lanes 4, 5, 6, 7). Among the products, those derived from primers S5 and S6 (lanes 6, 7) were of greater intensity than those derived from primers S3 and S4 (lanes 4, 5). The results place the most upstream initiation site somewhere between the S2 and S3 primers, and place a stronger downstream site between the S4 and S5 primers. The failure of S1 and S2 to generate a signal (lanes 2 and 3) defines an upper limit beyond which transcription does not initiate. Overall, the results show that transcription can begin as far as 160 bp upstream of the ATG codon, but that the strongest signals occur approximately 50 bp upstream.</p><p>A second approach to map the ALF gene start site involved 5&#x02032;-RACE analysis. In these experiments a primer located approximately 200 bp downstream of the ATG start codon was used for first strand cDNA synthesis reactions followed by reamplification with an adaptor primer and a nested gene-specific primer. The resulting PCR products were cloned and sequenced to determine their endpoints. The results, summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006664-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, reveal multiple start sites with frequencies ranging from one and seven. Most sites (&#x0223c;80&#x00025;) mapped between 16 to 66 nucleotides upstream of the ATG codon, consistent with the strong RT-PCR signals observed with primers S5 and S6 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006664-g001">Figure 1C</xref>. The most distal RACE product (observed once at position &#x02212;146) was at a position consistent with signals observed with primer S3. Sequencing showed that all the RACE clones matched genomic DNA and there was no evidence for an upstream exon.

In the case of germ cell promoters this would ideally involve spermatocytes and oocytes. However, these cells undergo meiosis and cannot be propagated in cell culture. This has led to the use of cell-free extracts from whole testis, a tissue which contains germ cells in many stages of differentiation together with associated somatic cells, as well as the use of somatic cells which, although capable of transcribing transfected germ cell promoters, normally exhibit silencing of endogenous germ cell genes.

Such studies helped define core promoter elements such as the TATA box and were important for developing methods of oocyte preparation and microinjection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006664-Eisenberg1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006664-Brown1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Second, recent studies have shown that the basal transcription machinery present in oocytes is distinct from that in somatic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006664-DeJong1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. This machinery includes a set of oocyte-specific germ cell substitutes for core promoter recognition factors like TBP, TFIIA, and TAFs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006664-Han1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006664-Jallow1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006664-Xiao1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. These variants replace their somatic counterparts and are therefore critical for the recognition and regulation of germ cell genes. The presence of these variants in oocytes means that these cells provide an environment where it is possible to match a germ cell promoter to the set of factors (e.g. TRF3, ALF, etc.) that normally control its expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006664-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Third, oocytes can be isolated in quantities sufficient for the preparation of cell-free extracts needed for <italic>in vitro</italic> protein-DNA interaction assays. This would not be as easily possible with mammalian oocytes because such cells must be individually dissected from ovarian tissue. Disadvantages to the system include the need for sufficient experimental replication of transcription assays to compensate for microinjection damage or frog-to-frog variation in oocyte quality. In addition, the <italic>X. laevis</italic> genome sequence is not available, and orthologous germ cell promoters from frogs and mammals, although conserved in terms of expression patterns, may diverge at the sequence level. On balance however, the ease of oocyte purification and the fact that they contain regulatory factors that are physiologically relevant make these cells an attractive system to address questions about the biochemistry of germ cell gene expression.</p><p>Interestingly, alignment of ALF promoter sequences from twelve diverse species showed poor similarity when all were included, and the similarity between two related frog species <italic>X. laevis</italic> and <italic>X. troplicalis</italic> was itself only about only 60&#x00025;. The two regions of homology identified in the two frog species, as well as the <named-content content-type="gene">CGCAAAA</named-content> motif that appeared to line up with a conserved <named-content content-type="gene">TATA</named-content>-like <named-content content-type="gene">TTCAAAA</named-content> sequence in mammalian promoters, were not critical for transcription activity in oocytes. These observations raise questions about the role of conserved and nonconserved elements in mediating germ cell-specific expression. One possibility is that divergent regions of the promoter might be responsible for germ cell specific gene expression while conserved motifs might be important for somatic silencing. Germ cell-expressed genes and somatic cell-expressed genes evolve at different rates, and we speculate that the greater conservation of somatic factors would require a correspondingly greater conservation of target sites whereas more rapidly evolving germ cell factors might coevolve with rapidly changing regulatory sites. Since the current study was limited to oocytes, however, we do not yet know if the sequences active for expression are also responsible for somatic silencing, or if silencing might be due to a separate, more conserved region of the promoter.</p><p>Deletion analysis demonstrates that the minimal active region is only about 63 base pairs, about half that described for the mouse ALF gene using transgenic experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006664-Han2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. The conclusions reinforce results of previous studies which have shown germ cell promoters to be quite small. Interestingly, transcription start site mapping experiments for the endogenous ALF gene suggest that initiation occurs at sites adjacent to or upstream of the active promoter domain defined in construct microinjection experiments. Further, bisulfite sequencing experiments to assay methylation status show that the endogenous promoter is relatively demethylated in DNA isolated from purified oocytes, consistent with the general correlation between demethylation and germ cell expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006664-Xie1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006664-Trasler1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006664-DeSmet1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Overall, these similarities suggest that germ cell gene regulation in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes is similar to other germ cell expression systems, including those of mammals.</p><p>Fine scale mutational analysis revealed two regions of the promoter (A and B) that, when altered, resulted in changes in both RNA levels and luciferase reporter activity. The results suggest that these two domains, despite their proximity to the 5&#x02032;-UTR and ATG codon, are likely to be promoter regulatory elements rather than translational regulatory elements. Moreover, oligonucleotide competition assays showed that oocyte extracts contain factors that interact specifically with sequences within or adjacent to the A and B elements. Although computer analysis provides predictions about what these factors might be, these predictions will need to be verified in future studies using factor-specific antibodies and purification procedures. The promoter must also be recognized by oocyte-specific basal factor variants such as TRF3 and ALF in order to form a complete, transcriptionally active, preinitiation complex. Indeed, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays have demonstrated interactions between one such factor, TRF3, and a microinjected H2B promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006664-Jallow1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Whether the A and B elements are involved in direct interactions with the core transcription machinery or whether the complexes identified in bandshift assays mediate later steps in preinitiation complex assembly are interesting questions that can be addressed in future studies.</p><p>Previous efforts to characterize germ cell promoters have emphasized their relatively small size and sequence diversity and have identified many site-specific transcription factors possibly involved in their regulation. The current paper extends this work using an approach in which a germ cell promoter is introduced into a cell type, <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, where the endogenous gene itself is naturally active. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the approach and define a very short <italic>Xenopus</italic>-specific germ cell promoter that can be used as a model to study regulatory factors and other mechanisms that are important for germ cell gene regulation.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0006664-DeJong1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation
