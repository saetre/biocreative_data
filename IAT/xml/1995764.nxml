Recent evidence indicates that the CXCR4/CXCL12 chemokine/receptor axis may be involved in promoting NB invasion and metastasis. In this study, we explored the potential role of CXCR4 in the malignant behaviour of NB, using a combination of <italic>in vitro</italic> functional analyses and <italic>in vivo</italic> growth and metastasis assessment in an orthotopic NB mouse model. We show here that CXCR4 overexpression in non-metastatic CXCR4-negative NB cells IGR-NB8 and in moderately metastatic, CXCR4 expressing NB cells IGR-N91, strongly increased tumour growth of primary tumours and liver metastases, without altering the frequency or the pattern of metastasis. Moreover shRNA-mediated knock-down experiments confirmed our observations by showing that silencing CXCR4 in NB cells impairs <italic>in vitro</italic> and almost abrogates <italic>in vivo</italic> growth. High levels of CXCL12 were detected in the mouse adrenal gland (the primary tumour site), and in the liver suggesting a paracrine effect of host-derived CXCL12 on NB growth. In conclusion, this study reveals a yet unreported NB-specific predominant growth and survival-promoting role of CXCR4, which warrants a critical reconsideration of the role of CXCR4 in the malignant behaviour of NB and other cancers.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neuroblastoma (NB), the most common and deadly solid tumour in childhood, originates from primitive cells of the sympathetic nervous system. NB displays a very heterogeneous behaviour at clinical, biological, and genetic levels. The majority of patients presents at diagnosis with an aggressive and metastatic disease for which little improvement in therapeutic options has been made in the last decade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001016-Brodeur1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Metastatic tumour cell dissemination of advanced stage and highly malignant NB tumours mainly occurs in the bone marrow, bone, liver, and skin. Organ-specific metastasis, known to involve events in both the tumour cells and the target tissue, represents an intriguing and yet unresolved phenomenon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001016-Hanahan1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001016-Liotta1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Chemokines are small, cytokine-like proteins forming a large superfamily, originally discovered as essential mediators of leukocyte chemoattraction in inflammation and immune cell homing and recirculation. Upon binding to their cognate seven-transmembrane spanning G-protein-coupled receptors, they induce integrin activation and cytoskeletal rearrangement promoting cell adhesion and directional migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001016-Baggiolini1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001016-Zlotnik1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.

In a number of cancer types, binding of its cognate ligand CXCL12 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001016-Balkwill3">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> was reported to mediate directed migration of cancer cells to sites of metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001016-Balkwill2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001016-Marchesi1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Recent reports indicate that CXCR4 is commonly expressed on NB metastasis in the bone marrow and that it may be actively contributing to NB tumour cell homing to the bone marrow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001016-Zhang1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

At sacrifice (day 102), the mean volume of NB8-E6 tumours was only 48 mm<sup>3</sup>. These results reveal that the time interval between engraftment and detectable tumour growth was considerably reduced in mice engrafted with NB8-CXCR4-C3 cells compared to NB8-E6, thus demonstrating that CXCR4 expression in the CXCR4-negative cell line NB8 dramatically accelerated orthotopic tumour growth <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001016-g002">Figure 2a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>CXCR4 does not induce metastatic dissemination of IGR-NB8 cells</title><p>One of the major proposed contribution of CXCR4 to NB progression was the promotion of site-specific metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001016-Geminder1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

Furthermore, based on our experience in this model, bone marrow metastases usually occur within 50 days after tumour engraftment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001016-Joseph1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We could also rule out that NB8 clones expressed too low levels of CXCR4 to induce invasion or metastasis, as the levels of expression were comparable to that of the PC3-CXCR4 cells, which show enhanced invasive properties.</p><p>In contrast, CXCR4 overexpression induced a remarkable enhancement of, <italic>in vivo</italic> tumour growth, representing the essential observation of this study. Both CXCR4 overexpressing cell lines NB8-CXCR4-C3 and N91-CXCR4-14 displayed a considerably faster growth compared to their respective controls. Even N91-CXCR4-14 cells which did not show enhanced <italic>in vitro</italic> growth, proliferate significantly faster <italic>in vivo</italic>, indicating that endogeneous CXCR4-mediated effects on growth can be further increased and are most likely dependent on the tumor environment. Interestingly, secondary growth was also enhanced: macroscopic liver metastases in the N91-CXCR4-14 were all larger than 500 mm<sup>3</sup> whereas the N91-E2 metastases were smaller than 500 mm<sup>3</sup>. Such observation strengthens the hypothesis that CXCR4/CXCL12 axis participates in the promotion of in vivo NB cell proliferation, together with other micro environmental factors, which need to be identified.</p><p>The impressive influence of CXCR4 on <italic>in vivo</italic> NB growth was further supported by CXCR4 knock-down experiments. <italic>In vivo</italic>, tumour growth of N91-shRNA-CS1 and N91-shRNA-CS2 clones with reduced endogenous CXCR4 was almost totally abrogated compared to N91-pAB303 control cells. This result confirms a role not only for exogenous but also for endogeneous CXCR4 in NB cell growth.</p><p>Under normal culture conditions i.e. in the presence of 10&#x00025; FCS the <italic>in vitro</italic> proliferation assays showed a moderately increased growth of 2/3 NB8-CXCR4 clones compared to mock transduced cells. This discrete growth promoting effect may be ligand independent, considering that serum contains low levels of CXCL12, or be a result of an autocrine signal from low amounts of CXC12 produced by NB cells, as reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001016-Taichman1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the NB8-C3 clone, displaying a moderate <italic>in vitro</italic> and a strongly enhanced <italic>in vivo</italic> growth, showed an increased <italic>in vitro</italic> growth in response to CXC12, indicating that CXCL12/CXCR4 axis can promote NB cell growth in vitro.</p><p>Moreover, NB8-CXCR4 cells were less sensitive to reduced serum concentration (2&#x00025; FCS). This finding indicates that CXCR4 can, at least in part, compensate for serum depletion, and increases survival in stress conditions, a hallmark of malignancy. In NB8-CXCR4 cells CXCL12/CXCR4 activates ERK1/2, with oncogenic and tumour-promoting activities, consistent with the report by Hatse et al showing that endogenous CXCL12/CXCR4 signalling axis is critical for neuroblastoma cell survival and proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001016-Hatse1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. The pro-survival effect of CXCR4 observed in stress conditions may be due to the low amounts of CXCL12 produced by NB cells. The in vitro effect of CXCR4 on proliferation under reduced serum concentration was not observed for the IGR-N91 cell line, which may be due to the fact that the constitutive expression of CXCR4 in this cell line is already be sufficient to confer <italic>in vitro</italic> survival advantages. Indeed, both N91-shRNA-CS1 and N91-shRNA-CS2 CXCR4 silenced clones showed reduced cell proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic> in 10&#x00025; serum and in reduced serum concentration.</p><p>Globally, our results show that exogeneous CXCR4 overexpression in IGR-N91 does not further increase their <italic>in vitro</italic> growth, migration and invasive properties, indicating that a subtle threshold of endogenous CXCR4 level necessary and sufficient for mediating growth, survival and migration is reached in these cells. In contrast, their <italic>in vivo</italic> growth could be further enhanced, probably by synergic signals provided by the tumour microenvironment.</p><p>The difference observed between the CXCR4 growth-promoting effects <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> indeed suggests that CXCR4 participates to a more complex growth-promoting phenomenon involving the tumour microenvironment. The high levels of CXCL12 found in the primary tumour site (adrenal gland) and in a major site of metastasis in our model (the liver) support the notion that it may confer survival and proliferative advantages to the NB cells and is consistent with a critical role of tumour microenvironment in primary and secondary tumour growth. In addition to a possible paracrine effect on tumour growth, the high levels of CXCL12 measured in the primary site (adrenal gland), represents a unique situation to NB where CXCL12 in the adrenal gland could also serve to retain the malignant cells in the primary site, rather than encourage them to metastasise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001016-Balkwill2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Nevertheless, some tumour cells, possibly equipped with unidentified particularly invasive characteristics, do escape the primary tumour and may then use the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis to specifically migrate toward CXCL12 producing organs such as the liver. Thus the large size of liver metastases observed in mice engrafted with N91-CXCR4-14 cells, also supports a CXCR4-mediated enhanced growth at secondary sites as at primary organs.</p><p>In conclusion, this <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> study reveals unique growth-promoting effect of the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis in NB, demonstrated by concordant CXCR4 gain and loss of function assays. This study also emphasizes the importance to study tumour growth and progression in orthotopic conditions. The role of the microenvironment in the CXCR4-mediated growth and the underlying explanation for the lack of increased metastatic spread can only be identified using an orthotopic model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001016-Joseph1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. In particular, the differential expression levels of CXCL12 ligand in primary and secondary target sites clarifies the role of the CXCR4/CXCL12 system in NB progression: it strongly enhances cell growth without increasing <italic>in vivo</italic> invasion.</p><p>Further <italic>in vitro</italic> molecular investigations will be needed to identify the growth and survival pathways involved in such CXCR4/CXCL12 responses. In particular, while some CXCR4-overexpressing related proteins have been already reported, a global CXCR4-mediated expression profile will be identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001016-Nevo1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Key molecules of the CXCR4 signalling pathway could be new targets for specific NB therapeutic tools.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0001016.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Zymographic assay of MMP-2 activity in NB cells culture media.
