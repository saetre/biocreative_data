We investigated their binding specificity at the constitutively methylated region of a CpG island containing the bidirectional promoter of the Breast cancer predisposition gene 1, <italic>BRCA1</italic>, and the Near BRCA1 2 (<italic>NBR2</italic>) gene. In HeLa cells, quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that MBD2 is associated with the methylated region, while MeCP2 and MBD1 were not detected at this locus. MBD2 depletion (&#x0223c;90%), mediated by a transgene expressing a small interfering RNA (siRNA), did not induce MeCP2 or MBD1 binding at the methylated area. Furthermore, the lack of MBD2 at the <italic>BRCA1</italic>-<italic>NBR2</italic> CpG island is associated with an elevated level of <italic>NBR2</italic> transcripts and with a significant reduction of induced-DNA-hypomethylation response. In <italic>MBD2</italic> knockdown cells, transient expression of a <italic>Mbd2</italic> cDNA, refractory to siRNA-mediated decay, shifted down the <italic>NBR2</italic> mRNA level to that observed in unmodified HeLa cells. Variations in MBD2 levels did not affect <italic>BRCA1</italic> expression despite its stimulation by DNA hypomethylation. Collectively, our data indicate that MBD2 has specific targets and its presence at these targets is indispensable for gene repression.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In mammals, DNA methylation at CpG islands located within regulatory regions is a crucial event in gene silencing. The various mechanisms leading to methylation-dependent down-regulation of the transcription remain to be fully determined. However, the discovery of methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) proteins and their interacting partners provides a direct link between DNA methylation and the establishment of a repressive chromatin architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). The five MBD proteins identified to date share the functional MBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). Four of them, MBD1, MBD2, MBD3 and MeCP2, are directly involved in the transcriptional repression of methylated templates in vertebrates and, with the exception of MBD3, bind methylated DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>).</p><p>MeCP2, the founding member of the MBD family, represses transcription through its interactions with the histone deacetylase&#x02013;Sin3 complex and the histone 3 lysine 9 trimethyl-transferase Suv39H1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). MBD3 is part of the histone deacetylase and chromatin remodeling Mi2/NuRD complex, which is targeted to methylated templates in the MeCP1 complex by MBD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). In mouse, an interaction between the MBD2 and the Sin3 complex has also been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). The HDAC complex associated with MBD1 is not yet identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>), but other MBD1 partners such as histone 3 lysine 9 dimethyl transferase SETDB1 and the chromatin assembly protein 1 have been characterized previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>).</p><p>In cell lines, MBD1, MBD2 and MeCP2 transiently repress the expression of genes driven by either strong or weak promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>), suggesting some functional redundancies between these proteins. Moreover, both the MBD1 and the MeCP2 proteins are associated, <italic>in vivo</italic>, with the differentially methylated region of the mouse imprinted <italic>U2af1-rs1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>) and, in cancer cell lines, some methylated CpG islands are bound by multiple MBD proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Since many cell and tissue types express multiple MBD proteins, these data suggest that other members of the family might compensate the absence of a specific MBD. However, functional specificities have been observed. In human, <italic>MeCP2</italic> mutations are the cause of the RETT syndrome (RTT), a neurological disorder associated with motor function impairment that represents one of the most common causes of mental retardation in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). In mouse, loss of <italic>Mecp2</italic> leads to phenotypes that resemble some of the symptoms of RTT patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>), indicating a specific function of MeCP2 in the maturation of central nervous system. <italic>Mbd1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice also show neuronal maturation deficits associated with hippocampal functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Therefore, the involvement of these proteins in different pathways of the central nervous system argues against a functional redundancy between Mecp2 and Mbd1. In addition, mice lacking Mbd2 do not exhibit specific phenotype except a maternal behavior deficit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>).</p><p>Although no global misexpression of endogenous methylated genes has been detected in the first studies, candidate gene approaches have identified some specific target genes. In mouse and rat, Mecp2 is directly involved in a depolarization-controlled repression of the brain derived neurotrophic factor gene in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>), and that of the imprinted <italic>DLX5</italic> gene driven at a distance by Mecp2 has also been shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Specific repression is not restricted to MeCP2. In mouse, loss of <italic>Mbd1</italic> induces small but significant increase in the expression of the endogenous virus, IAP, associated with chromosome instability in cultured neuron cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). <italic>Mbd2</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice exhibit a disordered helper T cells differentiation owing to ectopic expression of the <italic>IL4</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>).</p><p>A comparative study in human cancer cell lines using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay combined with a CpG island microarray also suggests some specificities, since some cancer-associated hypermethylated genes are bound by multiple MBD proteins while others are associated with a single MBD protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Furthermore, in interphase MCF7 cells, the distribution of MeCP2 does not parallel that of methylated cytosine and heterochromatin, and a selective binding of MeCP2 to some repetitive elements has also been observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). The mechanisms driving the MBD binding are not yet fully determined. The relative abundance of the MBD proteins might be an important parameter, since it was suggested that there are more methyl-CpGs in the genome than MBD protein molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>), and whether MBD1, MBD2 and MeCP2 are randomly associated with sites or segregate owing to other constraints is not yet known.</p><p>To address this question, we investigated in HeLa cells, the MBD proteins binding pattern at a CpG island located in the 5&#x02032; end of the Breast cancer predisposition gene 1 (<italic>BRCA1</italic>). <italic>BRCA1</italic> lies head to head with the Near BRCA1 2 gene (<italic>NBR2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). Experiments of site-directed deletions led to the identification of a bidirectional promoter that is embedded within a large CpG island (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). This CpG island contains a region that is constitutively methylated in all human cell lines and tissues, except gametes and preimplantation embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). Therefore, this model represents an interesting tool for investigating MBD proteins binding specificity and their effects on transcription at a naturally methylated CpG island.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Cervix cancer cell line (HeLa) was obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD) and grown in minimum essential medium (Eagle; Sigma, L'isle d'Abeau, France) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum.

The competitor RNA was synthesized using the Sp6 RNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). After DNase I digestion (Ambion Inc.) and RNeasy purification (Qiagen), this competitor RNA was quantified by densitometry and then diluted in the presence of yeast tRNA as a carrier (40 ng/&#x003bc;l; Ambion). For <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>MBD2</italic> quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR, previously designed competitors were used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>).</p><p>Equal amounts of total RNA samples (0.6 &#x003bc;g for <italic>NBR2</italic>, 0.3 &#x003bc;g for <italic>BRCA1</italic> and 0.1 &#x003bc;g for <italic>MBD2</italic>) were coamplified with increasing amounts of competitor RNAs in a final volume of 50 &#x003bc;l using the One Step RT&#x02013;PCR kit, Q solution for <italic>NBR2</italic> (Qiagen) and 0.6 &#x003bc;M of each primers. After a 30 min incubation at 50&#x000b0;C, RT was inactivated by heating at 95&#x000b0;C for 15 min.

In addition, control experiments for each competitor RNA were performed by omitting the RT to ensure that the signal was the result of RNA and not DNA amplification. PCR products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel and quantified. Then, the normalized signals corresponding to the target mRNA and the competitor were plotted against the initial number of competitor molecules added to the test tubes.

For the detection of the MBD proteins, rabbit polyclonal antibodies against MBD2 (kindly provided by Dr P. Wade) or MeCP2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) and mouse monoclonal antibody against MBD1 (Abgent, San Diego, CA), were diluted 1/2000. The secondary anti-rabbit-HRP or anti-mouse-HRP conjugate antibodies were diluted 1/5000. The immunocomplexes were detected using the ECL system (Amersham, Saclay, France).</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation</title><p>Cells were washed and scraped off the culture dishes in phosphate-buffered saline, and nuclei were prepared in ice-cold hypotonic buffer (10 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl and 5 mM MgCl2). Each step was performed on ice and in the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Roche). After centrifugation, cells were lyzed in the hypotonic buffer containing 0.1% NP-40. Nuclei were harvested by centrifugation at 2000 r.p.m. (700 <italic>g</italic>) and were washed in the same buffer. Nuclear proteins were then cross-linked to DNA by an incubation with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and then for 40 min at +4&#x000b0;C. Cross-linking was stopped by adding 125 mM glycine for 5 min. After centrifugation, the pellets were washed in the hypotonic buffer and resuspended in 1&#x02013;2 ml of SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA and 50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, pH 8). Nucleoprotein complexes were sonicated to reduce the length of DNA fragments to 300&#x02013;600 bp. Insoluble material was removed and the supernatant was collected. Thirty microliters of this fraction was preserved as an input control and the rest was diluted 1:10 in ChIP dilution buffer (ChIP assay Kit; Upstate Biotechnology). The chromatin solution was precleared for 1 h by incubation with 80 &#x003bc;l of salmon sperm DNA&#x02013;protein A&#x02013;agarose beads (Upstate Biotechnology). The soluble fraction was collected and 15 &#x003bc;l of monoclonal anti-MBD1 (Abgent), polyclonal anti-MBD1 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), anti-MBD2 (kindly provided by Dr P. Wade), anti-MeCP2 (Upstate) and anti-mouse IgG (Dakocytomation, Trappes, France) antibodies were added and incubated overnight. Then, for ChIP monoclonal antibodies, 1 &#x003bc;g of rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse antibody (Dakocytomation) was added and incubated for 1 h. After immunoprecipitation, immune complexes were collected by adding 60 &#x003bc;l of salmon sperm DNA&#x02013;protein A&#x02013;agarose beads for 1 h. The supernatant corresponding to the unbound fraction was collected. After washing (according to the manufacturer's instructions), complexes were eluted from the beads in 1% SDS and 0.1 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub>. This fraction corresponds to the bound (anti-MBD) or the non-MBD-specific antibodies (anti-mouse IgG) fractions. Cross-links were reversed by heating samples at 65&#x000b0;C in 200 mM NaCl. DNA was recovered by proteinase K digestion, phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. Finally, DNA samples from the input, unbound, non-MBD-specific antibody and bound fractions were quantified.</p><p>Quantitative PCR amplification was performed using a competitor DNA.

After cloning the PCR product into a pGEM-T easy vector (Promega), a single cut within the island fragment was performed using AccIII and an insertion of a 43 bp chemically synthesized duplex-oligonucleotide was accomplished using T4 DNA ligase (Roche). After cloning and purification (Plasmid Maxi Kit; Qiagen), this competitor vector was quantified. Equal amounts (2 ng) of total DNA samples from the input, unbound and bound fractions were coamplified with increasing amounts of competitor plasmid in a final volume of 100 &#x003bc;l using the HotStar <italic>Taq</italic> polymerase kit (Qiagen) and 0.4 &#x003bc;M of each primer.

One microgram of pSUPER<sub>MBD2</sub> was cotransfected with 0.1 &#x003bc;g of a plasmid encoding a geneticin resistance gene into HeLa cells by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France). Cells were selected using 1 &#x003bc;g/ml G418 (Roche) for 15 days.

A 117 bp double-stranded oligonucleotide (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium), containing the five silent point mutations, was introduced into ApaI/AccI site to replace the initial 117 bp fragment. After cloning and sequencing (Biofidal, Vaulx-en-Velin, France), plasmids exhibiting the expected sequence were selected. The transcription of the mutated form of <italic>Mbd2</italic> cDNA allows this mRNA to bypass siRNA-mediated decay.

Furthermore, as previously observed in HeLa cells, the immunoprecipitated fractions are depleted in the methylated island when anti-MeCP2 or anti-MBD1 were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The same results were obtained when a different antibody, anti-MBD1, was used (data not shown). In addition, a positive immunoprecipitation of MeCP2-bound chromatin has been obtained in another set of experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>), and in KD cells additional ChIP control experiments indicated that MBD1 proteins were associated with juxtacentromeric sequences <italic>Sat2</italic> (data not shown). Thus, in MBD2-depleted HeLa cells, the methylated region (nt &#x02212;1244 to &#x02212;1004) of <italic>BRCA1-NBR2</italic> CpG island is not bound by these other two MBD proteins. This observation was extended to the adjacent methylated sequences (nt &#x02212;1364 to &#x02212;1218) using a semi-quantitative approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

We have, therefore, investigated the ability of the exogenous Mecp2 to repress the transcription of the endogenous locus. <italic>Mecp2</italic> was overexpressed in HeLa and <italic>MBD2</italic> KD cells by transient transfection of the pCMV-MeCP2-Ha vector. Immunoblots indicated a high expression of Mecp2 after transfection in both cell types (Supplementary Data, Figure 10s).</p><p>Quantitative ChIP assays, from transfected <italic>MBD2</italic> KD cells, showed a slight (&#x0223c;1.7-fold) but statistically significant enrichment in the A segment of <italic>BRCA1-NBR2</italic> CpG island (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, &#x02018;A&#x02019; segment) in the chromatin fraction immunoprecipitated by antibodies against MeCP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Mecp2 binding was further confirmed by a semi-quantitative ChIP in the adjacent region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

Thus, in MBD2 depleted cells, elevated level of exogenous Mecp2 leads to Mecp2 binding at the <italic>BRCA1</italic>-<italic>NBR2</italic> locus and to a partial repression of <italic>NBR2</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Transient transfection of <italic>in vitro</italic> methylated expression vectors has clearly demonstrated that members of the methyl-CpG binding protein family, MBD1, MBD2 and MeCP2, are directly involved in the methylation-dependent repression of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). In the mouse, loss of these proteins leads to a prominent effect on cerebral function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>), suggesting a specific dependence of these tissues on the control mediated by MBD proteins. Alternatively, functional redundancy between MBD proteins may be more important in other tissues. In line with this hypothesis, global gene overexpression was not observed in mice lacking a particular MBD protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). Nevertheless, further studies indicated that gene-specific dysregulation in non-cerebral tissues are associated with the loss of MBD proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). Analysis of the chromatin proteins also raises the question of the redundancy between these proteins.</p><p>Our analysis, in the HeLa cell line, of a CpG island at the <italic>BRCA1</italic>-<italic>NBR2</italic> locus indicates that the methylated part of this CpG island is bound by MBD2 while MeCP2 and MBD1 are not detected in this region. Furthermore, western blot analysis, using antibodies directed against MeCP2 and MBD1 produced a signal at the expected size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>), &#x0223c;85 and &#x0223c;70 kDa, respectively, indicating that both proteins are expressed in this cell line (data not shown). Thus, the lack of detection of these two proteins at the methylated region of the <italic>BRCA1-NBR2</italic> CpG island is not due to their absence. In addition, the depletion in <italic>BRCA1-NBR2</italic> CpG island in the chromatin fractions immunoprecipitated by the anti-MeCP2 and MBD1 antibodies also indicates that these two proteins are linked to other chromatin domains in HeLa cells. Therefore, the methylated part of this CpG island seems to be specifically associated with MBD2 in our cellular model. Although all the MBD proteins are ubiquitously expressed in somatic tissues, variations in their expression levels, depending on the cell type and the differentiation state, have been observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). For example, in mouse brain, Mecp2 and Mbd1 are highly expressed when compared with Mbd2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>), while <italic>MBD2</italic> transcripts are 20-fold more abundant than <italic>MeCP2</italic> mRNA in breast tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>), suggesting that the relative MBD protein concentrations might be involved in the phenotypes associated with their experimental depletions. Therefore, their relative concentrations might be associated with a prominent binding of MBD2 to some methylated DNA segments. However, in these cells, the strong targeted-depletion of MBD2 proteins, induced by RNAi, does not induce the binding of other MBD proteins at the methylated region of the <italic>BRCA1-NBR2</italic> CpG island. Thus, these data suggest that this sequence is a preferential target for MBD2.</p><p>Among the mechanisms potentially involved in the preferential binding of MBD2, differences in affinity for methylated DNA might be an important component, since it was shown that murine Mbd2b exhibits a higher affinity than Mecp2 for methylated oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). Although this possibility cannot be excluded, it should be noted that, in <italic>MBD2</italic> knockdown HeLa clones, MBD2 proteins were nearly undetectable and the amount of the transcripts was reduced by 92% on the average, while MeCP2 and MBD1 protein levels remained unchanged (data not shown). In addition, hypermethylated CpG islands are associated with MeCP2 in several cell lines and tissues expressing all MBD proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>) and when overexpressed in HeLa cells depleted in MBD2 proteins, Mecp2 binds to the <italic>BRCA1-NBR2</italic> CpG island. Taken together, these data suggest that corepressors of transcription leading to a non-permissive chromatin environment may be, <italic>in vivo</italic>, of importance for the specific recruitment of MBD2, or alternatively for the exclusion of MeCP2 and MBD1 at the <italic>BRCA1-NBR2</italic> locus. The possible presence of a recently described MBD2 partner, the MIZF protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>), has also been investigated, since the methylated region of the <italic>BRCA1</italic>-<italic>NBR2</italic> CpG island contains a consensus binding site for this protein at position &#x02212;960 bp. However, we failed to detect MIZF at this locus by ChIP (data not shown).</p><p>In human cell lines, while chemically induced hypomethylation was associated with the activation of both <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>NBR2</italic>, transcriptional repression mediated by MBD2 seemed to be gene specific, since <italic>MBD2</italic> knockdown elevated only <italic>NBR2</italic> transcription, in HeLa cells. In addition, this phenotype was rescued by exogenous Mbd2, indicating that this effect is a specific consequence of the <italic>MBD2</italic> knockdown. Furthermore, this latter experiment also confirmed that MBD2 is not involved in <italic>BRCA1</italic> expression, since the expression of exogenous <italic>Mbd2</italic> did not modify the amounts of <italic>BRCA1</italic> transcripts in both wild-type HeLa cells and <italic>MBD2</italic> KD cells. Moreover, the response of <italic>NBR2</italic> to DNA hypomethylation was reduced by a factor of &#x0223c;2 in MBD2-depleted HeLa cells, while <italic>BRCA1</italic> response was not affected by the <italic>MBD2</italic>-siRNA. Although MBD2 depletion does not completely abolish the effect of 5-aza-dC, the consistent reduction of 5-aza-dC-response in MBD2-depleted HeLa cells confirms that MBD2 significantly contributes to the methylation-dependent <italic>NBR2</italic> repression.</p><p>In the human genome, <italic>BRCA1</italic> lies head to head with the <italic>NBR2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). The transcription start site of <italic>BRCA1</italic> is separated from the <italic>NBR2</italic> gene by a 218 bp bidirectional promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). This region is embedded within a large CpG island (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>) and the methylated part of this region corresponds to a nuclease resistant chromatin structure in human breast cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>) and in HeLa cells. Hence, this region is located at the 3&#x02032; end of the <italic>NBR2</italic> transcription start site and at the 5&#x02032; end of <italic>BRCA1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The specificity of MBD2 towards <italic>NBR2</italic> transcription from the bidirectional <italic>BRCA1</italic>-<italic>NBR2</italic> promoter, suggests that the methylation-dependent repression of <italic>NBR2</italic> and <italic>BRCA1</italic> is mediated by different mechanisms.</p><p>The analysis of the 5&#x02032; region of the endothelin receptor B gene in human cell lines shows that extensive methylation closely downstream of the initiation site does not abolish gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). However, studies using plasmid and episomal vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>) and patch methylation techniques indicate that methylation downstream of a promoter can decrease transcription levels, suggesting that this epigenetic mark may also affect the elongation rate. Therefore, the reduced expression of <italic>NBR2</italic> mediated by MBD2 might be dependent on such mechanisms. In line with this hypothesis, <italic>BRCA1</italic> expression is not affected by MBD2 binding to the methylated region of the CpG island upstream its promoter. Nevertheless, inhibition of DNA methylation stimulates <italic>BRCA1</italic> expression, suggesting that its repression might be associated with the binding of different MBD proteins to some other methylated DNA segments. Alternatively, DNA methylation may have a direct effect on the binding of regulatory factors since it was suggested that the &#x02212;1582 to &#x02212;202 region of the 5&#x02032; end of <italic>BRCA1</italic> contains several weak regulatory sites (both enhancers and repressors) with additive effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>) and a putative cAMP-responsive element binding transcription factor binding site has been mapped in the <italic>BRCA1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>).</p><p>MBD2 belongs to a family of methylation-dependent transcriptional repressor and its presence in aberrantly methylated genes has been observed in human cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>). However, a direct relationship between MBD2 binding and gene repression has been established only for a few genes. In mouse, it had been shown that Gata-3 and Mbd2 act in competition for the regulation of <italic>Il4</italic> gene transcription in T-helper cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>). Evidences for a contribution of MBD2 in silencing the aberrantly methylated pi-class glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (<italic>GSTP1</italic>) promoter have been obtained, in the breast cancer cell line MCF7 cells, by MBD2-depletion mediated by siRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>).</p><p>Functional domains have been mapped within the MBD proteins and beside their methyl-CpG binding domain, all these proteins posses a domain involved in gene repression, the transcriptional repression domains (TRDs); in contrast to the MBD, no sequence similarities were found between the different TRDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). Many promoters, including Simian virus 40, cytomegalovirus and beta-actin promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>), are efficiently repressed by tethering the minimal TRD of MeCP2, MBD1 and MBD2. However, it was shown that the <italic>L1</italic> promoter is not repressed by fusion protein containing the TRD of MBD2, but is silenced by fusion proteins containing either MeCP2 or MBD1 TRDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>). The repression of <italic>NBR2</italic> by MBD2 does not seem to be specific of its TRD, since in MBD2-depleted HeLa cells, exogenous Mecp2 decreased <italic>NBR2</italic> transcription. Similarly, inhibitory effect of exogenous <italic>Mecp2</italic> has already been observed in <italic>Mbd2</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Indeed, previous studies have shown that the methylation-dependent repression of reporter genes is impaired in fibroblast cell lines from these mice, suggesting that endogenous Mecp2 proteins do not compensate for the absence of Mbd2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Nevertheless, exogenous Mecp2 restores full repression in the <italic>Mbd2</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells, indicating that the overexpression of <italic>Mecp2</italic> can counteract the absence of <italic>Mbd2</italic> in this system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>).</p><p>Although <italic>Mbd2</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are viable and fertile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>), a reduction in Mbd2 inhibits the development of intestinal adenomas in the tumor-prone <italic>Apc</italic><sup>Min/+</sup> mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>). In human cell lines, <italic>MBD2</italic> antisense inhibitors suppress tumorigenesis <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, when these cells are implanted in nude mice as a model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>). Taken together these data suggest that MBD2 represents a new target potential in cancer therapy and, therefore, new insights on MBD2 specificities are, in this context, of importance. Collectively, our data indicate that MBD2 specifically binds to the <italic>BRCA1</italic> island and represses <italic>NBR2</italic>. In addition, our results suggest that the relative abundance of MBD is not a major factor in their targeting to some methylated DNAs. Furthermore, the cellular model developed in this study may represent a valuable tool for the identification of MBD2 target genes, which could be valuable for therapeutics applications.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>Supplementary Material is available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_33_13_4243__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_33_13_4243__1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are most grateful to Dr Paul Wade for providing MBD2 antibodies and to Dr Adrian Bird for the pCMV-MeCP2-HA and pCMV-MBD2 vectors.
