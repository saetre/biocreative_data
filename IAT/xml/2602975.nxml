A number of potent small molecule inhibitors of Kv1.3 channel have been reported, some of which were found to be effective in various animal models of autoimmune diseases. We report herein the identification of clofazimine, a known anti-mycobacterial drug, as a novel inhibitor of human Kv1.3. Clofazimine was initially identified as an inhibitor of intracellular T cell receptor-mediated signaling leading to the transcriptional activation of human interleukin-2 gene in T cells from a screen of the Johns Hopkins Drug Library. A systematic mechanistic deconvolution revealed that clofazimine selectively blocked the Kv1.3 channel activity, perturbing the oscillation frequency of the calcium-release activated calcium channel, which in turn led to the inhibition of the calcineurin-NFAT signaling pathway. These effects of clofazimine provide the first line of experimental evidence in support of a causal relationship between Kv1.3 and calcium oscillation in human T cells. Furthermore, clofazimine was found to be effective in blocking human T cell-mediated skin graft rejection in an animal model <italic>in vivo</italic>. Together, these results suggest that clofazimine is a promising immunomodulatory drug candidate for treating a variety of autoimmune disorders.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Immunosuppressive agents constitute a major class of drugs for the treatment of undesirable or abnormal activation of T lymphocytes and the immune system associated with organ transplantation and autoimmune diseases. Among the most widely used immunosuppressive drugs in the clinic are cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506, natural products of microbial origin that work through inhibition of intracellular calcium signaling cascade downstream of the T cell receptor (TCR). By recruiting abundant cytosolic immunophilin receptors, each of these immunosuppressive drugs induces the formation of a ternary complex with the calcium, calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin, thereby blocking access to the active site of calcineurin by its substrate, nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), preventing the dephosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation of NFAT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004009-Liu1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004009-Rao1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

Although no clear T cell phenotype was observed in Kv1.3 knockout mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004009-Xu1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, several lines of evidence exist in support of a critical role of Kv1.3 channel in the activation and function of human T cells.

As a result, extensive efforts have been made to discover and develop small molecule inhibitors of Kv1.3 as novel immunosuppressants and immunomodulators. A large number of structurally distinct inhibitors have been found, including UK-78282 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004009-Hanson1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, WIN17317-3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004009-Nguyen1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004009-Hill1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, correolide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004009-Felix1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, verapamil <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004009-Chandy1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, and 5-phenylalkoxypsoralens (Psora) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004009-Vennekamp1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, among others.

To accelerate drug development process, we recently assembled a library of mostly FDA-approved drugs as well as drugs approved abroad and drug candidates that have reached in Phase II clinical trials, known as the Johns Hopkins Drug Library. By systematically screening the library in cell-based assays, we have identified and validated several drugs with novel and previously unknown anti-angiogenic and anti-malarial activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004009-Chong1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004009-Byrne1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Herein, we disclose the identification of clofazimine as a promising hit from another cell-based screen for novel inhibitors of the intracellular TCR signaling pathway leading to the transcriptional activation of IL-2. Through a systematic examination of different steps in intracellular TCR signaling, it was revealed that clofazimine blocked calcium signaling in T cells by directly interfering with the function of Kv1.3 channel. Importantly, it was demonstrated that clofazimine was effective in preventing human T cell-mediated skin graft rejection in a reconstituted mouse model of skin transplantation. As clofazimine has been used as an antibiotic in humans since early 1960s, it has great potential as a novel treatment for many human autoimmune diseases. The distinct structure of clofazimine also offers a novel scaffold for the development of future generations of immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory agents.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>The signaling pathway emanating from TCR and leading to the transcriptional activation of the IL-2 promoter is dependent on the second messenger calcium and the calcium and calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin that has been shown to be a common target for both cyclosporine A and FK506 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004009-Liu2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004009-Rao1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

In contrast, the AP-1 luciferase reporter gene activity was enhanced, rather than inhibited, by higher concentrations of clofazimine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004009-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). A similar stimulation of the AP-1 reporter was also observed at higher concentrations of CsA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004009.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>), suggesting that clofazimine may affect the same signaling pathway as CsA.</p><p>The selective inhibitory effects of clofazimine on both NFAT and NF-&#x003ba;B over AP-1 suggested that it is likely to affect the activation of their common upstream regulator, calcineurin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004009-Liu1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004009-Crabtree1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004009-Rao1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. To assess this possibility, we determined whether clofazimine, like CsA and FK506, affected the dephosphorylation of endogenous NFAT in response to ionomycin treatment. Similar to CsA, clofazimine inhibited ionomycin-induced dephosphorylation of NFATc2 in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004009-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). In addition, clofazimine also blocked the ionomycin-induced nuclear translocation of NFAT in Jurkat T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004009.s001">Fig. S1B&#x02013;C</xref>). Together, these results indicated that clofazimine inhibited the activation of calcineurin <italic>in vivo</italic>. We next examined the effects of clofazimine on the activity of calcineurin <italic>in vitro</italic>. Clofazimine had no effect on the enzymatic activity of calcineurin with either <italic>para</italic>-nitrophenylphosphate or immunoprecipitated endogenous NFATc2 as a substrate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004009.s002">Fig. S2A&#x02013;B</xref>). Nor did it affect the binding of GST-NFATc2 to recombinant calcineurin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004009.s002">Fig. S2C</xref>). Interestingly, when the association between the N-terminal fragment of NFAT and the constitutively active form of calcineurin (Cn&#x00394;C) was examined in a mammalian two-hybrid assay, clofazimine inhibited the calcium-dependent NFAT-calcineurin interaction in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004009.s002">Fig. S2D</xref>). Thus, clofazimine appeared to act at a step upstream of calcineurin activation <italic>in vivo</italic>, raising the possibility that it affected either the release of intracellular calcium or calcium influx through the plasma membrane calcium channels.</p><p>We employed live cell imaging to determine the effect of clofazimine on changes in intracellular calcium concentrations in response to thapsigargin treatment. Using the calcium indicator dye Fura-2AM, we were able to observe entry of calcium into Jurkat T cells upon treatment of cells with thapsigargin followed by addition of 2 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> into the extracellular medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004009-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Pretreatment of Jurkat T cells with known CRAC channel inhibitors econazole or gadolinium abrogated calcium entry as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004009-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). We noticed that Jurkat T cells exhibited heterogeneity in their response to clofazimine with varying degrees of inhibition at a given concentration of clofazimine. For example, when cells were preincubated with clofazimine for 5 min, the calcium entry of only about a quarter of cells are inhibited to near completion by the drug while that in remaining cells was blocked to a lesser degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004009-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). When the preincubation time was increased to up to 2 h, there was a time-dependent increase in the proportion of cells that became sensitive to clofazimine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004009.s003">Fig. S3A&#x02013;B</xref>). The inhibitory effect of clofazimine on the extracellular calcium influx suggested that it might affect the CRAC channel. We thus examined the effects of clofazimine in reconstituted CRAC channels using ectopically expressed CRACM1 (Orai1), CRACM2 or CRACM3 subunits co-expressed with STIM1 in HEK 293T cells. But we observed no effects of clofazimine on the reconstituted CRAC current (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004009.s003">Fig. S3C</xref>), ruling out the possibility that clofazimine directly interacts and interferes with the known components of the CRAC channel.</p><fig id="pone-0004009-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004009.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Clofazimine interferes with calcium influx in Jurkat T cells.</title><p>(A) Calcium influx was inhibited by clofazimine in a heterogeneous fashion.

We thus determined the effects of clofazimine on the activity of various known channels expressed in activated T cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004009-g003">Fig. 3A and B</xref>, clofazimine had a dramatic effect on Kv1.3 current in a time- and dose-dependent manner.

This indicates that their IC<sub>50</sub> values for clofazimine are above 10 &#x000b5;M.

Since most cells do not depolarize beyond 0 mV, at least not for appreciable amounts of time, this represents the more physiologically relevant parameter in regards to the inhibitory effect of clofazimine.

The interaction between purified Kv1.3 protein and clofazimine was assessed by taking advantage of the difference in their mobility in native polyacrylamide gels. Free clofazimine migrated quite slowly in the gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004009-g004">Fig. 4C, top panel</xref>). Addition of BSA did not affect the gel mobility of clofazimine. Upon mixing with recombinant Kv1.3, however, clofazimine co-migrated with Kv1.3, as judged by the overlap of the Kv1.3 protein band revealed by Western blot and the colored clofazimine band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004009-g004">Fig. 4C, bottom panel</xref>). The shift in gel mobility of clofazimine by recombinant Kv1.3 strongly suggests that clofazimine forms a complex with recombinant Kv1.3 by directly binding to the protein.</p><p>To further assess the physiological relevance of Kv1.3 as a molecular target for clofazimine, we first determined the effect of ectopic overexpression of Kv1.3 on the sensitivity of the IL-2 reporter gene to clofazimine. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004009-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>, overexpression of Kv1.3 led to a gain in resistance of the IL-2 reporter to clofazimine in a dose-dependent manner. At the highest concentration of Kv1.3 expression plasmid used (2 &#x000b5;g), there was a 35-fold increase in the IC<sub>50</sub> value of clofazimine. Next, we downregulated the expression of endogenous Kv1.3 using lentivirus-mediated RNA interference. Of a total of nine RNAi constructs tested, the most effective construct, shKv1.3-4, partially downregulated the protein level of Kv1.3 by ca. 70 &#x00025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004009-g005">Fig. 5B, C</xref>). A comparison of the dose-response curves of Jurkat cells transduced with shKv1.3-4 lentiviruses and those transduced with viruses carrying a control shRNA against EGFP revealed that knockdown of Kv1.3 increased the sensitivity of the IL-2 luciferase reporter to clofazimine with a nearly 5-fold decrease in the IC<sub>50</sub> values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004009-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>). In contrast, knockdown of Kv1.3 had no effect on the sensitivity of the IL-2 luciferase reporter to CsA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004009.s006">Fig. S6</xref>). The changes in the sensitivity of the IL-2 reporter gene to clofazimine upon overexpression or knockdown of Kv1.3 provide strong support for the notion that Kv1.3 is a specific molecular target of clofazimine.</p><fig id="pone-0004009-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004009.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>(A)</title><p>Over-expression of Kv1.3 in Jurkat T cells resulted in resistance of the IL-2 luciferase reporter to CLF.

Initial experiments using mouse skin or heart transplant models revealed no beneficial effects of clofazimine in those models. These negative results are not surprising given that Kv1.3 plays distinct roles in humans and rodents, as it has been shown that Kv1.3 is dispensable in mice due to the up-regulation of other chloride channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004009-Xu1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.

Moreover, similar results were obtained for mixed lymphocyte reaction using cells derived from rats, making it difficult to evaluate the <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of clofazimine using well-established animal models.

We thus transplanted human foreskin into Pfb-Rag2&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice that lack T, B and NK cells. Upon healing of the skin graft for about 7 days, a total of 100 million human peripheral blood lymphocytes from an unrelated donor were adoptively transferred into the same animals.

By screening a library of known drugs (HDL), we identified clofazimine as a novel inhibitor of this signaling pathway. Further mechanistic deconvolution by systematically examining the known steps in this signaling pathway led to the identification of Kv1.3 as a physiologically relevant target for clofazimine. The selective inhibition of Kv1.3 by clofazimine accounts for the perturbation of calcium oscillation patterns by the drug and the distinct effects of clofazimine on the intrinsic enzymatic activity of calcineurin <italic>in vitro</italic> and the calcineurin-mediated NFAT dephosphorylation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Several lines of evidence were obtained that support Kv1.3 as a major molecular target for clofazimine. In addition to the inhibition of channel activity of ectopically expressed Kv1.3, it was found that clofazimine demonstrated remarkable selectivity for Kv1.3 over other related Kv channels including Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.5 and Kv3.1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004009.s004">Fig. S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004009.s005">S5</xref>). More importantly, we not only observed colocalization of clofazimine with Kv1.3 in live cells, but also denmonstrated that clofazimine could directly associate with purified recombinant Kv1.3 protein in native polyacrylamide gel as judged by the co-migration of the otherwise less mobile clofazimine and faster migrating Kv1.3 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004009-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>).

It is worth noting that unlike Psora-4, clofazimine does not significantly cross inhibit Kv1.5, which should make clofazimine less toxic. Although all existing experimental evidence is consistent with Kv1.3 as a molecular target for clofazimine, we cannot rule out other molecular targets for clofazimine, since it has not been possible to take a unbiased approach, such as photoaffinity labeling of whole cell lysates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004009-Griffith1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, to detect clofazimine binding proteins.</p><p>Although we observed excellent correlation between inhibition of Kv1.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004009-g003">Fig. 3</xref>) and that of IL-2 reporter gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004009-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) as well as that of thapsigargin-induced calcium oscillation in Jurkat T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004009-g002">Fig. 2C&#x02013;D</xref>), one discrepancy remains&#x02014;the calcium influx in only a subpopulation of Jurkat T cells, as measured by the fluorescent dye Fura-2AM, is completely inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004009-g002">Fig. 2A&#x02013;B</xref>).

The varying degrees of sensitivity of individual Jurkat T cells in a given population to clofazimine could be attributed to the different levels of expression of SKCa2 in them.</p><p>There are two related but distinct parameters for measuring calcium influx, one being the amount of calcium ions entering T cells via the CRAC channel, which is measured by the Fura-2AM dye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004009-g002">Fig. 2A&#x02013;B</xref>) and the other being calcium oscillation frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004009-g002">Fig. 2C&#x02013;D</xref>).

Together with previous reports on the important role of calcium oscillation frequency in signaling and cytokine gene expression in T cells, these results offer a coherent and consistent mechanism of action by clofazimine via inhibition of Kv1.3. However, at the same concentration of clofazime that inhibited calcium oscillation frequency in over 80&#x00025; cells, only 25&#x02013;50&#x00025; are affected significantly in the amount of calcium ions getting into cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004009-g002">Fig. 2A&#x02013;B</xref>). Thus, even among those &#x0201c;non-responsive&#x0201d; cells as judged by the change in net cytosolic calcium concentrations, clofazimine inhibited the calcium oscillation in them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004009-g002">Fig. 2.

Together, these results strongly suggest that the two potassium channels involved in regulating CRAC current have distinct functions. While it is unclear whether KCa channels regulate both the amount of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> entry and oscillation frequency, it is apparent that Kv1.3 is mainly responsible for enabling oscillation frequency with less influence on the amount of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004009-g002">Fig. 2</xref>).

The tricyclic phenazine core of clofazimine has not been seen in any other known inhibitors of Kv1.3, thus providing a new pharmacophore for structure/activity relationship studies and the development of new generations of more potent inhibitors. On the other hand, clofazimine does share some similarity with known Kv1.3 inhibitors in certain structural features. For example, the polycyclic core is reminiscent of the tricyclic core of Psora-4 and bicyclic cores of WIN173173. The chlorophenyl substituents on clofazimine can also be found in WIN173173. Whether these gross structural similarities can be translated into similar binding modes of these Kv1.3 inhibitors remains to be determined.</p><p>Clofazimine has been used as an anti-leprosy drug since the early 1960s. In addition to leprosy, clofazimine has also been tested and found to be efficacious in several autoimmune diseases including lupus erythematosus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004009-Mackey1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004009-Bezerra1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, Crohn's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004009-Afdhal1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, ulcerative colitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004009-Smith1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, and pustular psoriasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004009-Chuaprapaisilp1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>.

To date, however, the molecular mechanism of its immunomodulatory activity as well as its anti-mycobacterial activity has remained unknown. The surprising connection between clofazimine and the Kv1.3 potassium channel made in this manuscript not only unraveled a fundamental molecular mechanism of action of clofazimine in the human immune system, but also suggested potentially new expanded therapeutic applications of clofazimine. It is fascinating that clofazimine has been used in a recent trial as part of a combined antibiotic regimen in Crohn's disease to test the hypothesis that Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis is a possible cause of the disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004009-Selby1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. Although a suboptimal dose of clofazimine (50 mg/day) was administered along with other drugs, the outcome of the clinical trial may have to be reinterpreted in light of the inhibitory effect of clofazimine on effector memory T cells uncovered in the present study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004009-PeyrinBiroulet1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to T cell-mediated graft rejection, Kv1.3 has been shown to play a uniquely important role in the proliferation and survival of effector memory T cells which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of autoimmune diseases. Thus, clofazimine is likely to be effective on a number of autoimmune disorders through the same molecular mechanism.</p><p>Although clofazimine does have a number of side effects including GI and skin discoloration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004009-Ramu1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004009-Krop1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>, it is well tolerated and relatively safe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004009-Deps1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>.

As such, clofazimine has great potential in the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes and psoriasis as well as organ transplantation. The fact that clofazimine, unlike other known inhibitors of Kv1.3, has been used in humans for decades may allow for its accelerated clinical evaluation and eventual introduction as new treatments for different autoimmune and other pertinent diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell culture and IL2-Luciferase reporter cell line</title><p>Jurkat E6.1 (ATCC TIB152) T cells were maintained in RPMI medium 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10&#x00025; FBS, 2 mM-L-glutamine, penicillin (50 &#x000b5;g/ml) and streptomycin (50 &#x000b5;g/ml).

(A) Calcium influx in Jurkat T cells was inhibited by 10 &#x000b5;M psora-4 in a heterogeneous fashion. Psora-4 was added 5 minutes before stimulation with 1 &#x000b5;M TG. Representative images were taken 30 minutes after 2 mM calcium was added. The color gradient represents fura-2 at 350 nm/380 nm excitation ratio. (B) Quantitation of 350 nm/380 nm ratios for calcium imaging results shown in (A). Jurkat T cells can be divided into psora-4 responsive (R) and psora-4 non-responsive (NR) groups. (C) Psora-4 inhibits NFAT pathway in Jurkat T cells. The IC50s of psora-4 for IL-2, NFAT reporters are 9.3&#x000b1;1.7 &#x000b5;M and 29.6&#x000b1;8.2 &#x000b5;M, respectively. And the IC50 of clofazimine for NF-&#x003ba;B luciferase reporter assay is over 1 mM (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6 each). All the reporters were stimulated with PMA/ionomycin. (D) Psora-4 significantly enhances AP-1 luciferase reporter at high concentrations (&#x0003e;50 &#x000b5;M, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6), similar to clofazimine.</p><p>(0.77 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0004009.s008.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0004009.s009"><label>Materials and Methods S1</label><caption><p>Supporting Materials and Methods</p><p>(0.10 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0004009.s009.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Drs.
