Animal models and clinical studies of infected patients have indicated that protective chlamydial immunity is primarily mediated by Th1 responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The induction of such immunity involves rapid recruitment and activation of certain effector immune cells, specifically Th1 cells and dendritic cells (DCs) into the local genital mucosa to clear the infection, arrest ascending disease, and prevent major complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In addition, certain complimentary B cell functions &#x02013; principally Ab-mediated enhancement of Ag presentation &#x02013; lead to activation of Ag-specific Th1 cells dependent in part by Fc-receptor-mediated events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Thus, both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses are required for long-term protection against <italic>Chlamydia</italic>.</p><p>With the major elements of protective anti-<italic>Chlamydia </italic>immunity defined, a number of candidate vaccines have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Chemokines have emerged as important factors and possible mucosal adjuvants that function in lymphocyte activation and recruitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Indeed, a qualitative relationship exists between the class of chemokines secreted following infection, the type of immune response (cellular or humoral immunity) elicited, and the fate of the host following infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The profile of chemokine expression serves as a reliable indicator of immune response type (i.e., Th1 <italic>vs</italic>. Th2). In this respect, the CCL5-CCR5 axis has been demonstrated to be preferentially involved in the activation and function of Thl cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>CCL5 is secreted by epithelial cells, macrophages, fibroblasts, platelets, and activated T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This CC chemokine is known to regulate T cell differentiation and polarize Th1 &#x0003e;&#x0003e; Th2 subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] as well as numerous physiological functions of leukocytes including migration. Polymorphisms in CCR5 and CCL5 modulate immune responses as well as susceptibility and progression to HIV-1 and AIDS, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. We also showed that many of the deleterious complications of genital chlamydial infection, due to Th1-mediated inflammation, are not present in individuals with the <italic>ccr5&#x00394;32 </italic>mutation or in CCR5-deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. CCR5 expression following genital chlamydial infection is followed by an early Th1-like response that precedes activation and mucosal recruitment of Ag-specific Th1 cells necessary for clearance of <italic>Chlamydia </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. These findings indicate that CCL5 might be important for inducing protective immunity against <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. However, it is not certain what affect CCL5 deficiency would have on chlamydial disease. We tested the hypothesis that CCL5 is essential for inducing adaptive mucosal immunity against <italic>Chlamydia </italic>by Ab inhibition using a reliable mouse model of genital chlamydial infection. Results revealed CCL5 supports the induction of Th1 cytokine and immunoglobulin IgG2a as well as IgA responses against <italic>Chlamydia</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Expression of chemokines after genital Chlamydia infection</title><p>CCL5, CCR5, and IFN-&#x003b3; mRNAs were measured by quantitative RT-PCR analysis after genital chlamydial infection. A significant increase in CCR5, CCL5, and IFN&#x003b3; gene expression in the spleen and ILN was observed 7 days after genital infection when compared with levels before infection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). These mRNA levels modestly declined at inductive sites 14 days after infection. CCR5, but not CCL5 or IFN-&#x003b3; mRNA expression by fallopian tube-, uterus-, and cervix- derived lymphocytes were considerably higher than levels before infection. Indeed, CCR5 mRNA expression by fallopian tube lymphocytes was significantly higher 7 and 14 days post infection. These data suggest that increases in CCL5, CCR5, and IFN-&#x003b3; mRNA expression during early stages of infection at inductive sites (i.e., spleen and ILN) preceded CCR5 expression at effectors sites (i.e., fallopian tube(s), uterus, and cervix). The pattern of CCL5 and CCR5 as well as IFN-&#x003b3; illustrates how this chemokine axis coincides with both the innate (recognition phase, 0 to 7 days) and adaptive (activation, effector, and decline/homeostasis phases) immune responses to this pathogen and associated inflammation.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>CCL5, CCR5, and IFN-&#x003b3; mRNA expression during <italic>Chlamydia </italic>infections</bold>.

It has been shown in previous studies that CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5 enhance adaptive immunity through Th1 cytokine and co-stimulatory molecule modulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In this study, we demonstrate some of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of CCL5-mediated chlamydial immunity. Importantly, IFN-&#x003b3; mRNA was not significantly elevated 14 days after <italic>C. muridarum </italic>infection. IL-12p40 mRNA expression coincided with CCL5, but typically preceded IFN-&#x003b3; mRNA expression (data not shown). Indeed, early genital clearance of <italic>Chlamydia </italic>has been shown to occur in an IL-12-dependent and IFN-&#x003b3;-independent fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]; so, further studies will be required to dissect the roles of IL-12 and CCL5 in <italic>Chlamydia </italic>clearance and immunity. The present study shows that 7 days after genital <italic>Chlamydia </italic>infection, CCL5, CCR5, and IFN&#x003b3; mRNA levels were elevated in inductive sites, while CCR5 mRNA expression was higher in the fallopian tubes than in the uterus and cervix. To this end, similar yet differential chemokine expression patterns have been reported within anatomically distinct regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>CD4<sup>+ </sup>Th1 cells (and associated cytokines, chemokines, etc.) are critical elements in the immune response, stimulated by an ascending <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>infection in the female genital tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Indeed, studies of chlamydial infection in knockout mice support the importance of class II MHC, CD4, IL-12, IFN-&#x003b3;, and IFN-&#x003b3; receptor for chlamydial immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Our data suggest that CCL5 interactions are comparably important and mediate the temporal recruitment and activation of T cells to mitigate chlamydial infection through protective mucosal adaptive immunity by enhancing Th1 <bold>&#x0003e;&#x0003e; </bold>Th2 humoral and cellular immune responses.</p><p>CCL3 and CCL4 are also CCR5 ligands, but these chemokines were not remarkably elevated compared to CCL5, which was the most abundant CCR5 ligand expressed during the early stages (i.e., &#x0003c; 7 days) of chlamydial infection. CCL5 is an important factor in the homing of lymphocytes that express CCR5, CCR4, CCR3 and CCR1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. It was also demonstrated from our earlier studies that CCL5 can increase the proliferation and activation of Ag stimulated T lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These findings coincide with marked increases in CCL5 and IFN-&#x003b3; production by CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells during chlamydial infection. It is also plausible that CCL5 blockade might reduce the ability of innate immune cells (e.g., NK cells, macrophages, etc.) to respond to <italic>C. muriduram </italic>challenge. Previously, we demonstrated that CCL5 inhibition decreased the numbers of NK1.1<sup>+ </sup>and CD11b<sup>+ </sup>leukocytes at mucosal effector sites following pneumococcal challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. However, T cells were the primary lymphocyte-subtype that were reduced following CCL5 blockade during the hyper cellular response to <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae </italic>in mice.</p><p>Genital <italic>Chlamydia </italic>infection of mice enhanced Ag-specific Abs in serum and vaginal secretions as well as proliferative cytokine responses by CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells isolated from systemic and mucosal compartments.

In this study, <italic>Chlamydia </italic>infection enhanced IgG2a Ab responses, which were reduced after CCL5 inhibition. This highlights the importance of this chemokine in Th1-associated Ab responses against <italic>Chlamydia</italic>.</p><p>The precise cytokine signals required for S-IgA production are not completely understood and studies show both Th1-and Th2-type cell-derived cytokines are important for S-IgA production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].

In particular, IgA Ab-secreting cells predominantly populate the lamina propria of the mucosa. In contrast, <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-specific IgG Abs were not detected in vaginal secretions. This confirms other studies that show vaginal <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-specific IgG Abs are not present at high levels (relative to IgA) in vaginal washes after <italic>C. muridarum </italic>challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. However, intranasal, subcutaneous or transcutaneous immunization using mucosal adjuvants can induce vaginal wash Ag-specific IgG Ab titers that are comparable to those of IgA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p><p>IFN-&#x003b3; production is often associated with IgG2a production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] and may account for the systemic humoral responses against <italic>Chlamydia </italic>following vaginal challenge. In the present study, <italic>Chlamydia </italic>infection induced a profound IgG2a Ab response compared to other IgG subclass Abs. The analysis of mucosal and systemic responses revealed a bias toward Th1 &#x0003e;&#x0003e; Th2 type of responses. While little is known regarding Ag-specific CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cell (IL-4 and GM-CSF) secretory responses during <italic>Chlamydia </italic>infection, we show that these T helper cytokines were increased during chlamydial infection. CCL5 blockade diminished these cellular responses along with <italic>C. muridarum</italic>-specific CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cell secretion of IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-2.</p><p>Contradictory studies demonstrated the ability of CCL5 to promote both Th1-and Th2-type responses. It was reported that anti-CCL5 Ab treatment in mice decreased mycobacterial-inducible Th2-type lesions while increasing schistosomal-inducible Th2-type granulomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. However, studies from our laboratory suggest CCL5 enhances mucosal and systemic humoral responses through help provided by Th1-type cytokines and select Th2-type cytokines, with CCL5 promoting Th1 and Th2 responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The results in the present study suggest that CCL5 is required for optimal Th1 cellular responses against and clearance of <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. These results corroborate our previous findings that CCR5-dependent mucosal immune responses are required for the efficient clearance of genital chlamydial infection, while functional CCR5 expression reduces infertility as a pathologic consequence of Th1-mediated inflammation associated with infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>ccl5 </italic>gene has a number of physiologically relevant single nucleotide polymorphisms that affect its function and expression. In particular, the In1.1T/C haplotype of <italic>ccl5 </italic>is highly prevalent (~37%) in African Americans, than compared to Americans of European origin (~0.3%), and results in significantly lower CCL5 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. This has been attributed to some of the health disparities between these ethic/racial groups; specifically, higher human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) susceptibility and faster progression to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Similar to the <italic>ccr5&#x00394;</italic>32 polymorphism, the data in this study and others suggest diminished CCL5-CCR5 interactions could yield reduced fallopian tube scarring, but could also result in higher transmission/shedding of <italic>Chlamydia </italic>via decreased chlamydial clearance. It is plausible that a host with a modestly compromised innate immune system would on one hand &#x02013; avoid infertility by mounting reduced Th1 responses and on the other &#x02013; be unable to optimally clear a chlamydial infection. This would provide an evolutionary rationale for not only <italic>ccr5&#x00394;</italic>32 and <italic>In1.1T/C ccl5 </italic>polymorphisms, but also the propagation and transmission of <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. No doubt, demonstration of this postulate will require additional and extensive studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms that CCL5 uses to modulate mucosal immunity is essential to better understanding the pathogenesis of chlamydial infection. We tested the hypothesis that CCL5 is essential for inducing adaptive mucosal immunity against <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. We conclude that CCL5 supports the induction of Th1 cytokine and IgG2a Ab as well as IgA Ab responses against <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. The suppression of CCL5 correlated with delayed clearance of <italic>C. muriduram </italic>infection, which suggests chlamydial immunity is mediated by Th1 immune responses driven in part by CCL5.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title><italic>Chlamydia </italic>stocks</title><p>Stocks of the <italic>Chlamydia muridarum </italic>(trachomatis agent for mice) were prepared by propagating elementary bodies (EBs) in McCoy cells and used to infect mice as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].
