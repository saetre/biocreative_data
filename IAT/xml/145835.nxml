By using primer extension analysis we identified the fabH promoter responsible for transcription of the fabH, fabD and fabG genes encoding fatty acid biosynthetic enzymes. The response of the fabH promoter to amino acid starvation was determined in vivo. Transcripts originating from the fabH promoter were quantified by employing a ribonuclease protection assay. The fabH promoter was subject to relA-dependent stringent control and was repressed approximately 4-fold upon amino acid starvation. The results suggest that inhibition of transcription initiation of lipid biosynthetic genes in starved cells contributes to the stringent control of lipid biosynthesis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
