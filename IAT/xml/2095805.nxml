Previously, we showed that fusion of critically shortened telomeres in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> proceeds with approximately the same efficiency in the presence or absence of KU70, a key component of NHEJ. Here we report that DNA ligase IV (LIG4) is also not essential for telomere joining. We observed only a modest decrease (3-fold) in the frequency of chromosome fusions in triple <italic>tert ku70 lig4</italic> mutants versus <italic>tert ku70</italic> or <italic>tert</italic>. Sequence analysis revealed that, relative to <italic>tert ku70</italic>, chromosome fusion junctions in <italic>tert ku70 lig4</italic> mutants contained less microhomology and less telomeric DNA. These findings argue that the KU-LIG4 independent end-joining pathway is less efficient and mechanistically distinct from KU-independent NHEJ. Strikingly, in all the genetic backgrounds we tested, chromosome fusions are initiated when the shortest telomere in the population reaches <bold>&#x0223c;</bold>1 kb, implying that this size represents a critical threshold that heralds a detrimental structural transition. These data reveal the transitory nature of telomere stability, and the robust and flexible nature of DNA repair mechanisms elicited by telomere dysfunction.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>A primary function for the telomere is to confer a protective end structure that prevents natural chromosome ends from being inappropriately recognized as double-strand breaks (DSBs). This is accomplished by the specialized architecture at the chromosome terminus. In most eukaryotes, telomeres are comprised of stretches of TG-rich repeated DNA sequences that terminate in a single-strand overhang (G-overhang), and are bound by double- and single-strand specific telomere proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). For added protection, telomeres can assemble into a higher order t-loop configuration that apparently unfolds in S phase to allow telomerase access for telomeric DNA synthesis.</p><p>Telomere function can be disrupted by prolonged telomerase inactivation or by perturbation of telomere-binding proteins. In such settings, the telomere triggers a DNA damage response and is processed as a DSB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). One outcome is the fusion of aberrant telomeres end-to-end through the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Telomere fusion leads to the formation of dicentric chromosomes that in anaphase form bridges only to be broken when chromosomes are segregated. The new DSBs induce breakage&#x02013;fusion&#x02013;bridge cycles, resulting in chromosome rearrangements that severely compromise genome stability.</p><p>The core components of the NHEJ machinery include LIG4/XRCC4 and the KU70/80 heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). The KU complex acts to juxtapose two DSBs in alignment, while LIG4 and its stabilizing partner, XRCC4, ligate the two ends. In budding and fission yeast, the absence of KU and/or LIG4 leads to severe defects in end-joining; a 10&#x02013;400-fold decrease in NHEJ has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6 B7">4&#x02013;7</xref>). Likewise, mammalian cells deficient in KU and/or LIG4 display up to a 10-fold decrease in NHEJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10 B11 B12">8&#x02013;12</xref>). In both yeast and mammals, KU-independent end-joining pathways have been described, which rely on microhomology for alignment of the termini. In yeast, microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) is driven by the MRX complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> studies in human cells also demonstrate that the MRN complex utilizes microhomology to mediate end-joining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), but it is currently unclear whether this pathway operates <italic>in vivo</italic> Recent studies also implicate PARP1 and XRCC1/DNA ligase 3 (LIG3) in the repair of DSBs in mammalian cells lacking KU and LIG4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17">15&#x02013;17</xref>).</p><p>In addition to its role in DSB repair, KU localizes to telomeres where it functions both in telomere length maintenance and chromosome end protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Notably, the loss of KU in vertebrates and fission yeast results in an increased incidence of end-to-end chromosome fusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18 B19 B20 B21 B22">18&#x02013;22</xref>). In this respect it is paradoxical that KU, a key component of the NHEJ machinery, actively blocks telomere fusion. How KU can provide stability to chromosome ends without engaging NHEJ is unclear, but one possibility is that telomere binding proteins occlude active sites on KU essential to DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p><p>As in DSB repair, fusion of dysfunctional telomeres can be mediated by canonical NHEJ as well as alternate end-joining pathways. In budding yeast, LIG4 is required for joining dysfunctional telomeres to internal DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Similarly, studies in both mammalian cells and fission yeast indicate that the fusion of dysfunctional telomeres is dependent on LIG4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Notably, in the former study where telomere de-protection was induced by the loss of an essential telomere-binding protein, telomeres remained in an open, stabile configuration with intact G-overhangs, even though the ends were recognized as DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). In contrast, dysfunctional telomeres that arise in fission yeast and mammalian cells as a consequence of a long-term telomerase deficiency fuse efficiently in the absence of LIG4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Hence, the context in which the telomere is de-protected may influence its processing by DNA repair machinery.</p><p>Due to its genetic tractability and high tolerance for genome instability, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> is a useful model for studying the consequences of telomere dysfunction. Wild-type <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> telomeres range in size from 2 to 5 kb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), but in mutants lacking the telomerase catalytic subunit, TERT, telomeres shorten by &#x0223c;200&#x02013;500 bp per generation, ultimately triggering the formation of abundant end-to-end chromosome fusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). In the terminal generation of the mutants, where plants were sterile and unable to propagate to the next generation, the shortest functional telomere bearing an intact G-overhang is only &#x0223c;300 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>).</p><p>We previously showed that critically shortened telomeres fuse with approximately the same efficiency in the presence or absence of KU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), arguing that plants employ highly flexible pathways for NHEJ. Since <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> telomeres are abutted by unique subtelomeric sequences on most chromosome arms, it is feasible to investigate mechanisms of chromosome end-joining at the molecular level using PCR. Chromosome fusion junctions arising in <italic>tert</italic> mutants display canonical NHEJ signatures, including the insertion of filler DNA, microhomology and nucleotide deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). The average amount of telomere DNA captured in chromosome fusion junctions is 270 bp, consistent with the length of the shortest functional telomere. While the overall architecture of fusion junctions is similar in <italic>tert ku70</italic> mutants, insertion of filler DNA is reduced and the majority of fusions possess microhomology, suggesting a microhomology-dependent back-up pathway. Consistent with this prediction, chromosome fusions that arise in triple <italic>tert ku70 mre11</italic> mutants display decreased microhomology and increased insertions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), strongly implicating the MRX/N complex in a backup pathway for chromosome end-joining.</p><p>Here we examine the role of LIG4 in telomere fusion. We find that critically shortened telomeres can still fuse in plants lacking LIG4 and KU, with only a modest decrease in frequency. However, the chromosome fusion junctions display different sequence signatures than in <italic>tert ku70</italic> mutants, and the termini exhibit evidence for increased nucleolytic processing prior to fusion, arguing that the KU-LIG4 independent repair pathway is both mechanistically distinct, and less efficient than KU-independent NHEJ. Finally, we report a novel and critical size threshold for <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> telomeres that heralds the onset of chromosome end de-protection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plant growth and MMS treatment</title><p><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> were grown and DNA was extracted as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) with an exception noted below.

Heterozygous plants were identified using PCR with primers Lig4&#x02013;8 (5&#x02032; GTGATTTGAAACTAGTCTGTG 3&#x02032;), Lig4&#x02013;9 (5&#x02032; CAGCAAACCGATTCAGAGATG 3&#x02032;) and LbA&#x02013;1 (5&#x02032; TGGTTCACGTAGTGGGCCATCG 3&#x02032;).

PCR was used to identify a triple heterozygous plant in F1, and this plant was self-pollinated to produce a segregating F2 population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). All single, double and triple mutants along with wild-type plants were identified by PCR from this population. The genomic <italic>LIG4</italic> coding sequence (Genbank accession number: AB023042) was PCR-amplified using DNA from wild-type <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants and placed under direction of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and the octopine synthase transcriptional terminator and cloned into a vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>) for use in agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). The MMS sensitivity of the <italic>lig4-4</italic> mutation was complemented with this genomic construct (data not shown).

The <italic>lig4-1</italic> allele produces a <italic>LIG4</italic> transcript, 3&#x02032; of the T-DNA insertion site presumably from a cryptic promoter within the T-DNA. However, due to the presence of stop codons within the inserted T-DNA construct, this allele likely produces a non-functional protein. In support, <italic>lig4-1</italic> mutants exhibit sensitivity to DNA damage, expected from the loss of a DNA repair protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Nucleic acid extraction, RT&#x02013;PCR and telomere fusion PCR</title><p>DNA was extracted using the CTAB method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>).

DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation, suspended in water and loaded into a 0.8% agarose gel run at 50 V for &#x0223c;16 h. The gel was transferred onto a nylon membrane (Hybond), hybridized with a [&#x003b3;<sup>32</sup>P]ATP end-labeled (T<sub>3</sub>AG<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub> oligonucleotide in a buffer containing 0.25 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 7% SDS and 1 mg/ml BSA. Hybridization signals were detected using a STORM PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and the data were analyzed using IMAGEQUANT software (Molecular Dynamics). Specific subtelomeres were assessed in the same manner except that the DNA was digested overnight at 37&#x000b0;C with 30 U of PveII and SpeI in order to release intact subtelomeres (and their respective telomeres) from the bulk of genomic DNA. The probes used in the detection of the subtelomeres 1L, 2R and 5L are described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).

Approximately 300 mg of plant tissue was extracted using a GE DNA extraction kit (product code 27-5237-01) as per the manufacturer's instructions, except that the tissue was incubated at 37&#x000b0;C. Extracted DNA was incubated with SSB protein (Promega) to a final concentration of 2 &#x000b5;g/ml, to protect the single-stranded G-overhang from degradation. The DNA was then subjected to digestion using 30 U of each of the restriction endonucleases, HaeIII and HinfI, overnight at 37&#x000b0;C. The gel was hybridized with a [&#x003b3;<sup>32</sup>P]ATP end-labeled (TA<sub>3</sub>C<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> oligonucleotide. To ensure the signal obtained was from a single-stranded 3&#x02032; G-overhang, DNA was either mock or treated with T4 DNA polymerase (utilizing its 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; exonuclease activity). As expected, a loss of signal was observed in the samples treated with 24 U of T4 DNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). Agarose gels were denatured and re-hybridized using the same probe. The single-strand G-overhang signals were obtained by calculating the volume of the signal in each lane and then normalizing the signal using the hybridization signal obtained from the denatured gel. The single-strand G-overhang signal obtained from wild-type was set to one and each sample was normalized to this value.</p></sec><sec><title>Cytogenetic analysis</title><p>Mitotic anaphases were obtained from pistils of unopened floral buds as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) but 8-hydroxyquinoline was omitted.

To accelerate our analysis of LIG4, we generated a plant heterozygous for <italic>TERT</italic>, <italic>KU70</italic> and <italic>LIG4</italic> and allowed it to self-pollinate to create a triple <italic>tert ku70 lig4</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). From this cross we isolated all combinations of single, double and triple mutants and evaluated bulk telomere length from each genotype combination by TRF. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> shows the results of this analysis for successive generations of mutant lines arising from the triple heterozygote. As expected, telomere shortening was observed in all the plants lacking a functional <italic>TERT</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, lanes 7&#x02013;10, 13&#x02013;16), and was accelerated in double <italic>tert ku70</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, lanes 9 and 10). Furthermore, as expected, <italic>ku70</italic> mutants displayed greatly extended telomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, lane 6), consistent with our previous observation that KU70 acts as a negative regulator for telomere length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Characterization of telomere length in <italic>tert ku70 lig4</italic> mutants.

As expected, <italic>LIG4</italic> deficiency neither abolished telomere extension in <italic>ku70</italic> mutants, nor did telomere length vary significantly in <italic>tert lig4</italic> versus <italic>tert</italic> or in <italic>tert ku70</italic> versus <italic>tert ku70 lig4</italic>. However, in G2 and G3, the rate of telomere shortening appeared to be slightly faster in several <italic>tert lig4</italic> mutants relative to <italic>tert</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, left panel, compare lanes 1&#x02013;3 with 7 and 8; middle panel, compare lanes 1&#x02013;4 with 5, 6 and 8; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D compare lanes 1&#x02013;4 with 13&#x02013;15). Furthermore, PETRA analysis of individual telomeres in later generation <italic>tert lig4</italic> mutants showed telomeres that were somewhat shorter than in <italic>tert</italic> (data not shown). Confounding these results, however, was a three-generational analysis of <italic>tert lig4</italic> mutants (G1&#x02013;G3) derived from a second LIG4 mutant allele [<italic>lig4-1</italic>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>)]. Similar to <italic>lig4-4</italic>, <italic>lig4-1</italic> appears to be a null allele displaying the sensitivity to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). These double mutants did not reveal evidence for accelerated telomere shortening relative to their <italic>tert</italic> counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, right panel; data not shown). Therefore, our genetic analysis indicates that LIG4 may make a modest contribution to telomere length regulation in the context of a telomerase deficiency, but further studies are needed to address this possibility.</p><p>Notably, a generational analysis failed to reveal differences in the rate of telomere shortening in triple <italic>tert ku70 lig4</italic> mutants versus <italic>tert ku70</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E). Consistent with similar rates of telomere attrition, both <italic>tert ku70</italic> and <italic>tert ku70 lig4</italic> reached the terminal phenotype as early as G3 or G4. To correlate this phenotype with telomere length, we sought to determine the minimal functional telomere length in the most severely affected, developmentally arrested plants using PETRA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). PETRA is a sensitive, PCR-based technique that targets specific telomere arms using a primer directed at a unique subtelomeric sequence and a primer that anneals to the 3&#x02032; G-overhang. This approach allows us to accurately measure telomere length on 7/10 chromosome ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). We define a functional telomere as harboring an intact G-overhang, and hence the minimal functional length corresponds to the shortest PETRA products generated. The shortest telomeres that we could detect in a pool of terminal <italic>tert ku70</italic> mutants was 360 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) and in the two fourth generation <italic>tert ku70 lig4</italic> mutants were 320 and 450 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A and Supplementary Table 2). These data support our conclusion that 300 bp represents the minimal functional length for <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> telomeres, below which the telomere is unable to maintain a G-overhang and block end-to-end fusion. Thus, the failure of <italic>tert ku70 lig4</italic> to proliferate beyond G3 or G4 is likely due to the accumulation of non-functional telomere caps. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Analysis of telomeres in <italic>tert ku70 lig4</italic> mutants.

Telomere fusion was evaluated initially using conventional cytogenetics to detect bridged chromosomes in anaphase. Two independent lines from <italic>tert</italic>, <italic>tert ku70</italic>, <italic>tert lig4</italic> and <italic>tert ku70 lig4</italic> mutants were analyzed for three consecutive generations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). As expected, no anaphase bridges were observed in G1 or G2 of any of the mutants (data not shown). However, beginning in G3 anaphase bridges were observed in both lines of <italic>tert ku70</italic> and <italic>tert ku70 lig4</italic> mutants. Thus, LIG4 is not required for chromosome fusions in cells with critically shortened telomeres.</p><p>For plants that had not reached the terminal phenotype, and which had comparable telomere lengths, the percentage of anaphase bridges was not statistically different. For example, the percentage of anaphase bridges in G3 <italic>tert ku70</italic> line 3 was 6.6% and in G4 <italic>tert ku70 lig4</italic> line 1 was 10.3% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). However, comparison of chromosome fusion rates in terminal generation mutants revealed that the efficiency of end-joining was modestly reduced in the absence of <italic>LIG4</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). In G3 <italic>tert ku70 lig4</italic> (line 9) 6% of the anaphase showed bridges, while in G3 <italic>tert ku70</italic> (line 12) 22.3% of the anaphases harbored bridges. This difference is statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.04). A similar trend was observed with two other lines in G4; the number of anaphase bridges in <italic>tert ku70 lig4</italic> line 3 was reduced relative to <italic>tert ku70</italic> line 1 mutants (10.3% vs 28.4%; <italic>P</italic> = 0.002). Thus, the frequency of chromosome end-joining events appears to be decreased in the absence of LIG4 by a factor of &#x0223c;3-fold.</p><p>To verify that the anaphase bridges we observed reflect telomere fusions, we analyzed these same samples using telomere fusion PCR with primers directed outward from the right arm of chromosome 1 (1R) and the left arm of chromosome 3 (3L) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Southern blot analysis of the PCR products using a telomeric DNA probe gave a signal for <italic>tert ku70 lig4</italic> reactions, although it was reduced compared with <italic>tert ku70</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). Notably, results from telomere fusion PCR correlated well with the reduced frequency of anaphase bridges for the majority (75%) of <italic>tert ku70 lig4</italic> samples tested (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and Supplementary Table 2). <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Telomere length and the onset of end-to-end fusions in <italic>lig4</italic> mutants.

However, when PCR was performed with primers directed at slightly more internal sites on the chromosome, product abundance was not increased. An alternative possibility is that the telomere arms we targeted were not critically shortened, and hence would not be recruited into fusions. To address this issue, we determined the length of individual telomere tracts using PETRA. PETRA showed that the 5L and 5R telomeres were the very shortest in <italic>tert ku70 lig4</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A and Supplementary Table 2). When telomere fusion PCR was repeated using 5L and 5R primers, additional weak products were evident from several triple mutants after hybridization with a telomere repeat probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). Hybridization of the blots with a probe directed to the 5L or 5R subtelomere also yielded only a faint signal (data not shown). These data support the conclusion that the frequency of chromosome end-joining reactions is reduced in the absence of LIG4.</p></sec><sec><title>Chromosome fusion junctions formed in the absence of KU70 and LIG4 display unique sequence signatures</title><p>In accordance with their reduced abundance, telomere fusion PCR products from triple mutants were difficult to clone. Nevertheless, sequence analysis was performed on 11 independent clones. We noted several interesting distinctions in the structure of fusion junctions formed in the presence and absence of LIG4. First, although the use of microhomology (defined by at least one nucleotide overlap) was prevalent in <italic>tert ku70 lig4</italic> mutants, the amount of base pair overlap captured in the junctions was reduced in these mutants relative to <italic>tert ku70</italic> (avg = 2 versus avg = 4.6 perfect nucleotide overlap, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = 0.02). Although the number of clones analyzed is small, these data suggest that end-joining reactions in the absence of both KU and LIG4 are mechanistically distinct from the KU-independent pathway. Second, critically shortened telomeres were more prone to nuclease attack in <italic>tert ku70 lig4</italic> than in <italic>tert ku70</italic>. We observed a substantial decrease in the number of chromosome fusions that involved the direct joining of two telomere tracts. In <italic>tert ku70</italic> mutants, 43% of the junctions reflected telomere-telomere joining, while this was true for only 18% of junctions analyzed from <italic>tert ku70 lig4</italic> mutants [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> and Supplementary Table 3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>)]. In this regard, the chromosome fusion events in the triple mutant more closely resembled <italic>tert</italic> mutants, where only 11% of the junctions analyzed involved direct telomere-telomere joining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). In both <italic>tert</italic> and <italic>tert ku70 lig4</italic> mutants, the large majority of fusions (78 and 73%, respectively) corresponded to telomere&#x02013;subtelomere joining events, in which one chromosome end had lost all of its telomeric DNA prior to fusion. <table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Characterization of chromosome fusion junctions in <italic>tert ku70 lig4</italic> mutants</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>tert ku70 n</italic> = 31<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="TF3"><sup>b</sup></xref></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>tert ku70 lig4 n</italic> = 11</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left"><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Type of fusion<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="TF3"><sup>a</sup></xref></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Telomere&#x02013;telomere</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">43%</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">18%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Telomere&#x02013;subtelomere</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">51%</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">73%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Subtelomere&#x02013;subtelomere</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5%</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">9%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Complex</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1%</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Features of fusion junctions</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Deletion of subtelomere sequence</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">220 bp</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">220 bp</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Telomeric repeat retained at fusion site</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">270 bp</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">50 bp</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Microhomology at fusion junction<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="TF3"><sup>c</sup></xref></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">81%</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">66%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Insertion of filler DNA at fusion junction</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10%</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0%</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="TF3"><p><sup>a</sup>Telomere fusion PCR products were cloned and sequenced as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>).

While the profile of bulk telomeres in terminal generation plants detected by standard TRF blots is indistinguishable in <italic>tert ku70</italic> and <italic>tert ku70 lig4</italic> mutants, a subset of chromosome ends could have suffered extensive nuclease attack. Although we did not have sufficient genomic DNA from terminal generation mutants to evaluate all the chromosome arms, analysis of the 1L, 2R and 5L telomeres indicated that at least these three termini have not been extensively degraded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). Second, we performed in-gel hybridization to monitor the status of the G-overhang in terminal generation <italic>tert ku70 lig4</italic> mutants. Telomere uncapping in LIG4-deficient mammalian cells does not result in any loss of G-overhangs (25,41).

PETRA analysis revealed that the absence of LIG4 did not affect the stochastic nature of which telomere is the shortest. For example, in one G4 <italic>tert ku70 lig4</italic> mutant the shortest telomere was 5R (320 bp), while in another plant it was 4R (450 bp) (Supplementary Table 2). Similarly, the range of telomere lengths (i.e. the difference between the shortest and longest telomere in a given plant) was approximately the same in <italic>tert ku70</italic> and <italic>tert ku70 lig4</italic> mutants. The average range of telomere lengths for the two G3 <italic>tert ku70</italic> lines was 990 bp and 930 bp in G4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B and Supplementary Table 1). For <italic>tert ku70 lig4</italic> the range was 820 bp and 750 bp, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B and Supplementary Table 2).</p><p>Despite the stochastic nature of telomere dynamics in all the genetic backgrounds we examined (<italic>tert</italic>, <italic>tert ku70</italic>, <italic>tert ku70 lig4</italic>), the onset of telomere fusions strongly correlated with the presence of at least one telomere in the population that was 1 kb or below in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). In <italic>tert ku70</italic> mutants 94% of the plants (15/16) shown to contain telomere fusions by our PCR assay harbored a telomere of &#x02a7d;1 kb (Supplementary Table 1). For <italic>tert ku70 lig4</italic> mutants this value was 90% (9/10) (Supplementary Table 2). Similarly, when samples showing cytogenetic evidence for chromosome fusions from <italic>tert ku70 lig4</italic> mutants are included with samples showing positive telomere fusion PCR data, 87% of the plants contain at least one telomere that is less than or equal to &#x0223c;1 kb in length (Supplementary Table 2). This correlation was also evident when data from both <italic>tert ku70</italic> and <italic>tert ku70 lig4</italic> are combined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C). Thus, although bulk telomeres continue to shorten until they reach the minimal functional size of &#x0223c;300 bp, our data indicate 1 kb represents a critical length threshold. Telomeres that drop below this length have lost the ability to efficiently cap the chromosome terminus and begin to participate in end-joining reactions.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Here we exploit the genetic tractability of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> to examine DNA repair pathways that are elicited in mutants experiencing progressive telomere erosion. Specifically, we evaluated the role of LIG4 in promoting the formation of end-to-end chromosome fusions. By employing plants that were doubly deficient in TERT and KU70, our analysis was expedited as telomeres shortened two to three times faster in this background than in single <italic>tert</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Furthermore, by inactivating both <italic>KU</italic> and <italic>LIG4</italic>, we severely crippled the conventional NHEJ machinery, allowing us to investigate potential backup mechanisms for DSB repair. As with yeast and mammals, we found that LIG4 does not make a significant contribution to telomere length maintenance in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Interestingly, we observed a slight increase in the rate of telomere shortening in <italic>tert</italic> mutants carrying the <italic>lig4-4</italic> allele, but not the <italic>lig4-1</italic>. However, since <italic>tert lig4-4</italic> mutants are viable through at least G6 as are their <italic>tert</italic> siblings (Heacock,M. and Shippen,D., unpublished data), LIG4 appears to play only a minor role in telomere length maintenance when telomerase is inactivated. Consistent with this conclusion, we found that bulk telomeres shorten at the same rate in <italic>tert ku70 lig4</italic> mutants as in <italic>tert ku70</italic> mutants. In both settings plants typically reach the terminal phenotype in G3 or G4.</p><p>To evaluate the role of LIG4 in joining dysfunctional telomeres, we monitored genome integrity in plants with shortening telomeres using a combination of cytogenetic analysis and telomere fusion PCR. As with KU mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), we found that chromosome fusions can be readily detected in plants lacking both LIG4 and KU. Since NHEJ is favored in higher eukaryotes by 1000-fold over homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>), the other well-characterized DSB repair pathway, our findings reveal a second backup mechanism for DSB repair that does not involve canonical NHEJ. Studies in yeast and mammals support this conclusion. LIG4-independent fusion of critically shortened telomeres has been reported in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), and very recently in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Intriguingly, evidence for a backup pathway of DNA ligation in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> has also been described in <italic>lig4</italic> mutants during T-DNA integration, a process thought to be mediated by NHEJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). As in the current study, Friesner and Britt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>) report that T-DNA integration is reduced by 3-fold in the absence of LIG4.</p><p>Although little is known about this alternative mechanism for NHEJ, our data provide some insight into how it may engage dysfunctional telomeres. Several lines of evidence indicate that the backup pathway is less robust than KU-independent NHEJ. In addition to the 3-fold reduction in anaphase bridges, we found that telomere fusion PCR products were less abundant in <italic>tert ku70 lig4</italic> relative to <italic>tert ku70</italic>, even when primers were used that specifically targeted the very shortest telomeres in the population. Furthermore, critically shortened telomeres in plants lacking both KU and LIG4 appear more vulnerable to nuclease attack than in plants deficient only in KU. Not only is the incidence of telomere&#x02013;telomere fusions decreased, but also reduced is the length of the telomeric DNA tract captured in fusion junctions in <italic>tert ku70 lig4</italic> mutants compared to all of the other genetic backgrounds we have examined, including <italic>tert</italic>, <italic>tert ku70</italic>, <italic>tert lig4</italic> and <italic>tert ku70 mre11</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesize that the increased nucleolytic digestion of dysfunctional telomeres in <italic>tert ku70 lig4</italic> mutants is a reflection of reduced efficiency of repair. We found no evidence for extensive degradation of individual chromosome ends. Preliminary data from four independent telomere fusion clones from G5 <italic>tert lig4</italic> mutants revealed an average of 125 bp of telomeric DNA in the junctions (Heacock,M. and Shippen,D., unpublished data), more than twice the amount of telomeric DNA recovered from fusions in triple <italic>tert ku70 lig4</italic> mutants. Thus, the presence of KU in <italic>tert lig4</italic> mutants may limit nucleolytic digestion of dysfunctional telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). It is noteworthy that G-overhang signals in terminal <italic>tert ku70 lig4</italic> mutants are reduced relative to <italic>tert ku70</italic> double mutants. Hence, although critically shortened telomeres lose their ability to effectively block NHEJ, they largely retain their capacity to protect the chromosome terminus.</p><p>What is the mechanism for chromosome end-joining in the absence of KU and LIG4? Our sequence analysis reveals that chromosome fusion junctions in <italic>tert ku70 lig4</italic> mutants utilize shorter tracts of microhomology; <italic>tert ku70</italic> mutants employ twice the amount of perfect nucleotide overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Thus, end-joining by the LIG4-KU independent pathway appears to be mechanistically distinct from the KU-independent pathway. The MRN complex, which has been implicated in KU-independent fusion of critically shortened telomeres in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), is known to mediate end-joining primarily through the use of microhomology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) in an alternative pathway only partially dependent on LIG4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). As we see only a small difference in the level of microhomology at fusion junctions, we cannot rule out the possibility that MRN joins dysfunctional telomeres in KU-LIG4 mutants. Alternatively, end-joining could be mediated through a PARP1/LIG3-dependent pathway akin to what has been described in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17">15&#x02013;17</xref>). Although there is a clear PARP1 ortholog in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome, LIG3 is absent. LIG1 could act in combination with <italic>PARP1</italic> to join DNA ends, as <italic>in vitro</italic> studies indicate that the mammalian LIG1 can join double-strand DNA breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). It is also possible that LIG6, a DNA ligase unique to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> whose function is unknown, substitutes for LIG4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>).</p><p>Whatever the mechanism of end-joining dysfunctional telomeres, the molecular triggers for this reaction appear to be remarkably consistent in the presence or absence of key components of the NHEJ machinery. Our data indicate that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> telomeres undergo at least two distinct structural changes <italic>en route</italic> to complete dysfunction. By measuring individual telomere tracts in plants undergoing progressive telomere shortening, we discovered that chromosome fusions are first initiated when the shortest telomere in the population reaches a size of &#x0223c;1 kb. One caveat of our experiments is that the PETRA technique can currently measure telomere lengths on only 7/10 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> chromosome ends. Thus, it is formally possible that telomeres shorter than 1 kb are required to trigger chromosome fusions. Nevertheless, our data argue strongly that telomeres breach a length threshold at or near 1 kb. At this point, telomere tracts may be unable to assume a stable t-loop configuration, perhaps due to the reduced occupancy of some essential telomere binding proteins. An alternative, but not mutually exclusive model is that the reduced occupancy of telomere proteins on the shortened telomere releases the constraints on the telomere-associated DNA damage proteins, allowing them to instigate a DNA damage response that activates repair. Since plants survive for multiple generations after the initial onset of telomere dysfunction and their telomeres continue to shorten, this length threshold does not automatically incite significant genome instability. We speculate that shortened, &#x02018;meta-stable&#x02019; telomeres can assume an alternative structure that affords the terminus protection from a full-blown DNA damage response. Such a structure could be a simple fold-back conformation proposed for yeast telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46 B47 B48">46&#x02013;48</xref>). As telomere erosion continues, the incidence of chromosome fusions increases until the telomere tract reaches the minimal length of residual function (&#x0223c;300 bp) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Below this second size threshold, all of the features that distinguish the telomere from a DSB are lost.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkm472_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="nar_gkm472_nar-00862-t-2007-File007.doc"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="nar_gkm472_nar-00862-t-2007-File008.doc"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="nar_gkm472_nar-00862-t-2007-File009.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We are grateful to the Shippen lab for many helpful discussions, Dmitri Churikov and Carolyn Price for providing the in-gel hybridization protocol and Steve Heacock for software expertise.
