Among the molecules sharing the same chemical backbone are three major classes, the pink and purple anthocyanins, the pale yellow flavonols, and the proanthocyanidins (PAs) of seedcoats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). Various &#x02018;<italic>tt</italic>&#x02019; (<italic>transparent testa</italic>) mutants have provided a route for the study of flavonoid metabolic pathways, particularly the stages involving PAs.

The main flavonoids in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaves, however, are normally the paler-coloured kaempferol and quercitin glycosides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pelletier <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). Most of the aglycone flavonols become glycosylated in the C-3 and C-7 positions, and the principal sugar substitutions are glucose and rhamnose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kerhoas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Literature reports identify kaempferol as the origin of most vegetative flavonol glycosides, and kaempferol-3-<italic>O</italic>-rhamnoside-7-<italic>O</italic>-rhamnoside as a major component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Routaboul <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>, and references therein). Flowers have also been reported to contain predominantly kaempferol compounds, but quercitin derivatives are known to accumulate in stamens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shirley <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burbulis <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Routaboul <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Among the quercitin glycosides identified in inflorescence tissue are quercetin&#x02013;glucoside&#x02013;rhamnoside, quercetin&#x02013;glucoside&#x02013;rhamnoside&#x02013;rhamnoside, and quercetin&#x02013;rhamnoside&#x02013;rhamnoside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jones <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Numerous others, including flavonol dimers and oligomers, have been identified in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Routaboul <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p>The roles of flavonoids in plants range from protection from ultraviolet (UV) light to the pigmentation of flowers to attract pollinators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shirley, 2006</xref>). Evidence is also accumulating that these compounds are involved in regulating auxin transport since the flavonols quercitin and kaempferol, in particular, can displace synthetic auxin transport inhibitors <italic>in vitro</italic> (Jacobs and Rubery, 1998). Indeed, some flavonoid mutants have phenotypes suggestive of altered auxin transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shirley <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Peer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peer and Murphy, 2007</xref>). For example, the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> chalcone synthase (CHS) <italic>tt4</italic> mutant has delayed gravitropism and, although flavonoids are classically thought of as localized in the vacuole, the root tissue flavonols involved here may be cytosolic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buer and Muday, 2004</xref>). Meanwhile, control of bud outgrowth is affected in the <italic>Arabidopsis max1</italic> mutant, in which this regulator of flavonoid pathway genes is missing and which consequently has altered levels of auxin transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lazar and Goodman, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Given the many roles of flavonoids, their transport from the site of synthesis (primarily the cytosol) to the correct cell compartment, and between tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), is obviously important and complex. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kitamura (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marinova <italic>et al.</italic> (2007)</xref> have summarized the known steps for flavonoid synthesis and transport in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, clearly showing the gaps in our knowledge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>): whereas flavonoid biosynthesis is well understood, the proteins transporting anthocyanins and glycosylated quercitins and kaempferols remain little known. Characterization of <italic>tt</italic> mutants, however, has provided some insight into flavonoid transport. The product of <italic>TT12</italic> (At3g59030) in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> is a vacuolar flavonoid/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter expressed in seeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Debeaujon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marinova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). TT12 is a member of the <underline>m</underline>ultidrug <underline>a</underline>nd <underline>t</underline>oxin <underline>e</underline>fflux (MATE) transporter family, a group of proteins thought likely to fill some of the other missing steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kitamura, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). These eukaryotic and prokaryotic transporters are one of the five groups that together comprise the multidrug transporter superfamily (MTS). MATE proteins typically contain 12 transmembrane helices, and are characterized by the absence of the signature sequences found in their four sister groups&#x02014;the ATP-binding cassette, major facilitator, multidrug resistance (MRP), and resistance&#x02013;nodulation&#x02013;cell division families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Omote <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> MATE proteins have been found in the tonoplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Debeaujon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jaquinod <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marinova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), as was an acylated anthocyanin transporter in recent work in grape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gomez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), but one family member from lupin was identified in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Uhde-Stone <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). The sequestration of anthocyanin and other flavonoids in the vacuole is already linked to other MTS members: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goodman <italic>et al.</italic> (2004)</xref>, using antisense technology to investigate a <italic>Zea mays</italic> (maize) MRP (ZmMRP3), found perturbed anthocyanin accumulation. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> MRP may also be responsible for vacuolar uptake of glutathione&#x02013;anthocyanin conjugates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kitamura, 2006</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, there is a large group of &#x0003e;50 MATE proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kitamura, 2006</xref>) of which only a few have been characterized. There are two subgroups, the smaller one being most similar to the bacterial MATE proteins. One of these has been studied: FRD3 (ferric reductase defective 3, At3g08040) is involved in root iron metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rogers and Guerinot, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Green and Rogers, 2004</xref>). The second subgroup contains the majority of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> members, is similar to human and yeast MATE proteins, and includes the protein described here, a flower flavonoid transporter (FFT). Three proteins from this group have been studied: the product of <italic>TT12</italic>, mentioned above; ALF5 (aberrant lateral root formation 5, At3g23560; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diener <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>), thought to be involved in formation of lateral roots and toxin sensitivity; and EDS5 (enhanced disease susceptibility 5, At4g39030; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nawrath <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>).</p><p>The MATE family member under study here, FFT, is the product of At4g25640 [named, amongst a family of so-called <underline>d</underline>e<underline>t</underline>o<underline>x</underline>ifying efflux carriers, as AtDTX35 by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li <italic>et al.</italic> (2002)</xref>] in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. It is most similar to putative <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> (tomato), <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> (grape) and <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> (rice) MATE proteins, and four other <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> proteins (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp312/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S1</ext-link> available at <italic>JXB</italic> online). Its existence was noted previously in work on tomato describing a MYB overexpression line with altered anthocyanin regulatory pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mathews <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Because of the sequence similarity, these authors speculated that FFT might be involved in anthocyanin sequestration in vegetative tissues. Now identified as a possible vacuolar membrane protein (in a mass spectrometry study of vacuoles isolated from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cell culture; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jaquinod <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), loss of FFT could have profound effects.</p><p>It was found that <italic>FFT</italic> expression was widespread but particularly high in inflorescence tissues, especially in floral epidermal guard cells and those of the anther and nectary. Mutant analysis confirmed that abolishing <italic>FFT</italic> expression affects flavonoid levels in the plant, also altering root growth, seed development and germination, and pollen development and release. The FFT substrate is not established here, but the data suggest it is more likely to be a glycosylated flavonol than an anthocyanin as previously speculated. FFT can be added to the incomplete flavonoid transport network, and the results also show that correct reproductive development in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> requires this putative transporter.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plants and growth conditions</title><p>Wild-type (WT) and mutant lines were grown in compost in greenhouses maintained at 20&#x02009;&#x000b0;C.

Because flavonoid mutants often show altered seedcoats and, because germination in <italic>fft-1</italic> was variable, seeds were examined for physical abnormalities. The seedcoat of <italic>fft-1</italic> was brown pigmented like that of the WT, but ruthenium red (RR) staining showed altered seed mucilage. RR stains acidic polysaccharides such as pectic polysaccharides: with imbibing <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seeds, RR densely stains an inner layer of mucilage plus an outer, more diffuse (and easily disrupted) layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Macquet <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). This staining of imbibing <italic>fft-1</italic> seeds showed that the surrounding mucilage layer was absent or disrupted in the mutant.

Seed mucilage contributes to seed dormancy and, thus, heterogeneous mucilage release in <italic>fft-1</italic> mutant seeds is consistent with the abnormal germination rates. In addition, seed size was significantly more variable in the mutant (<italic>F</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.005), although mean seed size was not significantly different from that of the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3b</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>FFT</italic> affects growth rates</title><p>It was noticed that mutant seedlings appeared to grow and mature more quickly than the WT, so assays of root growth were carried out using plants on 1/2MS with and without sucrose (the former to promote anthocyanin production, in case of any effect).

To examine this further, Alexander's stain was used to differentiate viable from non-viable pollen. Acid fuchsin stains the protoplasm of viable pollen purple, and malachite green (MG) is a background counterstain. This can give an overestimate of viability, since non-viable pollen can contain protoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pline <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), but here a distinct difference between WT and <italic>fft-1</italic> flowers was shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Series of flowers at identical stages and positions on the primary inflorescence were sampled and stained. In contrast to WT anthers, which were plump, full of purple-stained pollen, and showed many pollen grains released upon dehiscence, the mutant anthers appeared thinner and had a lower proportion of (but did contain some) round, purple pollen grains.

This was also obvious in epifluorescence microscopy. DPBA was used to enhance cytoplasmic flavonol fluorescence: it gives high emission levels when bound to flavonols rather than other flavonoids, for example fluorescing at 520&#x02009;nm and 543&#x02009;nm when bound to the flavonols kaempferol and quercitin, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Saslowsky and Winkel-Shirley, 2001</xref>).

Confocal laser scanning microscopy was therefore used essentially to perform fluorescence spectroscopy, and thus indicate any changes to flavonoid levels (a technique previously used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hideg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>, and discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pf&#x000fc;ndel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Since GUS staining had occurred strongly in floral guard cells, inflorescence tissues treated with DPBA were excited with UV light (364&#x02009;nm) and an emission spectrum was recorded (400&#x02013;730&#x02009;nm). Spectra were recorded from anther guard cells in WT or mutant flowers (inset, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6a</xref>) from the same position on an inflorescence (the first open flower below the unopened bud cluster), in which flavonoids should be comparable. A peak of emission from anther guard cells expected to result from flavonoid excitation could be visualized at 500&#x02013;580&#x02009;nm in WT tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6b</xref>). Notably, a component of the fluorescence spectrum at &#x0223c;520&#x02009;nm was absent in <italic>fft-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6b</xref>), coinciding with the expected peak from flavonol&#x02013;DPBA secondary fluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Saslowsky and Winkel-Shirley, 2001</xref>). To quantify and test statistically the difference in replicate flowers, the well-defined flavonoid fluorescence peak at 580&#x02009;nm and the peak from chlorophyll fluorescence were used to produce a ratio of flavonoid:chlorophyll emission. The ratios were significantly different between WT and <italic>fft-1</italic>, suggesting a lower flavonoid content in the mutant [WT, 1.60 (SE, 0.14) versus <italic>fft-1</italic>, 0.86 (SE, 0.05); <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>P</italic>=0.0016, 28 df; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6a</xref>].

This is not surprising in the context of flavonoid pathways: a large proportion of a plant's phenylpropanoid and flavonoid compounds are found in the vacuoles of guard cells, whose location and physiological importance places them at the forefront of UV protection and, indeed, other responses to the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hutzler <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gitz and Liu-Gitz, 2003</xref>).

There is sparse published literature describing the roles of guard cells in these three locations. The nectaries develop as a ring at the base of the stamens in the Brassicaceae, which is among the families of plants that exude nectar through modified stomata (Davis <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998). Flavonoids including quercitin and kaempferol and other phenolics are found in nectar, and CHS, the enzyme at the root of the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>), is up-regulated during nectary development in tobacco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nicolson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). The presence of <italic>FFT</italic> transcript in these specific guard cells suggests a direct role in transporting flavonols for the production of nectar. Nectar release and nectar fall coincide with the start and end of anthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Durkee, 1983</xref>; Davis <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nicolson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), so it is interesting that <italic>FFT</italic> transcription is also directed to the anthers.</p><p>As a self-fertile plant, nectar composition is unlikely to affect reproductive success in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, but male sterility can result from defects in anther or pollen development. <italic>fft</italic>-<italic>1</italic> mutant anthers contained a proportion of non-viable pollen, and dehiscence of anthers was perturbed. As there was no GUS staining in the pollen of <italic>FFT</italic>&#x02013;promoter&#x02013;GUS-transformed plants (in contrast to anther guard cells), the altered flavonoid profiles in anthers are the probable cause of the <italic>fft-1</italic> pollen and fertility phenotypes. This was seen to an even great degree in the <italic>white anther</italic> petunia mutant which lacks CHS and is functionally male sterile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Napoli <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). Other mutants besides <italic>fft-1</italic> are defective in both anther and pollen development, e.g. <italic>coi1</italic> (<italic>coronatine insensitive 1</italic>) or <italic>fad</italic> (<italic>fatty acid desaturase 6</italic>) mutants, both related to jasmonic acid signalling in the regulation of anther dehiscence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xie <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sanders <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>).

Altered exine development in the <italic>ms2</italic> (<italic>male sterility 2</italic>) mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aarts <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>), for example, caused a range of effects, many similar to those seen in the <italic>fft-1</italic> mutant, including reduced seed set, shrivelled anthers, and the majority of the seeds being produced from apical flowers of the mature inflorescence.</p><p>An effect of altered flavonoid content could be perturbed lignification, as seen after disrupting the function of the first enzyme of the phenylpropanoid pathway, phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rohde <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Anther development and dehiscence follow defined pathways of maturation and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sanders <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>), lignified secondary walls in the anther being important in its dehiscence (and also of relevance here, in breaking open mature siliques; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mitsuda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). If anthers dehisce late, stigmatic papillae may no longer be receptive to pollination (in a self-fertile plant such as <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>). The guard cell location of the <italic>FFT</italic> transcript, however, suggests a connection in particular with appropriate dehydration of pollen and/or anther (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Keijzer <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; Taylor and Heppler, 1997; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Scott <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mitsuda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jung <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), which would be expected to require proper function of the guard cells on the epidermis of the anther theca (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Flavonoids in anther guard cells may also act within regulatory pathways that control co-ordinated development and maturation of pollen and anther (see comments on auxin, below). A role for FFT protein in dehiscence or dehydration of anthers and thus pollen coat formation and pollen viability seems most likely, but a direct chemical effect is also possible. Pollen's highly sculpted outer exine layer is mostly made up of sporopollenin, derived from long-chain fatty acids, but also contains some phenylpropanoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Morant <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Preston <italic>et al.</italic> (2004)</xref> speculated that altered flux along phenylpropanoid pathways was the cause of male sterility in <italic>myb4</italic> and <italic>myb32</italic> pollen mutants. Likewise, altered flavonoid composition in <italic>fft-1</italic> could disturb the pollen coat and reduce pollination success, since exine is involved in recognition and adhesion.</p><p>The <italic>fft-1</italic> mutant phenotype certainly indicates that perturbing flavonoid metabolism in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> affects this plant's fertility. Although this is known to be the case in other plants, e.g. petunia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Napoli <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>), the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> CHS mutant, <italic>tt4</italic>, is fertile. The requirement for particular flavonoids for viable pollen and pollination in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> has been discounted, therefore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burbulis <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>), although these authors do point out that the high levels of flavonols in pollen argue for an indirect role, at least, in fertility of the male gametophyte. In addition, a PAL double mutant (lesions in two of four <italic>PAL</italic> genes) did become sterile, with the siliques remaining small, and empty ovule sacs initially enlarging but then becoming shrivelled, suggesting male sterility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rohde <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p><p>As with <italic>fft-1</italic>, variability was seen in the fertility phenotype of the <italic>mpk</italic>6 (<italic>mitogen-activated protein kinase 6</italic>) mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bush and Krysan, 2007</xref>). Neither the present nor the latter authors could pinpoint specific environmental conditions that determined the severity of the effects. These mutations are clearly important but can (later in development) be overcome for reproduction in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, probably by developmental homeostasis. The variable success of fertilization in <italic>fft-1</italic> does suggest that there may be redundancy in the putative flavonoid transporters of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. If a threshold level of a, or some, flavonoids must be achieved for some fertilization, low levels of transport by other transporters might eventually compensate for the missing FFT. Interestingly, the TT12 MATE transporter was able to transport glycosylated anthocyanidins in <italic>in vitro</italic> transport assays although <italic>in vivo</italic> these do not appear to be the normal substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marinova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>FFT is necessary for correct seed development, germination, and growth</title><p>Numerous mutants with seedcoat phenotypes are defective in components of flavonoid biosynthesis or of its transcriptional regulation, e.g. <italic>tt8</italic>, <italic>ttg1</italic> and <italic>ttg2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Walker <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Broun, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ishida <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Changing the levels of flavonoids can have a range of effects on seed: in the <italic>ttg1</italic> mutant, seedcoat anthocyanin levels, dormancy, and seed mucilage are all affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Walker <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). In <italic>fft-1</italic>, accumulation of PAs and tannins is apparently not affected, since seeds are not paler than the WT. Fewer seed are set in the <italic>fft-1</italic> mutant, however, and varied seed sizes and heterogeneous mucilage release upon imbibition are seen amongst those that are produced. There is no evidence, from GUS staining, of <italic>FFT</italic> promoter activity in seeds, so it seems likely that the seeds&#x02019; heterogeneity is a result of faulty flavonoid transport in the carpel and/or developing silique, in which RT-PCR did reveal high levels of transcript, and where there was strong GUS activity in <italic>FFT</italic>&#x02013;promoter&#x02013;GUS plants. Since, for example, oxidation of PAs contributes to seed dormancy (and protection) by strengthening the seedcoat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Debeaujon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>), reduced dormancy in the <italic>fft-1</italic> mutant does also imply some change in seedcoat composition.</p><p>The GUS staining seen in <italic>FFT</italic>&#x02013;promoter&#x02013;GUS-transformed seedlings corresponds to the fluorescence from flavonoids seen previously in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> roots using epifluorescent microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buer and Muday, 2004</xref>) and, notably, is consistent with possible accumulation of flavonoids in discrete locations of the root. <italic>FFT</italic>-directed GUS staining was notable in the cortex in the elongation zone and in the root tip, close to the locations of CHS and chalcone isomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Saslowsky and Winkel-Shirley, 2001</xref>). The faster root growth of seedlings is intriguing, since flavonoid mutants can have altered auxin transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buer and Muday, 2004</xref>; Lazar and Goodman, 2005). After studies using several <italic>tt</italic> mutants, quite a body of literature (see Peer and Murphy, 2009) now documents a reduction or elevation in polar auxin transport because of increased or absent flavonols (respectively), and thus altered accumulation of auxin in apical tissues. Cecchetti and colleagues (2008) also recently discussed how auxin regulates anther dehiscence and pollen maturation: flavonol&#x02013;auxin effects on fertility cannot be ruled out in <italic>fft-1</italic> and present an interesting avenue for future work.</p></sec><sec><title>MATE proteins transport-specific subsets of flavonoids</title><p><italic>fft-1</italic> has variable fertility, not complete infertility. Another flavonoid mutant's altered gravitational response was eventually corrected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buer and Muday, 2004</xref>). These results suggest the existence of redundant mechanisms that allow roots or aerial tissues to recover. The existence of several <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> MATE proteins similar to FFT may explain redundancy of function, although some degree of specificity would correspond to the TT12 MATE transporter's limited substrates. Although it transports cyanidin-3-<italic>O</italic>-glucoside (acting as an H<sup>+</sup>-antiporter) in yeast assays <italic>in vitro</italic>, work on the <italic>tt12</italic> mutant suggests that anthocyanins and glycosylated flavan-3-ols are its principal substrates <italic>in vivo</italic>, where it acts at the vacuolar membrane of PA-synthesizing cells of the seedcoat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marinova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). This work has recently been extended, where complementation of the <italic>tt12</italic> mutant with a vacuolar <italic>Medicago truncata</italic> orthologue corroborates the identity of its substrate, epicatechin-3&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-glucoside (Zhao and Dixon, 2009). In the present case, data from a tomato orthologue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mathews <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>) led to speculation that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> FFT is a transporter of anthocyanin in vegetative tissues. The present work does not support this suggestion. Spectroscopic measurement of anthocyanin extracts does show a small reduction in young seedlings, and RT-PCR reveals <italic>FFT</italic> transcript in senescent leaves (which have high levels of anthocyanin) but, conversely, anthocyanin visibly accumulates in the mutant. It is hypothezised that the small changes in anthocyanin levels are a result of other perturbations in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathways since <italic>FFT</italic>&#x02013;promoter&#x02013;GUS staining was most significant in non-anthocyanin-containing tissues (inflorescence guard cells and roots). In addition, LC-MS measurements did not show any significant change in peaks likely to be flavonoids arising from samples of vegetative tissues (data not shown).</p><p>Fluorescence spectroscopy with DPBA did suggest altered flavonoid content in mutant versus WT anther guard cells, and LC-MS data revealed reductions in the <italic>fft-1</italic> mutant in several flavonol glycosides in buds and immature siliques. Work to date suggests that a lack of FFT most affects levels of kaempferol (the more predominant of the two flavonols in whole <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> flowers; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shirley <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>), specifically a diglucoside and probably therefore kaempferol 3,7-<italic>O</italic>-diglucoside (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.plantcyc.org:1555/ARA/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&#x00026;object=PWY1F-FLAVSYN">www.plantcyc.org:1555/ARA/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&#x00026;object=PWY1F-FLAVSYN</ext-link> for detailed pathways and published contents of flavonoids and enzymes), but further work is required to confirm whether this is a transporter for that compound. Numerous novel dimers and oligomers of flavonols have been identified in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Routaboul <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), totalling 26 different flavonoids, so perturbing this pathway in <italic>fft-1</italic> plants could clearly affect various aspects of reproductive development.</p><p>In summary, the characteristics of FFT support the case that MATE proteins are a component of flavonoid biosynthetic pathways. In addition, this protein appears to be necessary for proper reproductive development in <italic>Arabidopsis.</italic> Although <italic>chs</italic> mutants argue against an essential role in reproduction, transport of certain key flavonoids does seem to be essential for full male fertility.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Supplementary data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp312/DC1">Supplementary data</ext-link> are available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp312/DC1">Figure S1.</ext-link></bold> CLUSTALW alignment (N- and C-termini omitted to save space) and phylogram of FFT and the three most similar <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> MATE proteins with tomato putative anthocyanin permease (SlAnthP) and rice ripening protein (OsXP).
