We previously reported on using DMPC (dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine) vesicles for realizing porous bioreactors. Here, we describe a different strategy for making porous vesicles using a bacterial pore-forming toxin, &#x003b1;-hemolysin. Using RNA folding as a test case, we demonstrate that protein-based pores can allow exchange of magnesium ions through the vesicle wall while keeping the RNA molecule inside. Flow measurements indicate that the encapsulated RNA molecules rapidly respond to the change in the outside buffer condition. The approach was further tested by coencapsulating a helicase protein and its single-stranded DNA track. The DNA translocation activity of <italic>E. coli</italic> Rep helicase inside vesicles was fueled by ATP provided outside the vesicle, and a dramatically higher number of translocation cycles could be observed due to the minuscule vesicle volume that facilitates rapid rebinding after dissociation. These pores are known to be stable over a wide range of experimental conditions, especially at various temperatures, which is not possible with the previous method using DMPC vesicles. Moreover, engineered mutants of the utilized toxin can potentially be exploited in the future applications.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement><funding-source>National Institutes of Health, United States</funding-source></funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>ja9042356</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>ja-2009-042356</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value>40.75</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Single molecule fluorescence techniques are revolutionizing biological inquiries both in vitro and in vivo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> In order to observe single molecule reactions for an extended period, molecular movements via diffusion have to be slower than the time scale of the method used to track their movements. Although it is possible to track particles in one dimension, for example cytoskeleton motor proteins moving on actin filaments(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>) or microtubules,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>) or in two dimensions, as in the case of membrane protein diffusion,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>) there are many other examples where three-dimensional diffusion would preclude an extended observation time window. Therefore, several methodologies have been developed to keep the molecules of interest under observation for prolonged periods. Immobilization via biotin&#x02212;streptavidin anchors on bare(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>) or polymer-grafted surfaces(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>) and confinement within agarose or polyacrylamide gels(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>) are very useful strategies, yet care should be taken to ensure minimal perturbation to the activity of biological molecules. A recent report(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>) described an elegant technology for the confinement of individual molecules in free solution by means of anti-Brownian electrokinetic trapping (ABEL). ABEL, however, does not allow changing the solution condition while keeping the molecule trapped. An alternative approach entraps a molecule within a small unilamellar vesicle (SUV) which is then tethered on surfaces.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> Vesicle encapsulation has been used to study protein folding,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>) RNA folding,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>) DNA folding,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>) DNA&#x02212;protein interaction,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>) protein&#x02212;protein interaction,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>) and protein conformational changes.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>) In principle, vesicle encapsulation should provide a more biofriendly environment,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>) which may help avoid artifacts sometimes caused by direct surface tethering of proteins,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> because the immediate environment is composed of lipid molecules rather than an artificial solid substrate such as a glass slide. Vesicle encapsulation also obviates the need to modify biological molecules for surface tethering (e.g., biotinylation), offering ease and flexibility to the researchers as was utilized to determine the effect on FRET of dipole orientations of the fluorophores stacked at DNA duplex ends.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>) However, the inability to exchange buffer across the vesicle wall was noted as the major drawback(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>) because buffer exchange is commonly practiced either for examining molecules under various conditions, for example by varying concentration of certain chemical agents between measurements,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>) or for triggering certain reactions on demand.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>) Rendering the vesicles porous is therefore essential for fully realizing the potential of the encapsulation approach. This is already achieved for bulk assays,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> but their adaptation for single molecule experiments has been limited.</p><p>Porous vesicles should also be useful if the measurement condition is not suitable for vesicle formation. In such circumstances, vesicles can be formed under conditions favorable for encapsulation, and the solution condition can then be changed to the desired imaging conditions. Furthermore, because porous vesicles allow buffer exchange without washing out the encapsulated molecules, it would be possible to monitor the interaction between the same pair of biomolecules under various conditions. Finally, the presence of pores prevents the vesicle-to-vesicle variation of intravesicular conditions, for example ion concentrations, emerging from stochastic encapsulation and vesicle size distribution (further discussed in <xref rid="si1" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref>), which may be important for studying systems that display strong heterogeneity.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>) In this regard, pores ensure that the intravesicular condition is in equilibrium with the bulk solution, hence remains identical between vesicles. Clearly, introducing pores on vesicles should greatly expand the venues for single molecule vesicle encapsulation assays.</p><p>In order to fully harness the capabilities of vesicle encapsulation and overcome the impermeability barrier, we recently exploited the thermotropic properties of lipid membranes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>) where the membrane permeability of solutes reaches a maximum around membrane&#x02019;s melting temperature (<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub>). We showed previously that the vesicles made of the phospholipids DMPC (dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine) (<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> = 23 &#x000b0;C) can readily allow the passage of K<sup>+</sup>&#x02009;(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>) and ATP and its analogues(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>) at room temperature. Nevertheless, the pores rely on transient formation of lipid packing defects, and their presence and properties may be affected by many factors. An obvious limitation is that the working temperature range is narrow with the membrane being porous only within 3 &#x000b0;C of <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub>,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>) making it laborious to carry out measurements at various temperatures. For steady-state measurements, one would need to incubate the sample with the desired buffer at the <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> of the lipid membrane before taking data at a new temperature. Moreover, data acquisition at temperatures different from <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> would be problematic if the encapsulated reaction consumes substrates (e.g., ATP), as their consumption and product accumulation will alter the dynamics. Finally, nonequilibrium kinetic experiments, for example via flow, at various temperatures would require several different lipid compositions with <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> values that match those of the temperatures to be used. We therefore utilized a bacterial toxin, &#x003b1;-hemolysin (aHL), to induce stable pores on SUVs, which had been previously used for bulk measurements in an attempt to build an artificial cell.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>) We proposed using aHL in an earlier report,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>) and the actual implementation is the subject of this article.</p><p>aHL is a bacterial toxin secreted by <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> as water-soluble monomers which incorporate into lipid membranes to form a heptametric pore.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>) There are several reasons for our choice of aHL: (i) Owing to spontaneous incorporation of aHL into the membrane, such pores are easier to make than many other membrane proteins which require difficult reconstitution procedures. (ii) Once formed, aHL pores are stable in a wide variety of buffer conditions, pH, and temperature. (iii) The aHL pore with a narrowest opening of 1.8 nm is not selective, allowing passive passage of molecules up to 3kD both ways.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>) (iv) Finally, available engineered mutants of aHL may be further utilized to achieve unique experimental assays.</p><p>Here, we carried out the proof-of-concept experiments using smFRET (single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> on a home-built total internal reflection fluorescence setup (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) using three different model systems.

A 532 nm laser was used for donor excitation in FRET measurements. A 633 nm laser was used to excite the acceptor directly to confirm colocalization of a donor-labeled Rep helicase and an acceptor-labeled DNA. FRET efficiency was calculated as the acceptor intensity divided by the total intensity of donor and acceptor fluorescence averaged over 1 s. Data from hundreds of molecules were pooled to obtain FRET histograms. Noise in the measurements could yield FRET values below 0 and above 1 due to negative values after background subtraction for the acceptor and donor intensities, respectively. The leftmost peak in FRET histograms represents donor only population, hence was ignored in data interpretation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>Ribozyme Encapsulation</title><p>The encapsulation of the hairpin ribozyme in vesicles, immobilization of SUV on a supported lipid bilayer, RNaseA and nonspecific immobilization controls, imaging, data acquisition, and data analysis were performed as described previously.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>) SUVs encapsulating the ribozyme were formed in a 0.5 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> RNA buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 0.4% (w/w) glucose, and specified amounts of MgCl<sub>2</sub>) and were then incubated with the surface for specific attachment. The hairpin ribozyme molecules used in these studies did not contain a biotin moiety, thus removal of unencapsulated RNA via gel filtration prior to vesicle tethering was not needed. RNA concentrations during encapsulation were chosen to minimize the probability of encapsulating multiple molecules. Lipid films for the encapsulation were made of EggPC with 1% DPPE&#x02212;biotin.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>Purification and Characterization of aHL</title><p>Our initial attempts with the commercial aHL (Calbiochem) were not successful in forming pores despite our efforts that explored a wide variety of experimental conditions. As this failure is likely due to the low concentration of commercially available aHL (the practical maximum concentration we could use was &#x0223c;1 &#x003bc;M in monomer), we produced aHL in-house. We overexpressed hexahistidine-tagged aHL from a plasmid in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and purified the protein using a Ni-NTA column, and the protein activity was confirmed by the hemolysis assay (<xref rid="si1" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information Figure 2</xref>).

Incubation was carried out at 37 &#x000b0;C for at least 30 min. Various lower concentrations of aHL resulted in the poration of various fractions of SUVs, but 36 &#x003bc;M yielded reproducible results with nearly 100% yield of pore formation as judged by the fraction of molecules that fold when the extravesicular buffer was exchanged from no Mg<sup>2+</sup> to 1 or 10 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> condition. Pore formation does not happen when vesicles were incubated with aHL subsequent to immobilization, most likely because most of the aHL was captured by the supported lipid bilayer.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>Rep Helicase Encapsulation</title><p>Partial duplex DNA (400 nM, double-stranded DNA of 18 base pairs with a 3&#x02032; (dT)<sub>80</sub> and a Cy5 attached to the junction) and a 400 nM concentration of Rep molecules(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>) labeled with a donor fluorophore (Cy3) mixed in a total volume of 200 &#x003bc;L of buffer R (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl) were used to hydrate 2.5 mg of lipid films. In order to achieve, on the average, one molecule of each kind (i.e., one protein vs one DNA) in a 100 nm diameter vesicle, a concentration of 400 nM was chosen. Buffer R contains 500 mM to ensure that the labeled Rep does not aggregate, as when high concentrations of dye-labeled Rep monomers are dissolved under low salt conditions. Upon forming the multilamellar vesicles, 100 or 200 nm (concentrations were scaled accordingly) diameter vesicles were formed via extrusion. Skipping the freeze&#x02212;thaw cycles was found to be essential in keeping the proteins active (<xref rid="si1" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref>). Finally, unencapsulated Rep molecules were separated from the vesicles by a Ni-NTA column via the histidine tag on the protein. While buffer R had to be used during encapsulation to avoid clumping of Rep, it had to be exchanged with the imaging buffer(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>) (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mM ATP, 12 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 15 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.4% (w/w) glucose, anti-blinking agents such as 2-mercaptoethanol or Trolox, and oxygen scavenging system utilizing catalase and glucose oxidase) during data acquisition because high salt concentration in buffer R does not allow Rep to bind to the DNA.

Having developed the aHL approach, we tackled this problem once more where junction-encapsulating SUVs were first prepared in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Subsequently, pores were formed using aHL, and imaging was carried out in the buffer containing 50 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>. The dynamic behavior previously observed for the surface-tethered junction could then be reproduced(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>) (<xref rid="si1" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information Figure 1</xref>). aHL can therefore be utilized in such cases for which the measurement conditions are not suitable for the formation of SUV.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.4"><title>Rep Helicase Experiments</title><p>Next, we encapsulated an acceptor (Cy5)-labeled partial duplex DNA with a donor (Cy3)-labeled Rep helicase monomer in SUVs (Materials and Methods and Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a) in order to confirm the ATP passage through aHL pores. A Rep monomer, which cannot unwind duplex DNA by itself,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup> can translocate on a single-stranded DNA in the 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; direction. When Rep encounters a blockade (such as a double-stranded DNA) on its track, it snaps back to the 3&#x02032; end on its substrate. These repetitive translocation events (termed shuttling) continue until the Rep monomer dissociates from DNA.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>) Such measurements were previously carried out on DNA molecules tethered to a quartz surface coated with polymers. For the surface experiments, shuttling takes place a limited number of times (typically less than 10) due to eventual dissociation, and the number of translocation events is thus inadequate for inferring statistically significant information on the shuttling properties from a single Rep helicase (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). In contrast, we expected that encapsulation would enable long-term monitoring of shuttling for a single pair of Rep and DNA, as the molecules would quickly rebind within the minuscule SUV volume.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>(a) Rep helicase labeled with donor, and DNA labeled with acceptor at the junction depicted as coencapsulated within a porous SUV.

(b) Rep shuttling data obtained from surface-tethered DNA (modified from ref (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>)) with a same length tail. Inset shows a single translocation event where the gradual increase in the acceptor signal (with accompanying decrease in the donor signal) reflects translocation of Rep toward the junction, whereas the abrupt drop marks the snapping back to the 3&#x02032; end. The translocation time (&#x00394;<italic>t</italic>) is defined as the period between consecutive snapping events. Individual cycles of shuttling separated in time are due to different Rep molecules from solution binding on the same surface-attached DNA and exhibiting limited repetitive translocations until dissociation.

In marked contrast to the surface experiments, a single Rep&#x02212;DNA pair shows over 140 translocation events until acceptor photobleaching near 130 s). Time resolution was 30 ms. (d) &#x00394;<italic>t</italic> histograms can be built from a single Rep&#x02212;DNA pair. Similar statistics for surface measurements (b) can only be obtained by merging data from translocations events from many shuttling cycles exhibited by different Rep molecules.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ja-2009-042356_0002" id="gr5" position="float"/></fig><p>Upon surface immobilization of SUVs, and subsequent ATP injection, shuttling events were observed within SUVs (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c), indicating the ATP passage through aHL. The translocation activity was observed only when aHL was incorporated and ATP was present. Number of repetitive translocation events that can be observed from an individual Rep was substantially higher in the SUVs compared to the surface assays as anticipated. When encapsulated, a single Rep&#x02212;DNA pair exhibited shuttling essentially until photobleaching of the fluorophores. Such enhancement for the number of shuttling events makes it possible to observe more than 100 cycles of translocation from an individual Rep&#x02212;DNA pair and to obtain the kinetic parameters reliably free of complications arising from single molecule heterogeneity (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d).</p><p>In conclusion, in order to fully harness the capabilities of the vesicle encapsulation, we described here a generalizable methodology for making robustly porous vesicles. aHL pores utilized in this study allowed rapid passage of Mg<sup>2+</sup> as well as ATP through membranes of phospholipids SUVs. Compared to the thermothropically rendered defects, aHL pores are well-defined and stable at various temperatures.
