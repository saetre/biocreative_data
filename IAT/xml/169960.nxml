In this manuscript we report that human P&#x0002f;CAF is acetylated <italic>in vivo</italic>. We find that P&#x0002f;CAF is acetylated by itself and by p300 but not by CBP. P&#x0002f;CAF acetylation can be an intra- or intermolecular event. The intermolecular acetylation requires the N-terminal domain of P&#x0002f;CAF. The intramolecular acetylation targets five lysines (416&#x02013;442) at the P&#x0002f;CAF C-terminus, which are in the nuclear localisation signal (NLS). Finally, we show that acetylation of P&#x0002f;CAF leads to an increment of its histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. These findings identify a new post-translation modification on P&#x0002f;CAF which may regulate its function.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The packaging of the eukaryotic genome into chromatin provides the means for compaction of the entire genome inside the nucleus, restricting the access of many regulatory proteins required for essential biological processes such as replication, transcription, DNA repair and recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg655c1">1</xref>). To counterbalance this repressive nature of chromatin, several factors are able to destabilise the nucleosome to facilitate the interaction of proteins with the DNA. Recent studies have identified two types of protein complexes capable of altering chromatin structure. One of them utilises the energy coming from the ATP hydrolysis to alter the structure of nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg655c2">2</xref>). The second one includes complexes which modify covalently the histone tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg655c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg655c4">4</xref>), by acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, etc.</p><p>It has been known for many years that acetylation of the N-terminal tails of histones correlates with transcription activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg655c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg655c6">6</xref>). However, the underlying mechanisms and biological significance are just beginning to be revealed thanks to the identification of the first nuclear histone acetyltransferase (HAT), GCN5. Subsequently, many other transcription coactivators have been shown to be capable of acetylating nucleosomal histones: CBP&#x0002f;p300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg655c7">7</xref>), P&#x0002f;CAF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg655c8">8</xref>), ACTR&#x0002f;SRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg655c9">9</xref>) TAFII250 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg655c10">10</xref>), etc.</p><p>P&#x0002f;CAF was originally identified as a CBP&#x0002f;p300-binding protein due to its sequence similarity to the yeast GCN5 (yGCN5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg655c8">8</xref>). P&#x0002f;CAF and GCN5 show sequence conservation in the regions responsible for the HAT activity and the binding to yADA2 co-factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg655c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg655c12">12</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic>, yGCN5 efficiently acetylates free histones in solution, but does not recognise nucleosomal histones as a substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg655c13">13</xref>). However, <italic>in vivo</italic>, yGCN5 is found in a large complex containing yADA2 and yADA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg655c14">14</xref>). In this complex, yGCN5 is the HAT enzymatic component and is responsible for the acetylation of nucleosomal histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg655c15">15</xref>). In contrast, P&#x0002f;CAF has an intrinsic ability to acetylate nucleosomal histones <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>PCAF is also found in a complex consisting of more than 20 distinct polypeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg655c16">16</xref>). Some of them are identical to TBP-associated factors (TAFs) and others are histone fold-containing factors. P&#x0002f;CAF is capable of activating transcription through interaction with CBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg655c17">17</xref>), and independently from CBP but depending on P&#x0002f;CAF&#x02019;s intrinsic HAT activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg655c18">18</xref>). P&#x0002f;CAF is essential for myogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg655c19">19</xref>) and is capable of acetylating and coactivating MyoD transcription factor.</p><p>P&#x0002f;CAF and GCN5 are very unstable enzymes that rapidly and irreversibly lose histone acetyltransferase activity. <italic>In vitro</italic>, P&#x0002f;CAF is stabilised by the continuous presence of acetyl CoA and autoacetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg655c20">20</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that P&#x0002f;CAF is autoacetylated <italic>in vivo</italic> and is a target for p300 acetylation, but not for CBP. We also find that the P&#x0002f;CAF acetylation can occur in cis and in trans. Finally, we show that acetylation of P&#x0002f;CAF leads to an increment of its HAT activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture and transfections</title><p>U2Os and C2C12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium (DMEM) with 10&#x00025; fetal calf serum (FCS) and grown at 37&#x000b0;C, 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub>.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg655c20">20</xref>) has shown that P&#x0002f;CAF is autoacetylated <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, it is not yet known whether P&#x0002f;CAF acetylation occurs <italic>in vivo</italic>. To investigate this possibility, we have used an antibody raised against chemically acetylated histone H4, which recognises many acetylated proteins such as E2F, CBP, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg655c23">23</xref>) (anti-acetyl-Lys; ab-193 from abcam). First, we tested the antibody specificity for P&#x0002f;CAF acetylation. To that end, FL recombinant GST-P&#x0002f;CAF was incubated with acetyl-CoA and the acetylation status of GST-P&#x0002f;CAF was analysed by western blotting using the antibody anti-acetyl-Lys. The result (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg655f1">1</xref>A) demonstrates that the antibody recognises specifically acetylated P&#x0002f;CAF <italic>in vitro</italic>, in an incubation-time dependent manner. The bottom band in the gel (indicated with a small arrow) corresponds to a GST-P&#x0002f;CAF degradation product.</p><p>We then wanted to establish whether P&#x0002f;CAF is also acetylated <italic>in vivo</italic>. To that end, U2OS cells were transfected with P&#x0002f;CAF-Flag, P&#x0002f;CAF-Flag mutated in the HAT domain (P&#x0002f;CAF&#x00394;HAT-Flag) which has lost the ability to acetylate histones (data not shown), and HDAC1-Flag as a control for the Flag epitope. Flag proteins were immunoprecipitated using the anti-Flag antibody and their acetylation level was determined by western blotting using the anti-acetyl-Lys antibody. We found (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg655f1">1</xref>B, bottom part) that P&#x0002f;CAF-Flag is clearly recognised by the anti-acetyl-Lys antibody. Neither P&#x0002f;CAF mutated in the HAT domain (P&#x0002f;CAF&#x00394;HAT-Flag) nor HDAC1-Flag were recognised by the anti-acetyl-Lys antibody. This suggests that P&#x0002f;CAF is acetylated <italic>in vivo</italic>. To confirm this hypothesis, we analysed the acetylation status of the endogenous P&#x0002f;CAF from C2C12 cells. To do that, we immunoprecipitated P&#x0002f;CAF from C2C12 cells using a specific anti-P&#x0002f;CAF antibody and tested its acetylation level by western blotting, using the anti-acetyl-Lys antibody. The results in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg655f1">1</xref>C indicate that endogenous P&#x0002f;CAF is also acetylated <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>P&#x0002f;CAF N-terminal domain is required for P&#x0002f;CAF <italic>trans</italic> acetylation <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>Having established that P&#x0002f;CAF is acetylated <italic>in vivo</italic>, we sought to investigate whether P&#x0002f;CAF is acetylated by an intramolecular (cis) or intermolecular (trans) event. To do so, we should be able to follow P&#x0002f;CAF (HAT-active protein) and P&#x0002f;CAF&#x00394;HAT (HAT-inactive protein) after co-transfection. Since both proteins co-migrate in an SDS&#x02013;PAGE gel, we made a fusion of GFP to P&#x0002f;CAF-Flag to get GFP-P&#x0002f;CAF-Flag, which can be easily distinguished from P&#x0002f;CAF-Flag in an SDS&#x02013;PAGE gel and maintains HAT activity (data not shown). Then, we transfected U2OS cells with combinations of vectors expressing active (GFP-P&#x0002f;CAF-Flag) and inactive (P&#x0002f;CAF&#x00394;HAT-Flag&#x00029; proteins; immunoprecipitated them by using the anti-Flag antibody, and finally analysed their expression level and acetylation status by western blotting using the anti-Flag and anti-acetyl-Lys antibodies, respectively. The results in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg655f2">2</xref>A (bottom panel, lane 2) show that inactive P&#x0002f;CAF (P&#x0002f;CAF&#x00394;HAT-Flag) is acetylated in the presence of active P&#x0002f;CAF (GFP-P&#x0002f;CAF-Flag). Both proteins were expressed in U2OS to similar levels (top panel). The weak acetylation band of P&#x0002f;CAF&#x00394;HAT-Flag that we detect in the absence of GFP-P&#x0002f;CAF-Flag (bottom panel, lane 1) could be due to the activity of endogenous P&#x0002f;CAF enzyme. The results in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg655f2">2</xref>A suggest that acetylation of P&#x0002f;CAF(FL) can occur <italic>in vivo</italic> by an intermolecular reaction (in trans) <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Then we tried to identify the P&#x0002f;CAF region that is acetylated in trans. To that end, U2OS cells were transfected with P&#x0002f;CAF (FL)-Flag and P&#x0002f;CAF&#x00394;HAT (352&#x02013;832)-Flag (which lacks the first 352 amino acids) expression vectors. Flag proteins were immunoprecipitated using the anti-Flag antibody and their expression level and acetylation status were determined by western blotting using the anti-Flag antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg655f2">2</xref>B, top panel) and anti-acetyl-Lys antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg655f2">2</xref>B, bottom panel), respectively. The result confirms our previous findings, showing that P&#x0002f;CAF FL is acetylated <italic>in vivo</italic> (lanes 2 and 3), and also indicates that P&#x0002f;CAF&#x00394;HAT &#x00028;352&#x02013;832&#x00029;-Flag cannot be acetylated by P&#x0002f;CAF(FL)-Flag (lane 3, arrow). The lack of acetylation of P&#x0002f;CAF&#x00394;HAT (352&#x02013;832)-Flag could be due to the deletion of the P&#x0002f;CAF-P&#x0002f;CAF interaction domain and not the acetylation sites <italic>per se</italic>. To rule out that possibility, we analysed the P&#x0002f;CAF-P&#x0002f;CAF interaction by <italic>in vitro</italic> pull down experiments. More precisely, radiolabelled P&#x0002f;CAF was pulled down with GST-P&#x0002f;CAF(FL) and GST-P&#x0002f;CAF&#x00394;HAT (352&#x02013;832) and the bound protein was detected by radiography. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg655f2">2</xref>C shows that P&#x0002f;CAF is capable of interacting weakly with itself <italic>in vitro</italic> and this interaction is not affected when the N-terminal domain is deleted.

To ensure that we were monitoring a trans-independent event, we have used recombinant GST-P&#x0002f;CAF (352&#x02013;832) (which cannot be acetylated in trans by P&#x0002f;CAF(FL) <italic>in vivo</italic>, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg655f2">2</xref>B) and GST-P&#x0002f;CAF&#x00394;HAT &#x00028;352&#x02013;832&#x00029; in an <italic>in vitro</italic> acetylation assay.

This autoacetylation is likely to occur as an intramolecular event because P&#x0002f;CAF lacking the N-terminal domain (1&#x02013;352) cannot be acetylated in trans, either <italic>in vivo</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg655f2">2</xref>B) or <italic>in vitro</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg655f3">3</xref>A), by P&#x0002f;CAF(FL).</p><p>We conclude that P&#x0002f;CAF can be autoacetylated <italic>in vivo</italic>, both in trans and in cis at the C-terminal domain (amino acids 352&#x02013;832).</p></sec><sec><title>P&#x0002f;CAF is acetylated by p300 <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>P&#x0002f;CAF was originally identified as a p300&#x0002f;CBP-interacting protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg655c8">8</xref>). CBP and p300 have HAT activity and are able to acetylate other factors different from histones (p53, GATA, 1, ELKF1, E2F1, TCF, HMGi(Y), MyoD, TFIIE, F, etc.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg655c24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg655c31">31</xref>). Therefore, we sought to determine whether either CBP or p300 could acetylate P&#x0002f;CAF <italic>in vivo</italic>. To that end, we transfected P&#x0002f;CAF-Flag and P&#x0002f;CAF&#x00394;HAT-Flag in the presence or absence of p300-HA. Flag proteins were purified by immunoprecipitation using the anti-Flag antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg655f4">4</xref>A, lanes 2, 3, 5 and 6) and their acetylation levels were determined by western blotting, using the anti-acetyl-Lys antibody. The amount of p300-HA expressed in each transfection was monitored by IP with anti-HA antibody (lanes 1, 4 and 7). Our results show that p300 is able to acetylate P&#x0002f;CAF <italic>in vivo</italic> (lane 5). The weak acetylation band of P&#x0002f;CAF&#x00394;HAT-Flag that we detect in absence of P&#x0002f;CAF-Flag (lane 6) could be due to the HAT activity of endogenous p300 or P&#x0002f;CAF enzymes.</p><p>We did not detect any increase in acetylation by p300 over the autoacetylation levels on active P&#x0002f;CAF (lanes 2 and 3). The reasons may be that acetylation by p300 could be masked by the strong autoacetylation signal due to P&#x0002f;CAF itself or that acetylation sites in P&#x0002f;CAF are redundant.</p><p>We also wanted to determine whether CBP could acetylate P&#x0002f;CAF. To do that, P&#x0002f;CAF&#x00394;HAT-Flag and CBP-HA plasmids were transfected into U2OS cells, Flag proteins were purified by immunoprecipitation using the anti-Flag antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg655f4">4</xref>B, lanes 2 and 3) and their acetylation levels were determined by western blotting using the anti-acetyl-Lys antibody. The expression levels of P300-HA and CBP-HA in each transfection were monitored by IP with anti-HA antibody (lanes 1 and 4). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg655f4">4</xref>B shows that p300 (lane 2) but not CBP (lane 3) is capable of acetylating P&#x0002f;CAF <italic>in vivo</italic>. The presence of HA tag on CBP is not affecting its HAT activity, because when we analysed HAT activity of HA-CBP and HA-p300 by IP-HAT assay, both proteins showed similar HAT activity on histones (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg655f4">4</xref>C).</p></sec><sec><title>P&#x0002f;CAF is autoacetylated in its nuclear localisation signal (NLS)</title><p>To try to establish the function of P&#x0002f;CAF autoacetylation, we decided to identify the lysines on P&#x0002f;CAF, which are acetylated in cis. To this end, we expressed various domains of P&#x0002f;CAF as GST-fusion proteins and tested their autoacetylation by an <italic>in vitro</italic> acetylation assay. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg655f5">5</xref>A clearly shows that GST-P&#x0002f;CAF (352&#x02013;658) (which contains the HAT domain) is autoacetylated <italic>in vitro</italic>. The GST fusion &#x0005b;GST-P&#x0002f;CAF (489&#x02013;658)&#x0005d;, which does not include the region between 352 and 489 (but still maintains HAT activity, data not shown) lost the ability to be acetylated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg655f5">5</xref>A, lane 2). To analyse this region (amino acids 352&#x02013;489) more closely, we mutated the lysines (Ks) present between positions 352 and 658 in the GST-P&#x0002f;CAF (352&#x02013;658) construct (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg655f5">5</xref>B) and analysed the autoacetylation activities of these mutants in an <italic>in vitro</italic> assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg655f5">5</xref>C). (All the mutants were active in a HAT activity assay, data not shown.) The mutant that has lost the five Ks (416, 428, 430, 441 and 442) is not autoacetylated <italic>in vitro</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg655f5">5</xref>C, lane 3). After examination of the 352&#x02013;444 region, we realised that this region contains a putative NLS consensus sequence, between amino acids 425 and 445 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg655f5">5</xref>B). Therefore, we wanted to investigate whether P&#x0002f;CAF contains a functional NLS between these amino acids and whether P&#x0002f;CAF autoacetylation in cis could affect the NLS function. To investigate these possibilities, we constructed a GFP-P&#x0002f;CAF-Flag in which the five lysines at the putative NLS (428, 430, 441 and 442) were mutated to arginines (which maintain the positive charge of the NLS) &#x0005b;GFP-PCAF (Ks-Rs)&#x0005d;. C2C12 cells were transfected with GFP-P&#x0002f;CAF and GFP-PCAF(Ks-Rs) and we determined their cellular localisation by fluorescence. The results in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg655f6">6</xref> show that GFP-P&#x0002f;CAF is nuclear before C2C12 differentiation (myoblast) and after differentiation to myotubes (top panels), and that the lysines between 425 and 445 are essential for localising the protein in the nucleus (bottom panels) defining the unique nuclear localisation signal within P&#x0002f;CAF between 425 and 445 amino acids. On the other hand, the acetylation of the NLS on P&#x0002f;CAF opened the possibility of regulating intracellular localisation by acetylation. However, GFP-P&#x0002f;CAF shows exclusively intranuclear localisation on different cell types (293-T, U2OS, C2C12; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg655f6">6</xref> and data not shown) and does not change localisation upon differentiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg655f6">6</xref>), high confluence or growth in minimal medium (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>P&#x0002f;CAF autoacetylation and HAT activity</title><p>It has been proposed that P&#x0002f;CAF autoacetylation could play a role in regulating its HAT enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg655c20">20</xref>). So we sought to determine whether autoacetylation in cis could affect the acetyltransferase activity. To do that, we incubated first either GST-P&#x0002f;CAF (352&#x02013;658) or GST-P&#x0002f;CAF (352&#x02013;658) mutated at lysines 416, 428, 430, 441 and 442 (P&#x0002f;CAF non-acetylable mutant) in the presence and in the absence of cold acetyl-CoA and then P&#x0002f;CAF HAT activity on identical amounts of histone H3 was analysed in an <italic>in vitro</italic> acetylation assay by fluorography (see diagram in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg655f7">7</xref>A). The results in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg655f7">7</xref>A and their quantification in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg655f7">7</xref>B show that after incubation with acetyl-CoA, P&#x0002f;CAF is more active to acetylate histone H3. This effect is probably due to two independent processes: first, P&#x0002f;CAF stabilisation by acetyl-CoA as has been previously described by Herrera <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg655c20">20</xref>), which probably affects to the same extent P&#x0002f;CAF and the non-acetylable P&#x0002f;CAF mutant; and secondly, P&#x0002f;CAF intra-acetylation, which increases 2- to 3-fold P&#x0002f;CAF HAT activity on histone H3.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The results presented here show that P&#x0002f;CAF is an acetyl-protein <italic>in vivo</italic>. P&#x0002f;CAF is acetylated by itself and by p300, but not by CBP <italic>in vivo</italic>. Acetylation of P&#x0002f;CAF seems to increase P&#x0002f;CAF stability&#x0002f;histone acetyltransferase activity.</p><p>In this paper, we give some evidence for the implementation of an acetylation cascade: P&#x0002f;CAF is acetylated <italic>in vivo</italic> by itself and by another HAT, p300, suggesting that an acetylase modifies the activity of a second acetylase, probably in order to transmit a biological signal. The fact that the bromodomain, which is present in many chromatin-working proteins, recognises acetyl-lysines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg655c32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg655c36">36</xref>) also suggests a cascade mechanism mediated by acetylation. How is the acetylation signal transmitted? We have shown that incubation of P&#x0002f;CAF with acetyl-CoA increases P&#x0002f;CAF HAT activity on histone H3, suggesting that acetylation could be a mechanism to regulate P&#x0002f;CAF HAT activity. On the other hand, our work demonstrates that P&#x0002f;CAF can be acetylated at the N-terminal domain in trans and at the C-terminus by an intramolecular event. This acetylation at different sites could have different <italic>in vivo</italic> consequences. It is possible that P&#x0002f;CAF is recruited to different promoters by distinct sets of transcription factors and P&#x0002f;CAF acetylation could contribute to this specificity. P&#x0002f;CAF acetylation could be involved in this recruitment by affecting the P&#x0002f;CAF-transcription factor interaction. In fact, HAT-transcription factor interactions have been shown to be regulated by acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg655c31">31</xref>), although we have not detected any difference in binding to CBP2, E1A, E2F and p53 <italic>in vitro</italic> (data not shown). Another possibility is that acetylation may change P&#x0002f;CAF specificity to acetylate different histones or factors. This may lead to differential activated states necessary for some promoters but not others. We have not observed any change in the P&#x0002f;CAF specificity to acetylate, <italic>in vitro</italic>, different histones upon autoacetylation (data not shown); however, the pool of P&#x0002f;CAF autoacetylated represents very little of the total amount of enzyme in the reaction so any small change could be masked. Even in this unfavourable condition what we could observe is an increase in the global HAT activity of P&#x0002f;CAF on histone H3.</p><p>In summary, we have identified a new post-translational modification of P&#x0002f;CAF <italic>in vivo</italic>, which leads to an increment of its HAT activity and could be part of a signal transduction cascade leading to regulation of the cellular HAT activities.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg655f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> P&#x0002f;CAF is an acetyl-protein <italic>in vivo</italic>.
