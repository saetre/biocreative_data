In this study we demonstrate that HINT1 participates in ionizing radiation (IR)&#x02013;induced DNA damage responses. In response to IR, HINT1 is recruited to IR-induced foci (IRIF) and associates with &#x003b3;-H2AX and ATM. HINT1 deficiency does not affect the formation of &#x003b3;-H2AX foci; however, it impairs the removal of &#x003b3;-H2AX foci after DNA damage and this is associated with impaired acetylation of &#x003b3;-H2AX. HINT1 deficiency also impairs acetylation of ATM and activation of ATM and its downstream effectors, and retards DNA repair, in response to IR. HINT1-deficient cells exhibit resistance to IR-induced apoptosis and several types of chromosomal abnormalities. Our findings suggest that the tumor suppressor function of HINT1 is caused by, at least in part, its normal role in enhancing cellular responses to DNA damage by regulating the functions of both &#x003b3;-H2AX and ATM.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: DDR, DNA damage responses; DNA-PKcs, DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit; DSB, double strand breaks; IR, ionizing radiation; IRIF, Ionizing radiation-induced foci; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; PFGE, pulse-field gel electrophoresis; shRNA, short hairpin RNA.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>DNA double strand breaks (DSB) resulting from exposure to ionizing radiation (IR), various chemical agents, or even from normal DNA replication are the most lethal type of DNA lesion because the damage to both DNA strands prevents use of the complimentary DNA strand as a template for DNA repair. Therefore, the proper removal of DSB requires the coordinated action of diverse signaling pathways involved in cell cycle checkpoints and DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">van Gent et al., 2001</xref>). Inefficient or inaccurate repair of DSB can cause genomic instability and enhance carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">van Gent et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Although the precise sequence of events that occurs in the process of repairing DSB is not clear, changes in chromatin structure are believed to play an important role in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Downs et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, phosphorylation of a histone variant, H2AX, is one of the earliest events after DSB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rogakou et al., 1998</xref>). Within seconds after exposure to IR, H2AX is phosphorylated at a highly conserved Serine 139 residue in the C-terminal tail of this histone. This phosphorylated protein is called &#x003b3;-H2AX. The &#x003b3;-H2AX protein forms distinctive foci in the nucleus that are observable by immunofluorescent staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rogakou et al., 1999</xref>). &#x003b3;-H2AX provides a scaffold for other checkpoint signaling and DNA repair proteins to accumulate in the vicinity of DSB, forming IR-induced foci (IRIF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Paull et al., 2000</xref>). Because DNA is wrapped around histone octamers and packaged further into higher order structures, during the subsequent process of DNA repair, chromatin remodeling activity is required to relax this tight packaging and allow access of repair proteins to the damaged sites in DNA. After DNA repair is complete, chromatin remodeling complexes also play an important role in restoring normal cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Papamichos-Chronakis et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, chromatin remodeling functions in all stages of DNA damage responses (DDR) in eukaryotic cells.</p><p>DDR also involve activation of checkpoints that delay progression of the cell cycle, and thus allow time for DNA repair. Activation of the ATM protein is also one of the earliest cellular responses to DSB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakkenist and Kastan, 2003</xref>). In undamaged cells, ATM resides as a catalytically inactive dimer or multimer. Upon DNA damage, it is first acetylated by a specific histone acetyltransferase called TIP60 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sun et al., 2005</xref>). This is followed by autophosphorylation at Ser1981, which causes the activation of ATM kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakkenist and Kastan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sun et al., 2005</xref>). The active ATM monomers activate via phosphorylation several downstream effectors including Chk1, Chk2, and p53, all of which are involved in cell cycle checkpoints or apoptosis.</p><p>In this study we examined the role of a novel tumor suppressor gene, <italic>Hint1</italic>, in DDR elicited by DSB. The HINT1 protein belongs to the histidine triad superfamily of nucleotide-binding proteins and is evolutionarily highly conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lima et al., 1996</xref>). In previous studies we demonstrated that <italic>Hint1</italic> deficiency in mice resulted in increased susceptibility to both spontaneous and carcinogen-induced tumor formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Su et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2006</xref>). We also discovered that <italic>Hint1</italic> &#x02212;/&#x02212; mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) are more resistant to the cytotoxicity of IR than <italic>Hint1</italic> &#x0002b;/&#x0002b; MEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Su et al., 2003</xref>). These findings suggested that the HINT1 protein might play a role in cellular responses to DNA damage. Because of the importance of &#x003b3;-H2AX in the chromatin remodeling pathway and ATM in the checkpoint and apoptosis pathway in maintaining genome integrity, we investigated the role of HINT1 in these two pathways of DDR after treating control or HINT1-deficient cells with IR or the radiomimetic drug bleomycin.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>HINT1-deficient cells display prolonged &#x003b3;-H2AX foci and impaired acetylation of &#x003b3;-H2AX after &#x003b3; radiation</title><p>To study the role of HINT1 in DDR, we used MEFs derived from the <italic>Hint1</italic> &#x0002b;/&#x0002b;, &#x0002b;/&#x02212;, and &#x02212;/&#x02212; mice, which were previously generated in our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Su et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2006</xref>). We first examined the expression of HINT1 in these cells by real-time RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis. We found that the mRNA level in <italic>Hint1</italic> &#x0002b;/&#x02212; cells is &#x0223c;50% of the wild-type cells and undetectable in <italic>Hint1</italic> &#x02212;/&#x02212; cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). The expression of HINT1 protein is also high in the <italic>Hint1</italic> &#x0002b;/&#x0002b; MEFs, decreased by half in the &#x0002b;/&#x02212; MEFs, and undetectable in the &#x02212;/&#x02212; cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Because of the importance of the formation of &#x003b3;-H2AX foci in response to DSB, we compared the kinetics of &#x003b3;-H2AX foci formation and removal in the three different genotypes of <italic>Hint1</italic> MEFs after exposing the cells to 4 Gy of &#x003b3; radiation. Colocalization of &#x003b3;-H2AX foci with p-ATM foci was observed in these cells (unpublished data). Cells were counted as positive if they contained five or more &#x003b3;-H2AX foci per nucleus. In untreated <italic>Hint1</italic> &#x0002b;/&#x0002b; MEFs, &#x0003c;10% of the cells were positive for &#x003b3;-H2AX foci. However, in untreated <italic>Hint1</italic> &#x0002b;/&#x02212; or &#x02212;/&#x02212; MEFs, 30&#x02013;40% of the cells were &#x003b3;-H2AX positive, and this increase was statistically significant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). This suggests that HINT1-deficient cells accumulate spontaneous DNA damage at a higher rate than the corresponding wild-type cells. After &#x003b3; radiation, the cells in all three genotypes showed increases in &#x003b3;-H2AX foci, suggesting that HINT1 is not required for the formation of IR-induced &#x003b3;-H2AX foci. The percentage of cells positive for &#x003b3;-H2AX foci as a function of postirradiation time is shown also in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>. &#x003b3;-H2AX&#x02013;positive cells gradually declined at 3 h after IR treatment in <italic>Hint1</italic> &#x0002b;/&#x0002b; cells, and by 24 h the percentage of &#x003b3;-H2AX&#x02013;positive cells observed was similar to sham-treated control. However, 90% of the <italic>Hint1</italic> &#x02212;/&#x02212; and &#x0223c;75% of the <italic>Hint1</italic> &#x0002b;/&#x02212; cells remained positive for &#x003b3;-H2AX staining for up to 24 h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). We further examined whether the prolonged &#x003b3;-H2AX foci colocalize with the MRN repair complex. Double fluorescent staining was performed with &#x003b3;-H2AX and Rad50 antibodies, and DAPI was used as a counterstain of the nucleus. In the <italic>Hint1</italic> &#x0002b;/&#x0002b; cells, Rad50 foci colocalized with &#x003b3;-H2AX foci at 1 h after IR, and both foci diminished at 24 h after IR (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). However, in the <italic>Hint1</italic> &#x02212;/&#x02212; cells, even at 24&#x02013;48 h after IR, Rad50 foci were observable and these foci colocalized with &#x003b3;-H2AX (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Because Rad50 is a component of the MRN complex, which is recruited to &#x003b3;-H2AX foci in response to DNA DSB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maser et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Paull and Lee, 2005</xref>), prolonged Rad50 foci further indicate that there are defects of &#x003b3;-H2AX dynamics in HINT1-deficient cells. The significant differences of &#x003b3;-H2AX and Rad50 foci removal between wild-type and HINT1-deficient MEFs suggest that HINT1 is required for the normal removal of IRIF that occurs within a few hours after IR.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>HINT1-deficient MEFs display prolonged &#x003b3;-H2AX staining and impaired acetylation of &#x003b3;-H2AX.</bold> (A) Real-time RT-PCR quantification of mRNA levels in exponential growing <italic>Hint1</italic> MEFs. &#x02020;, P &#x0003c; 0.0001 compared with <italic>Hint1</italic> &#x0002b;/&#x0002b; MEFs.

Repeat studies gave similar results.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1830253f01"></graphic></fig><p>The precise mechanisms by which &#x003b3;-H2AX foci are removed are not known. &#x003b3;-H2AX may be dephosphorylated in chromatin by protein phosphatases acting in situ or it may be first replaced by unmodified H2AX, and then dephosphorylated in the nucleoplasm. Current data supports the latter mechanism because thus far direct dephosphorylation of &#x003b3;-H2AX has been seen only in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nazarov et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chowdhury et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Keogh et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, it was recently discovered that during DNA repair in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> the removal of phospho-H2Av, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologue of human &#x003b3;-H2AX, requires the histone acetylase activity of the TIP60 protein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kusch et al., 2004</xref>), and in HeLa cells TIP60 also acetylates H2AX in response to IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ikura et al., 2007</xref>). There is increasing evidence that the TIP60 complex plays an important role in the regulation of DDR because it is recruited to the chromatin surrounding DSB and contributes to the dynamics of DNA repair through a series of chromatin modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bird et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Downs et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kusch et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Murr et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>A recent paper showed that the HINT1 protein associates with the TIP60 complex in SW480 human colon cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Weiske and Huber, 2006</xref>). This finding prompted us to examine whether the persistence of &#x003b3;-H2AX foci in HINT1-deficient MEFs is caused by impaired acetylation of &#x003b3;-H2AX because of absence of HINT1 from the TIP60 complex. To examine whether &#x003b3;-H2AX is acetylated in response to IR, we immunoprecipitated the &#x003b3;-H2AX protein from lysates of <italic>Hint1</italic> MEFs at 0, 30 min, 1 h, or 3 h after a 4-Gy dose of &#x003b3; radiation, using conditions that dissociate histones from nucleosomes in the preparation procedure (see Materials and methods). Using an anti&#x02013;&#x003b3;-H2AX antibody in an immunoblot analysis of these immunoprecipitates, we found that even in unirradiated <italic>Hint1</italic> &#x0002b;/&#x0002b; cells, there was a basal level of &#x003b3;-H2AX, and that this level increased at 30 min, and then declined at 3 h after IR (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). The levels of &#x003b3;-H2AX in the <italic>Hint1</italic> &#x0002b;/&#x02212; and &#x02212;/&#x02212; cells at time 0 and at 3 h were greater than that in the &#x0002b;/&#x0002b; cells. These results are consistent with those described in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>. We then used an antibody to acetyllysine in immunoblots to examine whether in these cells &#x003b3;-H2AX is acetylated in response to IR, as is the case with its <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kusch et al., 2004</xref>). There was a low level of acetylation of &#x003b3;-H2AX in the untreated <italic>Hint1</italic> &#x0002b;/&#x0002b; cells. This increased at 30 min, and then declined at 1 h after IR. However, in both <italic>Hint1</italic> &#x0002b;/&#x02212; and &#x02212;/&#x02212; MEFs, the acetylation of &#x003b3;-H2AX was completely abolished, with or without IR (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). We also used the ac-H2A(K5) antibody to examine whether this acetylated &#x003b3;-H2AX protein is specifically acetylated at the conserved lysine site because several other lysines are also reported to be acetylated after IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yamamoto and Horikoshi, 1997</xref>). In the <italic>Hint1</italic> &#x0002b;/&#x0002b; MEFs there was a basal level of acetylation of &#x003b3;-H2AX at K5, and at 30 min after IR this level increased markedly, and then declined at 1 h. However, no evidence of acetylation of K5 was detected in the &#x003b3;-H2AX protein in <italic>Hint1</italic> &#x0002b;/&#x02212; or &#x02212;/&#x02212; cells, before and after IR (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). These findings suggest that HINT1 is haploinsufficient with respect to its role in mediating the acetylation of &#x003b3;-H2AX because this acetylation is impaired in <italic>Hint1</italic> &#x0002b;/&#x02212; MEFs. The acetylation of &#x003b3;-H2AX appears to be associated with the capability of removing &#x003b3;-H2AX foci in the later stages of DDR because only the <italic>Hint1</italic> &#x0002b;/&#x0002b; MEFs, in which &#x003b3;-H2AX is acetylated in response to IR, are able to remove &#x003b3;-H2AX foci at 3 h. The <italic>Hint1</italic> &#x0002b;/&#x02212; and &#x02212;/&#x02212; MEFs, which are impaired in &#x003b3;-H2AX acetylation, fail to remove &#x003b3;-H2AX foci even 24 h after IR. As a result, these cells display prolonged &#x003b3;-H2AX nuclear foci staining (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1 C</xref>). These findings are consistent with previous studies on the role of &#x003b3;-H2AX acetylation in the removal of &#x003b3;-H2AX foci in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kusch et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>HINT1 is recruited to IRIF in response to &#x003b3; radiation and interacts with &#x003b3;-H2AX</title><p>The results described in the previous section clearly demonstrate that HINT1 plays a role in DDR and is involved in the chromatin remodeling pathway after IR. Because IR triggers the recruitment to discrete nuclear foci of several proteins that play a role in signaling DNA damage and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Paull et al., 2000</xref>), it was of interest to determine whether the HINT1 protein also forms IRIF. For this purpose a FLAG-tagged Hint1 expression plasmid was constructed and transiently expressed in <italic>Hint1</italic> &#x02212;/&#x02212; MEFs. These cells were either untreated or treated with a 4-Gy dose of &#x003b3; radiation and fixed at the indicated times. IRIF formation was analyzed by immunofluorescent staining with specific antibodies to the FLAG tag or &#x003b3;-H2AX. We found that in untreated cells, HINT1 is localized predominantly in the cytoplasm, although diffuse staining of HINT1 was also observed in the nucleus (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). The cytoplasmic patterns of FLAG-Hint1 staining did not change in response to IR. However, we observed remarkable changes of FLAG-Hint1 localization in the nucleus in response to IR. There were very few foci in untreated cells, and these foci did not colocalize with &#x003b3;-H2AX. At 30 min after IR, HINT1 formed distinct nuclear foci that colocalized with &#x003b3;-H2AX foci (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). These foci remained detectable at 3 h and disappeared at 18 h after IR. Interestingly, the kinetics of HINT1 IRIF formation correlates well with that of &#x003b3;-H2AX foci (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). The fact that HINT1 is recruited to IRIF provides strong evidence that HINT1 plays an important role in DDR.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>The HINT1 protein is recruited to IRIF and associates with &#x003b3;-H2AX.</bold> (A) <italic>Hint1</italic> &#x02212;/&#x02212; MEFs were transiently transfected with FLAG-Hint1, grown on coverslips, and treated with 4 Gy of IR.

The formation of &#x003b3;-H2AX foci is normally a very early and transient response of cells to DSB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">van Gent et al., 2001</xref>). Spontaneous formation of &#x003b3;-H2AX foci was seen in several DNA repair&#x02013;deficient cells, such as cells derived from ataxia telangiectasia or Nijmegen breakage syndrome patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kuhne et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, we found that HINT1-deficient MEFs also display &#x003b3;-H2AX foci in the absence of irradiation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), which suggests that these cells have increased levels of spontaneous DNA damage. We found that HINT1-deficient MEFs display a marked persistence of &#x003b3;-H2AX foci after exposure to IR (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), which suggests that these cells are defective in DNA repair. Comet assay and PFGE-based DNA repair assays (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) further confirmed the reduced DNA repair capability of HINT1-deficient MEFs compared with wild-type cells. These findings are of interest because another member of the HIT protein family, aprataxin, has recently been shown to play an important role in resolving abortive DNA ligation intermediates and in DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahel et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>HINT1-deficient cells are also defective in activation of ATM in response to IR. Thus, we found that both acetylation and activation of ATM are significantly reduced in HINT1-deficient MEFs and in Hint1-shRNA knockdown derivatives of SW480 colon cancer cells, as manifested by decreased phosphorylation of the S1981 residue in ATM and decreased phosphorylation of its downstream effectors Chk1(S317), Chk2(T68), and p53(S15) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). The induction by IR of several DNA damage&#x02013;inducible genes, including p21, GADD45&#x003b1;, GADD153, and TP53inp1, is also defective in HINT1-deficient MEFs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Cellular levels of the p21 protein are also decreased in HINT1-deficient MEFs and in Hint1-shRNA SW480 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Thus, it appears that HINT1 normally plays an important role in the ATM checkpoint pathway that is activated in response to DNA damage. Despite these findings, HINT1-deficient MEFs are more resistant to the cytotoxicity of IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Su et al., 2003</xref>) and HINT1-deficient SW480 derivatives are more resistant to the induction of apoptosis after IR than control SW480 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>). These results appear to be paradoxical because loss of ATM activity is often associated with increased cellular sensitivity to DNA damage. However, reduced activation of ATM-mediated signaling pathways may also result in reduced apoptotic potential. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barlow et al. (1997)</xref> have demonstrated that ATM selectively regulates the p53-dependent cell cycle checkpoint and apoptotic pathways. Another study has demonstrated the requirement for both ATM and Bax gene products in IR-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chong et al., 2000</xref>). It has been recently found that inactivation of ATM reduces apoptosis in Myc-transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pusapati et al., 2006</xref>), and ATM loss impairs Myc apoptotic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maclean et al., 2007</xref>). Cells with reduced apoptotic potential may be able to survive with a considerable amount of genomic instability. In a clonogenic survival assay, decreased sensitivity to increasing doses of &#x003b3; radiation was found in <italic>Hint1</italic> &#x02212;/&#x02212; MEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Su et al., 2003</xref>). Because this assay is based on the number of surviving colonies, the &#x0201c;decreased radiation sensitivity&#x0201d; observed with <italic>Hint1</italic> &#x02212;/&#x02212; cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Su et al., 2003</xref>) does not indicate that HINT1-deficient cells are also devoid of genomic instability. Because <italic>Hint1</italic> &#x0002b;/&#x02212; and &#x02212;/&#x02212; MEFs display a substantial amount of spontaneous and IR-induced genomic instability associated with micronuclei and nucleoplasmic bridges (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>), these findings are consistent with the observation that the apoptotic potential is impaired in HINT1-deficient cells. HINT1 may also directly affect targets downstream of ATM, including p53 and p21, thereby directly affecting the process of apoptosis. Indeed, overexpression of HINT1 induces PARP cleavage, activates caspase-3, and enhances expression of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Weiske and Huber, 2006</xref>). Therefore, the combined effects of loss of HINT1 expression on cellular responses to DNA DSB could be complex, including transient responses such as reduced activation of ATM and downstream responses such as reduced apoptosis. The method used to assess the effects of HINT1 deficiency on sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of IR (colony formation assay at 2&#x02013;3 wk) in MEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Su et al., 2003</xref>) involves complex cellular processes, including clonal selection of resistant cells, and therefore may not directly address the sensitivity of HINT1-deficient cells to DNA DSB.</p><p>Although ATM acetylation is markedly decreased in <italic>Hint1</italic> &#x02212;/&#x02212; cells, ATM activation (phosphorylation of downstream targets) is not completely inhibited (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), perhaps because ATM can be activated by mechanisms other than acetylation but at a lower efficiency. Furthermore, p-ATM foci still colocalize with &#x003b3;-H2AX in <italic>Hint1</italic> &#x02212;/&#x02212; cells (unpublished data), and this may be sufficient for activating &#x003b3;-H2AX because in HINT1-deficient MEFs the reduced activation of ATM does not affect the phosphorylation of H2AX (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Thus, the function of ATM may not be completely lost in these cells. Alternatively, activation of &#x003b3;-H2AX in HINT1-deficient cells may be mediated by the DNA-PKcs because DNA-PKcs and ATM function redundantly in the phosphorylation of H2AX in response to IR, and &#x003b3;-H2AX foci are formed even in ATM &#x02212;/&#x02212; cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stiff et al., 2004</xref>). Whether deficiency of DNA DSB repair in <italic>Hint1</italic> &#x02212;/&#x02212; MEFs was caused by insufficient activation of ATM is not clear, and it will be of interest to study whether in <italic>Hint1</italic> &#x02212;/&#x02212; MEFs the retarded DNA DSB repair is caused by inefficient nonhomologous end joining or compromised mechanism of other repair pathways.</p><p>It was of interest that, despite the fact that the <italic>Hint1</italic> &#x02212;/&#x02212; MEFs have defects in the DSB repair pathway, including loss of ATM activation and the presence of unrepaired DSB, <italic>Hint1</italic> &#x02212;/&#x02212; cells are more resistant to cytotoxicity by IR than <italic>Hint</italic> &#x0002b;/&#x0002b; cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Su et al., 2003</xref>). It is possible that in HINT1-deficient cells the functions of ATM are fine tuned so that proapoptotic effects induced by IR are inhibited whereas prosurvival effects are not. It is also possible that HINT1 has other activities that are required for inducing apoptosis after IR. Nevertheless, genetic or epigenetic inactivation of HINT1 might contribute to the development of radioresistant tumors, and, on the other hand, transient inactivation of HINT activity might be a strategy for developing compounds that protect normal cells from the cytotoxicity caused by IR.</p><p>There is increasing evidence that protein acetylation plays an important role in regulating DDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Squatrito et al., 2006</xref>). Perhaps the most novel aspect of the present study is our finding that HINT1-deficient cells are impaired in the acetylation of both &#x003b3;-H2AX and ATM in response to DNA damage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig, 3 A</xref>) and that HINT1 associates with ATM and &#x003b3;-H2AX (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). These findings suggest that HINT1 may be important for mediating and coordinating the acetylation events necessary to induce both the early (ATM activation) and late (removal of &#x003b3;-H2AX) steps of DDR. Additional studies are required to determine the mechanism by which HINT1 influences the state of acetylation of ATM and &#x003b3;-H2AX. HINT1 has intrinsic hydrolase activity for phosphoramidate and acyladenylate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bieganowski et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chou et al., 2007</xref>), but further studies are required to determine if these activities are relevant to its functions in DDR pathways.</p><p>Collectively, the defects in the &#x003b3;-H2AX chromatin remodeling pathway in HINT1-deficient cells, combined with the defects in the ATM checkpoint pathway, may explain why HINT1-deficient MEFs display an increase in various types of chromosomal abnormalities and genomic instability (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). These findings confirm the haploinsufficient function of HINT1 at a mechanistic level. It was of interest that the biological and cellular effects caused by decreased levels of HINT1 are not entirely dose dependent. Thus, <italic>Hint1</italic> &#x0002b;/&#x02212; MEFs exhibit decreased acetylation of &#x003b3;-H2AX to an extent similar to <italic>Hint1</italic> &#x02212;/&#x02212; cells, and they also display prolonged activation of &#x003b3;-H2AX similar to <italic>Hint1</italic> &#x02212;/&#x02212; cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). In contrast, we did observe dose dependency for several other cellular functions of <italic>HINT1</italic>, such as decreased activation of ATM, p21, and other p53 target genes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Recent studies indicate that the effects of gene dosage can be complex and cannot be linearly correlated to expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kondrashov and Koonin, 2004</xref>). This is particularly relevant to genes encoding subunits of protein complexes because stoichiometry imbalance can cause alterations of interaction with the target element, which leads to an abnormal phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Birchler et al., 2005</xref>). The HINT1 protein forms a stable homodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lima et al., 1996</xref>) and possibly functions in various protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Korsisaari and Makela, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Weiske and Huber, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ajit et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2007</xref>) and, therefore, stoichiometry balance may be important for its functions. Because of the strong haploinsufficient phenotype of <italic>Hint1</italic> &#x0002b;/&#x02212; cells, loss of heterozygosity in the <italic>Hint1</italic> gene or decreased HINT1 expression of human tissues may increase the risk of tumor development in these tissues. Recent promoter methylation studies indicate that the <italic>Hint1</italic> gene promoter is partially methylated in several lung cancer and colon cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yuan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2007</xref>), and that this is associated with decreased expression of HINT1 RNA and protein. Because HINT1 plays an important role in DDR, this decreased expression of HINT1 may increase the likelihood of genome instability and thereby enhance tumor development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines</title><p><italic>Hint1</italic> &#x0002b;/&#x02212; mice were mated to generate <italic>Hint1</italic> &#x0002b;/&#x0002b;, &#x0002b;/&#x02212;, and &#x02212;/&#x02212; embryos and each genotyped as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2006</xref>).
