ECTV normally penetrates through the periphery but rapidly spreads through the lymphatic system to vital organs. In mousepox-sensitive strains of mice, ECTV infection culminates with either rapid death or overt symptoms of mousepox due to very high loads that the virus reaches in vital organs, particularly the liver. However, some strains of mice such as C57BL/6 (B6) and 129 also become infected with ECTV but naturally resist mousepox by controlling the virus loads in vital organs and clearing the virus without clinical symptoms of disease. Natural killer (NK) cells are cells of the innate immune system previously shown to play an important role in natural resistance to mousepox. However, how NK cells protect from this disease is still unknown. In this paper we show that NK cells directly contribute to antiviral defenses by curbing virus dissemination to vital organs and also indirectly by augmenting the antiviral T cell response. We also demonstrate that optimal protection requires the activating NK cell receptor NKG2D which facilitates killing of ECTV-infected cells. Our work has important implications for the understanding of natural resistance to viral disease.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Fang M, Lanier LL, Sigal LJ (2008) A role for NKG2D in NK cell&#x02013;mediated resistance to poxvirus disease.

To determine whether and when NK cells are required for resistance to mousepox, we depleted NK cells in B6 mice at different times following ECTV infection with either anti-asialo GM1 antiserum or anti-NK1.1 mAb PK136. Anti-asialo GM1 antiserum depletes NK cells and some activated T cells but not NKT cells, whereas PK136 depletes NK cells and NKT cells but not T cells. Thus, the use of both Abs allowed us to better distinguish the role of NK cells from that of other lymphocyte populations. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0040030-t001">Table 1</xref>, depletion of NK cells with either Ab on or before day 4 post-infection (PI) with 3,000 pfu ECTV resulted in very high mortality, while mock-depleted mice (normal rabbit sera for anti-asialo GM1 and mouse IgG2a for PK136) were still resistant (data not shown). On the other hand, resistance to mousepox was maintained when mice were depleted of NK cells on day 6 PI, indicating an important role for the physical presence of NK cells at the early, but not later, stages of infection. In additional experiments, we found that five out of five and two out of five PK136-depleted B6 mice succumbed when infected with 100 and 1 pfu ECTV, respectively. Identical results were obtained for BALB/c mice infected with the same virus stock. This shows that the susceptibility of B6 mice depleted of NK cells on the day of infection is similar to that of genetically susceptible BALB/c mice. In agreement with the increased mortality, NK cell depletion resulted in severe necrosis and splenic lymphopenia as compared to non-depleted (intact) B6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040030-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Furthermore, 7 d PI, NK cell&#x02013;depleted mice had more than 10<sup>3</sup>-fold higher viral titers in both the spleen and liver than intact mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040030-g001">Figure 1</xref>B), indicating a more severe systemic infection in the absence of NK cells.

NK cell production of IFN-&#x003b3; and granzyme B (GzB) in the draining lymph nodes (D-LN) was already induced 24 h PI, reaching the peak at 48 h PI when &#x0223c;20&#x00025; of the NK cells produced IFN-&#x003b3; and 43&#x00025; produced GzB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040030-g001">Figure 1</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040030-g001">1</xref>D), a time when T cell responses were not yet detected &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040030-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. This was accompanied by a 2- to 4-fold increase in the proportion of NK cells in the D-LN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040030-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). NK cell responses in non-draining LN and spleen, however, did not peak until day 5 PI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040030-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). In addition, histopathological analysis of the infected footpads on day 2 PI did not show leukocyte infiltration or other signs of inflammation in either intact or NK cell&#x02013;depleted B6 mice (data not shown). Thus, at very early stages of infection the NK cell response is restricted to the D-LN.</p><p>To distinguish whether the increase in NK cell number in D-LN resulted from recruitment and/or proliferation, we inoculated mice at different stages of infection with BrdU IP and sacrificed the mice 3 h later to determine BrdU incorporation by flow cytometric analysis. Very few NK cells incorporated BrdU in the D-LN during the first 3 d PI, suggesting increased migration to the D-LN at early times PI. In fact, on day 3 and 5 PI, the BrdU incorporation in NK cells in spleen and liver was higher than in the D-LN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040030-g001">Figure 1</xref>E). Thus, the increase of NK cells in the D-LN on day 2 PI is mostly due to recruitment rather than proliferation.</p><p>A recent report by Hayakawa and Smyth revealed that peripheral NK1.1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NK cells can be divided into three subsets according to their expression of CD11b and CD27, which they designated R1 (CD27<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup>), R2 (CD27<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>), and R3 (CD27<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>), that represent NK cells at distinct developmental stages &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040030-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040030-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. R1 cells are immature, whereas R2 and R3 fractionate the mature cells into two populations. While adoptively transferred R2 cells can differentiate into R3 cells, R3 cells appear to be terminally differentiated. We, therefore, investigated whether ECTV infection altered the maturation phenotype of NK cells in the D-LN and found a substantial increase in NK cells with a mature (R3) phenotype on day 2 PI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040030-g001">Figure 1</xref>F, upper panels). Of interest, the majority of effectors (IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and/or GzB<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) were within this mature NK cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040030-g001">Figure 1</xref>F, lower panels). Together, these data demonstrate that the increased NK cell number in the D-LN at early time points PI is mainly a result of recruitment. Moreover, the data show that the NK cells responding to ECTV infection are mature or mature very rapidly after infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Control of Early Virus Dissemination by NK Cells Is Dependent on IFN-&#x003b3; and Perforin</title><p>We hypothesized that the observed early recruitment to and activation of NK cells in the D-LN may contribute to the prevention of virus dissemination to central organs. Thus, we depleted NK cells in B6 mice with anti-NK1.1 mAb (PK136) and determined viral titers in spleen and liver on day 3 PI. To rule out a role for T cells at this stage we also depleted both CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells by using a combination of anti-CD4 (GK1.5) and anti-CD8 (2.43) mAbs. Depletion of NK cells resulted in &#x0003e;10<sup>3</sup>-fold increase in viral loads in the spleen, while a much lower increase in virus titers was observed in mice depleted of T cells. The slight increase in virus titers in the T cell&#x02013;depleted mice was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.09) and was not reproducible.

Therefore, NK cells, and not T cells, are responsible for limiting the early dissemination of ECTV from the site of infection to central organs.</p><p>NK cells can control viral infections by producing antiviral cytokines, such as IFN-&#x003b3;, or by perforin (Pf)-mediated killing of infected cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040030-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;.

However, whether the early control of virus dissemination (day 3 PI) by NK cells requires IFN-&#x003b3; and/or Pf-mediated killing is unknown.

The data above indicate that NK cells have a direct effect in preventing mousepox by curbing virus dissemination during early infection. However, NK depletion at early stages resulted in an increase in spleen and liver viral titers, splenic lymphopenia, liver pathology, and death on day 7 PI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040030-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0040030-t001">Table 1</xref>), a time when the presence of NK cells was no longer necessary (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0040030-t001">Table 1</xref>) and when the T cell response should have already peaked &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040030-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. This suggested that the absence of NK cells may have an impact on the establishment of the adaptive anti-ECTV T cell response. Thus, we compared in vivo T cell proliferation in intact mice and mice depleted of NK cells on day 0 PI.

Because NKG2D-deficient mice are not available, we took advantage of the anti-NKG2D mAb CX5 that, in vivo, blocks binding of NKG2D to its ligands and causes its internalization without depleting NKG2D-bearing cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040030-b035">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040030-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;.

We found that more than 50&#x00025; of DAP12-deficient mice developed the typical skin rash, but only 10&#x00025; died following ECTV infection, whereas all DAP10-deficient mice survived without showing ostensible symptoms of mousepox (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0040030-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>To get further insights into the role of NKG2D and its adapters in resistance to mousepox, we determined cell numbers and virus titers 7 d PI in NKG2D-blocked as well as in DAP12- and DAP10-deficient mice. Results showed that NKG2D blockade and DAP12- or DAP10-deficiency resulted in significantly decreased splenic lymphocytosis as compared with wild type, untreated B6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040030-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). More important, the viral loads in NKG2D-blocked mice were almost 10<sup>3</sup> times higher than in unblocked mice, whereas those of DAP12- and DAP10-deficient mice were also significantly elevated, but to a lesser degree (10<sup>2</sup> and 10 times higher, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040030-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). Thus, the degree of splenic lymphocytosis and viral loads on day 7 PI was consistent with the lethality and symptoms of mousepox that we observed under the different conditions. Together, these results show that NKG2D is involved in resistance to mousepox. The data also suggest that for this process NKG2D preferentially, but not exclusively, uses DAP12 as the signaling adapter. Most likely, the absence of one adapter is partially compensated by the presence of the other. The data further suggest that Ly49H and Ly49D are not essential for B6 resistance to mousepox because DAP12-deficient mice were only mildly susceptible to mousepox infection. This contrasts with prior studies demonstrating that DAP12-deficient mice on a B6 MCMV-resistant background are exquisitely sensitive to MCMV infection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040030-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><fig id="ppat-0040030-g003" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>NKG2D Uses DAP10 or DAP12 Adapters to Help Resist Mousepox</title><p>(A) The indicated mice were infected with 3,000 pfu ECTV and the absolute number of lymphocytes in their spleens was determined on day 7 PI by trypan blue exclusion.

However, NKG2D is not only expressed by NK cells but also by some T cells. We hypothesized that if NKG2D has a role in NK cell&#x02013;mediated resistance to mousepox, NKG2D blockade should result in increased early virus dissemination to organs independent of T cells. To test this hypothesis, we measured early viral titers in the spleens (day 3 PI) of mice treated with the anti-NKG2D mAb CX5. To rule out a role of NKG2D on T cells at this time, we also included groups of mice that were T cell&#x02013;depleted or NKG2D-blocked and T cell&#x02013;depleted. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040030-g004">Figure 4</xref>B, NKG2D-blocked and T cell&#x02013;depleted &#x0002b; NKG2D-blocked mice had virus titers that were comparable to those of NK cell&#x02013;depleted mice and that were significantly higher than those of mice that were only T cell&#x02013;depleted. Together, these data indicate that NKG2D is involved in the NK cell&#x02013;mediated resistant to mousepox.</p><p>We next tested whether NKG2D blockade and DAP10- or DAP12-deficiency affected the recruitment of NK cells to D-LN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040030-g004">Figure 4</xref>C, upper panels) or their ability to produce IFN-&#x003b3; and GzB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040030-g004">Figure 4</xref>C, lower panels). However, we found that none of these parameters were decreased. In fact, in both DAP10- and DAP12-deficient mice more NK cells were recruited to the D-LN and a larger proportion produced IFN-&#x003b3; and GzB as compared with wild-type B6 mice. This indicates that NKG2D is required for effective NK cell&#x02013;mediated control of ECTV, but is not required for their activation.</p><p>Because NK cell recruitment and activation in the D-LN was not diminished by NKG2D blockade or DAP12 and DAP10 deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040030-g004">Figure 4</xref>C), we hypothesized that NKG2D may be required for optimal NK cell&#x02013;mediated cytotoxicity. Thus, we examined whether NK cells from NKG2D-blocked mice were defective in their ability to kill various targets. For this purpose, mice were infected with ECTV and treated or not with anti-NKG2D Ab. Five days later, NK cells were purified from their spleens and immediately analyzed by flow cytometry to confirm NKG2D receptor blockade or downregulation in the CX5-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040030-g004">Figure 4</xref>D) and were used as effectors in 4-h <sup>51</sup>Cr release assays. Because we were unable to show specific killing of ECTV-infected cells in vitro, we tested the purified NK cells against a variety of uninfected targets that constitutively express NKG2D ligands at their cell surface (MC57G, MEF, and YAC-1) or, as a control, CHO-K1 whose killing is dependent on Ly49D &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040030-b043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040030-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;, but not NKG2D. We found that the NK cells from mice infected with ECTV (whether treated with anti-NKG2D Ab or not) killed all targets much more effectively than those from uninfected mice. This enhanced killing did not require the targets to be infected. However, the NK cells from mice treated with CX5 were less effective killers of NKG2D ligand-bearing target cells as compared to those from untreated mice, except against CHO-K1 cells for which the NK cell killing is dependent on Ly49D and not on NKG2D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040030-g004">Figure 4</xref>E). Furthermore, purified NK cells from ECTV-infected intact mice also demonstrated reduced, but not absent cytotoxicity when anti-NKG2D mAb was added to the assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040030-g004">Figure 4</xref>F). Thus, ECTV infection enhances spontaneous NK cell&#x02013;mediated cytotoxicity, which is partially reduced by NKG2D blockade. Together, these data suggest that NKG2D signaling is not required for the recruitment and activation of NK cells during ECTV infection, but contributes to their optimal ability to kill targets expressing NKG2D ligands. Because anti-NKG2D did not reduce cytotoxicity to the same levels as those in uninfected mice, the data also indicate that activating receptors other than NKG2D are involved in the cytotoxicity induced by ECTV infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>ECTV Infection Upregulates NKG2D Ligands In Vitro and In Vivo</title><p>NKG2D-mediated killing requires the recognition of ligands on the surface of target cells.

Consistent with the ability of ECTV-activated NK cells to spontaneously kill them, MEFs constitutively express NKG2D ligands as revealed by staining with mouse NKG2D-Fc fusion protein &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040030-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0040030-g005">Figure 5</xref>A).

More importantly, we define several of the mechanisms whereby NK cells afford this resistance.</p><p>To determine whether and when NK cells are required for resistance to mousepox we depleted mice of NK cells with either anti-asialo GM1 or anti-NK1.1 Abs at different times PI. Although separately these two approaches have caveats, together they provide conclusive evidence that the presence of NK cells during the first 4 d PI, but not beyond day 5 PI, is essential for resistance to mousepox. First, even though anti-NK1.1 Ab depletes NKT cells, the loss of mousepox resistance upon Ab treatment cannot be due to the elimination of NKT cells because anti-asialo GM1 Ab does not eliminate this population &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040030-b051">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040030-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, Parker et al<italic>.</italic> recently demonstrated that NKT cells are dispensable for resistance to mousepox because ECTV infection of mice deficient in NKT cells (i.e., CD1d- and V&#x003b1;14J&#x003b1;281 TCR-deficient mice) did not result in symptoms of mousepox or an increase in virus titers when compared to wild-type B6 mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040030-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. Second, although anti-asialo GM1 can eliminate some activated T cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040030-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d;, the loss of resistance cannot be attributed to T cell depletion because asialo GM1 is not expressed on virus-specific T cells within the first few days after viral infection. Moreover, we show that anti-NK1.1 and -asialo GM1 Abs do not affect resistance when given on day 6 PI (the peak of the T cell response). Furthermore, treatment with anti-NK1.1, but not depletion of T cells one day before infection, resulted in significantly increased virus titers on day 3 PI. In addition, treatment with anti-asialo GM1 Ab accelerated ECTV lethality in RAG-1-deficient mice, which lack adaptive immunity (data not shown). &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cell&#x02013;deficient mice are also resistant to mousepox &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040030-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;, indicating that the possible depletion of some &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells by anti-asialo GM1 Ab cannot account for the dramatic increase in ECTV lethality after treatment with this Ab. Although work in other laboratories has already shown that depletion of NK cells with either anti-NK1.1 or asialo-GM1 results in susceptibility to mousepox &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040030-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040030-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040030-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;, depletion at different times PI has not been described previously. Sequential depletion of NK cells allowed us to establish that the presence of NK cells is required only during the very early stages of infection. This is consistent with the concept that NK cells serve as the first line of defense after infection, thereby providing sufficient time to mount a full-fledged T and B cell response. We also established, however, that the contribution of NK cells to mousepox resistance extends beyond the need for their physical presence to kill virus-infected cells early after infection because NK cell depletion before day 4 PI resulted in higher virus titers and death after this time. This is most likely due to the role of NK cells in allowing a potent antiviral T cell response to develop, as discussed below.</p><p>We also followed the kinetics of NK proliferation and activation in spleen, liver, and D-LN of ECTV-infected mice. Interestingly, although we detected some proliferation, we did not find activated NK cells in liver and spleen on day 3 PI. This was despite the fact that NK cell&#x02013;mediated control of virus loads in spleen and liver already occurred at this time PI. In fact, the peak of NK cell activation in spleen and liver took place on day 5 PI. On the other hand, the proportion of total NK cells, as well as the proportion of activated NK cells in the D-LN, peaked as early as day 2 PI, and these parameters were still substantially elevated on day 3 PI, notwithstanding that the proliferation of NK cells at these times was not yet detectable in D-LN. In addition, we found that the increase in NK cell numbers in the D-LN on day 2 PI was mostly due to an increase in mature NK cells and that these mature NK cells were preferentially activated. Together, these data suggest that the prompt NK cell response in the D-LN is responsible for the early control of virus loads in central organs and that this response is mostly due to the recruitment and activation of mature NK cells rather than their expansion. To spread to central organs from the footpad, ECTV must pass through the D-LN &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040030-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040030-b054">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040030-b056">56</xref>&#x0005d;. Recently, we have shown that in mousepox-susceptible BALB/c mice, memory CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells protect from mousepox, at least in part, by curbing the spread of ECTV from the D-LN to central organs and allowing for the establishment of a full-fledged adaptive response &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040030-b054">54</xref>&#x0005d;. Our results here suggest that NK cells may use the same strategy, furthering a model where LNs are not only sites where lymphocytes are primed and proliferate but also the place where a major fight against virus spread takes place &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040030-b054">54</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In addition to NK cells, strong adaptive T cell responses are essential for resistance to mousepox. Our experiments here show that NK cells have a direct role in controlling ECTV because they reduced virus loads on day 3 PI when the T cell response is still undetectable (data not shown and &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040030-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;). However, if the only role of NK cells were direct, one would expect mice depleted of NK cells to become sick, but recover once the adaptive immune system takes control. Yet, while the presence of NK cells on day 6 PI was not required for resistance to mousepox, their presence before day 6 PI was vital for controlling virus titers and preventing pathology and death after this time. This could be explained by the finding that depletion of NK cells on the day of infection resulted in a substantially reduced T cell response. There are three non-excluding possibilities that may explain this effect. First, NK cell production of cytokines such as IFN-&#x003b3; may directly modulate the adaptive T cell response &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040030-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. A caveat to this hypothesis is that NK cells produce as much or more IFN-&#x003b3; in ECTV-infected mousepox-susceptible BALB/c and DBA2/J mice as in resistant B6 mice (unpublished data), but these susceptible mice fail to mount an effective T cell response to ECTV. Second, NK cells may indirectly affect the activation of T cells through their interaction with antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells (DC). This hypothesis has the same caveats as the one above. Third, it is possible that in the absence of NK cells, the uncontrolled virus replication of a highly pathogenic virus overwhelms the T cell response. In support of this possibility, infection of mousepox-susceptible BALB/c mice with a highly attenuated strain of ECTV results in the induction of a strong T cell response (unpublished data), and depletion of NK cells does not affect the T cell response to the poorly pathogenic vaccinia virus (unpublished data) with which ECTV shares most of the dominant CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell epitopes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040030-b057">57</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Previous work by Delano and Brownstein showed that <italic>Rmp1</italic>, a gene important for resistance to mousepox, maps to the NK complex in distal chromosome 6 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040030-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. Moreover, they proposed that <italic>Rmp1</italic> encoded NK1.1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040030-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. However, we found that NK1.1 is not required for resistance to mousepox. In addition, our work suggests that the activating receptors Ly49D and Ly49H are likely not involved. On the other hand, using in vivo signaling blockade we found that NKG2D is involved in resistance to mousepox and that ECTV infection results in the upregulation of NKG2D ligands in vivo and in vitro. That NKG2D is involved in antiviral responses has precedents. For example, previous studies have shown that cytomegalovirus (CMV) induces the upregulation of NKG2D ligands and that mouse and human CMV encode immune evasion molecules that downregulate NKG2D ligands and are important for their pathogenesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040030-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. However, a direct role for NKG2D in the response to poxviruses has not been described previously. Interestingly, Campbell et al<italic>.</italic> have recently shown that cowpox virus encodes a soluble competitive antagonist of NKG2D &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040030-b058">58</xref>&#x0005d;. Although this gene has been lost in other OPVs, such as ECTV, VACV, VARV, and MPXV, these data support our finding that NKG2D is involved in resistance to some OPV infections. On the other hand, NKp30, NKp44, and NKp46, but not NKG2D, were found to be responsible for the recognition of VACV-infected cells by human NK cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0040030-b059">59</xref>&#x0005d;. Whether this reflects differences between NK cell recognition of different OPVs, differences between human versus mouse NK cells, or both, will require further investigation.</p><p>Because mouse NKG2D signals through either the adapter protein DAP12 or DAP10, we further tested the susceptibility of mice lacking one or the other adapter. Of interest, when considering virus titers and spleen cellularity, the susceptibility of these two strains of mice was intermediate between intact and NKG2D mAb&#x02013;blocked B6 mice. This indicates that for resistance to mousepox, the two adapters likely have overlapping, but not completely redundant, effects. Still, DAP12 seems to be the preferred adapter because DAP12-deficient mice were more susceptible to mousepox than DAP10-deficient mice, although it is possible that other DAP12-associated receptors might contribute to resistance to mousepox. Our results predict that DAP10 &#x0002b; DAP12 double-deficient mice would be highly susceptible to mousepox. Unfortunately, these mice are not yet available.</p><p>NKG2D is expressed by most NK cells but also by activated CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. In fact, we have observed that in ECTV-infected B6 mice a large proportion of virus-specific CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells express NKG2D beginning 7 d PI (unpublished data). Thus, the experiments reported here do not rule out the additional contribution of NKG2D in the T cell&#x02013;mediated resistance to mousepox, a very interesting possibility that we are currently investigating. Nevertheless, our experiments clearly implicate NKG2D in the NK cell&#x02013;mediated response to ECTV because in vivo NKG2D blockade resulted in enhanced virus loads in central organs before the onset of the T cell response and because in vivo NKG2D blockade reduced the cytotoxicity of ECTV-activated NK cells. Still, several lines of evidence indicate that NKG2D is not the only activating receptor involved in the anti-ECTV NK cell&#x02013;mediated response and that its most likely role is as a co-stimulator that facilitates cytotoxicity rather than being required for the initial NK cell activation: (1) NK cell depletion was much more effective than NKG2D blockade at rendering B6 mice susceptible to mousepox; (2) NKG2D-blockade did not affect NK cell proliferation (data not shown), IFN-&#x003b3; and GzB production by NK cells, or recruitment of NK cells into the D-LN of ECTV-infected mice; (3) In vivo and in vitro NKG2D blockade significantly decreased, but did not abrogate, the cytotoxicity of ECTV-activated NK cells. Ongoing studies in our laboratory are aimed at identifying other activating receptor(s) and signaling pathway(s) required for NK cell&#x02013;mediated resistance to mousepox.</p><p>In summary, our work demonstrates that NK cells contribute to the natural resistance of B6 mice to mousepox by using direct effector functions (most likely the killing of infected cells) to curb virus dissemination and by supporting a strong adaptive T cell response. Moreover, our data suggest that the activating receptor NKG2D, but not NK1.1 or Ly49 family members, has a role in this NK cell&#x02013;mediated resistance to mousepox by promoting optimal NK cell&#x02013;mediated killing. Thus, our data provide substantial insights into the mechanisms of natural resistance to ECTV and possibly other OPV infections. Together, our work furthers our understanding of host-pathogen interactions and the mechanisms whereby NK cells protect from viral disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cells.</title><p>YAC-1 and CHO-K1 cell lines were obtained from Dr. Kerry Campbell (Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), and A9, MC57G, and BSC-1 cells were obtained from the ATCC.
