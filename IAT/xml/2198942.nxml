We created a fluorescent protein-fragment complementation assay (PCA) to detect the interaction between Cdc28 and Swi4, which leads to the inactivation of SBF. The PCA signal was quantified by microscopy and image analysis in deletion strains corresponding to 25 candidate genes that are periodically expressed during the cell cycle and are substrates of Cdc28.

Genetic and proteomic methodologies are commonly applied in the model organism <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> to decode genomic sequence information into a meaningful understanding of protein function. For example, genetic screening methods including synthetic genetic array analysis, diploid synthetic lethality analysis by microarray, and epistatic miniarray profiles, imply functional links between proteins by identifying pairs of mutations in non-allelic genes that cause aggravating or alleviating effects on growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001500-Collins1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001500-Schuldiner1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001500-Pan1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001500-Tong1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the ability to demonstrate interactions between two genes is restricted to those that result in a measurable change in phenotype, such as fitness.</p><p>To maximize the knowledge that can be obtained from large-scale genomic and proteomic experiments, focus is now being placed on systems biology approaches in which datasets are combined to learn more information than can be gathered from any one dataset alone. Recently, combining genetic interactions with protein-protein interaction (PPI) data has been shown to generate valuable insight into relationships between protein complexes and genetically defined epistasis groups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001500-Collins1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, functional protein complex dynamics have been inferred from comparison of PPI data with gene expression co-variation for intrinsically dynamic processes, including replicative and respiratory cell cycles where timing of protein complex assembly and gene expression are assumed to be tightly linked <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001500-deLichtenberg1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001500-Murray1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. In these efforts, PPI data are used as a tool of inference, whereas here we show how dynamic PPIs can be used as direct and general sensors of the activity of any cellular pathway to provide mechanistic insights into the roles of proteins in a cellular process.</p><p>We present a novel screening strategy in which genetics and proteomics are incorporated to detect <underline>ge</underline>netic <underline>p</underline>erturbations of <underline>p</underline>rotein <underline>i</underline>nteractions (GePPI) in order to assign function to previously uncharacterized or characterized proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001500-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The principle is that if a protein encoded by a candidate gene plays a role in a biological pathway of interest, deletion of the gene will result in perturbation of a sentinel PPI within the pathway. The protein can be implicated in any step in the pathway upstream of the interaction measured, wherein the change propagates through the pathway resulting in a perturbation of the PPI. Alternatively, a protein can be involved in a downstream positive or negative feedback event that regulates the sentinel PPI. The sentinel PPI is detected using protein-fragment complementation assays (PCA) (Reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001500-Michnick1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>), and perturbations are measured by fluorescence microscopy and image analysis of the PCA in selected yeast deletion strains. We previously showed that fluorescent PCAs can detect spatial and/or temporal perturbations of PPIs <italic>in vivo</italic> in mammalian cells, following addition of drugs, siRNAs, or hormones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001500-Remy1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001500-Remy2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001500-Remy3">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001500-MacDonald1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001500-Michnick2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Perturbations of the sentinel PPI could be due to a number of different processes including, removal of a mediator or inhibitor of the interaction, changes in the rate of protein synthesis or degradation, changes in protein localization, or post-translational modifications.</p><fig id="pone-0001500-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001500.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>The GePPI screening strategy to identify proteins involved in the inactivation of SBF via phosphorylation by Clb/Cdc28.</title><p>(A) A schematic representation of the GePPI screening strategy. 1) A biological pathway of interest is selected and a PCA assay is created that detects one or more sentinel PPIs of this pathway in wild-type yeast. In this example, protein A activates the sentinel interaction between proteins B and C, whereas protein D inhibits the interaction via a negative feedback loop. 2) Candidate genes are selected and plasmids encoding the PCA fusion proteins for each assay are transformed into the corresponding deletion strains. 3) Transformed deletion strains are screened in 96-well plates by fluorescence microscopy and images are collected and processed using image analysis software. 4) Strains are selected for which the PCA signal is significantly decreased or increased, as this type of analysis can be easily automated for yeast without the use of counter-stains that are required to identify changes in sub-cellular localization. In this example, deletion of protein A results in a decrease in the PCA signal, whereas deletion of protein D results in an increase in signal. (B) Regulation of SBF and MBF throughout the cell cycle. Activation of SBF involves phosphorylation of the SBF-associated repressor Whi5 by Cln/Cdc28 during G1. Phosphorylation of Whi5 leads to its dissociation from SBF followed by nuclear export. Inactivation of SBF in G2/M involves phosphorylation of Swi4 by Clb/Cdc28 activity. Regulation of MBF is less well understood but phosphorylation of Swi6 by Clb6/Cdc28 followed by Swi6 nuclear export may be a mechanism of inactivation of both SBF and MBF. The sentinel interaction between Cdc28 and Swi4 is indicated by dashed box.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0001500.g001"/></fig><p>To illustrate feasibility of the GePPI screen, we applied it to the discovery of mechanisms underlying regulation of the yeast cell cycle. A key aspect of this regulation involves proper timing of activation and inactivation of transcription factors by the cyclin dependent kinase, Cdc28. Cdc28 is activated by three G1-specific cyclins, Cln1-3 and six mitotic B-type cyclins, Clb1-6. Two heterodimeric transcription factors, SBF and MBF activate G1/S-phase gene expression and each contains a common transactivation protein, Swi6 and a unique DNA binding protein, Swi4 and Mbp1 respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001500-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). SBF is activated in G1 by Cln/Cdc28 indirectly via phosphorylation of the SBF repressor Whi5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001500-Costanzo1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. SBF is later inactivated at the G2/M transition by Clb/Cdc28-dependent phosphorylation of Swi4 and Clb1 and Clb2 are the principle cyclins responsible for this inactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001500-Amon1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001500-Siegmund1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001500-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Similar mechanisms governing regulation of MBF have not been elucidated; however, phosphorylation of Swi6 by Clb6/Cdc28 leads to nuclear export during M-phase and may contribute to inactivation of both transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001500-Geymonat1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The interaction between Cdc28 and Swi4 was chosen as the sentinel PPI in our GePPI screen since it represents the cell cycle regulated event of SBF inactivation. We screened the Cdc28-Swi4 PCA in 25 candidate deletion strains and showed that the serine/threonine kinase Elm1 is important in the inactivation of SBF. In addition, we present data that suggest that phosphorylation of Elm1 by Cdc28 is an important negative feedback event leading to degradation of Elm1 upon completion of mitosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>In order to detect and localize PPIs in yeast, we adapted the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein &#x02018;Venus&#x02019; PCA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001500-MacDonald1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001500-Michnick2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> for use in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.

These PCAs were included as controls in the GePPI screen based on the assumption that a perturbation specific to the interaction between Clb/Cdc28 and Swi4 may or may not result in a similar perturbation of the Cdc28-Swi6 PCA since Swi4 and Swi6 form a complex. In contrast, the Cdc28-Mbp1 PCA should not be perturbed since Clb1-4 are not required for suppression of MBF activity and Mbp1 does not co-immunoprecipitate with Clb2, suggesting MBF is inactivated through an alternate mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001500-Amon1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001500-Siegmund1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0001500-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001500.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Interactions between Cdc28 and the components of SBF and MBF.</title><p>Representative images of wild-type yeast transformed with the Cdc28-Swi4, Cdc28-Swi6 and Cdc28-Mbp1 yeast enhanced monomeric Venus (yEmVenus) PCAs.

We compared a list of 412 genes that are periodically expressed during the cell cycle with no PPI of significant reliability according to de Lichtenberg <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001500-deLichtenberg1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> to a list of 181 Cdc28 substrates identified <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001500-Ubersax1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Our rationale was that one or more of these genes may function upstream of the inactivation of SBF by Clb/Cdc28, and may, via phosphorylation by Cdc28 mediate positive or negative feedback regulation of Cdc28 activity. Merging of the two datasets generated a list of 25 non-essential proteins for which the deletion strain was available, to which we added the three components of SBF and MBF: Swi4, Swi6, and Mbp1; as well as the principle cyclins involved in activation and inactivation of SBF, Cln3 and Clb2 respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001500.s004">Table S1</xref>).</p><p>The Cdc28-Swi4 sentinel PCA, as well as the Cdc28-Swi6 and Cdc28-Mbp1 PCAs were transformed into wild-type yeast and the 30 deletion strains.

This observation suggests that the mutation may cause a mild delay in G1, consistent with the increased doubling time and profile of DNA replication observed for <italic>elm1T551A</italic>. We hypothesized that phosphorylation of Elm1 by Cdc28 at threonine-551 is a signal for Elm1 degradation at the end of mitosis and in the absence of this phosphorylation signal, Elm1 levels and in turn Clb/Cdc28 activity persist, thereby inhibiting progression through the restriction point in G1. To test this hypothesis we attempted to measure the levels of the wild-type and mutant forms of Elm1 protein, but were unable to detect the proteins using an anti-Elm1 antibody.

However, the authors were able to detect an Elm1 fusion protein that was tagged with GST at its N-terminus, leading them to speculate that Elm1 normally has a short half-life and that the GST tag interfered with recognition of a PEST motif found at residues 24&#x02013;50, which is proposed to serve as a signal for rapid intracellular proteolysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001500-Koehler1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, we were able to detect Elm1-GFP and elm1T551A-GFP with an anti-GFP antibody in synchronized cells. We showed that Elm1-GFP was present at low levels after release from arrest in G1, and then increased steadily throughout the cell cycle. In contrast, elm1T551A-GFP was observed in the highest amount at the first time point after release from G1 arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001500-g006">Figure 6A</xref>).

In contrast to large-scale screens that aim to test every gene or protein in an organism, performing a small-scale screen by selecting candidate genes based on prior knowledge can greatly increase the efficiency and reduce the cost of the screening process.</p><p>We used the GePPI screen to provide new insights into the regulation of an important cell cycle regulated event.

The choice of PCAs to use in such screens will be dictated by the problem being studied and specific advantages or disadvantages of the different PCAs. For instance, the PCAs based on green fluorescent protein variants reported here are useful in that they can capture qualitative perturbations such as changes in cellular locations of complexes in a gene-deleted strain. The fact that these assays are irreversible, and are therefore kinetic traps of protein complexes, means that they can capture transiently formed complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001500-MacDonald1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001500-Magliery1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. However, in some instances (but not many), trapping complexes by the folded PCA reporter protein could prevent detection, particularly of disruption of interactions. Trapping is not a general problem with PCAs and in particular, we have demonstrated that new classes of PCAs based on luciferases are completely reversible; that is, dissociation of protein complexes leads equally to unfolding and physical separation of the complementary reporter protein fragments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001500-Remy4">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001500-Stefan1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Individual PCAs combined with the availability of the deletion strain collection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001500-Winzeler1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> and titratable promoter alleles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001500-Mnaimneh1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> or hypomorphic alleles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001500-Schuldiner1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> to study essential genes in yeast means that GePPI could be applied to any cellular pathway for which a sentinel PPI reports on the state of the pathway in order to provide testable mechanistic hypotheses into the function of genes.
