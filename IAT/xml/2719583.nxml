Factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and the angiopoietins are well-established promoters of angiogenesis. However, the molecular regulation of tumour angiogenesis remains to be fully elucidated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>One potential pro-angiogenic factor is osteoprotegerin (OPG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. OPG is a secreted glycoprotein belonging to the tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily, initially identified for its role in regulating bone turnover through the binding and neutralisation of receptor activator of NF&#x003ba;B ligand (RANKL). Subsequently OPG has been found to have additional roles within the immune and vascular systems, as well as promoting tumourigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Observations that OPG deficient mice exhibit vascular calcification provided initial evidence that OPG could have a role in the vascular system and further <italic>in vivo </italic>studies have demonstrated the involvement of OPG in vascular complications, including atherosclerotic plaque calcification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. These findings have been supported clinically, with both OPG polymorphisms and increased serum levels being associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Additionally, OPG has been associated with other vascular complications, including ischaemic stroke and pulmonary arterial hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. With reference to <italic>in vitro </italic>studies OPG has been found to increase endothelial cell survival, proliferation and migration, as well as induce endothelial cell tube formation in an <italic>in vitro </italic>matrigel model of angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Recently, &#x003b1;<sub>&#x003bd; </sub>integrin has been found to be involved in OPG-induced endothelial cell migration and proliferation, however mechanisms for other potential pro-angiogenic effects such as OPG-stimulated tube formation remain to be established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Clinical studies have shown endothelial cells within a number of tumour types to express high levels of OPG compared with those in normal tissues, and in breast cancer this expression was found to correlate with tumour grade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic>, endothelial cells have been found to secrete OPG capable of inhibiting tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis of breast cancer cells, indicating endothelial-derived OPG to be functionally active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Other studies have demonstrated the ability of OPG to inhibit TRAIL-induced apoptosis of a variety of cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that OPG can promote tumourigenesis both directly, via pro-survival actions on tumour cells and also indirectly, through the stimulation of angiogenesis. Previous studies have found endothelial cell OPG levels to be up-regulated in response to pro-inflammatory factors including IL-1&#x003b1; and TNF&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, processes involved in regulating endothelial OPG levels in the tumour microenvironment are currently unknown.</p><p>Therefore, this study aims to address two key points. Firstly, to elucidate the mechanisms behind the pro-angiogenic effects of OPG and secondly, to establish whether this is relevant in the tumour microenvironment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Effect of VEGF in combination with OPG on endothelial cell tube formation</title><p>It has previously been shown that OPG can induce endothelial cell tube formation on growth factor reduced matrigel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. However, in the tumour microenvironment it is possible that OPG also enhances vessel formation induced by other pro-angiogenic factors such as VEGF. Therefore, to further elucidate how OPG may affect tube formation, endothelial cells were treated with a combination of OPG and VEGF to establish whether the two have a synergistic effect on tube formation <italic>in vitro</italic>. As demonstrated in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, OPG or VEGF when administered alone significantly increased tube formation, almost doubling the number of branch points (<italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001). When OPG and VEGF were added together, tube formation was significantly increased by 20% compared to VEGF alone (<italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001) and 26% compared to OPG alone (<italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001). This suggests that within the tumour microenvironment OPG is able to act in concert with other pro-angiogenic factors such as VEGF to further enhance angiogenesis and additionally, that OPG and VEGF act via different pathways to induce endothelial cell tube formation.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of VEGF in combination with OPG on endothelial cell tube formation</bold>.

To assess the ability of pro-angiogenic factors to affect the levels of endothelial OPG production, HuDMECs were treated for 24 hours with VEGF (1&#x02013;25 ng/ml), TGF&#x003b2; (5&#x02013;10 ng/ml) or FGF (10&#x02013;25 ng/ml), as well as the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF&#x003b1; (1&#x02013;50 ng/ml), which has previously been shown to stimulate endothelial OPG production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Levels of gene expression were then determined using real-time PCR and OPG secretion assessed using ELISA.

Since clinical studies have demonstrated increased OPG expression in breast tumour endothelial cells, HuDMECs were co-cultured with the T47D breast cancer cell line, which did not produce detectable levels of OPG (data not shown). These co-cultures were established at HuDMEC: T47D ratios of 2:1, 4:1 and 10:1. Following a 72-hour incubation period, HuDMECs were separated from the T47D cells using CD31 Dynabeads and OPG gene expression assessed in each cell type. As demonstrated in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4(a)</xref>, tumour cell contact significantly increased OPG gene expression levels compared to HuDMECs cultured alone. This was particularly noticeable at a 2:1 HuDMEC: T47D ratio, where OPG levels were increased 3-fold (<italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001). This was specific to HuDMECs as OPG gene expression was not detectable in the T47D cells following co-culture. The elevated levels of OPG expression were accompanied by increased HuDMEC OPG secretion. This increase was significant in co-cultures with a 2:1 HuDMEC: T47D ratio (100 pg/1000 cells) compared to HuDMECs cultured alone (42 pg/1000 cells) (<italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4(b)</xref>).

This additive effect does not appear to be exclusive to OPG, since other studies have demonstrated similar observations in endothelial cells treated with a combination of VEGF and bFGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Therefore, these results suggest that within the tumour microenvironment, where a variety of pro-angiogenic factors are likely to be present, these can act in concert to promote tumour angiogenesis. Additionally, our results show that OPG is unlikely to induce endothelial cell tube formation via the same mechanism as VEGF. Investigating this further, we found that neutralisation of the VEGF receptor VEGFR2 had no effect on OPG-mediated endothelial cell tube formation, whilst significantly inhibiting that of VEGF. Although VEGF is able to exert its effects through a number of receptors, our results combined suggest it is probable that OPG acts via an alternative mechanism.</p><p>One possible mechanism could be via the interaction of OPG with heparan sulphate proteoglycans of the syndecan family, which have previously been reported to be involved in OPG-mediated monocyte chemotaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Additionally, the observation that the syndecan binding peptide AG73 can induce endothelial cell tube formation suggests the involvement of syndecans in this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In our study recombinant Fc-conjugated OPG was used, the heparin binding ability of which is suggested to be compromised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. However, other studies have shown both OPG and OPG-Fc to bind to cells in an apparently heparan sulphate-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Therefore the potential involvement of the syndecans in OPG-mediated endothelial cell tube formation cannot be completely dismissed. OPG has previously been observed to bind to the anti-angiogenic protein thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. TSP-1 is released by endothelial cells and inhibition of TSP-1 activity using blocking antibodies promotes endothelial cell tube formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Therefore, another consideration could be that OPG binds to and inhibits TSP-1 activity, resulting in an increase in endothelial cell tube formation. Additionally, it would be of interest to assess the role of the integrins in this process, given recent evidence of their role in OPG-mediated endothelial cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>We have also demonstrated that tumour cell contact, but not the pro-angiogenic factors VEGF, bFGF or TGF&#x003b2;, enhance OPG production in microvascular endothelial cells. In agreement with previously published studies, we found that the proinflammatory cytokine TNF&#x003b1; increased HuDMEC OPG levels, supporting that the cells used in this study retained the responsiveness to cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The role of TGF&#x003b2; in regulating OPG levels has been studied in other cell types, but the effects appear to depend on the cell type used. Whilst TGF&#x003b2; can increase OPG production in osteoblasts and bone marrow stromal cells, levels have been found to be decreased in human vascular smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. This suggests along with our findings, that with regards to vascular cells, the role of TGF&#x003b2; in increasing OPG levels is negligible, at least <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>Although VEGF has previously been found to increase OPG production in endothelial cells in combination with TNF&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], no study until now has assessed the effects of VEGF alone. Our findings demonstrate that VEGF administered alone has no effect on endothelial cell OPG production. Tumours often exhibit an inflammatory component and it may be possible under those conditions that VEGF could act in conjunction with TNF&#x003b1; to augment OPG levels. However, in studies demonstrating increased endothelial cell OPG expression in breast cancer tissues, no notable inflammation was observed, suggesting alternative mechanisms exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Another way in which endothelial cell OPG expression may be enhanced within the tumour microenvironment is through direct tumour cell contact. This is the first study to demonstrate that contact between breast cancer cells and endothelial cells results in increased gene and protein levels of endothelial OPG, a process that appears to depend on integrin &#x003b1;<sub>&#x003bd;</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>ligation and activation of the transcription factor NF&#x003ba;B. Interestingly, inhibition of NF&#x003ba;B and integrin &#x003b1;<sub>&#x003bd;</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>did not induce tumour cell contact mediated increases in OPG gene expression in HuDMEC, indicating their involvement at the post transcriptional level, possibly by affecting mechanisms involved in mediating OPG secretion. Observations that tumour cell conditioned medium had no effect on endothelial cell OPG levels suggests this process requires direct tumour cell contact. However, it cannot be ruled out that contact between tumour and endothelial cells results in the secretion of as yet unidentified factors from tumour cells that are capable of inducing endothelial cell OPG production. One potential candidate is the secreted glycoprotein and integrin &#x003b1;<sub>&#x003bd;</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>ligand osteopontin, which has previously been observed to increase endothelial OPG levels in an NF&#x003ba;B dependent manner following integrin &#x003b1;<sub>&#x003bd;</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Interestingly, osteopontin expression has been found to be increased in prostate cancer cells following their direct cell contact with bone marrow stromal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Therefore it is feasible to consider that osteopontin could be increased in other tumour-derived cell lines following direct cell contact.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>To conclude, this study has demonstrated that the VEGF signalling pathway is not involved in mediating the pro-angiogenic effects of OPG on endothelial cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, thus narrowing the search for the mechanism by which these processes occur. Secondly, this is the first study to show that endothelial cell OPG is increased following direct contact with breast tumour cells via a mechanism that depends partly on integrin &#x003b1;<sub>&#x003bd;</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>ligation and NF&#x003ba;B activation. Therefore, observed increases of endothelial OPG in malignant tissue, particularly that of breast cancer, could be a result of direct interactions between tumour and endothelial cells within the tumour microenvironment. Our data support a potential role for endothelial cell-derived OPG in tumour angiogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HuDMECs) were extracted from excess tissue, with the patients' informed consent, following routine breast surgery (kindly provided by Professor M.
