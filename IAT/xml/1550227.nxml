It is arguably the most important congenital defect of commercial piglets and causes significant economic loss to pig farmers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The prevalence of PCS can range from less than 1% in most farms to over 8% in some establishments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>PCS can be found at or a few hours after birth in up to 2 to 3 piglets in an affected litter. Arising from long periods of recumbency, abrasions and ulceration may develop, which could predispose the affected individual to secondary arthritis, pododermatitis, and osteomyelitis of the digits. Mortality rate can reach 50% due to starvation or crushing by the sow. Affected piglets can recover after a week if supportive treatment is provided. PCS is prevalent in Landrace, Large White breed, and in other heavily muscular breeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Male and female piglets appear susceptible to PCS in similar proportion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. There are, however, conflicting reports on the association of PCS with litter size or birth weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>PCS appears to be a multifactorial condition of unknown aetiology. The predisposing factors are thought to include genetics and environmental factors, such like nutrition, management, pharmacological administration, and mycotoxins. Pregnant sows treated with glucocorticoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and experimentally fed <italic>Fusarium </italic>(F-2) toxin (zearalenone) contaminated grain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] showed higher incidence of PCS. However, histological changes in glucocorticoid induced or mycotoxin-induced PCS are distinct from naturally occurring PCS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The role of dietary choline appears unimportant in the prevention of PCS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Administration of pyrimethamine, an antibiotic often used in combination with a sulphonamide, to pregnant Goettingen minipigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and of prostaglandins to induce parturition in late pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] have been reported to lead to higher incidence of PCS.</p><p>A range of pathological lesions has been described for PCS, the most common feature being the presence of myofibrillar hypoplasia, often interpreted as an immaturity of the muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Myofibrillar hypoplasia ranges from a slight reduction of myofibrillar content to severe myofibrillar deficiency, with vacuolation, focal degeneration and necrosis. However, myofibrillar hypoplasia is not exclusive to PCS as the condition is also found in clinically normal piglets. The descriptive finding of myofibrillar hypoplasia is therefore not be diagnostic of PCS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, subjective microscopic and ultrastructural muscle examination had found no significant qualitative changes between normal and PCS piglets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Presently, there is a lack of objective morphological information available on PCS muscles. The term hypoplasia refers to underdevelopment of a tissue or organ that results in a decrease in cell number. Atrophy refers to a decrease in the size of a tissue or organ caused by disease or disuse. It is not certain if clinical PCS is related to a reduction of fibre size (atrophy), number (hypoplasia) or both. Additionally, no histochemical, biochemical, or molecular changes have been reported that are characteristic of PCS. Therefore, there is a need to better define the histopathological, biochemical and molecular changes that take place in muscles of PCS. The development of objective cellular and molecular parameters to assess clinical PCS could add valuable information to our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease. With recent advances in imaging technology and quantitative PCR, morphological analysis and relative muscle gene expression can now be conducted with greater precision. We describe here the histopathological and molecular characterisation of PCS. We found that PCS piglets had smaller fibre size and higher fibre density in the <italic>semitendinosus </italic>(ST), <italic>longissimus dorsi </italic>(LD) and <italic>gastrocnemius </italic>(G) muscles. <italic>Muscle Atrophy F-box </italic>(<italic>MAFbx</italic>), a marker of muscle atrophy, was more highly expressed in all PCS muscles. Conversely, expression of <italic>P311</italic>, a novel 8 kDa protein with a conserved PEST domain, was down-regulated in all PCS muscles tested.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Muscle fibre atrophy in PCS muscles</title><p>Morphological and fibre type analyses were conducted on 4 sets of muscles from 4 separate litters of pigs (3 muscles per pig: ST, LD and G); each set comprised one 2-day-old affected PCS piglet and a normal litter mate. Histological examination of all PCS muscles showed no evidence of significant inflammatory change (data not shown). The average fibre cross-sectional area of affected PCS piglets was consistently smaller than their normal counterparts in all 3 muscles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Consequently, fibre density (fibre number per unit area) from affected individuals was higher in the 3 muscles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). PCS piglets showed higher distribution of fibre number in the smaller fibre range than normal piglets (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The contrast in fibre size distribution was particularly evident in the ST and LD of PCS piglets, which showed a narrow and steep distribution pattern of smaller fibres (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Hence fibre atrophy was a feature of PCS muscles. However, based on immunostaining for myosin heavy chain (MYH) slow and MYH fast fibres, no significant difference was found in fibre type composition between normal and affected muscles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Selective reduction of MYH expression in PCS muscles</title><p>To further assess the phenotypic differences between muscles of normal and PCS piglets, TaqMan quantitative real-time PCR was performed on the muscles from the 4 sets of litter mates to determine the relative mRNA expression levels of <italic>MYHembryonic, MYHperinatal, MYHslow</italic>, <italic>MYH2a</italic>, <italic>MYH2x</italic>, <italic>MYH2b </italic>and &#x003b1;-<italic>actin</italic>. PCS piglets showed significantly lower expression of <italic>MYHslow </italic>in LD and G muscles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Expression of <italic>MYH2x </italic>and <italic>MYH2b </italic>in ST muscle was also statistically lower in PCS piglets (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). No significant difference was found between normal and PCS piglets for <italic>MYHembryonic</italic>, <italic>MYHperinatal</italic>, <italic>MYH2a </italic>and &#x003b1; <italic>-actin </italic>(data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Up-regulation of MAFbx and down-regulation of P311 in PCS muscles</title><p>The ubiquitin-proteasome proteolysis pathway is a principal route of muscle atrophy in which MAFbx, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, was found to be consistently up-regulated in a variety of muscle atrophic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Because of the close association of <italic>MAFbx </italic>expression with muscle atrophy, we determined the relative expression of porcine <italic>MAFbx </italic>in normal and PCS muscles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). We found that in almost all muscle samples examined, with the exception of ST muscle in litter 2, <italic>MAFbx </italic>expression was clearly up-regulated in PCS piglets (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Another growth-related gene associated with muscle atrophy, <italic>P311</italic>, is a novel gene reported to be down-regulated in a number of muscle atrophic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] but up-regulated under moderate dietary restriction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In contrast to <italic>MAFbx</italic>, <italic>P311 </italic>expression in PCS muscles was consistently down-regulated in comparison with normal controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). It is worthy to note that the significant differences in <italic>MAFbx </italic>and <italic>P311 </italic>expression between normal and affected muscles of litter 2 were not as great as in the other 3 litters, which might be a reflection of differing gradation of the disease process (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Moreover, the wide variation in expression levels of <italic>MAFbx </italic>and <italic>P311 </italic>between litters, were not entirely surprising. Endogenous gene expression is known to vary widely between individual pigs of the same genetic background and age, reared under identical husbandry conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>As little is known about the normal developmental expression pattern of <italic>MAFbx </italic>and <italic>P311</italic>, we examined their embryonic and muscle foetal expression at different stages of gestation, and their expression in adult muscle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Real-time PCR results showed that <italic>MAFbx </italic>expression remained at basal levels throughout gestation and in adult muscle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). In relation to normal muscles, <italic>MAFbx </italic>expression in PCS LD muscles was significantly elevated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Real-time PCR results showed that <italic>P311 </italic>expression in normal animals increased with gestation and remained raised in newborn and adult muscles. However, the expression of <italic>P311 </italic>in 2-day-old PCS piglets was considerably down-regulated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>P311 over-expression in C2C12 cells by adenovirus infection and stable transfection</title><p>To assess the function of P311 in muscle cells, we over-expressed <italic>P311 </italic>in C2C12 muscle cells by stable transfection as well as by infection with a <italic>P311</italic>-adenovirus construct (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Expression of both constructs could be demonstrated by <italic>P311 </italic>mRNA detection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>), and by P311-FLAG fusion protein detection by immunofluorescence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). Cell cytotoxicity assays that measured metabolic capacity showed no significant difference between infected/transfected cells, and control cells over an extended period of 10 days differentiation, which indicated similar cell viability (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). This finding also indicates that over-expression of <italic>P311 </italic>is not detrimental to C2C12 cells.</p></sec><sec><title>P311 over-expression increased C2C12 cell proliferation and reduced differentiation</title><p>To determine the effect of <italic>P311 </italic>on cell proliferation, 5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) assays were performed on <italic>P311</italic>-adenovirus infected and stably transfected C2C12 cells. Both constructs promoted proliferation compared with control GFP cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). C2C12 cells stably transfected with <italic>P311 </italic>gave rise to less myotubes as visualised by immunostaining for desmin, and MYH fast proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>). This observation could be appreciated quantitatively by determining the fusion index of the transfected myotubes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref>), which showed that <italic>P311 </italic>over-expression produced less myotube formation than control.</p><p>No obvious differences in <italic>MYH </italic>expression were detected between <italic>P311</italic>-infected and control C2C12 cells during the early stages (3I and 3I 3D) of development (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). However, at the later stage of differentiation (3I 6D), there was the suggestion of reduced expression of <italic>MYHembryonic, MYH2b, Myf-5 </italic>and <italic>&#x003b1;-actin </italic>in <italic>P311</italic>-infected C2C12 myotubes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>), with the notable exception of <italic>MYHslow </italic>which showed raised expression. The overall results of extended <italic>P311 </italic>over-expression indicated a trend towards reduction in the expression of a number regulatory and structural muscle genes, which was consistent with reduced muscle differentiation. Since <italic>P311 </italic>appeared to associate with increased proliferation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>), and reduced differentiation and myotube formation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>), we examined whether it might also be down-regulated by the over-expression of constitutively active calcineurin (Cn), a key mediator of skeletal muscle differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Indeed, endogenous expression of <italic>P311 </italic>was down-regulated a few days after Cn infection, regardless of the developmental stage of the C2C12 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). Hence, in the promotion of muscle differentiation, Cn down-regulated <italic>P311 </italic>expression.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>PCS is associated with extensive muscle fibre atrophy</title><p>PCS is a well-recognised, commercially important clinical congenital condition of piglets. However, woefully little is known about its aetiology, pathogenesis or pathology. In this study, we demonstrated that PCS muscles (LD, ST and G) consistently showed fibre atrophy with concomitant increase in fibre density (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). It appears that PCS is an extensive muscle condition that affects several muscle groups. Indeed, previous work has shown that PCS affects different muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. We found that the ST and LD were more severely affected than the G (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). PCS associated atrophy was not accompanied by significant changes in fibre type composition (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), but some affected muscles showed significant reduction in the expression of <italic>MYHslow</italic>, <italic>MYH2x </italic>or <italic>MYH2b </italic>gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Hence PCS is a condition associated with muscle fibre atrophy ostensibly connected to reduced protein accretion, and is associated with reduction in the expression of structural muscle genes. At present, it is unclear if the atrophic fibre change observed in PCS muscles is a primary pathology of the condition or is a secondary outcome of disuse atrophy. In the present work, due to technical difficulty in obtaining complete cryostat cross-sections representative of total muscle areas, total fibre number of each muscle could not be reliably determined. At present, it is not certain if PCS-associated fibre atrophy is also accompanied by fibre hypoplasia.</p></sec><sec><title>PCS is associated with muscle wasting</title><p>MAFbx, an E3 ubiquitin ligase enzyme, was identified as an early marker of atrophy through differential expression screening studies in multiple models of skeletal muscle atrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. E3 ubiquitin ligase is one of three enzymatic components of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], a major protein degradation route known to be responsible for skeletal muscle atrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. We demonstrated high levels of <italic>MAFbx </italic>mRNA in all 4 atrophic PCS piglets from 4 litters (presented as individual and combined litters) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), in contrast with basal levels found in normal muscles pre- and post-natally (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). The elevated expression of <italic>MAFbx </italic>would suggest that the PCS muscles were subjected to a process of muscle wasting, possibly as a consequence of disuse atrophy. It remains possible that PCS is primary condition of gestational muscle under development.</p></sec><sec><title>Functional significance of P311</title><p>P311, first identified in murine embryonic neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], is a small 8 kDa 68-amino acid protein with a short half-life of around 5 minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. It is characterised by the presence of a conserved PEST domain (sequences rich in proline, glutamic acid, serine and threonine) a targeted site for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. We found rising levels of <italic>P311 </italic>expression throughout gestation, which was maintained in post-natal normal muscles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). By contrast, in PCS muscles, <italic>P311 </italic>was detected at much reduced levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Expression of <italic>P311 </italic>was previously reported to be down-regulated in atrophic murine muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In conditions of muscle wasting, arising from denervation or disuse, the process of protein degradation exceeds the rate of protein synthesis, resulting in net protein loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In PCS muscles, reduced <italic>P311 </italic>expression could be a consequence of net protein loss. On the other hand, given that P311 promoted cell proliferation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>), it may have an active role in promoting muscle growth through raised myoblast number.</p><p>P311 does not belong to any known family of proteins, and its cellular function remains largely unclear. To investigate the function of <italic>P311 </italic>in skeletal muscle, it is necessary to ascertain its effects in muscle in the context of cell proliferation, differentiation and phenotype determination. We established that <italic>P311 </italic>over-expression led to raised C2C12 cell proliferation and reduced myotube formation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref>). Consistent with reduced myotube formation, expression of several muscle genes (<italic>MYHembryonic</italic>, <italic>MYH2b</italic>, <italic>&#x003b1;-actin </italic>and <italic>myf-5</italic>) was down-regulated in late differentiation of <italic>P311</italic>-over-expressed C2C12 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). Myf-5, like MyoD, is transcriptionally active in proliferating myoblasts; its exogenous expression can cause non-myogenic cells to differentiate and fuse into myotubes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Previously, P311 was shown to be involved in glioblastoma cell migration and fibroblast cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Moreover, differentiation of neural cells was related to loss of <italic>P311 </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Hence, <italic>P311 </italic>may play an active part in the determination of muscle mass through the promotion of myoblast proliferation. The endogenous expression of <italic>P311 </italic>was suppressed by Cn over-expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). As Cn is a key mediator of muscle differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] it would suggest that P311 could also have an effect of limiting muscle differentiation. In PCS muscles, reduced <italic>P311 </italic>expression could conceivably mediate fibre atrophy through reduced cell proliferation, leading to reduced availability of total myoblast number in the formation of muscle fibres. Moreover, reduced myoblast number could potentially lead to the formation of less muscle fibres, hence fibre hypoplasia. Future work will require detailed total fibre counting to determine if fibre hypoplasia is also a feature of PCS muscles.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we demonstrated that the PCS is a condition characterised by extensive fibre atrophy and raised fibre density with no significant difference in fibre type composition. At the molecular level, PCS muscles showed reduced expression of a number of sarcomeric genes, elevated <italic>MAFbx </italic>and reduced <italic>P311 </italic>expression. It seems likely that the development of clinical PCS is a function of fibre size and, possibly, fibre number at birth, such that below a certain fibre threshold, the newborn would no longer be able to properly support its own weight. The differential expression patterns of <italic>MAFbx </italic>and <italic>P311 </italic>between muscles of normal and affected litter mates indicate their potential for use as biomarkers in the diagnosis of subclinical PCS. Clearly, more work is needed to evaluate this potential.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry and image analysis</title><p>ST, LD and G muscles were removed from four 2-day-old splayleg male piglets, along with 4 corresponding normal litter mates. Ten &#x003bc;m thick serial sections were immunostained with antibody for &#x003b2;-dystroglycan used at 1:200 dilution (VisionBiosystems), for MYH slow used at 1:50 dilution (M-32, Sigma) and for MYH fast used at 1:50 dilution (NOQ7.5.4D, Sigma), as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. For each muscle sample, 6 fields with at least 500 fibres each were randomly selected for morphometric analysis under &#x000d7; 20 magnification using the KS300 image analysis software (Carl Zeiss Ltd).</p></sec><sec><title>Expression constructs</title><p>Full length porcine <italic>P311 </italic>cDNA and a constitutively active murine calcineurin A (Cn) (from Dr. S. Williams, University of Texas) were cloned into an adenovirus vector, using the Adeno-X Expression System 2 (BD Biosciences). The starting plasmid vector pDNR-CMV for the insertion of <italic>P311 </italic>and Cn housed an expression cassette that was derived from the plasmid pAAV-IRES-hrGFP (Stratagene) which comprised a multiple cloning site for the creation of a 3'-end FLAG fusion gene and a GFP reporter gene, with an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) between the two. For time course studies, infection with <italic>P311 </italic>and Cn-adenovirus constructs were used at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5. For stable transfection, full length <italic>P311 </italic>cDNA was cloned into a neomycin resistant pBK-CMV expression plasmid vector (Stratagene), where transcription was driven by a cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture, transfections and expression assays</title><p>C2C12 cells (CRL-1772) were grown in proliferation medium (PM) (10% foetal bovine serum in DMEM with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 &#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin). At 80% confluence, PM was replaced by differentiation medium (DM) (4% horse serum in DMEM with penicillin and streptomycin). For stable transfections, C2C12 cells at 35% confluence in T25 culture flasks were transfected with 6.0 &#x003bc;g <italic>P311 </italic>plasmid, by the use of lipofectamine and Opti-MEM, according to manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Next day, the transfection medium was replaced with PM for 1 day, followed by G418 (Invitrogen) selection at 2000 &#x003bc;g/ml over several days until a day after all cells in the control untransfected flask had been eliminated by G418. All subsequent experiments on stably transfected cells were conducted in the absence of G418.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>C2C12 cells, infected with <italic>P311 </italic>or GFP control adenovirus, were grown for 3 days in PM, followed by 8 days in DM. To improve P311 stability, o-phenanthorline and lactacystin were added to the DM, at final concentrations of 1.26 mM and 10 mM respectively, 2 hour prior to fixation. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and incubated with the primary anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma), at a dilution of 1/2000, overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. A goat anti-mouse-TRITC (Southern Biotech) at 1/200 was used as the secondary antibody in a 45 minute incubation at 37&#x000b0;C. It was mounted using Vectashield (Vector) hard set mounting medium with DAPI. Images were captured by a CCD camera mounted on an inverted Olympus fluorescence microscope.</p></sec><sec><title>BrdU, fusion index and cell cytotoxicity assays</title><p>BrdU assays on C2C12 cells, infected with <italic>P311</italic>-adenovirus and stably transfected with <italic>P311 </italic>plasmid construct, were performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Briefly, cells were incubated with BrdU for 2 hours and immunostained with a rat anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody. BrdU positive cells were counted. For each construct, three independent experiments were conducted.</p><p>For fusion index assays, after 9 days in DM, cells were fixed and incubated with a primary antibody (anti-desmin 1:200, Dako, or anti-MYH fast 1:200) at 4&#x000b0;C overnight. Secondary FITC conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody (Sigma) was used at 1/200 dilution. For each sample, 5 fields were randomly chosen for counting. Fusion index was defined as the number of DAPI stained nuclei within myotubes in a given field divided by the total number of DAPI stained nuclei in the same field. Three independent experiments were conducted.</p><p>Cell cytotoxicity assay, a resazurin-based reduction assay that measured the metabolic capacity of cells, was performed according to manufactururer's protocol, normalised to unit weight of protein (CellTiter-Blue, Promega).</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative real-time RT-PCR</title><p>Total RNA was isolated from porcine muscles and C2C12 cells using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen), quantitated in an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer and converted into cDNA with random primers using a Reverse Transcription System (Promega). Two &#x003bc;g of total RNA were used for each cDNA conversion. Four sets of cDNA samples from PCS and normal piglets were prepared (litters 1 to litters 4). With pre-natal muscles, LD was pooled from 3 Pietrain-based pig foetuses from gestation stage of 35, 49, 63, 77 and 91 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Additionally, pooled whole 14-day embryos and 21-day embryos derived from the same uterine horn were used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. With <italic>P311 </italic>adenovirus, C2C12 cells were infected in PM for 3 days (3I), followed by 3 days in DM (3I 3D) or by 6 days in DM (3I 6D). TaqMan quantitative real-time RT-PCR (Applied Biosystems) was performed on a number porcine and murine genes: <italic>MYHembryonic</italic>, <italic>MYHperinatal</italic>, <italic>MYHslow</italic>, <italic>MYH2a</italic>, <italic>MYH2x</italic>, <italic>MYH2b</italic>, &#x003b2;-<italic>actin</italic>, &#x003b1; <italic>-actin</italic>, <italic>myf-5, MAFbx </italic>and <italic>P311</italic>.

All other primers and probes sequences are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. A relative standard curve method, normalised to &#x003b2;-actin was used in the quantification of expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>SAS software (SAS procedure mixed, SAS Institute) was used. Fibre size, fibre density, real-time PCR data for PCS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) were analyzed by mixed model variance analysis using muscle type (ST, LD, and G), disease status (normal, PCS) as fixed effects with litters and replicate as random effects. BrdU and fusion index data were analyzed by mixed model variance analysis, using treatment (<italic>P311 </italic>and GFP control) as fixed effects with experiments and replicate as random effects. The standard errors of the difference between sample means were calculated using the error mean square from the ANOVA. Differences between pair-wise combinations of the least square means were tested for significance (p &#x0003c; 0.05). Unless specifically stated, quantitative real-time RT-PCR data were expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation from triplicate samples within the same experiment.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>PTO performed most of the experimental work and wrote the draft manuscript.
