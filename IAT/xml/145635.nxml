At least four alternatively spliced forms of AREC3 cDNA were identified. Sequence analysis indicates that AREC3 has an extensive homology with the Drosophila sine oculis gene product required for development of the entire visual system [Cheyette et al.(1994) Neuron 12, 977-996]. The homologous region including a homeodomain is required for specific DNA binding to ARE. A transactivation domain was identified in the C-terminal part of the AREC3 by reporter gene assays using GAL4-AREC3 fusion protein constructs. Immunohistochemistry revealed that AREC3 localized to the nucleus and cytoplasm of myoblast C2C12 cells, and the production of AREC3 is augmented during muscle differentiation. Western blot analysis indicated that the 115 kDa form of AREC3 protein is increased in the cytoplasmic extract, and the 67kDa form is increased both in nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts of C2C12 cells during muscle differentiation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
