We have shown that these two chemokines are activated by the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 for IL-8, and Jun-terminal kinase (JNK) for MCP-1. It is also well established that transcription of each of these chemokines is tightly controlled by the nuclear factor kappa B (NF&#x003ba;B) transcription factor family. Therefore, we sought to better understand the differential regulation of chemokine expression by NF&#x003ba;B in adenoviral infection of the cornea.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Primary keratocytes derived from human donor corneas were treated with signaling inhibitors and small interfering RNA specific to MAPKs, and infected with adenovirus for different time periods before analysis. Activation of specific NF&#x003ba;B subunits was analyzed by western blot, confocal microscopy, electromobility shift assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation, and chemokine expression was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Upon adenoviral infection, NF&#x003ba;B p65, p50, and cREL subunits translocate to the nucleus. This translocation is blocked by inhibitors of specific MAPK signaling pathways. Confocal microscopy showed that inhibitors of the p38, JNK, and ERK pathways differentially inhibited NF&#x003ba;B nuclear translocation, while PP2, an inhibitor of Src family kinases, completely inhibited NF&#x003ba;B nuclear translocation. Western blot analysis revealed that activation of specific NF&#x003ba;B subunits was time dependent following infection. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that binding of NF&#x003ba;B p65 and p50 subunits to the IL-8 promoter upon viral infection was differentially reduced by chemical inhibitors of MAPKs. Electromobility shift assay and luciferase assay analysis revealed that transactivation of IL-8 occurred with binding by the NF&#x003ba;B p65 homodimer or NF&#x003ba;B p65/p50 heterodimer as early as 1 h post infection, whereas MCP-1 expression was dependent upon the NF&#x003ba;B cREL but not the p65 subunit, and occurred 4 h after IL-8 induction. Finally, knockdown of NF&#x003ba;B p65 by short interfering RNA abrogated IL-8 but not MCP-1 expression after adenoviral infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The kinetics of NF&#x003ba;B subunit activation are partly responsible for the observed pattern of acute inflammation in the adenoviral-infected cornea. MAPKs differentially regulate chemokine expression in adenoviral keratitis by differential and time-dependent activation of specific NF&#x003ba;B subunits.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>GalleyStatus</meta-name><meta-value>Export to XML</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>corr-author</meta-name><meta-value>Chodosh</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>An acute inflammatory response to infection or injury occurs in stereotyped stages irrespective of invading organism or mechanism of injury, with neutrophils being the first cells to infiltrate the tissue or body cavity, followed shortly by monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. This pattern appears to be the result of the specific induction and activity of chemokines, proteins elicited by cells that induce the directed migration of leukocytes into tissue sites of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>], by infected or injured cells. Possible molecular mechanisms at play in the tightly controlled pattern of acute inflammation include transcriptional induction, transcriptional repression, and mRNA stability. In particular, it has been shown that AU-rich elements in mRNA contribute stability to the molecule and in part serve to control the kinetics of gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>]. Leukocyte infiltration into the corneal stroma represents a critical pathogenic event in viral infection of the cornea. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is one of the earliest chemokines to be expressed in infection and acts as a first line of defense via its capacity to elicit neutrophil chemotaxis, and to a lesser degree monocyte and T-cell chemotaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. IL-8 induction following viral infection has been shown by many independent research groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>], and a wide variety of cells produce IL-8, including microglia and astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. However, in the corneal stroma the molecular mechanisms that regulate IL-8 expression following adenoviral infection remain unclear. Our study focuses on the kinetics of transcription of IL-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), another key chemokine in adenoviral keratitis, and on the role of the NF&#x003ba;B transcription factor family in chemokine activation.</p><p>The nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B (NF&#x003ba;B) family of transcription factors controls expression of well over one hundred genes, the majority of which participate in regulating innate and adaptive immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. Activation of NF&#x003ba;B occurs within minutes after an appropriate stimulus and leads to strong transcriptional stimulation of both viral and cellular genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]. Analysis of the transcriptional regulation of chemokines induced by viral infection is critical to understanding the pathogenesis of viral keratitis. However, the mechanisms that connect viral infection to chemokine expression by infected stromal cells are poorly understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>].</p><p>In general, chemokine gene expression is controlled by the NF&#x003ba;B transcription factor family, p65, RELB, cREL, NF&#x003ba;B1 (p50/100), and NF&#x003ba;B2 (p52/105). These proteins form specific homo- or heterodimers for transcriptional activation of target genes in a cell-specific manner. NF&#x003ba;B subunit activation can be achieved through two main pathways: canonical (classical), characterized by the activation of the I&#x003ba;B kinase (IKK) complex, including both IKK&#x003b1; and IKK&#x003b2;; and non-canonical (non-classical), characterized by activation of NF&#x003ba;B-inducing kinase and IKK&#x003b1;, but not IKK&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>]. Therefore, it is the specific activation of upstream IKKs that represents the point of divergence for NF&#x003ba;B activation. Activation of these pathways has been determined to be both cell and stimulus specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>]. The canonical pathway is the route most commonly activated by pathogens, and is stimulated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns and cytokines. The non-canonical pathway has been described particularly in B lymphocytes, and is stimulated by B-cell activating factor, lymphotoxin &#x003b2;, and CD40L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>]. Lipopolysaccharide from <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> was shown to activate both canonical and non-canonical pathways in primary B cells with activation of both NF&#x003ba;B p50/RELA and p52/RELB heterodimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>]. Herpes simplex virus type 1 ICP27 protein was shown to activate NF&#x003ba;B via the canonical pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>]. While the role of NF&#x003ba;B in apoptosis following adenoviral infection has been explored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>], its role in cytokine regulation due to viral infection has been less fully addressed.</p><p>We have earlier shown that NF&#x003ba;B p65 is activated upon adenoviral infection in conjunction with the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) pathway for cell survival during viral replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>], but activation of NF&#x003ba;B p65 as a possible mechanism for chemokine induction in adenoviral infection has not been explored. Our prior studies in a mouse model of adenoviral keratitis have shown expression of KC (a homologue of IL-8 in the mouse) within 4 h of infection, followed by MCP-1 at 16 h post infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>].

Briefly, after mechanical debridement of the corneal epithelium and endothelium, corneas were cut into 2 mm diameter sections, and each section placed in individual wells of 6-well Falcon Tissue Culture Plates (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) with Dulbecco&#x02019;s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), containing 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin G sodium, and streptomycin sulfate. Corneal fragments were removed prior to monolayer confluence. Cells were grown and maintained at 37 <sup>o</sup>C in 5 % CO<sub>2</sub>. Cells from multiple donors were pooled, and the cell monolayers used at passage three. For inhibitor analysis, cells were pretreated with SB203580 (10 &#x000b5;M), SP600125 (25 &#x000b5;M), PD98059 (25 &#x000b5;M), and PP2 (10 &#x000b5;M) at 37 &#x000b0;C for 3 h before infection, and were exposed to the inhibitors at the same concentrations throughout the infection process. The protocol for use of corneas from deceased human donors was approved by the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary Human Studies Committee, and conformed to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Human adenovirus species D type 19 (HAdV-D19) used in this study was cultured directly from the cornea of a patient with EKC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>], and purified by cesium chloride gradient. The virus was grown in human lung carcinoma cells (A549 cells, CCL 185; American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) in Minimum Essential Media (MEM) with 2 % FBS, penicillin G sodium, streptomycin sulfate, and amphotericin B. The State of Oklahoma Department of Health confirmed the viral serotype.

Specificity of probe binding was shown by use of 100 molar excess of unlabelled probe (data not shown). We have previously shown that chemical inhibition of JNK has no effect on IL-8 expression by adenoviral-infected keratocytes.

In light of our in vivo data showing that KC, an IL-8 homolog, is the first chemokine to be induced upon adenoviral-infection, and that MCP-1 expression is delayed, these results indicate that in adenoviral infection, IL-8 is transactivated by NF&#x003ba;B p65/p65 homodimers and/or NF&#x003ba;B p65/p50 heterodimers, while MCP-1 gene expression is delayed and uses predominantly cREL and NF&#x003ba;B p50.</p></sec><sec><title>Cellular localization of NF&#x003ba;B subunits in adenoviral infection</title><p>NF&#x003ba;B and I&#x003ba;B shuttle continually between the cytoplasm and nucleus in steady state conditions, resulting in a basal level of NF&#x003ba;B activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>].

Interestingly, SP600125 had less inhibitory effect on nuclear localization compared to other MAPK inhibitors, indicating that the JNK pathway does not mediate NF&#x003ba;B p65 activation. The Src inhibitor PP2 completely suppressed NF&#x003ba;B p65 and p50 nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>), suggesting a broad upstream role of Src in these pathways, while downstream MAPKs collaborate in the activation and translocation of NF&#x003ba;B.

The stepwise order and timely expression of various inflammatory mediators seem to be preset as a part of a master gene activation program. For example, the consistent differential in time between the expression of interferon gamma and IL-17 during active experimental autoimmune encephalitis in DA rats suggests different roles for these cytokines in the pathogenesis of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>].

Its multiple actions, redundancy in function, and cell specificity have made building a picture of the molecular mechanisms by which NF&#x003ba;B activates cytokine genes in infection a complex undertaking. Viruses that have been previously shown to activate NF&#x003ba;B include human immunodeficiency virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>], hepatitis B virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>], hepatitis C virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>], Epstein Barr virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>], herpes simplex virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>], and influenza virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>]. The K13 protein of human herpes virus-8 was shown to mediate IL-8 via NF&#x003ba;B p65, p50 and cREL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. Most prior studies of the influence of adenoviral infection on NF&#x003ba;B activation used either recombinant adenoviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>], adenovirus vectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref>], or isolated adenovirus proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r49">49</xref>].

In our studies, adenoviral-infected cells showed increased nuclear translocation and IL-8 promoter binding for NF&#x003ba;B p65 and p50. Interestingly, we demonstrated by confocal microscopy, EMSA, and western blot that the JNK inhibitor (SP600125) had a minimal effect on NF&#x003ba;B p65 and p50 binding to IL-8 promoter. These data correlate with our earlier reports showing that inhibition of JNK activity in adenoviral-infected cells did not reduce IL-8 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>] or inhibit NF&#x003ba;B p65 translocation to the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. However, the ChIP data did appear to show an effect of SP600125 on p65. Also, cREL binding to IL-8 promoter by ChIP assay was negligible, but our supershift assay with cREL on the IL-8 promoter was significant. Further studies will be necessary to resolve these apparent discrepancies.</p><p>Our confocal microscopy data demonstrated increased nuclear translocation of NF&#x003ba;B p65, cREL, and p50 in adenoviral-infected cells, whereas no such translocation was observed in mock-treated cells. By confocal microscopy, inhibitors to various MAPKs reduced but did not completely inhibit NF&#x003ba;B subunit translocation to the nucleus, suggesting that NF&#x003ba;B nuclear translocation represents a summation of upstream activity by numerous kinases. Our earlier studies demonstrated that inhibition of Src fully blocked activation of p38 MAPK, ERK, and JNK (32, 35, and 52), suggesting that Src kinases are linearly upstream to all 3 MAPKs. By confocal microscopy, inhibition of Src also effectively blocked NF&#x003ba;B nuclear translocation.</p><p>Although IL-8 is one of the best-studied chemokines in host&#x02013;pathogen interactions, the specific signaling and molecular mechanism underlying the kinetics of its induction remain to be fully elucidated. IL-8 contributes to the chemotaxis of neutrophils but also other leukocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>], and has become a paradigm chemokine for translational studies of anti-chemokine therapy. Monoclonal antibody to IL-8 was recently utilized successfully as a treatment for localized pustular psoriasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r54">54</xref>]. Our data clearly show that NF&#x003ba;B p65 is critical for IL-8 expression, as knockdown of p65 reduced IL-8 luciferase activity to mock levels at multiple time points post infection. Reduced p65 did not inhibit expression of MCP-1, suggesting again that MCP-1 expression is not NF&#x003ba;B p65 dependent. We suggest that NF&#x003ba;B p65 and cREL play a role in the kinetics of IL-8 and MCP-1 gene regulation, respectively, in adenoviral-infected primary keratocytes. Further studies are needed to clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying MCP-1 induction and how other transcription factors such as Sp1 may regulate chemokine induction in adenoviral infection.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Supported in part by U.S. Public Health Service NIH grants EY013124 and P30EY014104<bold>,</bold> Massachusetts Lions Eye Research Fund, Inc., New England Corneal Transplant Research Fund<bold>,</bold> and an unrestricted grant to the Department of Ophthalmology, Harvard Medical School, from Research to Prevent Blindness, New York, NY.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ryan</surname><given-names>GB</given-names></name><name><surname>Majno</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Acute inflammation.
