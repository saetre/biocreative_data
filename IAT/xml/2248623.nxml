After initial severe hypotonia, PWS children become hyperphagic and morbidly obese, if intake is not restricted. Short stature with abnormal growth hormone secretion, hypogonadism, cognitive impairment, anxiety and behavior problems are other features. PWS is caused by lack of expression of imprinted genes in a &#x0223c;4 mb region of chromosome band 15q11.2. Our previous translocation studies predicted a major role for the C/D box small nucleolar RNA cluster <italic>SNORD116 (PWCR1/HBII-85</italic>) in PWS. To test this hypothesis, we created a &#x0223c;150 kb deletion of the &#x0003e;40 copies of <italic>Snord116 (Pwcr1/MBII-85)</italic> in C57BL/6 mice. <italic>Snord116del</italic> mice with paternally derived deletion lack expression of this snoRNA. They have early-onset postnatal growth deficiency, but normal fertility and lifespan. While pituitary structure and somatotrophs are normal, liver <italic>Igf1</italic> mRNA is decreased. In cognitive and behavior tests, <italic>Snord116del</italic> mice are deficient in motor learning and have increased anxiety. Around three months of age, they develop hyperphagia, but stay lean on regular and high-fat diet. On reduced caloric intake, <italic>Snord116del</italic> mice maintain their weight better than wild-type littermates, excluding increased energy requirement as a cause of hyperphagia. Normal compensatory feeding after fasting, and ability to maintain body temperature in the cold indicate normal energy homeostasis regulation. Metabolic chamber studies reveal that <italic>Snord116del</italic> mice maintain energy homeostasis by altered fuel usage. Prolonged mealtime and increased circulating ghrelin indicate a defect in meal termination mechanism. <italic>Snord116del</italic> mice, the first snoRNA deletion animal model, reveal a novel role for a non-coding RNA in growth and feeding regulation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="18"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>As the leading genetic cause of obesity with a prevalence of 1 in 10,000 to 20,000, Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex neuro developmental disorder characterized by neonatal hypotonia and failure to thrive, developmental delay, cognitive defects, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, characteristic facial features, short stature, and behavioral abnormalities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Holm1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The most prominent feature of PWS is hyperphagia with an age of onset between 2 and 6 years, which if uncontrolled, can lead to morbid obesity and associated ailments that include type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and early death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Cassidy1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The underlying mechanism of the hyperphagic behavior is unclear. PWS is caused by the inactivation or deletion of several imprinted, paternally expressed genes within 4 Mb of chromosome band 15q11.2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Nicholls1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Molecular mechanisms include large deletions, maternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 15 or mutations involving the imprinting center. The current challenge in PWS research is to elucidate the contributions of individual loci to the genetic and molecular pathways that are affected, leading to PWS-associated phenotypes. Prior studies of spontaneous reciprocal translocations and deletions allowed us to narrow down the critical region within the common deletion interval to &#x0223c;121 kb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Gallagher1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Schle1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

At birth, deletion mice were also indistinguishable from WT. As of postnatal day 2 (P2), however, they failed to gain weight as effectively as their WT littermates, and by 3 weeks of age, the mutants' weight was &#x0223c;60&#x00025; of the WT weight for males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001709-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, left) and females (not shown). Although the mutants' rate of growth appeared to normalize after weaning, the weight differences persisted to adulthood for both genders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001709-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, middle and right). The length of the mutant mice was also decreased. At 5 months of age, the length of the mutant males was 95.8&#x000b1;0.4&#x00025; of WT (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;13 WT, 9 Del, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;1&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>), and the length of the mutant females was 97.6&#x000b1;0.8&#x00025; of WT, (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;12 WT, 12 Del, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05), as measured under anesthesia from the tip of the nose to the anus. Unlike previously reported PWS mouse models with neonatal lethality, almost all the <italic>Snord116del</italic> mice survived to adulthood, and appear healthy at their current age of 18 months.</p><p>Possible causes of the striking early postnatal growth failure include reduced milk intake. Human neonates with PWS have severe hypotonia and are unable to suck effectively, so that gavage feeding is usually required. In a previous mouse model for PWS, decreased milk intake and impaired righting ability from the prone position had been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Tsai1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, we observed sufficient milk in the stomachs of young pups with <italic>Snord116</italic> deletion when their abdomens were still transparent. Also, the mutant pups were not hypotonic. When tested at P5, they accomplished the righting task with equal or better efficiency than their WT littermates, and they could hold on to a 45 degree rough surface longer than the WT littermates (data not shown). A careful dissection at P5 and P13 showed strikingly reduced sizes of liver (72&#x000b1;15&#x00025; of WT at P5 and 56&#x000b1;2&#x00025; at P13; both <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001), and stomach (67&#x000b1;36&#x00025; at P5 and 68&#x000b1;6&#x00025; at P13; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 and <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.05, respectively), but brain weights were only slightly decreased (95&#x000b1;7&#x00025; of WT at P5, and 92&#x000b1;1&#x00025; at P13; both <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.02) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001709-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). The disproportionately small stomach size at P5 may suggest that reduced food intake could contribute to the growth retardation. We also observed decreased subcutaneous fat storage during the dissection. Histologic examination of H &#x00026; E stained sections of all other inner organs, including the brain, revealed no apparent abnormalities in the <italic>Snord116del</italic> mice compared to WT littermates.</p><p>Since individuals with PWS have short stature after early childhood that is in part due to growth hormone (GH) deficiency, and the growth retardation of <italic>Snord116del</italic> mice persisted to adulthood, we measured the direct downstream effector of GH action, the transcript levels of insulin-like growth factor (<italic>Igf1,</italic> GeneID: 16000) in liver. By performing quantitative RT-PCR with liver RNA samples from 4-wk and 8-wk old mice, we found that <italic>Igf1</italic> mRNA expression was significantly lower in the mutants at both time points, 76&#x000b1;8&#x00025; of the WT level at 4 wk and 80&#x000b1;8&#x00025; at 8 wk (both <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.04) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001709-g002">Fig. 2C</xref> left). Measurements of circulating IGF-I protein in serum showed an even more drastic reduction to 39&#x000b1;5&#x00025; of the WT level at 4 wk and 57&#x000b1;6&#x00025; at 8 wk (both <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0005) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001709-g002">Fig.2C</xref> right).

We performed H&#x00026;E staining of E12.5, E14.5 and E18.5 embryonic and adult (4 week old) pituitaries. The developing pituitary gland appeared morphologically normal in sections from <italic>Snord116del</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001709-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). To obtain quantitative data, we determined the volume of the pituitary gland at E18.5 and at 4 wk by using three-dimensional reconstruction. The volume of the pituitary gland was not significantly reduced in E18.5 <italic>Snord116</italic> embryos compared to their WT littermates.

In adult <italic>Snord116del</italic> mice (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3), the volume of the pituitary gland was also not significantly reduced, relative to body weight (data not shown).</p><p>Given that the morphology of the <italic>Snord116</italic> pituitary was normal, we asked whether the GH deficiency observed could be due to a reduction in hormone-producing cells in the anterior pituitary. To address this question, we performed immunohistochemical staining for the five hormone-producing cell types present in the anterior pituitary. This analysis revealed that all cell types are present in normal proportions in the developing (E18.5) and adult (P28) <italic>Snord116</italic> pituitary compared to the WT (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001709.s001">Figure S1</xref>). With no reduction in the number of GH-producing cells (somatotrophs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001709-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>) and apparently normal immunogenicity of the GH protein in these cells, the cause of GH-deficiency most likely resides in the regulation of GH release.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Normal fertility and delayed sexual maturation</title><p>Individuals with PWS have hypoplastic genitalia, and delayed and often incomplete sexual maturation, secondary to deficiency of gonadotropic hormones.

Both male and female deletion mice gained less weight than the WT controls. Thus, they were relatively more resistant to HF diet-induced obesity. The effect was more pronounced in the mutant males, consistent with their lower energy intake on HF diet as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001709-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>.</p><p>PWS is associated with high body fat mass and low muscle mass. We measured total fat and lean body mass ratio in the <italic>Snord116del</italic> mice by Dual Energy X-ray absorptiometry. After 4 months on the HF diet, the <italic>Snord116del</italic> mice had significantly lower body fat content than WT littermates (&#x02212;6.9&#x00025;, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001 for males and &#x02212;7.2&#x00025;, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.02 for females) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001709-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>, HF). A cohort of mice kept on regular rodent chow diet for 5 months, showed an insignificant trend of lower fat content in deletion males compared to their WT littermates (&#x02212;3.6&#x00025;, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.07), and a significantly lower fat content in deletion females (&#x02212;4.2&#x00025;, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.02). A group of 9 months old mice on regular rodent chow showed the same difference, with significantly lower body fat content in deletion males (&#x02212;9&#x00025;, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;2&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>), and females (&#x02212;5&#x00025;, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.02) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001709-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that the <italic>Snord116</italic> mice are leaner that WT on a regular diet, as well as on a HF diet. The fact that the <italic>Snord116del</italic> mice on HF diet have a higher body fat content than those on the regular diet confirms that they are capable of anabolic fat storage. Under both dietary regimes, however, the overall fat storage is much lower in the mutant than in the WT mice, which is contrary to the human PWS phenotype.</p><p>Finally, we assessed the ability to adjust food intake after fasting. After a 24 hr fast, normal mice regain their pre-fasting body weight within 48 hr due to compensatory hyperphagia. Some obese strains, such as <italic>ob/ob</italic> (GeneID: 16846) mice or those with neuronal ablation in the hypothalamic feeding circuit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Xu1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, have abnormal weight regulation and are unable to compensate for missed meals and to regain their body weight within 48 hr. Therefore, we tested 3 months old <italic>Snord116del</italic> mice and their WT littermates for their ability to compensate. After a 24 hr fast and re-feeding, both the deletion and WT mice showed similar food intake, as measured at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hr after the fasting period, and mice of both genotypes gained back the weight they lost during fasting within 48 hrs (data not shown). When we measured the 48 hr cumulative food intake, deletion males (M2) showed a significantly higher compensatory intake, 3.09&#x000b1;0.06 units of the pre-fasting daily intake, than the WT males, with only 2.88&#x000b1;0.05 units of daily intake (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.02) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001709-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). This difference may reflect the known insufficient compensatory feeding of the WT C57BL/6 males, which are prone to diet-induce obesity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Koza1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, because it was not seen in females. The 48 hr cumulative food intake for females (F2) was not significantly different, with WT and deletion mice taking in 3.07&#x000b1;0.05 units and 3.14&#x000b1;0.06 units of their pre-fasting daily intake, respectively. We conclude that normal feeding regulation allows the <italic>Snord116del</italic> mice to restore missed meals and maintain body weight with good precision.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Normal thermal regulation</title><p>In addition to abnormal re-feeding response to fasting, <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice are also defective in thermal regulation.

We tested 5 month old WT and <italic>Snord116del</italic> mice for their ability to maintain body temperature when placed in a 4&#x000b0;C room. The deletion mice were able to keep their core body temperature for the entire testing period of 32 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001709-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>), with the core temperature of the deletion males roughly 0.5&#x000b0;C higher than that of their WT littermates for most of the tested time points (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). The deletion females were also able to keep their core body temperature in the cold with slightly higher levels than the WT (less than 0.5&#x000b0;C) at some testing points (data not shown). Given their smaller size and lower body fat mass, the deletion mice may require a slightly higher core temperature to maintain whole body temperature.

We placed 6 months old <italic>Snord116del</italic> males and their WT littermates into metabolic chambers for 7 days. To our surprise, the mutant mice consumed more food than their WT littermates after normalizing intake to body weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001709-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). The water intake mirrored the food intake with the deletion mice consuming more water as well (data not shown).

Suspecting that the stress of the metabolic chambers could be the cause of the observed difference, we placed the 6 months old mice that had been tested in the chambers back into their home cages and measured their food intake.

could alter the expression of neighboring or distant loci, for example, by changing the chromatin conformation of the flanking region, or by deleting enhancer/repressor elements or unidentified miRNAs. We have evidence that the observed phenotypes are not due to changes in the expression of nearby genes. First, the expression levels for the closest protein coding genes, <italic>Ndn</italic> (necdin), <italic>Snrpn</italic>, and <italic>Ube3a</italic> in brain were not changed in quantitative real-time RT-PCR assays. Second, a large-scale gene expression profiling study using Illumina microarrays also revealed no changes in transcript levels of nearby protein coding genes and expressed sequence tags (data not shown). Therefore, the <italic>Snord116</italic> deletion does not affect the expression of flanking protein-coding genes in the PWS critical region (PWCR).</p><p>The PWCR contains many other snoRNA genes. In the human PWCR, the transcription unit of <italic>SNURF</italic>-<italic>SNRPN</italic> includes all the intron-encoded snoRNAs in a single large RNA precursor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Runte1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. A similar large transcript was recently identified in mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-LeMeur1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, the <italic>Snord116</italic> deletion could affect the processing efficiency of intronic elements that are located upstream or downstream of the deletion breakpoints. Such a mechanism might explain the small decrease in <italic>Snord107</italic> expression and the small increase in <italic>Snord115</italic> expression that we observed in the brain of <italic>Snord116del</italic> mice. In previous studies, however, <italic>SNORD107</italic> and <italic>SNORD115/Snord115</italic> were excluded from contributing to the PWS phenotype in humans and mice (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Introduction</xref>). Therefore, it is unlikely that the subtle changes in the levels of these snoRNAs could be causing the major phenotypes in <italic>Snord116del</italic> mice.</p><p>Experimental proof that loss of a specific gene is responsible for a certain phenotype is straightforward for single-copy genes, where a point mutation can be made to abolish gene function without affecting the genomic structure. The fact that <italic>Snord116</italic> exists as a gene cluster of at least 41 copies and spans &#x0223c;150 kb of genomic DNA precludes such an experiment. Alternatively, one could test whether a transgene expressing <italic>Snord116</italic> corrects the abnormal phenotype of the deletion mice. We made several transgenic mouse strains expressing <italic>Snord116</italic> from a neural-specific enolase promoter and achieved <italic>Snord116</italic> expression levels comparable to that of an endogenous single-copy gene. Expression from our transgene construct, which contains a single copy of <italic>Snord116</italic> within nucleolin intron 11<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Nicoloso1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, is comparable to that of an average endogenous single-copy gene, but far lower than the endogenous level of <italic>Snord116</italic> expressed from the &#x0003e;40-copy cluster (data not shown). Consequently, the transgenes failed to rescue the neonatal growth retardation and lethality present in <italic>Snrpn</italic> to <italic>Ube3a</italic> deletion mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Tsai1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. To achieve a higher level of <italic>Snord116</italic> expression, as may be required for transgenic rescue, the creation of BAC transgenics might be an option which, however, would face the risk of introducing unrecognized genetic elements such as miRNAs.</p><p>As for the possibility of an unidentified gene or genes in the deleted interval being responsible for the observed phenotypes, we were unable to identify any conserved elements other than the multiple copies of <italic>Snord116</italic> in the deleted interval. The exons of the host gene, which in mouse encode an open reading frame (hypothetical protein LOC664788), are not conserved in human. Our conclusion that the <italic>Snord116</italic> deletion is responsible for the phenotypes in the mice is supported by a recently presented individual with PWS who has a paternally derived small genomic deletion comprising the entire <italic>SNORD116</italic> cluster and half of the <italic>SNORD115</italic> cluster. <italic>SNORD116</italic> expression was completely abolished (Sahoo T, del Gaudio D, German JR, Shinawi M, Peters SU, Person R, Garnica A, Cheung SW, Beaudet AL, Prader-Willi syndrome is caused by paternal deficiency for the HBII-85 C/D box snoRNA cluster.

But despite adequate nutrition, they fail to thrive during infancy. Older children and adults with PWS have short stature in part due to growth hormone (GH) deficiency and respond well to GH treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Burman1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Angulo1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The <italic>Snord116del</italic> mouse model reproduces the severe neonatal growth retardation, but not the hypotonia. We were unable to document reduced milk intake, although stomach weights at P5 were reduced. Thus, it remains possible that a subtle difference in suckling behavior reduces milk intake, and cumulatively affects growth. Growth hormone secretion is not required during the first two weeks after birth, as shown by the normal growth in the first two weeks of the GH receptor knock-out mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Zhou1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, the neonatal growth retardation in <italic>Snord116del</italic> mice must be due to a defect other than lower GH secretion. The persistent growth retardation in puberty and adulthood in the deletion mice, however, is consistent with GH deficiency. No obvious difference in pituitary size or the number of GH producing cells was evident around the time of birth or in 4-week old mutants. Since GH secretion is pulsatile and the half-life of GH is very short (about 15&#x02013;20 min), it can be difficult to demonstrate reduced circulating levels. To obtain a reliable assessment, we evaluated GH activity by measuring the mRNA and protein levels of IGF-I (insulin-like growth factor 1) and documented reduced <italic>Igf1</italic> mRNA levels in liver, as well as reduced IGF1 protein levels in the serum, at 4 and 8 weeks of age. Since <italic>Igf1</italic> transcription increases in response to GH binding, these results indicate an abnormality in GH release and/or signaling in the deletion mice. Our findings in the <italic>Snord116del</italic> mice are consistent with decreased circulating IGF-I in both GH-receptor (GeneID: 14600) and hypothalamic growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) receptor (GeneID: 14602) deficient mice, that are approximately half and two-thirds the weight of their WT littermates, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Eicher1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Coschigano1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref> . Notably, circulating IGF-I levels in the GHRH (<italic>lit/lit</italic>) mice are in the range seen in our <italic>Snord116del</italic> mice (data not shown) suggesting a common final mechanism for the growth retardation related to available circulating IGF-I.</p><p>The literature on PWS has long suspected that the primary defect lies in hypothalamic dysfunction. While early autopsies of PWS brains revealed a reduction in the size of the paraventricular nucleus containing fewer oxytocin-preducing neurons and a 30&#x00025; reduction in GHRH-producing neurons in the nucleus arcuatus of the hypothalamus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Swaab1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, more recent studies of hypothalami from six adult obese PWS individuals did not confirm a reduction of GHRH-neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Goldstone2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, GHRH and gonadotropin stimulation studies in humans demonstrated a lack of response in most PWS individuals, placing the site of the major defect into the pituitary rather than the hypothalamus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Burman1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Hypoplastic pituitaries have occasionally been reported in patients. In the <italic>Snord116del</italic> mice, we found normal pituitary development and structure, with normal representation of all five specific hormone-producing cell types. In comparison, in the <italic>lit/lit</italic> dwarf mice with a mutation in the GHRH gene (GeneID: 14601), the anterior pituitary is hypoplastic and GH-producing cells are reduced in number and are abnormally distributed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Lin1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Individuals with PWS have hypogonadism due to insufficient gonadotropin secretion, but their delayed puberty responds to GH treatment, indicating that it may be caused in part by deficient GH secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Burman1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. The <italic>Snord116del</italic> females also have delayed puberty, as observed by delayed vaginal opening, in the absence of other signs of hypogonadism. We, therefore, propose that their delay in adolescent growth as well as in sexual maturation may be due to a defect in growth hormone release.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Neurobehavioral features</title><p>The diagnostic criteria of PWS include developmental delay, cognitive impairment, and characteristic behavior problems such as temper tantrums, obsessive-compulsive behavior and stubbornness. In addition, a high pain threshold is noticed in many PWS individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Cassidy1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The neurobehavioral tests of <italic>Snord116del</italic> mice uncovered increased anxiety/fear in the elevated plus maze test, as well as impaired motor learning in the rotarod test. The elevated level of fear or anxiety may reflect higher stress level in the deletion mice, which is consistent with reports in PWS subjects. <italic>Snord116del</italic> mice responded as quickly to thermal pain as their WT littermates.</p><p>With respect to motor function, the mouse model differs from the human disorder. In PWS subjects, motor milestones are typically delayed by one to two years due to infantile central hypotonia. Although muscle tone improves with age, deficits in strength, coordination, balance, and motor planning may continue. Growth hormone treatment, by increasing muscle mass, can improve motor skills. In the <italic>Snord116</italic> deletion mouse model, we observed normal locomotor activity and excellent wire-hanging ability. Although initially the deletion mice performed similarly or even better than controls on the rotarod, they did not improve upon training, indicating a motor learning deficiency in the presence of good motor strength. Thus, we propose that in PWS subjects, the motor deficit may not solely be due to hypotonia, but an independent motor learning deficit may also be at play.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Energy homeostasis regulation and food seeking behavior</title><p>What causes the hyperphagia and food-seeking behavior in PWS is unknown. At least three non-exclusive theories have been discussed. First, the hypothalamus, the center for energy homeostasis, may be defective. Second, neuro-imaging studies of PWS subjects indicated that the brain regions involved in reward and motivation, such as amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex, may be activated in the addiction-like food seeking behavior of individuals with PWS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Holsen1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Miller1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Third, in studies of eating behavior, PWS individuals had longer meal times <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Zipf1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Lindgren1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref> and were insensitive to satiety signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Hinton1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. We will now evaluate these hypotheses in the light of the results of our studies,</p><p>In <italic>Snord116del</italic> mice, the energy homeostasis regulation was normal under several testing conditions. First, the deletion mice were able to reduce their total food intake in response to higher caloric food and kept a more stable body weight than did WT controls. Second, the deletion mice were able to compensate for fasting with the same precision as the WT littermates, and that distinguishes <italic>Snord116del</italic> mice from other genetic models of obesity, such as <italic>ob/ob</italic> (leptin-null) mice, or those with hypothalamic neuronal ablation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Xu1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Third, the deletion mice were able to maintain their core body temperature in a 4&#x000b0;C environment, in contrast to many obese mouse mutants, such as <italic>ob/ob</italic>, <italic>db/db</italic> (null for leptin receptor), and <italic>stat3</italic>-/- mice, that quickly become hypothermic in the cold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Yen1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Gao1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. Fourth, the <italic>Snord116</italic> deletion mice do not become obese even though the adults have increased daily food intake compared to WT. As we found no evidence of a deficiency in homeostasis regulation of food intake and energy expenditure, we propose that the pathophysiology of PWS does not involve a defect in energy homeostasis regulation, but rather, in behavioral aspects of overeating. Mutant mice, however, must have a way to maintain stable body weight despite their hyperphagia, a mechanism apparently lacking in humans with PWS.</p><p>Extensive studies on stress and feeding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Pecoraro1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref> indicate that increased stress may lead to increased cortisol levels and to increased feeding of palatable food. We considered the hypothesis that elevated stress might be the cause for hyperphagia in PWS, but found no evidence to support it. First, cortisol levels were reportedly normal in PWS children <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-LAllemand1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Second, the hyperphagia in PWS is not associated with seeking palatable food, but with a craving for any food items, and when restricted, even from trash. Third, during the first two days in the metabolic chamber, the WT mice reduced their food intake and lost body weight, which is a normal response to a stressful novel environment. The <italic>Snord116del</italic> mice, however, showed attenuated feeding inhibition, suggesting that their drive to feed overrides any fear and anxiety caused by the novel environment. In summary, in both human PWS subjects and our deletion mice, there is no evidence that increased levels of anxiety or stress is the cause for hyperphagia.</p><p>Based on eating studies in humans, it was proposed that PWS is a genetic model of starvation instead of food addiction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Holland1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistent with this proposal, PWS subjects do value food items more than other objects. In a recent functional MRI study, PWS individuals had higher activities of blood oxygen dependent response to pictures of food than to pictures of animals or tools. The signal was located in the medial pre-frontal region which is known to mediate reward <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Miller1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. These PWS subjects had normal insulin, glucose and triglyceride levels. Hence, the food seeking behavior is not caused by energy insufficiency, but rather by an abnormal response of the brain in the presence of sufficient fuel. Consistent with this notion, the <italic>Snord116del</italic> mice did not lose as much weight as the WT when their caloric intake was restricted. Thus, energy insufficiency is not likely to cause their hyperphagia.</p><p>Studies comparing food intake behavior of young PWS individuals and non-PWS obese controls showed that the PWS group spent more time eating, and ate more food <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Zipf1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, PWS subjects, on average, ate three times more calories to attain a similar feeling of decreased hunger as did a lean control group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Holland2">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Fieldstone1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>.

Our <italic>Snord116del</italic> mouse model recapitulates the abnormal feeding behavior in human PWS. Their hyperphagia is associated with prolonged meal time, indicating a delay in meal termination that is most likely due to lack of sensing satiety.</p><p>Circulating neuropeptide hormones related to appetite regulation were measured in PWS subjects, and while leptin levels were similar to those in non-PWS obese subjects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Butler1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, plasma levels of ghrelin were elevated in adults <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-DelParigi1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Haqq1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. Ghrelin is produced mostly in the stomach, and circulating levels are normally increased by fasting and reduced after feeding. Increased density of ghrelin-expressing cells was reported in PWS adult gastric tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Choe1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. We found elevated circulating ghrelin in adult <italic>Snord116del</italic> mice which replicates the human data. It could be responsible for their hyperhagia, as in fed <italic>Snord116del</italic> animals, the ghrelin level was more than two-fold higher than in fed WT controls and resembled the fasting level in the WT mice.</p><p>It is puzzling that <italic>Snord116del mice</italic> eat more but retain a lean body composition. The metabolic profile of <italic>Snord116del</italic> mice showed decreased fat utilization, which is consistent with their elevated plasma ghrelin levels, as ghrelin administration in rodents leads to an increased respiratory quotient indicating less fat usage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Tschop1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. Ghrelin administration in normal rodents does not change energy expenditure, and, therefore, the ghrelin-induced decreased fat utilization leads to increased adiposity. In the <italic>Snord116del</italic> mice, however, energy expenditure is increased and body fat content is reduced. Thus, the metabolic profile of <italic>Snord116del</italic> mice does not recapitulate the effects of exogenous ghrelin administration.</p><p>Whether and how hyperghrelinemia causes hyperphagia in PWS individuals and <italic>Snord116del</italic> mice remains an open question. Since the gut hormone does not cross the blood-brain barrier in mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Banks1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>, any relevance of the hyperghrelinemia for the hypothalamic circuits that regulate feeding behavior is uncertain. In human PWS subjects, a short-term clinical trial of somatostatin treatment lowered plasma ghrelin level but failed to reduce appetite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Tan1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. These results are difficult to interpret because somatostatin also suppresses the levels of anorexic peptides such as peptide YY. Future work crossing <italic>Snord116del</italic> mice with ghrelin-null mice and mice lacking the ghrelin receptor (also called growth hormone secretagogue receptor, GHS-R, GeneID: 208188) may define the role of ghrelin in the phenotype of <italic>Snord116del</italic> mice.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Why is <italic>Snord116</italic> imprinted?</title><p>The function of imprinted genes in placental mammals is to regulate the growth of fetal and placental tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Reik1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. Imprinting is thought to have evolved from a conflict between maternal and paternal genomes for the allocation of maternal resources. Paternally expressed genes promote growth (<italic>Igf2, Peg1, Peg3, Ins1/2, Slc38a4</italic>), and experimental knock-out of these genes restricts fetal and placental growth. Maternally expressed genes have the opposite effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Reik2">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. While the main site of this intergenomic conflict is the placenta, we propose that the paradigm may extend to neonatal life. During the period before weaning, there is competition for maternal milk. Remarkably, the <italic>Snord116del</italic> mice were of normal size at birth and were not hypotonic, but failed to grow in the first three weeks of life, while they were dependent on maternal milk. As soon as they were weaned and eating on their own, their growth rate normalized. It is, therefore, possible that the primary function of the <italic>Snord116</italic> snoRNA is to promote postnatal growth during the pre-weaning period. PWS infants also fail to thrive during this time, even when nutrition is normalized via tube feeding.

In response, the appetite regulatory circuits may become wired in such a way that the &#x0201c;lack-of-satiety&#x0201d; signal is permanently on and leads, in some unexplored way, to hyperghrelinemia and mealtime extension.</p><p>Not all imprinted genes can be functionally linked to the conflict hypothesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001709-Tycko1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>.

With respect to developing rational therapeutic interventions, we expect that drugs used for correcting addiction, which target the incentive control mechanisms in brain, will not be effective, and that research must focus on the sense of satiety required for meal termination.
