IL-12, a critical Th1 cytokine secreted by antigen presenting cells (APCs) is suppressed by Vpr, implicating it as an important virulence factor. We hypothesize that Vpr protein packaged in the virion may be required for disabling APCs of the first infected mucosal tissues. Consistent with this idea are reports that defects in the C-terminus of Vpr are associated with long-term non-progression.</p></sec><sec><title>Principal Findings</title><p>Vpr RNA amplified from various sources was electroporated into monocyte-derived DC and IL-12 levels in supernatants were analyzed. The analysis of previously reported C-terminal Vpr mutations demonstrate that they do not alleviate the block of IL-12 secretion. However, a novel single conservative amino acid substitution, R90K, reverses the IL-12 suppression. Analysis of 1226 Vpr protein sequences demonstrated arginine (R) present at position 90 in 98.8&#x00025;, with other substitutions at low frequency. Furthermore, none of sequences report lysine (K) in position 90. Vpr clones harboring the reported substitutions in position 90 were studied for their ability to suppress IL-12. Our data demonstrates that none of tested substitutions other than K relieve IL-12 suppression. This suggests a natural selection for sequences which suppress IL-12 secretion by DC and against mutations which relieve such suppression. Further analyses demonstrated that the R90K, as well as deletion of the C-terminus, directs the Vpr protein for rapid degradation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study supports Vpr as an HIV virulence factor during HIV infection and for the first time provides a link between evolutionary conservation of Vpr and its ability to suppress IL-12 secretion by DC. DC activated in the presence of Vpr would be defective in the production of IL-12, thus contributing to the prevailing Th2 cytokine profile associated with progressive HIV disease. These findings should be considered in the design of future immunotherapies that incorporate Vpr as an antigen.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human immunodeficiency virus I (HIV- I) possesses many weapons to evade the immune system of an infected individual. High sequence variability of the HIV genome allows viral escape from both humoral and cellular immune responses. HIV mutations leading to CTL escape are attributed to the failure of cellular immunity to control HIV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005853-Gulzar1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Recent studies demonstrating an inverse correlation between the frequency of CTL escape via mutation of HIV antigens and the replicative capacity of the virus further confirm this idea <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005853-Rousseau1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Mutations that evade inhibition of compounds comprising HAART regimens are also well documented.</p><p>In addition to direct evasion of immune responses through mutagenesis, HIV also disturbs cytokine profiles in the plasma of HIV patients, thereby impeding effective immune responses against the infection, a feature which is receiving more recognition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005853-Decrion1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The cytokine response to an invading microorganism is critical for priming DC-mediated adaptive immune responses and is subject to tight regulation, particularly in the case of Th-1 polarizing cytokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005853-Langenkamp1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005853-Tureci1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. During early HIV infection Th 1 cytokines are detected in the plasma of infected individuals, however, at later stages of disease, the cytokine profile switches to a Th 2 profile indicative of a decay in the antiviral immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005853-Clerici1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. One of the cytokines associated with Th 1 polarization is IL-12 and it has been reported that its level is decreased in HIV-positive patients versus healthy individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005853-Chehimi1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. The association of IL-12 with productive CD8-mediated cytolytic activity is well documented in tumor models <italic>in vitro</italic> and in human clinical trials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005853-Xu1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005853-Mortarini1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Likewise, the impaired immune response to HIV was shown to be restored <italic>in vitro</italic> by addition of exogenous IL-12 underscoring the critical importance of this cytokine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005853-Clerici2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>IL-12 is produced by activated antigen presenting cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells and its level can be modulated by infection of those cells types with HIV. The viral protein R (Vpr) is thought to contribute to this effect. Monocyte and DC cultures incubated in the presence of extracellular Vpr were shown to downregulate CD80, CD83, and CD86 in these cell types, blocking their activation and maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005853-Muthumani1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Another study supports the observation that Vpr impairs expression of CD80, CD83, and CD86 costimulatory molecules as well and documents that Vpr inhibits IL-12 production and upregulates IL-10 cytokine secretion by DC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005853-Majumder1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. That study implicated Vpr as an important virulence factor in HIV infection and suggested that the suppressed immune responses may be a consequence of Vpr-mediated block of IL-12 production by DC. The association of Vpr mutations with long-term non-progressor (LTNP) status is also consistent with the idea of Vpr as a virulence factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005853-Lum1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005853-Michael1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Approximately 275 molecules of Vpr protein are incorporated into HIV virions released form productively infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005853-Muller1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, Vpr is present during early stages of infection and available to rapidly exert its function on the cells it first encounters, DC of the mucosal membranes.

Argenine in position 77 of Vpr is reported to bind to adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) expressed in the mitochondrial membrane causing its depolarization which leads to the induction of a caspase-dependent pathway and eventual apoptosis. At least two reports link the R77Q substitution in Vpr with long-term non-progression (LTNP) of HIV-infected patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005853-Lum1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005853-Brenner1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

In addition, we created the reverse substitution, Q77R in the p98CN009.8 background.

This study reported that through the involvement of the LXXLL coactivator signature motif, Vpr acts as a potent coactivator of the glucocorticoid receptor pathway and IL-12 is one of the targets regulated by that pathway. The core LXXLL motif in ligand-bound nuclear hormone receptors is necessary and sufficient to bind the cellular transcriptional co-activator proteins, a function known to be disrupted by the AXXLL mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005853-Heery1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.

Cytokine levels in DC culture supernatants collected 24 hrs post-electroporation indicate that RNA encoding the truncated Vpr amplified from template Vpr-2 do not inhibit IL-12 secretion and is similar to the control condition where cells were electroporated with only control GFP RNA. As previously observed, truncated Vpr amplified from Vpr-2 relieved the IL-12 suppression. The full-length Vpr RNA amplified from p98CN009.8 also suppressed the IL-12 secretion. This indicates that Arginine in position 77 is not involved in the regulation of the IL-12 cytokine pathway. Since amino acid 77 is not involved, it was not surprising that the reverse mutant Q77R did not differ from the wild-type p98CN009.8 and suppressed IL-12 secretion as well.</p><p>Our observation that disruption of the core LXXLL motif did not result in suppression of IL-12 secretion is in contrast to reported observations using purified Vpr protein in monocyte cultures. The observed differences of IL-12 levels may be due to the differences in the two experimental systems. This experiment also confirmed our original observation that the MFI of the maturation markers, CD80, CD83, and CD86 are not significantly different from the GFP RNA control, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005853-g003"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>, panel B), nor did the percentage of cells expressing those markers differ between each CD40L DC-matured population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005853-g003"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>, panel C). Expression of AXXLL and R77Q Vpr RNAs was confirmed in vitro (Data not shown). In addition continuous suppression of IL-12 in the DC electroporated with the AXXLL and R77Q Vpr RNA indirectly suggests lack of those mutations on the expression of Vpr in DC. The lower levels of maturation markers expressed by the GFP RNA-electroporated control cells was due to the lack of co-transfection with CD40L RNA, which is required to achieve full DC maturation in this system.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>The C-terminal domain structure is important for Vpr-mediated suppression of IL-12 secretion by DC</title><p>Given than none of the mutations tested above demonstrated any impact on IL-12 secretion, we next created a new series of mutations within the C-terminal region: R90K as well as deletion of the last three amino acid residues, eliminating both S94 and S96 (&#x00394;SRS). These residues are reported to be important for transactivation of Vpr and induction of G2 cell cycle arrest (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005853-Badley1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>). The R90K and &#x00394;SRS mutants were created in the background of the p98CN009.8 clone. The RNAs transcribed from these cDNA fragments were electroporated into DC followed by an IL-12 Elisa assay on 24 hr supernatants. As a control the RNAs were electroporated in the absence of any Vpr RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005853-g004"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>). In this experiment the use of the C-terminal truncated form of Vpr versus full-length (WT) Vpr (1 &#x000b5;g of RNA per 10<sup>6</sup> DC) demonstrated relief of IL-12 suppression. More interestingly, cultures of DC electroporated with R90K Vpr had levels of IL-12 comparable to those observed using the C-terminal Vpr truncation or in the complete absence of Vpr RNA (GFP control). The same result was obtained with p98CN009.8 Vpr RNAs and its mutants transfected into DC at 5 &#x000b5;g RNA per 10<sup>6</sup> DC (data not shown). The data also repeated with all Vpr mutants created in the Vpr-2 genetic background (data not shown). The viability of the DC cultures post electroporation was 93&#x02013;94&#x00025; for all conditions in this experiment; therefore the different IL-12 levels measured in the supernatants were not due to different numbers of viable cells in the cultures. The percent of viable dendritic cells vary from experiment to experiment because of different donor material used to generate the DCs. Therefore the viability data should be derived from intra assay conditions. These data clearly show that a single conservative amino acid substitution, R90K, in full length Vpr prevents the IL- 12 blockade in DC.</p><fig id="pone-0005853-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005853.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Vpr R90K mutation restores IL-12 secretion from DC.</title><p>Analysis of IL-12 secretion profile and phenotype of the DC transfected with Vpr mutants in C-terminal region.

Since all of the proteins were efficiently translated <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005853-g005"><bold>Figure 5</bold></xref>, panel A), the differences in the expression levels in DC cannot be explained by the differential translational competence of the RNAs.

In the presence of lactacystin, there was an accumulation of the Vpr-specific signals using lysates of DC electroporated with truncated Vpr or the R90K mutant.

This idea is supported by a study in rhesus macaques where inclusion of the Vpr accessory gene in an experimental plasmid-based vaccine containing Nef antigen markedly reduced Th1 type responses compared to the vaccine containing only the Nef antigen, which led to decreased CD4 T cell counts and increased viral loads <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005853-Muthumani2">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Negative effects attributed to Vpr manifested by downregulation of costimulatory molecules and suppression of IL-12 secretion have been reported. In contrast to previous reports, our study did not confirm the observation of CD83, CD86, and CD80 downregulation. This may be the due to the difference in delivery system of Vpr to the DC. The study by Muthumani <italic>et. al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005853-Muthumani1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> used Vpr recombinant protein which was co-incubated with the DC and Majumder <italic>et. al.</italic> used DC transfected with HIV Vpr&#x0002b; proviral constructs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005853-Majumder1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> whereas in our study Vpr expression is achieved using translation-competent RNA electroporated into the DC. The Vpr RNA is translated in the cytoplasm of the DC and is a highly homogeneous expression system which bypasses the need for Vpr RNA transcription and may possibly deliver the functional Vpr to different subcellular compartments compared to other expression methods or the provision of exogenous Vpr protein. As a consequence, variable effects may be observed.</p><p>Detailed analysis of the C-terminal region did not support any previously reported mutations in the C-terminal region as modulators of IL-12 expression levels. Mirani <italic>et al</italic>, desribed downregulation of IL-12 production via a GR-like function in cultured monocytes by adding purified recombinant Vpr protein and modulating the effect on IL-12 with the GR antagonist, RU486 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005853-Mirani1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. The direct Vpr GR-like effect on IL-12 secretion in our system was elucidated by mutating the LXXLL motif to AXXLL which is reported to inactivate the nuclear receptor function. However, side-by-side comparison of the DC electroporated with two Vpr RNAs encoding either a functional LXXLL motif or containing the inactivating mutation, AXXLL, did not demonstrate any difference in the ability to express the IL-12. Additionally, the R77Q mutation of Vpr is thought to be associated with long-term control of HIV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005853-Lum1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005853-Mologni1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. If preservation of IL-12 expression is associated with the LTNP phenotype, R77Q was a good candidate for testing in the IL-12 secretion assay. However, our data show that in a direct comparison of RNA encoding wild-type R77 and the Q77 mutant, in otherwise identical Vpr amino acid backgrounds, no difference in IL-12 secretion is observed.</p><p>Interestingly, a high rate of Vpr mutations and other defects in the C-terminal domain are described in LTNP cohorts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005853-Zhao1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005853-Caly1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. The deletion of the last three amino acids did not change the ability of Vpr to modulate IL-12 secretion, however, the R90K substitution revealed complete reversal of IL-12 suppression, restoring the level to that observed with the truncation of the entire C-terminal Vpr domain. Interestingly, sequence analysis of Vpr within the Los Alamos Database revealed no such mutants. The analysis revealed that other amino acid substitutions such as R90G and R90S are present, but at a cumulative frequency not exceeding 1.3&#x00025;. Reports of the R90K substitution were found by a manual search of the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005853-Zhao1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005853-Cali1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> and in both cases this mutation was isolated from a patient exhibiting an LTNP phenotype. It is therefore possible to envision that strains of HIV encoding R90K have lower virulence. Virus encoding Vpr R90K may be unable to block IL-12 secretion. IL-12 cytokine is a component of LTNP phenotype in HIV infected individuals, and is a common feature with healthy individuals. Our analysis of amino acids reported at position 90 indicated that R (arginine) is highly conserved. None of the amino acids reported in this position tested in our assay relieve IL-12 suppression and the R90K substitution is the only substitution which restored the Il-12 secretion profile. These data taken together suggest that HIV naturally selects for a sequence encoding for amino acids which suppress IL-12 secretion by DC and against the mutation(s) which relieves this suppression.</p><p>NMR structural analysis of the C-terminal region of Vpr suggests it has a dimeric structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005853-Schuler1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005853-Bourbigot1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> which is confirmed experimentally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005853-Schuler1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Studies of the C-terminus predicted the dimeric structure of the full length Vpr protein in solution and the dimerization was postulated to be biologically relevant. Our data demonstrate that the intact C-terminus is important for the suppression of IL-12. It would be of interest to explore whether the R90K amino acid substitution causes disruption of the Vpr dimeric structure. The amino acids previously described by Schuler <italic>et al</italic> resulting in the disruption of the dimers do not involve amino acid position 90 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005853-Schuler1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Our study uncovers the mechanism of how the R90K substitution allows for IL-12 secretion in the DCs.The R90K substitution perhaps is recognized as a defect and directs Vpr for rapid degradation. This would suggest that the R90K substitution is not directly involved in activation of the IL-12 secretion pathway; rather the R90K substitution alleviates the suppressive effect of wild-type and other amino acids found in this position through the reduction of intracellular Vpr protein levels. In summary, our study documents a single amino acid substitution which is not found in most of the reported HIV genomes. We predict that selective pressure exists to preserve an amino acid at position 90 which supports IL-12 suppression. The R90K substitution relieves IL-12 suppression and is selected against, since other amino acids more distantly related to R than K are observed in infected subjects. This finding provides further support for Vpr as a virulence factor during HIV infection. The DC matured in the presence of Vpr are defective in the production of IL-12 and eventually lose their ability to orchestrate productive T cell responses thus mediating, at least in part, the switch from Th1 to Th2 cytokine production which is a hallmark of progression to AIDS.</p><p>The physiologic contribution of Vpr to natural viral infection and persistence is perplexing. The negative influence of IL-12 blockade on adaptive antiviral immunity is in apparent conflict with studies which highlight Vpr as a dominant immune target. Cytotoxic CTL responses against Vpr in HIV infection are well documented <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005853-Addo1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> and Vpr is described as an antigen to which CTL responses are preferentially directed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005853-Altfeld1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.

The ability to utilize Vpr as a component of experimental immunotherapeutics may be particularly important. since a systematic bioinformatic analysis of the Clade C HIV proteome revealed that HIV-1 mutations in Vpr which confer escape from CTL recognition can result in the lowest viral fitness compared to those directed against any other HIV protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005853-Rousseau1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.
