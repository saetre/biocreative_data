Until recently, most cases of bacterial keratitis were associated with trauma or ocular surface diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. However, with the increase in the population of contact lens wearers, contact lens wear has become one of the major predisposing factors for microbial keratitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. Gram-positive bacteria are the predominant microbiological organisms associated with bacterial keratitis (83% of all positive cultures), and gram-negative bacteria account for only 17% of all bacterial keratitis. However, gram-negative bacteria, mainly <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, account for 30% of all bacterial keratitis in contact lens wearers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. In addition, Bourcier reported that 80.1% of bacterial keratitis cases caused by gram-negative organisms were found in contact lens wearers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>].</p><p>It was recently reported that <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> was isolated in 71% of the culture-positive cases of contact lens-related keratitis, and it was the most common isolate in Australia (44.2%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>].</p><p>Many pathophysiological effects of contact lens wear have been reported, such as allergic, toxic, mechanical, and osmotic effects. One of the important effects of contact lens wear was the induced hypoxia and hypercapnia of the corneas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>].</p><p>The corneal epithelial cells are the first line of defense against invading pathogens. One of the mechanisms for this resistance is the antimicrobial components of the tear film, e.g., lactoferrin, lysozyme, mucins, and defensins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>].</p><p>Recent investigations of the innate immune system have suggested that toll-like receptor systems are involved in the immune system on the ocular surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>].</p><p>Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of innate immune-recognizing receptors that recognize the conserved structure of microbes, termed pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). TLR4, a member of the TLR family, has been studied extensively in pathogen-mediated host responses, and it functions as a primary detector of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of gram-negative bacteria. Activation of TLR4 induces inflammatory responses by initiating multiple intracellular signaling events, including the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&#x003ba;B), which ultimately leads to the synthesis and release of many proinflammatory mediators and adhesion molecules, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-), and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1). On the ocular surface, TLR4 with a cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14) and LPS-binding protein (LBP) was reported to induce immune responses against infiltrating gram-negative bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>].</p><p>The purpose of this study was to determine whether hypoxia is involved in the activation of the TLR 4 signaling systems in human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs), in the LPS-induced expressions of TLR 4, and in the release of inflammatory cytokines as well as activation of NF-&#x003ba;B. To accomplish this, experiments were conducted on a simian virus 40-immortalized human corneal epithelial cell (SV40-HCEC) line under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. We also examined the expression of the mRNA of TLR4 in the HCECs of hydrogel soft contact lens (SCL) wearers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Human subjects</title><p>All procedures on human subjects were performed in accordance with the tenets of the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>].

We hypothesized that the altered expression of the mRNA of <italic>TLR4</italic> in HCECs was most likely due to the hypoxia induced by the contact lens wear. Our findings demonstrated that HCECs and SV40-HCECs express the mRNA of <italic>TLR4</italic>, and the level of expression was decreased in SV40-HCECs cultured under hypoxic conditions.

These findings are in agreement with studies reporting that <italic>TLR4</italic> expression was reduced by hypoxia in other type of cells and organs, e.g., cultured pulmonary artery endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]. On the other hand, the mRNA and protein levels of <italic>TLR4</italic> were up-regulated by hypoxia in a cultured microglia cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>].

Their results were in good agreement with our results on SV40-HCEs cultured under 2% O<sub>2</sub> for 48 h prior to exposure to LPS. The differences in the types of cells and organs, and in the culture conditions, may account for the different <italic>TLR4</italic> expression.

On the other hand, there have been reports that the cytokine response induced by activation of TLR4 signaling due to LPS exposure was barely detected in corneal epithelial cells in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. In a more recent study, sCD14 and LPS-binding protein (LBP), which are LPS receptor proteins, were identified in human tears and found to mediate the LPS-induced innate immune response by amplifying corneal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. In this study, NF&#x003ba;B activation was detected, followed by increased expression of <italic>IL-6</italic> and <italic>IL-8</italic> in SV40-HCECs when stimulated by LPS derived from <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> that was co-incubated with sCD14 and LBP. Our results supported those of Blais et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>] and Huang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>], and indicated that the TLR4 signaling systems may play a role in corneal epithelial cells. In our culture system, LPS exposure caused a significant decrease in the mRNA expression of <italic>IL-6</italic> and <italic>IL-8</italic> protein production under hypoxic conditions. In addition, immunoblotting showed that the LPS-induced NF&#x003ba;B activation was also decreased due to hypoxia. Thus, hypoxia attenuated not only the <italic>TLR4</italic> expression, but also the LPS-induced TLR 4 signaling pathways.</p><p>It has been demonstrated that hypoxia activates many transcriptional factors, including NF&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>]. Our findings are in contrast to those reported earlier. However, we investigated the effects of hypoxia on the LPS-induced NF&#x003ba;B activation or cytokine production, whereas the earlier studies investigated the effect of hypoxia on NF&#x003ba;B activation only. It has been reported that hypoxia up-regulated <italic>TLR4</italic> mRNA expression and enhanced the IRF-3 pathway, whereas it decreased the LPS-induced NF&#x003ba;B pathways in microglial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>]. Recently, it was reported that cigarette smoke causing hypoxia reduced <italic>TLR4</italic> mRNA and LPS responsiveness, and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) had a more significant association with reduced <italic>TLR4</italic> expression than less severe disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>]. The expression of <italic>TLR4</italic> may have important implications for inflammation and infection in response to pathogens.</p><p>Thus, NF&#x003ba;B activation and cytokine production are regulated complex interactions. It may be possible that hypoxia decreased the LPS-induced NF&#x003ba;B activation in the TLR4 signaling pathway, although there are some differences in duration, hypoxic exposure, and the use of different types of cells.</p><p>In conclusion, the expression of <italic>TLR4</italic> was decreased in the HCECs of SCL wearers and SV40-HCECs under hypoxic conditions. In addition, hypoxia decreased the LPS-induced expression of <italic>IL-6</italic> and <italic>IL-8</italic> as well as the activation of NF&#x003ba;B in SV40-HCECs. These results indicate that the contact lens-induced hypoxia may increase the susceptibility to bacterial infections such as <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> by altering the TLR4 signaling pathways.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B) 19791273 from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports,
