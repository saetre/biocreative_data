Yeast cells contain two prominent actin structures, cables and patches, both of which are rapidly assembled and disassembled. Although genetic studies have shown that rapid actin turnover in patches and cables depends on cofilin, how cofilin might control cable disassembly remains unclear, because tropomyosin, a component of actin cables, is thought to protect actin filaments against the depolymerizing activity of ADF/cofilin. We have identified cofilin as a yeast tropomyosin (Tpm1) binding protein through Tpm1 affinity column and mass spectrometry. Using a variety of assays, we show that yeast cofilin can efficiently depolymerize and sever yeast actin filaments decorated with either Tpm1 or mouse tropomyosins TM1 and TM4. Our results suggest that yeast cofilin has the intrinsic ability to promote actin cable turnover, and that the severing activity may rely on its ability to bind Tpm1.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ability to assemble distinct and dynamic actin structures in the same cell is critical for the diverse role of actin in cell motility and morphogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003641-Chhabra1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Surprisingly, we found that the major yeast tropomyosin, Tpm1, has little protective effect against cofilin in a variety of assays, however, a cofilin mutant unable to bind Tpm1 showed diminished ability to sever Tpm1-bound F-actin. These results suggest that yeast cofilin is intrinsically capable of promoting the turnover of tropomyosin-bound F-actin in yeast.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>Because previous studies suggest that tropomyosin inhibits actin depolymerization by cofilin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003641-Bernstein1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, we hypothesized that additional proteins may be required to facilitate cable turnover, possibly through regulation of tropomyosin binding to actin, and set out to identify such proteins through Tpm1 affinity chromatography.

We used a microscopy-based assay to test the effect of Tpm1 on actin severing by substoichiometric amounts of Cof1 (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Pre-polymerized yeast actin was incubated with Cof1 for various lengths of time.

Current thinking on the turnover of tropomyosin-decorated actin structures is influenced by the notion that tropomyosin protects F-actin from the depolymerizing activity of ADF/cofilin. The data presented above show that tropomyosin does not present a barrier for the action of yeast cofilin, suggesting that Cof1 may be intrinsically capable of mediating the turnover of actin cables. This is consistent with the recent observation of a dramatically reduced rate of cable turnover in <italic>cof1</italic> mutant yeast cells, as well as in cells lacking Aip1, an <italic>in vivo</italic> co-factor that enhances ADF/cofilin-mediated actin fragmentation by capping the barbed ends of severed filaments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003641-Okada1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The protective effect of tropomyosin against vertebrate ADF/cofilin is thought to be due to competitive binding of tropomyosin and ADF/cofilin to F-actin. We found surprisingly that Cof1 was associated as a high-scoring binder to Tpm1 affinity column, and that purified Cof1 binds directly to tropomyosin in solution. Although the affinity of this interaction is low in solution, it may occur more extensively on the surface of actin cables where there is a high local concentration of tropomyosin. The interaction between Cof1 and Tpm1 is abolished by <italic>cof1-22</italic>, which encompasses three amino acid substitutions: E134A, R135A, R138A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003641-Lappalainen2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.

Based on these findings, we speculate that whereas the presence of Tpm1 may hinder Cof1's contacts with F-actin, some of these contacts may be replaced by the interaction between Tpm1 and Cof1. The latter could either alter the association of Tpm1 with F-actin or could help stabilize the overall interaction of Cof1 with F-actin in order to cause the structural changes in the filament that lead to fragmentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003641-Bamburg1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>A previous study found that <italic>cof1-22</italic> also reduces the rate of actin patch turnover, and the extent of this reduction parallels the effect of the mutations on Cof1-induced actin depolymerization <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003641-Lappalainen1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

These observations, together with a lack of localization of Cof1 along actin cables, may suggest that Cof1 promotes cable turnover primarily through its severing activity. Multicellular organisms express many isoforms of ADF/cofilin and tropomyosin due to gene duplication and alternative splicing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003641-McGough1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003641-Gunning1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.
