Two gene families have been shown to play a role in the genetic regulation of longevity; the Sirtuin and FOXO families. It is also established that nuclear Sirtuins interact with and under specific cellular conditions regulate the activity of FOXO gene family proteins. Thus, we hypothesize that a mitochondrial Sirtuin (<italic>SIRT3</italic>) might also interact with and regulate the activity of the FOXO proteins. To address this we used HCT116 cells overexpressing either wild-type or a catalytically inactive dominant negative <italic>SIRT3</italic>. For the first time we establish that FOXO3a is also a mitochondrial protein and forms a physical interaction with SIRT3 in mitochondria. Overexpression of a wild-type <italic>SIRT3</italic> gene increase FOXO3a DNA-binding activity as well as FOXO3a dependent gene expression. Biochemical analysis of HCT116 cells over expressing the deacetylation mutant, as compared to wild-type <italic>SIRT3</italic> gene, demonstrated an overall oxidized intracellular environment, as monitored by increase in intracellular superoxide and oxidized glutathione levels. As such, we propose that <italic>SIRT3</italic> and FOXO3a comprise a potential mitochondrial signaling cascade response pathway.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>SIRT3</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>FOXO3a</italic></kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>Superoxide</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>One theme emerging over the last several years is that aging is a complex, genetically regulated cellular process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>. Genes critical to longevity have been isolated and characterized in several model systems including yeast and <italic>C. elegans</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>. Sirtuin family genes first came to attention because their <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> homolog (<italic>Sir2</italic>) was shown to regulate both replicative and overall lifespan by caloric restriction (CR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>. In humans and mice there are seven Sirtuins, two that are located in the nucleus (<italic>SIRT1</italic>, <italic>6</italic>, and <italic>7</italic>), one in the cytoplasm and nucleus (<italic>SIRT2</italic>), and 3 are localized to the mitochondria (<italic>SIRT3</italic>, <italic>4</italic>, and <italic>5</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>. While yeast <italic>Sir2</italic> is a NAD+ dependent deacetylase, mammalian Sirtuins have more varied targets, including either deacetylase or ADP-ribosyltransferase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>.</p><p>It is clear that sirtuins regulate a series of essential intracellular processes that defend the cell against multiple types of cellular damage, including oxidative damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>. These observations imply that Sirtuin genes may be metabolic guardians that could play a central role in longevity by regulating cellular or organelle renewal. That is, as cells and critical intracellular organelles slowly degrade from age related oxidative stress, Sirtuin genes may respond to this by activating signaling pathways to repair damage.</p><p>When outlining a course of investigation for the potential role of Sirtuins as organelle surveillance genes, we chose to examine the mitochondrial inner membrane protein <italic>SIRT3</italic> for several reasons. First, it has long been suggested that the mitochondria play a role in aging and oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>. Second, mitochondrial electron transport chains reduce of O<sub>2</sub> to form superoxide (O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02022;-</sup>), leading to oxidative stress which plays a role in genomic instability and aging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>. Third, <italic>SIRT3</italic> localization to the inner mitochondrial membrane is consistent with a role in monitoring and responding to conditions harmful to electron transport, activating processes to minimize mitochondrial damage</p><p>The <italic>FOXO</italic> family of transcription factors: FOXO1, FOXO3a, FOXO4 and FOXO6 are the human homologs of the <italic>daf-16 C. elegans</italic> gene. <italic>Daf-16</italic> is the master regulator of dauer formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref> and contributes to the regulation of lifespan in nematodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>. FOXO transcription factors appear to regulate a wide range of intracellular processes including metabolism and cellular resistance to various forms of oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>. It is also established that sirtuins interact with, and under specific cellular conditions, regulate that activity of FOXO gene family proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>. Thus, we chose to investigate if <italic>SIRT3</italic> might also interact with and regulate the activity of any of the FOXO proteins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell lines and Plasmids</title><p>HCT-116 (human colon carcinoma) and Cos-7 cells were cultured in McCoy's 5A media, containing 10% heat-inactivated (56&#x000b0;C, 30min) fetal bovine serum (FBS) and. supplemented with penicillin (100 Units/mL) and streptomycin (100&#x003bc;g/mL). The expression vector pcDNA4 was obtained from Promega, Inc. pCMV-SIRT3-wt and pCMV-SIRT3-mt were a kind gift from Toren Finkel (National Institutes of Health).

Permanent cell lines expressing wild-type <italic>SIRT3</italic> (wt-SIRT3) or the deacetylase mutant (mt-SIRT3) (supplemental Fig. S1) were constructed by transfecting pcDNA4, pCMV-SIRT3-wt, or pCMV-SIRT3 in HCT116 cells using FuGene 6 and selected with zeosin (supplemental Fig. S2). For this work cell lines expressing the various SIRT3 genes are referred to as wt-SIRT3 or mt-SIRT3 while plasmids expressing these genes are denoted as pCMV-SIRT3-wt or pCMV-SIRT3-mt (supplemental Fig. S1).

Mitochondria extracts were prepared using kit provided by Pierce (Rockford, Il). Briefly cells were lysed by dounce homogenization in lysis buffer followed by centrifugation at 700 x g to remove the nuclear fraction along with cell debris. The supernatant was then spun at 3,000 x g for 15 minuets to isolate the mitochondria fraction. Trypan blue exclusion analysis was performed to check for lysis efficiency following dounce homogenization. Western samples were loaded into denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gels, membranes were probed with anti-SIRT3 (See supplement) or anti-FOXO3a antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA).</p></sec><sec><title>Co-transfections, Luciferase Assays, and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation</title><p>For transient assays, cells were plated at 2 &#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> cells per 100-mm plate, co-transfected, and harvested after 36 hrs.

We sought to establish whether the mitochondrial localized <italic>SIRT3</italic> may also form a physical interaction with the FOXO family protein, FOXO3a, using co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) techniques. Carboxy-terminally myc tagged wild-type (p-myc-hSIRT3-wt), and mutant (p-myc-hSIRT3-mt) <italic>SIRT3</italic> expression vectors were transfected into Cos-7 cells followed by Co-IP with an anti-myc antibody.

These cells were used to determine if the FOXO3a &#x02013; SIRT3 interaction occurs in the mitochondria or the cytosol. Co-IP experiments were repeated using the HCT116 <italic>SIRT3</italic> expressing stable cell lines. FOXO3a was found to interact with SIRT3 in both whole cell (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B) and mitochondrial extracts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C). All fractions and samples in the Co-IP experiments were checked for the presence of SIRT3, using a SIRT3 specific antibody (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting , PA), as well as tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and Cytochrome C (Mitosciences, Eugene, OR) to ensure fraction purity (data not shown). These experiments demonstrate that both wild type and mutant <italic>SIRT3</italic> form a physical interaction with FOXO3a in mitochondrial extracts.</p></sec><sec><title>FOX3a is a mitochondrial protein</title><p>FOXO3a interacts with SIRT3 in mitochondrial extracts <italic>in vitro</italic> thus, we chose to investigate if any of the FOXO3a proteins might be localized to the mitochondrial tissue lysates as well. Western analysis of mitochondrial samples from human heart (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A) and liver (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B) (Microscience, Inc) lysates clearly shows that FOXO3a is present in the mitochondrial cellular fractions. Anti-tubulin and anti-cytochrome C antibodies were used as controls to determine mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial protein fractions. As expected, similar results were seen in HCT116 and HCT116 cells genetically altered to express either the wild-type or deacetylation null SIRT3 genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C).</p></sec><sec><title>SIRT3 activates FOXO3a dependent gene expression</title><p>To determine if FOXO3a activates promoter activity in our system, three FOXO3a expression vectors were employed that: (1) express the wild-type gene that is still inhibited by Akt (pCMV-FOXO3a-wt); (2) express a mutant gene that appears to be a dominant negative (pCMV-mt-FOXO3a); and (3) express a dominant positive (constitutively active) gene that cannot be phosphorylated and inhibited by Akt (pCMV-N-FOXO3a) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>. Co-transfection of these three plasmids with p3400-MnSOD-Luc, which contains the MnSOD promoter and its two consensus FOXO binding sites (supplemental Fig. S3) cloned upstream of luciferase, demonstrated that pCMV-N-FOXO3a increased p3400-MnSOD-Luc luciferase activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A, bar 3). In contrast, co-transfection with pCMV-mt-FOXO3a decreased <italic>MnSOD</italic> expression of the reporter (bar 2) as compared to the control, wild-type vector, pCMV-wt-FOXO3a (bar 1). These results clearly demonstrate that <italic>FOXO3a</italic> can activate the expression of the reporter gene.</p><p>A <italic>FOXO3a</italic> luciferase reporter construct was made that contains three <italic>FOXO3a</italic> binding sites fused to the luciferase gene (p3x-FOXO-tk-Luc) and this reporter vector was used to determine <italic>FOXO3a</italic> dependent gene expression as measured by luciferase levels. p3x-FOXO-tk-Luc was subsequently co-transfected into HCT116 cells with either pCMV-SIRT3-wt or pCMV-SIRT3-mt expression vectors. Expression of the wild-type <italic>SIRT3</italic> increases luciferase activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B, bar 1 versus bar 2).

In contrast, co-transfection of pCMV-SIRT3-wt with a mutant <italic>FOXO3a</italic> expression vector (pCMV-mt-FOXO3a) decreased p3x-FOXO-tk-Luc driven luciferase activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C, bar 2 versus 3. These results suggest that in transient assays FOXO3a dependent gene expression that is induced by SIRT3 is prevent by expression of a mutant FOXO3a protein.</p><p>ChIP analysis showed that wt-SIRT3 cells have an increase in FOXO3a binding to upstream regulatory regions of gene promoters that each contain two canonical FOXO3a binding sites roughly 1 kb upstream of the transcription start site (supplemental Fig. S3). FOXO3a binding to both the <italic>MnSOD</italic> (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>D, upper panel) and <italic>SCO2</italic> (lower panel) promoters is increased in the wt-SIRT3, as compared to mt-SIRT3 cells.

HCT116 cells were used since they have nearly undetectable SIRT3 protein (data not shown). These results showed an increase in luciferase activity in cells overexpressing the wild-type SIRT3 gene, as compared to the mutant gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A). p3400-MnSOD-Luc was also co-transfected into HCT116 cells with either pCMV-SIRT3-wt or pCMV-SIRT3-mt <italic>SIRT3</italic> expression vector.

The mitochondria are a major source of superoxide formation; and the accumulation of superoxide, from decreased election transport, is thought be a source of oxidative damage associated with degenerative diseases and aging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>. Thus, it seemed logical to propose that one function of SIRT3 may be to mediate intracellular superoxide levels.

This idea is based on the observations that: (1) FOXO3a is present in the mitochondria and physically interacts with SIRT3; (2) <italic>SIRT3</italic> increases the DNA-binding of FOXO3a at two promoters resulting in an increase in gene expression; and (3) altered <italic>SIRT3 </italic>function results in altered and increased intracellular O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x025cf;-</sup>. The results of these experiments all support the hypothesis that SIRT3 may be a mitochondrial surveillance factor that detects metabolic imbalances involving O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02022;- </sup>production and induces specific pathways to respond to these conditions.</p><p>While it is tempting to suggest that SIRT3 is initiating a signaling pathway in the mitochondria and sending it to the nucleus to activate gene expression via FOXO3a our results do not confirm this specific idea and the experimental assays to validate this idea do not exist. However, one possibility is that SIRT3 is both a mitochondrial and a cytoplasmic protein. Several manuscripts have been published suggest that SIRT3 is a mitochondrial protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref> while others imply a more complex cellular localization pattern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>. In our two model systems using HCT116 and <italic>SIRT3</italic> knockout derived MEFs, SIRT3 appears present only in the mitochondria. However, this does not rule out a small amount of the protein might be in either the cytoplasm or nucleus.</p><p>Several previous publications suggest that <italic>SIRT3</italic> may play a role in the regulation of mitochondrial metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref> as well as acetyl-CoA synthetase acetylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>. It also appears that <italic>SIRT3</italic> is the primary mammalian <italic>Sir2</italic> homolog that regulates global mitochondrial lysine acetylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>. However, the mechanism and physiological function of <italic>SIRT3</italic> has not been determined. The results presented here, when coupled with others, suggest that at least one function of <italic>SIRT3</italic> serves as a sensor of small reactive oxygen molecules and initiates specific cellular signaling pathways. In this model the induction of <italic>SCO</italic>2 and <italic>MnSOD</italic> would be an appropriate response to detoxification O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02022;-</sup>.</p><p>The mitochondria are key organelles that maintain multiple cellular processes and decreases in function are critical to age-related diseases such as diabetes, neurodegeneration, and carcinogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>. SIRT3 is located near the electron transport chain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref> and is at an ideal location to function as a guardian gene against the accumulation of small reactive molecules that might induce cellular damages. Mitochondria are a major source of superoxide formed by the reduction of oxygen during electron transport. The oxidative damage caused by the reactive oxygen species derived from superoxide is believed to be a major cause of degenerative diseases associated with aging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>. However, it has also been suggested that that physiological levels of O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02022;-</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production are essential for normal biological signaling processes leading to the attainment of a normal lifespan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>. Thus, these results suggest a potential mechanism where the normal production of reactive oxygen species, such as O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x025cf;-</sup>, induces specific pathways that act to repair and, perhaps more importantly, to renew organelle functions.</p><p>On the other hand, the induction of proteins such as <italic>SCO2</italic>, should decrease O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02022;-</sup> levels indirectly by increasing the efficiency of the four electron reduction of O<sub>2</sub>. <italic>SCO2</italic> is a mitochondrial membrane-bound protein involved in copper supply for the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>. CcO catalyzes the four-electron reduction of molecular oxygen to H<sub>2</sub>O and couples this reduction with proton translocation across the inner membrane to improve mitochondrial respiration efficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>. CcO increases the efficiency of four electron transfer to O<sub>2</sub> to 2H<sub>2</sub>O in Complex IV and as such, reduces the residence time of electrons at upstream sites capable of mediating one electron reductions of O<sub>2</sub>. Thus, the induction of <italic>SCO2</italic> could theoretically decrease O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02022;-</sup> production at sites in the electron transport chains upstream of Complex IV (Complexes I, II, and III).</p><p>This work also suggests that there may be mitochondrial surveillance genes that sense organelle distress and pass signals to the nucleus to initiate the expression of nuclear genes to prevent or repair any functional damage to mitochondria. While no direct mechanism is presented for how this signaling is transduced out of the mitochondria, it does seem logical that such a reparative pathway would exist and has been proposed by others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>. Finally, since <italic>SIRT3</italic> is the primary deacetylase in the mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref> we would propose that deacetylation, perhaps induced by nutrient deprivation or oxidative stress, may activate families of evolutionary conserved reparative genes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SMs1"><caption><p>Supplemental Figures S1-S3</p></caption><media xlink:href="ijbsv04p0291s1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported (in part) by the Intramural Research Program of the NIH, NCI, and CCR and NIH R01-CA100045, NIH P01-CA66081, NIH F32-CA110611.
