Cell surface labeling with the E-selectin extracellular domain/Fc chimera (exE-selectin/Fc) showed that the transmigration capacity of breast cancer cells was correlated to both the expression level and localization pattern of E-selectin binding protein(s) on the tumor cell surface. The exE-selectin/Fc strongly bound to metastatic MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-468 cells, but not non-metastatic MCF-7 and T47D cells. Binding of exE-selectin/Fc was abolished by removal of tumor cell surface sialyl lewis x (sLe<sup>x</sup>) moieties. Employing an exE-selectin/Fc affinity column, we further purified the counterreceptor of E-selectin from metastatic breast cancer cells. The N-terminal protein sequence and cDNA sequence identified this E-selectin ligand as a &#x0223c;170 kD human CD44 variant 4 (CD44v4). Purified CD44v4 showed a high affinity for E-selectin via sLe<sup>x</sup> moieties and, as expected, MDA-MB-231 cell adhesion to and migration across HUVEC monolayers were significantly reduced by down-regulation of tumor cell CD44v4 via CD44v4-specific siRNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>We demonstrated, for the first time, that breast cancer cell CD44v4 is a major E-selectin ligand in facilitating tumor cell migration across endothelial monolayers.

A key step in the metastasis process is migration of tumor cells across the blood vessel-lining endothelial monolayers. It has been widely reported that endothelial cell E-selectin plays a pivotal role in mediating cell&#x02013;cell interactions between tumor cells and endothelial monolayers during tumor metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001826-Nubel1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001826-Laferriere1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001826-Laferriere2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The major ligand of endothelial E-selectin on the tumor cell surface has been identified as a sialylated glycan determinant, such as sialyl Lewis x moieties (sLe<sup>x</sup>), which decorate the terminal extensions of O-linked or N-linked carbohydrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001826-Lesley1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Interaction of tumor cell surface sLe<sup>x</sup> moieties and sLe<sup>x</sup>-decorated glycoproteins with endothelium E-selectin is a major component of cancer invasion and metastasis. A positive correlation between expression of E-selectin ligands such as sLe<sup>x</sup> moieties in tumor cells and tumor cell metastasis or invasion has been widely reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001826-Tozawa1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001826-Koike1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. In breast cancer cells, several studies have also demonstrated a critical role for E-selectin in regulating tumor cell transendothelial migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001826-Tozeren1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001826-Moss1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the identity of the E-selectin ligand in breast cancer cells and its physiological contribution in regulating tumor cell transendothelial migration is unknown.</p><p>Several leukocyte adhesion molecules, including leukocyte P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) and E-selectin ligand-1 (ESL-1), have been identified as ligands for endothelial E-selectin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001826-McEver1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. These interactions between PSGL-1, ESL-1 and E-selectin play a significant role in regulating leukocyte rolling process. Dimitroff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001826-Dimitroff1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> reported that both E-selectin binding forms of PSGL-1 and ESL-1 are expressed on the human bone-metastatic prostate tumor MDA PCa 2b cell line, suggesting that these molecules may serve as E-selectin ligands in mediating tumor cell adhesion to or migration across endothelium. However, it is unclear whether breast cancer cells or other non-bone derived metastatic tumor cells express PSGL-1 or ESL-1. Recently, studies have demonstrated that CD44 variant isoforms (CD44v) in LS174T colon carcinoma cells possess selectin binding activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001826-Hanley1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001826-Napier1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting a broader role for CD44v in regulating tumor cell metastasis, particularly the event of migration across the vascular endothelium. CD44 was originally identified as a leukocyte homing receptor, and its globular amino-terminal domain contains hyaluronic acid (HA)&#x02013;binding motifs and several potential glycosylation sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001826-Bajorath1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Through its interaction with hyaluronan, CD44 serves as an adhesion molecule in cell&#x02013;substrate and cell&#x02013;cell interactions, lymphocyte recruitment to inflammatory sites, and tumor metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001826-Khan1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001826-Wang1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001826-Naor1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001826-Spessotto1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. The size of the CD44 molecule ranges from the standard 85&#x02013;95 kD form (CD44s) to larger variant isoforms of 200 kD or more due to RNA splicing and post-translational modifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001826-Underhill1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Functional characterization of different isoforms of the CD44 family, however, is still limited. Many cancer cell types express high levels of specific variants of CD44 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001826-Mine1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. The animal model studies have shown that interfering with the binding of CD44 to its ligand inhibits local tumor growth and metastatic spread <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001826-Guo1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001826-Zahalka1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. During tumor metastasis, cells detach from the primary tumor, penetrate the basement membrane into the connective tissue, and invade adjacent organs structures, including blood vessels. Tumor cells are subsequently transported to metastatic sites through the blood stream. However, the mechanisms by which CD44 modulates the tumor cell transendothelial migration process are not fully understood.</p><p>In the present study, we demonstrated that metastatic breast cancer cells strongly express a &#x0223c;170 kD CD44 variant 4 (CD44v4). The expression level and localization pattern of CD44v4 in breast cancer cells is closely correlated with tumor cell migratory capability across TNF-&#x003b1; pre-activated HUVEC monolayers. Our results further showed that CD44v4 is highly decorated with E-selectin binding sLe<sup>x</sup> moieties and serves as a major adhesive molecule in mediating breast cancer cell transendothelial metastasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Breast cancer cell transendothelial migration is E-selectin dependent</title><p>HUVEC monolayers cultured on collagen-coated permeable Transwell filters were used as a model for endothelial cell monolayers to assess the transmigration of breast cancer cells. HUVEC monolayers were pre-activated with 25 ng/ml TNF-&#x003b1; for 6 h to upregulate the expression of adhesion molecules before the tumor migration assay. Five breast cancer cell lines including MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-468, T47D, and MCF-7 were assessed for their migratory capability across HUVEC monolayers. The general migratory capability of these five breast cancer cells has been well-studied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001826-Wang1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001826-Lechertier1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001826-Bouker1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Various breast cancer cells have a marked differential migratory capability. Among five cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-468 have a higher invasive ability and are generally regarded as metastatic breast cancer cells while MCF-7 and T47D cells have a lower invasive ability and are regarded as non-metastatic cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001826-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, MDA-MB-231 had the highest transmigration rate across TNF-&#x003b1; pre-activated HUVEC <underline>monolayers</underline> while MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-468 cells demonstrated relatively modest transmigration. Compared to these metastatic breast cancer cells, MCF-7 cells and T47D cells had a significantly lower transmigration rate. The transmigration of MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-468 cross TNF-&#x003b1; pre-activated HUVEC monolayers was further characterized in the presence of various functional inhibitory antibodies. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001826-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, migration of MDA-MB-231 cells cross HUVEC monolayers was significantly blocked by anti-E-selectin antibody, but not by inhibitory antibodies against LFA-1 or VLA-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001826-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>), suggesting that metastasis of breast cancer cells across TNF-&#x003b1; pre-activated HUVEC monolayers is specifically dependent on HUVEC E-selectin.

A direct binding assay of breast cancer cells with soluble exE-selectin/Fc was performed. In the experiment, exE-selectin/Fc or Fc-only (served as a control) was incubated with non-fixed breast cancer cells at 4&#x000b0;C for 1 h, and bound Fc was detected by fluorescently conjugated goat anti-rabbit Fc antibody. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001826-g002">Figure 2</xref>, the exE-selectin/Fc recombinant strongly bound to MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-468 cell surfaces.

A similar negative staining of exE-selectin/Fc was observed in T47D cells (data not shown). Since sLe<sup>x</sup> moieties are major binding partners of E-selectin, we further determined whether the binding of exE-selectin/Fc to metastatic breast cancer cells was dependant on tumor cell surface sLe<sup>x</sup> moieties. As shown in the figure, removal of sLe<sup>x</sup> moieties from the tumor cell surface by neuraminidase treatment markedly reduced the binding of exE-selectin/Fc. Taken together, these results suggested that sLe<sup>x</sup> moieties are likely involved in mediating the binding interactions of breast cancer cells to E-selectin and that breast cancer cell transendothelial migration is positively correlated to the binding activity of the exE-selectin/Fc recombinant to tumor cells.</p><fig id="pone-0001826-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001826.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Binding of soluble exE-selectin/Fc recombinant to breast cancer cells via sLe<sup>x</sup> moieties on the tumor cell surface.</title><p>Trypsin-elicited breast cancer cells were surface labeled with soluble exE-selectin/Fc or Fc-only as detailed in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001826-g003">Figure 3</xref>, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-468 cells were all strongly labeled with exE-selectin/Fc, while MCF-7 and T47D were not or only weakly stained. This observation was in agreement with flow cytometry analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001826-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). However, among three metastatic breast cancer cells, the binding patterns of the exE-selectin/Fc recombinant were strikingly different. On the surface of highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells, exE-selectin/Fc bound strongly to the migrating front of the cell (arrows), particularly the &#x0201c;spiking&#x0201d; cellular protrusions (arrowheads). In contrast, exE-selectin/Fc was found to be concentrated at sites of cell-cell contact in both MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-468 cells, which had relatively less transmigration compared to MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001826-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). These results suggested that metastatic breast cancer cell transendothelial migration might also be correlated to the localization pattern of E-selectin binding protein(s) on the tumor cell surface. Co-staining MDA-MB-231 cells with exE-selectin/Fc recombinant and rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin showed that F-actin (red, arrows) was predominantly localized at the exE-selectin/Fc binding region (green, arrows), including the &#x0201c;spiking&#x0201d; cellular protrusions (arrowheads). The co-distribution of F-actin and the exE-selectin/Fc recombinant in metastatic breast cancer cells suggests that the E-selectin binding protein(s) were mainly localized to the leading edge or migrating front of MDA-MB-231 cells during metastasis.</p><fig id="pone-0001826-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001826.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Localization of potential E-selectin ligand(s) on the breast cancer cell surface.</title><p>A: After blocking with 5&#x00025; normal goat serum in PBS, breast cancer cells cultured in a tissue culture dish were incubated with exE-selectin/Fc (10 &#x000b5;g/ml) in blocking solution for 1 h at 4&#x000b0;C.

During tumor cell metastasis, binding interactions generally occurred between selectin-expressed endothelial cell monolayers and selectin ligands on tumor cells. The binding capacity of tumor cells to blood vessel-lining endothelium through E-selectin was closely correlated to the metastatic capability of breast cancer cells. A previous study demonstrated that E-selectin ligation regulated the transendothelial migration of colon cancer cells via mediating p38 and ERK MAP kinase activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001826-Tremblay1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. However, E-selectin ligands expressed in migrating tumor cells, particularly breast cancer cells, are not well-characterized. In the present study, we show that the CD44 variant isoform 4 (CD44v4) is a major metastatic breast cancer cell glycoprotein decorated with sLe<sup>x</sup> moieties and serves as an E-selectin ligand in facilitating tumor cell migration across TNF-&#x003b1; pre-activated HUVEC monolayers.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>CD44v4 mediates breast cancer cell adhesion to endothelial monolayers via interacting with E-selectin</title><p>In the present study, the binding activity of breast cancer cells to E-selectin was carefully characterized at the cellular level. Using soluble E-selectin/Fc recombinant as a probe, we directly detected the binding of E-selectin to living breast cancer cells. The results clearly demonstrated a positive correlation between the binding activity of soluble E-selectin/Fc recombinant and the ability of breast cancer cells to migrate across endothelial cell monolayers. Firstly, E-selectin binding protein(s) are abundantly expressed in metastatic breast tumor cells including MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-468, but not in non-metastatic tumor cells such as MCF-7 and T47D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001826-g002">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001826-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Secondly, labeling of E-selectin/Fc recombinant on the breast cancer cell surface also demonstrated a strikingly different pattern among various metastatic tumor cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001826-g003">Figure 3</xref>, in MDA-MB-231 cells, which had the highest transmigration rate across TNF-&#x003b1; pre-activated HUVECs, the E-selectin/Fc recombinant strongly bound to the migrating cell front, particularly the &#x0201c;spiking&#x0201d; structures of cell protrusions. In contrast, in MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-468 cells, which had relative lower transmigration rates compared to MDA-MB-231 cells, binding of the E-selectin/Fc recombinant was mainly found at sites of cell-cell contacts. Taken together, these results suggest that breast cancer cell transendothelial migration is closely correlated to both the expression level and localization pattern of cell surface E-selectin binding protein(s). In the present study, we selected HUVEC as a model endothelial cell line to characterize the interactions between breast cancer cells and endothelial monolayers during tumor metastasis is mainly due to the simplicity of HUVEC system. However, for better understanding breast tumor cell migration across blood vessel-lining endothelium under pathophysiologic conditions, primary cultured endothelial cells that are isolated from particular blood vessels should be used. Moreover, in order to mimic the real physiological situation of tumor metastasis, tumor cell transmigration across HUVEC monolayers pre-activated by TNF-&#x003b1; should be also measured under flow condition.</p><p>The binding of the E-selectin/Fc recombinant to metastatic breast cancer cells was largely reduced by removal of sLe<sup>x</sup> moieties from tumor cell surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001826-g002">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001826-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>), suggesting that the E-selectin binding protein(s) in metastatic breast cancer cells are decorated with sLe<sup>x</sup> moieties and that sLe<sup>x</sup> moieties play a significant role in mediating tumor cell binding to E-selectin.

Differential utilization of the 10 variable region exons, as well as variations in N- or O-glycosylation and glycosaminoglycanation (heparan sulfate or chondroitin sulfate), generates multiple CD44 isoforms.
