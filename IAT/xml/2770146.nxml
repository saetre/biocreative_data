We used two electrode voltage clamp and single channel recording to show that TASK-3 responds to voltage in a way that reveals such gating. In wild-type channels, <italic>P</italic><sub>open</sub> was very low at negative voltages, but increased with depolarisation. The effect of voltage was relatively weak and the gating charge small, &#x0223c;0.17. Mutants A237T (in M4) and N133A (in M2) increased <italic>P</italic><sub>open</sub> at a given voltage, increasing mean open time and the number of openings per burst. In addition, the relationship between <italic>P</italic><sub>open</sub> and voltage was shifted to less positive voltages. Mutation of putative hinge glycines (G117A, G231A), residues that are conserved throughout the tandem pore channel family, reduced <italic>P</italic><sub>open</sub> at a given voltage, shifting the relationship with voltage to a more positive potential range. None of these mutants substantially affected the response of the channel to extracellular acidification. We have used the results from single channel recording to develop a simple kinetic model to show how gating occurs through two classes of conformation change, with two routes out of the open state, as expected if gating occurs both at the selectivity filter and at its cytoplasmic mouth.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Tandem pore potassium channels help set the resting membrane potential of a wide variety of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Goldstein <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Patel &#x00026; Honor&#x000e9;, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Kim, 2005</xref>). Among such channels, the acid sensitive TASK-3 (K<sub>2P</sub>9.1) is widely expressed in the central nervous system, regulating the excitability of a number of neuronal populations (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Han <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Washburn <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Brickley <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>).

This gating process, occurring at the selectivity filter, is likely to be similar to that described for C-type inactivation in Kv channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Yellen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bichet <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Zilberberg <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>).</p><p>There is currently little or no evidence that mammalian TASK channels are gated at the inner, cytoplasmic mouth. Such channels are, however, modulated by a number of factors. For example, depolarisation of the membrane gates TASK channels open (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Lopes <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Yuill <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>), though the effect of voltage is weak compared with that on channels of the voltage gated superfamily. Further, while TASK channels are down-regulated by Gq coupled receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Millar <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Czirj&#x000e1;k <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Talley <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>), channel opening is promoted by volatile anaesthetics such as halothane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Talley &#x00026; Bayliss, 2002</xref>). The responses to G&#x003b1;q on the one hand and to halothane on the other occur independently of the response to extracellular acidification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Talley &#x00026; Bayliss, 2002</xref>), implying that a further gating mechanism occurs.</p><p>Studies of bacterial K<sup>+</sup> channels in shut (KcsA, KirBac1.1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Doyle <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Kuo <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>) and in open form (MthK, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Jiang <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>) show gating to involve straightening and flexion of membrane helices about a glycine hinge residue. Such glycine hinge residues are conserved in the M2 and M4 membrane helices of all tandem pore K<sup>+</sup> channels. This conservation suggests that similar gating changes occur in these channels and may be the mechanism through which TASK channels respond to Gq coupled receptors, to volatile anaesthetics, and to voltage.</p><p>Here, we consider the response of TASK-3 channels to voltage as a means of investigating channel gating. We find residues in M2 and M4 whose mutation increases channel open state probability. We also find that mutation of putative hinge glycines (G117 and G231), preventing easy flexion of M2 and M4, holds channels shut. All of these mutant channels show an alteration in the relationship between <italic>P</italic><sub>open</sub> and voltage, though the apparent gating charge is not altered. None of the mutants showed markedly altered sensitivity to changes in extracellular pH. Our results are consistent with channel gating occurring at the channel inner mouth, through movements of M2 and M4.</p><p>Since it is proposed that channels are opened and shut both at the selectivity filter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Yuill <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>) and at the cytoplasmic mouth, we have used the results of single channel recording to develop a simple kinetic model to test whether the hypothesis of two modes of gating can account for our results (see Discussion). A model with two routes from the open to different shut states accounts well for our results.</p><p>Some of the results have been described in abstract form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Stanfield <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>).

W. Davies (Department of Cell Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Leicester). Channel amplitudes were determined by fitting an amplitude histogram of data points. Open and shut durations were determined in single channel patches using a cursor set mid way between the shut and open levels. In fitting such relationships, given the filter setting and digitisation rates, a minimum resolution of 100 &#x003bc;s was applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Colquhoun &#x00026; Sigworth, 1995</xref>). No correction was applied for missed events owing to the small reduction in dwell times (&#x0223c;5%) that resulted from such correction. The distributions of dwell times in open and shut states were fitted with appropriate exponential functions.

The fitting was first done against data from wild-type channels and repeated for data from a mutant channel type (A237T).

Thus, mutants where residues close to this inner mouth are altered (A237T, N133A and N133A/A237T) stabilise the open state; mutants of hinge glycine residues (G117A and G231A) reduce the time spent open. The mutants shift the relationship between <italic>P</italic><sub>open</sub> and voltage: A237T and N133A to less positive voltages; G117A and G231A to more positive voltages. Mutants that alter side chain&#x02013;side chain interactions in the region where gating occurs alter the stability of shut and open states. Our results, analysed using the theory of mutant cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Carter <italic>et al.</italic> 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Horovitz, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Hidalgo &#x00026; MacKinnon, 1995</xref>), indicate that in the mutant A237T, an H-bond contributes to stabilising the open state. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Ben-Abu <italic>et al</italic>.

This <italic>Drosophila</italic> channel is nevertheless shut by mutation of hinge glycine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Ben-Abu <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>), as occurs here with TASK-3.</p><p>We do not have an explanation as to how the response to voltage is initiated. It occurs in the absence of any obvious voltage sensor, such as is found in Kv channels. In KcsA, voltage-dependent gating occurs in part at the selectivity filter and is driven by a charged residue (E71) in this filter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Cordero-Morales <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). No such charged residue is present in either TASK-1 or in TASK-3 and introducing a charge into the filter of TASK-1 did not alter the response to voltage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Yuill <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). Further, replacement in TASK-3 of certain charged residues elsewhere in the structure &#x02013; in mutants K107Q, E130Q and R245Q &#x02013; appears not to affect the response to voltage (data not shown). Nor does voltage sensing arise from the dipole moment of the helices that move to open the channel. These moving elements are the C-terminal parts of M2 and M4, lying on the cytoplasmic side of the hinge glycines G117 and G231. In each case, the negatively charged end of the dipole is at the cytoplasmic end (the C-terminal end) of the helices. If the helix dipole senses voltage field, the helices M2 and M4 would straighten under depolarisation, favouring the shut state. A possibility is that increasing occupancy by K<sup>+</sup> raises <italic>P</italic><sub>open</sub> and certainly the response to voltage is affected by the concentration of permeant ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Lopes <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>).</p><p>Whatever the mechanism that initiates the response to voltage, there are striking parallels between this response and the response of K<sub>2P</sub> channels to Gq coupled receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Millar <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Czirj&#x000e1;k <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Talley <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>) and to volatile anaesthetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Talley &#x00026; Bayliss, 2002</xref>).
