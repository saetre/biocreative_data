They act as molecular switches by cycling between active GTP and inactive GDP-bound states, through the action of two classes of regulatory proteins: a) guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEFs) and b) GTP-ase activating proteins (GAPs). Genome wide analysis of the lower eukaryote <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum </italic>revealed a surprisingly large number of Ras Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors (RasGEFs). RasGEFs promote the activation of Ras proteins by catalyzing the exchange of GDP for GTP, thus conferring to RasGEFs the role of main activator of Ras proteins. Up to date only four RasGEFs, which are all non-redundant either for growth or development, have been characterized in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>. We report here the identification and characterization of a fifth non-redundant GEF, RasGEFM.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>RasGEFM is a multi-domain protein containing six poly-proline stretches, a DEP, RasGEFN and RasGEF catalytic domain. The <italic>rasGEFM </italic>gene is differentially expressed during growth and development. Inactivation of the gene results in cells that form small, flat aggregates and fail to develop further. Expression of genes required for aggregation is delayed. Chemotaxis towards cAMP is impaired in the mutant, due to inability to inhibit lateral pseudopods. Endogenous cAMP accumulates during early development to a much lower extent than in wild type cells. Adenylyl cyclase activation in response to cAMP pulses is strongly reduced, by contrast guanylyl cyclase is stimulated to higher levels than in the wild type. The actin polymerization response to cAMP is also altered in the mutant. Cyclic AMP pulsing for several hours partially rescues the mutant. <italic>In vitro </italic>experiments suggest that RasGEFM acts downstream of the cAMP receptor but upstream of the G protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The data indicate that RasGEFM is involved in the establishment of the cAMP relay system. We propose that RasGEFM is a component of a Ras regulated pathway, which integrate signals acting as positive regulator for adenylyl cyclase and negative regulator for guanylyl cyclase. Altered guanylyl cyclase, combined with defective regulation of actin polymerization, results in altered chemotaxis.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The <italic>ras </italic>proto-oncogenes encode membrane-bound small monomeric GTP-binding proteins with molecular masses ranging between 20 to 40 kDa, which are highly conserved in the course of eukaryotic evolution. Ras proteins control fundamental cell processes including proliferation, differentiation, motility and polarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Like heterotrimeric G proteins they act as molecular switches cycling between two interconvertible forms: inactive, when bound to guanosine diphosphate (GDP), and active, when bound to guanosine triphosphate (GTP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Conversion between GTP and GDP-bound states is tightly regulated by two set of proteins: guanosine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs). GEF proteins cause activation by catalysing the exchange of bound GDP with GTP, whereas GAPs inactivate Ras by increasing their rate of GTP hydrolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Systems composed by GTPases, GAPs and GEFs allow great versatility in the construction of signaling pathways. Signals can be amplified (one GEF could activate several GTPases), integrated (several pathways activate the same GEF and GAP, and the behaviour of one GTPase depends on the total effect of all its GEFs and GAPs), or split (one GTPase induces many effects) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This versatility allows small GTPases to mediate a wide range of different biological functions among different organisms. For example in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>RasGEF CDC25 is required for Ras mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase and it is essential for proliferation and spore germination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], whereas in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the RasGEF Son-of-sevenless (Sos) functions upstream of Ras in R7 photoreceptor differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Despite its relatively small genome, <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>possesses a relatively large number of <italic>ras </italic>and <italic>rasGEF </italic>encoding genes. <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>is a lower eukaryote with a simple life cycle, consisting of growth and multicellular development, the latter being fully completed in approximately 24 hours. The amoebae live as single cells, growing by feeding on bacteria, which are taken up by phagocytosis, and dividing by binary fission. Upon starvation, cells start releasing the chemoattractant cAMP and gather by chemotaxis to form multicellular aggregates. Within each aggregate, cells differentiate into prespore and several classes of prestalk cells, while undergoing a series of morphogenetic changes, which end up in the formation of fruiting bodies. Fruiting bodies consist of slender stalks of vacuolated, dead cells, bearing on top spores encapsulated in sori.</p><p>Here we report the identification and characterization of a novel RasGEF, named RasGEFM. To date only four <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>RasGEFs have been characterized, namely <italic>rasGEFA</italic>, formerly known as <italic>aimless </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], <italic>rasGEFB </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], <italic>gbpC </italic>and <italic>gbpD </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The latter two encode for unconventional RasGEFs. GbpC possesses a RasGEF domain coupled to a cyclic nucleotide-binding domain, which is associated with a MAPKKK-like kinase domain, Leucine Rich Repeats (LRR) and a Ras domain. GbpD is highly similar to GbpC, but it lacks the Ras, MAPKKK-like and the LRR domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. These two proteins control myosin phosphorylation and, as consequence, cell motility and chemotaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The GEF protein encoded by the <italic>rasGEFA </italic>gene is essential for cell aggregation, acting at the level of adenylyl cyclase activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>cells lacking <italic>rasGEFB </italic>are defective in early development, although they eventually form tiny but normally proportioned fruiting bodies. Furthermore, these cells move unusually rapidly and show severe impairment in cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Here we present evidences that RasGEFM is involved in a Ras regulatory network, required for cAMP receptor dependent signal transduction. Mutant cells lacking the <italic>rasGEFM </italic>gene produce very small, flat aggregates and fail to develop further. Chemotaxis is altered in the mutant, due to inability of the cells to polarize properly. The phenotype can be partially rescued by pulsing cells with cAMP. We show that RasGEFM is involved in controlling cAMP relay and cell motility.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification, cloning and sequence analysis of <italic>D.d.rasGEFM</italic></title><p>To identify Ras regulator proteins in the <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>genome a bioinformatic approach was taken, based on a tBLASTn algorithm, to search the <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>genome project databases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Using known RasGEFs domains as query, we identified approximately 30 genes encoding for proteins with significant homology to putative RasGEF proteins (unpublished results). Among the putative RasGEF encoding genes, one of these, designated as <italic>Dd rasGEFM</italic>, was isolated for functional studies. The <italic>rasGEFM </italic>gene, located on the chromosome 2, is organized in 4 exons, which are interrupted by 3 introns. Southern blot analyses performed under high and low stringency conditions, and extensive analysis of the <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>genomic sequence databases, indicated that the gene is present as single locus (data not shown). The <italic>rasGEFM </italic>gene encodes a relatively large multi-domain protein of 929 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of approximately 102 kDa, whose domain structure is displayed in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. The amino-terminal region of the protein contains six short poly-proline stretches, which are putative consensus docking site for SH3 or WW domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] whereas the carboxy-terminal region possesses the putative RasGEF catalytic domain. BLAST analysis shows that the catalytic domain, with evolutionary identical amino acid residues conserved, shares high homology with the murine p140GRF (30% identity, 59% homology). Among <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>RasGEF proteins, the most similar to RasGEFM are two putative uncharacterized RasGEFs (RasGEFE and RasGEFJ) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><p>Between the catalytic domain and the amino-terminal poly-proline rich region, there are a DEP and a RasGEF-N terminal domain. The RasGEF-N terminal module is peculiar only for Ras specific GEFs, and it is likely to have a purely structural role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The DEP (Dishevelled-Eglin-Pleckstrin homology) domain, located between the catalytic and the RasGEF-N terminal domain, shows significant homology to the DEP domain of the human pleckstrin 25% overall homology and 11% identity, versus a 27% overall homology and 14% identity displayed by the <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>GbpC DEP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] when compared to the human plekstrin counterpart. DEP is a widespread motif found in proteins involved in Wnt signalling, in regulators of G protein signalling (RGS), in pleckstrin and other signalling proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], responsible either for targeting proteins to the membrane or mediating protein-protein interaction, although the underlying molecular mechanism remains still unknown.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic representation of the different functional domains of RasGEFM identified with MotifScan</bold>. The RasGEFM protein contains the following recognizable modules: 6 proline rich regions, a RasGEF N-terminal domain, a DEP domain and a RasGEF catalytic domain.

This transition is triggered by starvation of the cells, is enhanced by periodic release of cAMP, and results in the coordinated activation and repression of aggregation-specific and growth-phase genes, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. We examined the expression pattern of the <italic>rasGEFM </italic>gene during development of wild-type cells and in three mutant strains, which are blocked at sequential steps of development. Two transcripts were detected in Northern blots: the upper one is present during growth and at the beginning of development and disappears at 6 hours of starvation. The lower transcript is barely visible at the beginning of starvation, reaches its maximal expression at 6 hours of development and decreases thereafter, though being present up to the end of development (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Northern blot analysis of <italic>rasGEFM </italic>expression in parental and mutant strains</bold>. (<italic>A</italic>) Total RNA was extracted from AX2 cells developed in suspension for 0 to 9 hours or on filters. In the latter case the cells were harvested at mound (12 hours), first finger (16 hours) and preculminant (20 hours) stages. The membrane was hybridized to a radiolabelled <italic>rasGEFM </italic>specific probe (probe <italic>a</italic>) corresponding to bp 760&#x02013;1518 of the cDNA clone and to the <italic>actin </italic>gene used as a loading control. (<italic>B</italic>) Total RNA was extracted from different developmental <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>mutants starved in shaking suspension up to 6 hours. LW6 (G protein &#x003b2; subunit minus), HSB1 (PIA <italic>ts</italic>-mutant, defective in the G-protein adenylyl cyclase activation) and HSB50 (mutant blocked at mound stage).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2121-6-43-2"/></fig><p>We examined <italic>rasGEFM </italic>expression in the LW6 mutant lacking the &#x003b2; subunit of heterotrimeric G protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Although two G&#x003b2; genes are present in the <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>genome, disruption of one of them blocks all G protein-dependent pathways in LW6 mutant cells, which fail to respond to and to relay cAMP, to express aggregation specific genes and to develop. In this strain only the <italic>rasGEFM </italic>upper transcript is detected during starvation, while the lower transcript fails to accumulate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). This indicates that up-regulation of the lower transcript is under control of the heterotrimeric G protein. Gene expression was also analyzed in the HSB1 and HSB50 mutants. HSB1 is defective in cAMP relay, due to a temperature-sensitive mutation in the adapter protein PIA, which is essential for adenylyl cyclase activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. HSB1 cells thus fail to aggregate but, in contrast to LW6, express at moderate level aggregation-specific genes and are sensitive to exogenous cAMP pulses. The HSB50 mutant undergoes chemotaxis and aggregation, but is blocked at mound stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In both mutants, the <italic>rasGEFM </italic>expression pattern was similar to that observed in the parental strain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), suggesting that transcription of the lower transcript does not require cAMP relay, even though it may be enhanced by cAMP pulses, similarly to other aggregation-specific genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. It is worth mentioning that the two transcripts may arise from differential splicing or different degree of polyadenylation. Screening 24 cDNA clones obtained by using mRNA from 6-h starved cells resulted in a signle sized cDNA to be present. Sequencing three such clones gave rise to a transcript containing all four exons. Assuming this transcript to correspond to the most abundant mRNA species at this time point, namely the lower band, then we should conclude that differential splicing is unlikely and the upper band is the result of extensive polyadenylation. Additional experiments are required to confirm this hypothesis and to understand this intriguing developmentally regulated changes in <italic>rasGEFM </italic>gene expression.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>rasGEFM </italic>null mutant is delayed in the acquisition of aggregation competence and blocked at the aggregation stage</title><p>To gain insight into the function of <italic>rasGEFM</italic>, the gene was inactivated by homologous recombination. Disruption was confirmed by Southern and Northern blot analysis of the mutant strain, named HSB61 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). HSB61 cells grew normally both in axenic medium, or on bacterial lawn, but were defective in development. In contrast to the parental cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>), which form fruiting bodies after about 24 hours of starvation, HSB61 cells formed small, flattened aggregates, unable to develop into tipped tight mounds (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Aggregate formation was density-dependent. If cells were plated on non-nutrient agar at concentration of 1 or 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup>/cm<sup>2 </sup>no aggregates were formed, whereas control cells formed aggregates. At 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells per cm<sup>2 </sup>the mutant cells formed small aggregates, similar to those shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, but many cells failed to aggregates. Treating cells with cAMP pulses rescued in part the mutant phenotype; if aggregates, formed in suspension after 6&#x02013;8 hours pulses, were transferred on agar, they continued to develop and to form small fruiting bodies, although many cells failed to aggregate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). We have failed to observe cells forming streams, even in 6 to 8 hours pulsed cells, although elongated cells very near to aggregates are found, suggesting that some short-range chemotaxis may occur.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Disruption of the <italic>rasGEFM </italic>gene</bold>.

Intercellular adhesion in <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>is developmentally regulated, as growth-phase cells are weakly adhesive, and this adhesion is completely blocked by EDTA. During the first 5&#x02013;6 hours of development, cells express the adhesion glycoprotein csA on the cell surface, which is responsible for an EDTA-resistant form of adhesion (for a review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]), and at least in part, for post-aggregative pattern formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. We tested the ability of HSB61 cells to develop EDTA-resistant adhesion over the first 8 hours of development. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, HSB61 cells exhibited a delay of 5 to 6 hours in the appearance of EDTA-resistant adhesiveness compared to the parental strain. Cell treatment with cAMP pulses, which are known to stimulate expression of csA as well as several other aggregation-specific genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], accelerated acquisition of EDTA-stable adhesion, though in contrast to the parental strain the mutant cells appeared to be refractory to the pulses for at least 4 hours (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Appearance of EDTA-stable contacts in (<italic>open symbols</italic>) untreated and (<italic>closed symbols</italic>) cAMP treated cells</bold>.

HSB61 cells resulted strongly impaired in chemotaxis, as will be described further below, but their behaviour improved significantly when pulsed with cAMP. Taken together these results suggest that HSB61 cells fail to aggregate properly, due to impaired periodic cAMP signalling, which is required for optimal expression of aggregation-stage specific genes.</p><p>To confirm this hypothesis, we followed the expression of three such genes, namely <italic>carA</italic>, <italic>acaA </italic>and <italic>csA</italic>. <italic>CarA </italic>and <italic>acaA </italic>encode the cAMP receptor cAR1 and adenylyl cyclase A, respectively, whereas <italic>csA </italic>is, as mentioned above, the gene for the cell adhesion glycoprotein csA.

Exogenously supplied cAMP pulses mimic the endogenous oscillations of cAMP and give insight on potential defects in cAMP relay or other cAMP induced responses in mutant cells.

As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>, in response to a cAMP pulse, 5 hours starved and cAMP-treated HSB61 cells displayed a dramatically reduced increase in cAMP compared to AX2 cells. In contrast the cGMP peak in the mutant was about twice that observed in the parental strain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>). Remarkably, when cells were assayed after 9 hours pulsing, cGMP peaked 5 to 10 fold higher compared to AX2 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref>), while the cAMP level increased slightly compared to t5 mutant cells (data not shown). The <italic>rasGEFM </italic>null mutant, therefore, displays significantly increased cGMP and reduced cAMP responses in the pre-aggregative stage and during aggregation compared to the parental strain.

The assay was done with mutant cells pulsed with cAMP for 7 hours, since after such treatment the mutant cells accumulated cAMP to levels comparable to 5-h treated control cells, as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>. GTP&#x003b3;S stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity about 16 and 13 fold in AX2 and HSB61 cells, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>).

The strongly reduced adenylyl cyclase activation by 2'-deoxy-cAMP in the mutant could be due to a lower number of cAMP receptors expressed on the cell surface. To exclude this we performed cAMP binding experiments in both cell lines AX2 and HSB61 pulsed for 5 and 7 hours, respectively. The total amount of cAMP receptors was comparable, as both maximum amount of ligand bound to the receptor (Bmax), and dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) were in the same range in wild type and mutant cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p><bold>GTP&#x003b3;S and 2'-deoxy-cAMP induced adenylyl cyclase activation</bold>.

Therefore, it was tempting to hypothesize that RasGEFM could function as the putative exchange factor for either of these Ras proteins. Activated Ras can be measured by using a Ras Binding Domain (RBD) to affinity purify Ras proteins. Given that the RBD-Ras interaction is dependent on Ras being in a GTP bound form, one can selectively measure activated Ras from cellular lysates. An assay has recently been described for <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>Ras proteins employing the RBD from <italic>S. pombe </italic>Byr2, and it has been shown that both RasC and RasG are transiently activated by cAMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. To determine whether RasGEFM mediates this activation, we challenged 6 hours pulsed AX2 and HSB61 cells with cAMP and observed the kinetics of Ras activation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>). While the levels of both activated RasC and RasG increased upon cAMP stimulation in HSB61, the maximum level of RasG-GTP was greatly reduced relative to AX2, whereas RasC activation was largely unaffected in the mutant. This suggested the possibility that RasGEFM may be partly responsible for mediating the activation of RasG. However, when 10-hour pulsed cells were stimulated with cAMP, RasG activation was restored. Interestingly, the total level of RasG remained at a very high level relative to AX2. This data shows that RasGEFM is unlikely to be an activator of RasC or RasG, and the partial loss of RasG activation seen in 6 hours cells may be a secondary effect of reduced gene expression. In addition, the finding that RasG is activated after prolonged cAMP treatment favours the notion that a developmentally regulated component, regulated by cAMP signalling, is directly or indirectly required for RasG activation.</p><fig position="float" id="F11"><label>Figure 11</label><caption><p><bold>RasC and RasG activation in HSB61 mutant</bold>.

In their movement, AX2 cells eventually adhere to each other into streams, due to outward relay of the signal (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">13</xref>, upper panel). Five hours-starved HSB61 null cells behaved differently: they sensed the gradient and extended a membrane lamella towards the micropipette, but they also extended several lateral pseudopodia with high frequency, thus displaying a severe polarization defect. In contrast to the parental strain, the mutant cells exhibited a rather flattened shape and an apparently increased cell-substratum adhesion. As a result, their chemotactic orientation and motility were strongly reduced (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">13</xref>, middle panel and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">additional file 2</xref>).

Gene expression studies and functional assays indicate that the mutant phenotype is due to defective developmental expression of cAMP relay and are consistent with a role of RasGEFM in regulating cAMP signalling. The mutant phenotype differs, however, from the phenotype displayed by other mutants that are strictly defective in adenylyl cyclase activation, such as mutants in RasGEFA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], PIA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] CRAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] and RasC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].

In contrast to <italic>rasGEFM </italic>null cells, which form small flat aggregates, all these other mutants fail to aggregate, although they respond to cAMP pulses. Their chemotactic motility in response to cAMP diffusing from a microcapillary is also much less impaired, and guanylyl cyclase activation is rather normal and not enhanced as in the <italic>rasGEFM </italic>null mutant.</p><p>These findings indicate that these mutants display different alterations in signal transduction downstream of the cAMP receptor.

It might have been expected, therefore, that RasGEFM would act upstream of RasC. However, we now have direct evidence that RasGEFA directly activates RasC and is the only GEF responsible for the activation of RasC (Kae <italic>et al</italic>, unpublished). Consistent with this result, there was no major effect on the cAMP dependent activation of both RasC and RasG in the <italic>rasGEFM </italic>null cells.</p><p>Several attempts have been performed to try to rescue the HSB61 phenotype but so far none of them succeeded, although a RasGEFM GFP-fused protein of the correct size was expressed (data not shown). This observation, combined with the rather peculiar <italic>rasGEFM </italic>mRNA expression, in which two transcripts are detected and regulated independently, suggests that the failed rescue might be due to the necessity for the RasGEFM protein to be expressed in a regulated way and not under the control of a constitutive promoter, such as the actin 15 promoter. Experiments are in progress in this direction and they will be crucial to confirm that the phenotype is due to direct disruption of the <italic>rasGEFM </italic>gene and not to additional detrimental effects of the transformation. The possibility of a second random mutation, which independently of <italic>rasGEFM </italic>disruption could be responsible for the observed phenotype, cannot be excluded but it seems unlikely to us. The GTP&#x003b3;S inhibition of cAMP binding, together with the stimulating effects of GTP&#x003b3;S on adenylyl cyclase, and the rescuing effect of cAMP, clearly locate the mutant defect upstream of the G protein and suggest a single event to be involved.</p><p>When <italic>rasGEFM </italic>null cells are challenged with a cAMP filled micropipette, the chemotactic response is impaired. Apparently the cells sense the gradient but they seem incapable of organizing a leading front. Moreover, several lateral pseudopodia are continuously extended and retracted. As a consequence, the cell fails to polarize, maintains a rather flattened shape and moves "spastically" towards the micropipette. If mutant cells are treated with cAMP pulses for at least 6 to 8 hours, chemotactic orientation and speed are improved, and many cells become elongated and move faster towards the micropipette.</p><p>Formation of a leading front, acquisition of polarity and suppression of lateral pseudopodia are processes characterized by the redistribution of cytoskeletal components, with F-actin and numerous actin-binding proteins being enriched at the front and myosin II assembled in filaments at the back of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].

These results suggest to us that RasGEFM is not directly involved in mediating a putative Ras-induced actin polymerization. They are instead consistent with the notion that a developmentally regulated component, required for proper actin recruitment in response to chemoattractant, is absent or expressed under a threshold level in the mutant and is induced by prolonged cAMP treatment.</p><p>Taken together our findings support a role for RasGEF M in developmental acquisition of chemotactic efficiency and aggregation competence. The proposed localization of Ras GEFM downstream the cAMP receptor lead us to suggest that Ras GEFM and its cognate Ras may act as dissociating components between G protein coupled receptors and the G protein or molecular switches acting in a G protein independent way. A physical interaction between &#x003b2; 1 adrenergic receptors and a RasGEF has been recently reported in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>A peculiarity of the <italic>RasGEFM </italic>null mutant is the elevated cyclic GMP response to cAMP stimulation both at early and late starvation times, which suggests a role for RasGEFM as negative regulator of cAMP receptor-induced guanylyl cyclase activation. Cyclic GMP accumulation has been proposed to be regulated by adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] and to inhibit pseudopodia formation at the back of the cell by inducing myosin filament formation in the cell cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Myosin filament formation at the presumptive leading front would be counteracted by myosin phosphorylation due to myosin heavy chain kinase A (MHCK-A), which is selectively recruited at the leading front [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. As a result, a high cGMP concentration leads to improved orientation in a chemoattractant gradient, as shown in mutant cells lacking cGMP phosphodiesterase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. <italic>RasGEFM </italic>null cells, challenged with cAMP diffusing from a microcapillary, show, however, reduced orientation and increased lateral pseudopodia, despite a stronger cGMP response to cAMP. It may be argued that cGMP is rapidly hydrolysed in the HSB61 mutant, in contrast to the cGMP phosphodiesterase null cells. However, if cGMP is down-regulated by adaptation, it must be assumed that as long as cells are exposed to a chemoattractant gradient, as occurs when they are stimulated with cAMP diffusing from a microcapillary, adaptation of guanylyl cyclase is switched off [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], and this should lead in <italic>RasGEF M </italic>null cells to constantly higher levels of cGMP. Why is then chemotactic orientation reduced in the mutant?</p><p>A possible explanation for this discrepancy is offered by the reduced actin response to chemoattractant. We have suggested that a developmentally regulated component, which is required for actin recruitment at the presumptive leading front, is lacking/down-regulated in the mutant. Strongly reduced actin polymerization at the front would result in impaired translocation of myosin heavy chain kinase A (MHCK-A), which has been shown to require F-actin binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. As a consequence, a high cGMP level in the mutant, as in wild type cells or PDE null mutants, would induce myosin filaments all over the cell, consistent with its proposed role as global inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], but myosin filaments in the front would not be dissociated by MHCK-A, due to its impaired recruitment. Thus we propose that in the RasGEFM null mutant chemotaxis is inhibited due firstly to altered F-actin polymerization at the presumptive leading front and secondarily to impaired recruitment of MHCK-A.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>All the defects observed in the <italic>rasGEFM </italic>null mutant can be explained by assuming a modulatory role of the RasGEFM close to the cAMP receptor, which regulates guanylyl and adenylyl cyclases. RasGEFM appears to act as a negative regulator of guanylyl cyclase and a positive regulator of adenylyl cyclase. Currently we have no obvious explanation for this opposite activity. It must be kept in mind, however, that in contrast to adenylyl cyclase, which is stimulated by the G&#x003b2; subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein, receptor-dependent stimulation of guanylyl cyclase is more complex and less well understood. Several lines of evidence suggest a role for small GTPases in its activation, independently and in addition to the heterotrimeric G protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. If RasGEFM and its putative Ras target act as receptor-linked molecular switches, this may lead to differential, albeit opposite, effects on heterotrimeric G-protein-dependent or independent pathways. Identifying the putative RasGEFM regulated Ras may help in understanding these complex transduction pathways.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell cultures, growth, and developmental conditions</title><p>Wild type strain AX2-214 and <italic>rasGEFM </italic>null mutant, referred as HSB61, were grown either in liquid nutrient medium at 23&#x000b0;C under shaking at 150 rpm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] or on nutrient agar plates with <italic>Escherichia coli B/2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].
