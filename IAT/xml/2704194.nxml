Large amounts of ROS derived from inflammatory cells cause pro-inflammatory cytokine production. In fact, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>has been reported to augment cytokine production in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Among inflammatory cells, neutrophils are a key player in the inflammatory lung diseases. It is well-known that excessive infiltration of neutrophils is observed in the airways during exacerbations induced by viral infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are simple pattern recognition receptor systems and are known to react with conserved molecular patterns of pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The innate immunity cells also act against viral infections through TLRs including TLR3, TLR7 and TLR8. Human neutrophils possess all functional TLRs except TLR3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and their agonists enhance neutrophil functions such as cytokine release, superoxide generation and phagocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. TLR7 and TLR8, located in the endosome, act as anti-viral receptors for recognizing single strand RNA (ssRNA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], which is present at various phases of viral infection from viral entry to replication. After TLR7 and TLR8 are activated by ssRNA, their signals are transduced through myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD-88) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) leading to enhanced nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) DNA binding activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Activation of NF-kB leads to increased inflammatory gene products such as interleukin-8 (IL-8) and GM-CSF causing neutrophilic inflammation during viral infection. Resiquimod (R848), a potent synthetic agonist of TLR 7/8 has been reported to simulate the effects of ssRNA viruses on TLR 7/8, to prime human neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], and then increase the biosynthesis of lipid mediators through NF-kB activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] suggesting that TLR7 and TLR8 activation might affect the neutrophilic responses.</p><p>Although excessive oxidative stress occurs in the airways of inflammatory lung diseases during exacerbations, it remains unclear whether oxidative stress potentiates the neutrophilic responses against viral infection. Therefore, by using human peripheral neutrophils from healthy never-smoking subjects, the present study was designed to clarify whether oxidative stress can potentiate the TLR8-mediated neutrophilic responses, including cytokine production, chemotaxis and superoxide generation. Furthermore, we also investigated what signal transductions are associated with this potentiation of the neutrophilic responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>Commercially available reagents were obtained as follows: Mono-Poly Resolving Medium was from Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co.

They were never-smokers and had had no infection for 4 weeks preceding the study. Human peripheral blood neutrophils were isolated from whole blood by a density gradient technique using Mono-Poly Resolving Medium as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Briefly, whole blood was collected by vein puncture into tubes containing EDTA anticoagulant. Then, each blood sample was gently mounted onto the same volume of Mono-Poly Resolving Medium without mixing. The samples were centrifuged at 400 &#x000d7; <italic>g </italic>for 20 min at room temperature. The blood was separated into four layers from the top, plasma, lymphocytes/mononuclear cells, neutrophils, and red blood cells. The neutrophil layer was gently collected by a pasteur pipette without aspirating the other layers and put into fresh 20 ml tubes. This procedure allowed us to obtain neutrophils with over 95% purity and viability as determined by trypan blue staining. After washing by phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution and counting the cell numbers, neutrophils were suspended in 10% FCS in RPMI 1640 at a concentration of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml. The neutrophils were isolated before each experiment and used immediately. All replicate experiments in the current study were performed by using neutrophils from different donors. This study was approved by the local ethics committee of Wakayama Medical University School of Medicine.

The preparation was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde fixative solution for 30 min. Endogeneous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubation in 0.3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. After washing, the cells were incubated with anti-TLR8 rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:100 dilution) for 12 hrs at 4&#x000b0;C. Non-specific binding to the antibody was prevented by pre-incubation with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS containing 0.3% Triton-X for 30 min. The immunoreactions were visualized by the indirect immunoperoxidase method using Envision polymer reagent, which is goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with peroxidase labeled dextran (Dako Japan Ltd, Kyoto, Japan), for 1 hour at room temperature. Diaminobenzidine reaction was performed, followed by counterstaining with hematoxirin.

Although R848 or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>enhanced the phosphorylation of NF-kB p65, the phosphorylation was significantly augmented by the combination of R848 and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). To investigate the mechanisms in the enhancement of NF-kB p65 phosphorylation by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, we examined the effect of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>on IkB&#x003b1; expression in the presence of R848.

H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>potentiated the R848-augmented IL-8 release, and this potentiation was reversed by N-acetyl-<sc>L</sc>-cysteine. In addition, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>potentiated the release of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6, and the superoxide generation in the R848 treated neutrophils. Although the expressions of TLR8, MyD88 and TRAF6 were not affected by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>enhanced the phosphorylation of NF-kB and potentiated the IkB&#x003b1; degradation in the R848 treated cells. Furthermore, MG-132, a proteosome inhibitor, reversed the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-potentiated IL-8 release in the R848 treated neutrophils. These results suggested that oxidative stress potentiated the release of various R848-induced cytokines and superoxide generation in human neutrophils through NF-kB activation.</p><p>Previous reports have demonstrated that human peripheral blood neutrophils possessed all known TLRs except TLR3, but the expression levels of TLR7 and its reponses are extremely limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In the present study, R848, a potent synthetic agonist of TLR 7/8, but not the TLR7 ligand R837, enhanced the neutrophilic responses including the cytokine production (IL-8, TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6 and IL-1&#x003b2;), the superoxide generation and the chemotaxis of neutrophils. This is consistent with a previous study, which showed that the influenza virus and R848 stimulated the IL-8 release in neutrophils through the activation of TLR 7/8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. It was also shown that TLR7 knockout neutrophils respond poorly to both the TLR 7/8 ligand and the influenza virus in comparison with wild type neutrophils, suggesting that TLR7 plays an essential role in murine neutrophils. These results are inconsistent with our current study. However, several studies have reported that TLR7 stimulation affects the cytokine release not in human neutrophil, but in murine neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. These results suggest that the discrepancy of the findings with the previous report might be due to differences in the species.</p><p>In the current study, we showed that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>potentiated the cytokine release including IL-8, TNF-&#x003b1;, and IL-6, and the superoxide generation in R848-treated neutrophils. In addition, this potentiation was reversed by N-acethyl-<sc>L</sc>-cysteine suggesting that oxidative stress is associated with the potentiation of the R848-mediated neutrophilic response. A previous report has shown that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>pre-incubation potentiated lipopolysaccharide-induced IL-8 production, and that hydroxy radical scavengers markedly suppressed this potentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. These results are consistent with our findings. Although H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>potentiated the R848-augmented neutrophilic responses, the potentiation seemed to be heterogeneous. Indeed, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>potentiated the R848-augmented IL-8, TNF-&#x003b1;, and IL-6 release, but did not potentiate the IL-1&#x003b2; release. This was an interesting finding because the degree of oxidative stress may modulate the profile of inflammatory mediators during viral infection. In the current study, it remained unclear why the potentiation by oxidative stress was heterogeneous. A future study is needed to explore this issue.</p><p>Hydrogen peroxide enhanced the R848-induced phosphorylation of NF-kB, and potentiated the degradation of IkB&#x003b1;. In addition, a proteosome inhibitor, MG-132, inhibited the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-augmented IL-8 release in the R848-treated neutrophils. Considering that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>did not affect the expression levels of TLR8 or other signaling molecules such as MyD88 or TRAF6, these results suggested that the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-potentiated NF-kB activation could play a central role in the augmentation of the neutrophilic responses. This was consistent with previous reports, which have shown that oxidative stress cooperatively activated NF-kB with other mediators such as TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, the phosphorylation of NF-kB p65 in the vehicle-pretreated and R848-treated group was less than in the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-pretreated and vehicle-treated group. In theory, the phosphorylation in the vehicle-pretreated and R848-treated group should be greater than in the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-pretreated and vehicle-treated group. There is a possible explanation for this discrepancy. Generally, NF-kB is phosphorylated by NF-kB kinase and IkB&#x003b1; kinases when NF-kB is dissociated from IkB&#x003b1; and translocated into the nucleus in various types of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. There is no report that explored the interaction between NF-kB phosphorylation and IkB&#x003b1; degradation in neutrophils under TLR8 activation. Therefore, the finding observed in the current study may be due to an unknown signaling in the R848-treated neutrophils.</p><p>Steroids have been reported to reduce the severity and duration of admission in exacerbations of COPD and asthma. In this study, dexamethasone inhibited the R848-augmented IL-8 release from neutrophils in a dose-dependent manner, and this inhibition was observed in the presence or absence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. These results might indicate that steroids are useful therapeutic agents to attenuate the viral-induced neutrophilic inflammation. However, the pretreatment with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>attenuated the effect of dexamethasone, suggesting that oxidative stress induced the steroid resistance. It has been reported that oxidative stress attenuates the effects of steroids in macrophages and epithelial cells through histone deacetylase 2 inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. This mechanism may also explain the results observed in the present study.</p><p>There are several limitations in the current study. First, we used H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>as a model of oxidative stress. Many previous reports used this in vitro model to mimic the pathophysiological condition of oxidative stress observed in inflammatory lung diseases including COPD and asthma. We used H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>at 0.1 &#x02013; 100 &#x003bc;M in the current study and these concentrations are the same range as in previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. However, we should be careful when extrapolating the findings obtained in this in vitro model to the "real" pathophysiological conditions in inflammatory lung diseases. Second, we used neutrophils isolated from healthy subjects, not from smokers or patients with lung diseases. According to previous reports, the characteristics of neutrophils are altered in patients with COPD compared with healthy subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The neutrophilic responses to TLR activation may be altered in patients with inflammatory lung disease. Third, we used R848 as a synthetic ligand for TLR 7/8. Many reports have used R848 as the ligand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The stimulation of TLR 7/8 by R848 might be different from that of single strand RNA virus infection. In the current study, we attempted to elucidate the effects of oxidants on the TLR8 signaling. To accomplish this, we used R848 for the following reasons. First, R848 is a stable agent and is easy to handle compared with single strand RNA. Second, R848 does not have any other effect except TLR 7/8 stimulation. Indeed, the R848 signaling was abolished by treatment with bafilomycin, an inhibitor of endosomal acidification. Therefore, the findings in the current study seemed to be mediated by TLR8 signaling.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that the TLR8-mediated neutrophilic responses in healthy never-smoking subjects were markedly potentiated by oxidative stress, and this potentiation was mediated by enhanced NF-kB activation. These results suggested that oxidative stress might potentiate the neutrophilic inflammation during viral infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>COPD: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; TLR8: Toll-like receptor 8; H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>: Hydrogen peroxide; NF-kB p65: Nuclear factor-kappa B p65; IkB&#x003b1;: Nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor, alpha; MyD88: Myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88; TRAF6: Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SY carried out the data analysis and drafted the manuscript.
