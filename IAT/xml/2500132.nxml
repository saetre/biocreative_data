It is a circulating factor derived from osteocytes that acts to regulate kidney function and osteogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Yamashita, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Yu and White, 2005</xref>). FGF-23 is essential for maintaining phosphate homeostasis and has been linked to regulation of vitamin D (1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>) metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Yu and White, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Razzaque and Lanske, 2006</xref>). Although these phenomena have been well established, the signaling mechanisms of FGF-23 and potential target genes have yet to be investigated in detail. FGF-23 alone has minimal ability to promote intracellular signaling. Recent studies have shown that the function of FGF-23 is dependent on interaction with a hormone cofactor, Klotho (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kurosu et al., 2006</xref>), which is a trans-membrane protein that binds FGF-23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Torres et al., 2007</xref>). Interaction of Klotho with the FGF receptor 1c (FGFR1c) converts it into a receptor specific for FGF-23 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Urakawa et al., 2006</xref>). Upon formation of a ternary complex with FGF-23 and FGFR1c, phosphorylation of the receptor is achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kurosu et al., 2006</xref>). However, little is known about the downstream effects caused by FGF-23&#x02013;Klotho. In fact, the only significant molecular changes that have currently been observed from FGF-23&#x02013;Klotho function include phosphorylation of extracellular signal&#x02013;regulated kinase (ERK), sodium phosphate transport regulation, and increased Egr-1 (early growth responsive 1) gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Yu and White, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kurosu et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The phenotypes observed from both <italic>Fgf-23<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> and <italic>Klotho<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice are consistent with premature aging. These include shortened life span, severe atrophy of most tissues/organs, soft tissue calcifications, infertility, pulmonary emphysema, osteoporosis, and arteriosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kuro-o et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Razzaque et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Torres et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>Fgf-23<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> and <italic>Klotho<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice also have increased serum phosphate levels. FGF-23&#x02013;Klotho has been found to inhibit phosphate transport in renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (PTEC) by direct regulation of the sodium phosphate cotransporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Yu and White, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Both <italic>Fgf-23<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> and <italic>Klotho<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice have unusually high serum levels of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Tsujikawa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Shimada et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Sitara et al., 2004</xref>). Although vitamin D precursor molecules are steroid derived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Johnson et al., 2002</xref>), an enzyme called 1&#x003b1;-hydroxylase (CYP27B1) is essential for the final synthesis of active vitamin D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Dardenne et al., 2001</xref>). In fact, targeted inactivation of 1&#x003b1;-hydroxylase in mouse models (<italic>1&#x003b1;-hydroxylase<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>) results in undetectable serum levels of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Dardenne et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that elevated serum levels of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> in <italic>Fgf-23<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> or <italic>Klotho<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice might be caused by the ability of these molecules to regulate expression of the 1&#x003b1;-hydroxylase gene. The correlation between elevated levels of active vitamin D and the premature aging&#x02013;like phenotype in <italic>Fgf-23<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> and <italic>Klotho<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice makes it tempting to hypothesize that excessive active vitamin D might have cytotoxic effects on various tissues, resulting in the observed atrophy. Studies in prostate and breast cancer cells have shown that exposure of cells to high levels of active vitamin D can have apoptotic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Narvaez et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Johnson et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2006</xref>). Excessive activation of the vitamin D receptor causes transcription of genes associated with mitochondrial export of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> and subsequent cleavage of caspase-9. This action induces cleavage of caspase-3, which promotes DNA fragmentation causing apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Demay, 2006</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we show that FGF-23&#x02013;Klotho stimulates mitogenic and cell survival pathways to prevent atrophy of tissues caused by excessive production of active vitamin D. High levels of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> are suppressed by FGF-23&#x02013;Klotho signaling through inhibited expression of renal 1&#x003b1;-hydroxylase, an enzyme responsible for synthesis of active vitamin D. Furthermore, we show that vitamin D&#x02013;induced caspase activity is inhibited by signaling pathways initiated by FGF-23&#x02013;Klotho, thus directly preventing apoptosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>FGF-23&#x02013;Klotho signal transduction</title><p>To investigate the role of FGF-23 and Klotho in regulation of systemic vitamin D and tissue atrophy, we first performed protein analyses by immunoblotting. We found that exposure of renal PTEC or small intestine epithelial cells (FHs74Int) to exogenous FGF-23 or Klotho alone had minimal effects on protein phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38, JNK, AKT, inhibitor &#x003ba;B (I&#x003ba;B), and GSK-3&#x003b2; (glycogen synthase kinase-3&#x003b2;) compared with control (vehicle treated) cells. However, exposure to both FGF-23 and Klotho caused significant up-regulations in phosphorylation of all of these proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). These data were confirmed by multiplex ELISA, which also showed increases in CREB (cAMP response element binding), p70S6K, and STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) phosphorylation by FGF-23&#x02013;Klotho. Addition of a small molecule Ras inhibitor before FGF-23 and Klotho treatment prevented increased phosphorylation of CREB, ERK1/2, JNK, p38, p70S6K, and STAT3. Addition of a small molecule inhibitor against phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) prevented increased phosphorylation of I&#x003ba;B, p70S6K, AKT, and GSK-3&#x003b2;. Combined effects of both Ras and PI3K inhibitors lowered all FGF-23&#x02013;Klotho-induced phosphorylations to background levels (Fig. S1, A and B, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803024/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803024/DC1</ext-link>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Signaling events induced by FGF-23&#x02013;Klotho.</bold> Immunoblotting showing that FGF-23 or Klotho alone have no effect on kinase activity in PTEC or FHs74Int cells.

We substituted Klotho with &#x003b2;-glucuronidase to assess potential effects on FGF-23&#x02013;induced signaling.

Consistent with the phosphorylation patterning, we found that levels of Cyclin D1 and c-myc were significantly increased with the addition of FGF-23 and Klotho to cell cultures compared with control cells. As expected, FGF-23 or Klotho alone had no significant effect on Cyclin D1 or c-myc expression. Ras inhibitor was sufficient to abolish most of the increased expression of these proteins under the influence of FGF-23&#x02013;Klotho, whereas PI3K inhibitor had only a minimal effect (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>FGF-23&#x02013;Klotho signaling promotes cell proliferation.</bold> (A and B) ELISA analysis showing increased expression of the cell cycle proteins Cyclin D1 (A) and c-myc (B) upon exposure of cells to FGF-23 and Klotho.

However, exposure to both FGF-23 and Klotho greatly increased levels of BrdU incorporation. Introduction of Ras inhibitor to cultures nearly abolished increases in proliferation caused by FGF-23&#x02013;Klotho, whereas PI3K inhibitor had only a minimal effect.

Kidneys and intestines from these mice at 6 wk of age were sectioned and stained for Ki67 expression to measure proliferation in vivo.

In the intestine, we found that the number of Ki67-positive nuclei was significantly reduced in <italic>Fgf-23<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice, whereas in FGF-23 transgenic mice it was greatly increased compared with the wild type (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, D and E</xref>). Similar results were observed in skin and spleen tissues (unpublished data). Interestingly, in the kidney, there were dramatic changes in levels of cytoplasmic Ki67 but no positive staining for nuclear Ki67. We also attempted BrdU incorporation, but there was no positive staining in the nuclei from kidney sections (unpublished data). These data suggest that the role of FGF-23&#x02013;Klotho is not to control proliferation in the kidney in vivo but rather to regulate mineral-ion homeostasis as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Yu and White, 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>FGF-23&#x02013;Klotho signaling prevents vitamin D&#x02013;induced apoptosis</title><p>Because active vitamin D has recently been described to have anti-cancer effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Johnson et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2006</xref>) and serum levels of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> are excessively high in <italic>Fgf-23<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> or <italic>Klotho<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Tsujikawa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Shimada et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Sitara et al., 2004</xref>), we hypothesized that these elevated levels might promote apoptosis, thus causing the observed atrophy of tissues. We first showed the direct effect of FGF-23&#x02013;Klotho on expression of 1&#x003b1;-hydroxylase, the enzyme responsible for final synthesis of active vitamin D metabolite. Protein levels of 1&#x003b1;-hydroxylase were observed by ELISA, showing that FGF-23 and Klotho together were able to greatly reduce expression of this enzyme in PTEC cells compared with the control, whereas FGF-23 or Klotho alone had little effect. Addition of Ras and PI3K inhibitors showed significant rescue of 1&#x003b1;-hydroxylase expression, however full restoration was not achieved. These data suggest that other signaling pathways may also be involved in regulation of 1&#x003b1;-hydroxylase expression. Interestingly, no statistically significant changes in expression of 1&#x003b1;-hydroxylase were found with treatment of FHs74Int cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>).

We found that a dose of 100 nM of vitamin D had little effect on levels of apoptosis compared with vehicle-treated control cells. Although a 200-nM concentration showed significant but relatively low cell death, a 300-nM dose heavily increased levels of apoptosis. 400 nM of vitamin D caused cell death of nearly the entire populations of PTEC and FHs74Int cells (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803024/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803024/DC1</ext-link>). In the presence of 400 nM of vitamin D, FGF-23 or Klotho alone showed no differences in levels of apoptosis.

We have also provided insight into the physiological functions of these proteins, which regulate cell survival, proliferation, and vitamin D metabolism. These discoveries go beyond the traditional dogma of FGF-23 and Klotho being responsible for maintaining mineral-ion homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Yu and White, 2005</xref>). It is now clear that two major signal transduction pathways are initiated by FGF-23&#x02013;Klotho. Ras signaling promotes downstream kinase activities that cause up-regulation of cell cycle genes to induce proliferation, whereas PI3K signaling counter regulates apoptotic pathways through its downstream activation of AKT (Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803024/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803024/DC1</ext-link>).</p><p>Perhaps the most interesting aspect of our study is that although virtually all internal organs showed evidence of vitamin D&#x02013;induced apoptosis in <italic>Fgf-23<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice, only select tissues (intestine, spleen, and skin) showed effects of FGF-23&#x02013;Klotho on proliferation. Although kidneys of <italic>Fgf-23<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice showed no evident change in proliferation, in vitro studies of kidney PTEC demonstrated greatly increased proliferation as a result of exposure to exogenous FGF-23 and Klotho. These data suggest that there are distinct regulatory factors controlling in vivo proliferation for each organ that may render FGF-23&#x02013;Klotho ineffective for this purpose. However, it is clear that FGF-23&#x02013;Klotho does inhibit expression of 1&#x003b1;-hydroxylase in kidney cells (in vitro and in vivo) and subsequent production of active vitamin D. Although the concentrations of active vitamin D used for our in vitro studies may not be the same as those reached in vivo in <italic>Fgf-23<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice, evidence of apoptotic rescue by genetic knockout of <italic>1&#x003b1;-hydroxylase</italic> suggests that active vitamin D is the cause of the observed tissue atrophy.</p><p>The potential use of FGF-23&#x02013;Klotho as an antiaging therapy is tempting; however, there is great risk. Although excessive serum levels of active vitamin D are clearly responsible for several aging-like phenotypes, including tissue atrophy, moderate production of active vitamin D is still essential for normal bone mineralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Christakos et al., 2006</xref>). Also, lack of systemic vitamin D has been linked to increased risk in development of various forms of cancer including colorectal, breast, lung, ovarian and prostate carcinomas, as well as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Furthermore, there is strong evidence that vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of developing other pathological conditions such as multiple sclerosis, type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, hypertension, and stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Grant, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Peterlik and Cross, 2006</xref>). Pharmacological doses of vitamin D analogues have been used as potential therapies against these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hayes, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Holick, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Deeb et al., 2007</xref>). The ability of FGF-23&#x02013;Klotho signaling to inhibit synthesis of active vitamin D through inhibitory control of 1&#x003b1;-hydroxylase gene expression, as well as to induce signaling pathways that counter-regulate vitamin D&#x02013;induced apoptotic signaling, could potentially slow the aging process. However, it would also likely increase the risk of developing diseases associated with vitamin D deficiency. Therefore, it is evident that a balance of moderate levels of systemic active vitamin D is essential for maintaining overall health and longevity.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Human renal PTEC were obtained from Clontech Laboratories, Inc.
