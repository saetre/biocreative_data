This comparison revealed colinear genomes that exhibited high sequence identity, except for the presence of 17 unique DNA regions in strain DJO10A and six in strain NCC2705. While the majority of these unique regions encoded proteins of diverse function, eight from the DJO10A genome and one from NCC2705, encoded gene clusters predicted to be involved in diverse traits pertinent to the human intestinal environment, specifically oligosaccharide and polyol utilization, arsenic resistance and lantibiotic production. Seven of these unique regions were suggested by a base deviation index analysis to have been precisely deleted from strain NCC2705 and this is substantiated by a DNA remnant from within one of the regions still remaining in the genome of NCC2705 at the same locus. This targeted loss of genomic regions was experimentally validated when growth of the intestinal <italic>B. longum </italic>in the laboratory for 1,000 generations resulted in two large deletions, one in a lantibiotic encoding region, analogous to a predicted deletion event for NCC2705. A simulated fecal growth study showed a significant reduced competitive ability of this deletion strain against <italic>Clostridium difficile </italic>and <italic>E. coli</italic>. The deleted region was between two IS<italic>30 </italic>elements which were experimentally demonstrated to be hyperactive within the genome. The other deleted region bordered a novel class of mobile elements, termed mobile integrase cassettes (MIC) substantiating the likely role of these elements in genome deletion events.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Deletion of genomic regions, often facilitated by mobile elements, allows bifidobacteria to adapt to fermentation environments in a very rapid manner (2 genome deletions per 1,000 generations) and the concomitant loss of possible competitive abilities in the gut.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Recent molecular studies into the microbial diversity of the human intestine reveal a much greater diversity than previously recognized and very little is currently known of the contribution of individual groups to the human organism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. One numerically dominant group of microbes, the bifidobacteria, is often suggested to be associated with good intestinal health given their overriding dominance in the feces of breast fed infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. This phenomenon led to their discovery in 1899 by the pediatrician Henri Tissier and his subsequent use of these bacteria for the treatment of infantile diarrhea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The proposed beneficial effect of bifidobacteria is further supported by the decrease of these bacteria in geriatric individuals and the concomitant increase of other microbial groups, most notably clostridia and <italic>E. coli </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This has led to the growing worldwide interest of including bifidobacteria in foods specifically for their potential intestinal health benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, clinical feeding studies with bifidobacteria show that while the strains can be detected in subject's feces during feeding trials, they are rapidly lost upon cessation of the studies pointing to a possible loss of competitive fitness of the strains for competition within the human intestinal environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This may be due to attenuation of the strains, as the fermentation environment is very different to the buffered and anaerobic environment of the human colon.</p><p>To further the understanding of genetic attenuation that may occur in bifidobacteria, the complete genomic sequence of a numerically dominant human intestinal isolate of <italic>Bifidobacterium longum</italic>, that was grown for less than 20 generations in laboratory media, was deciphered. This was compared to an available genome sequence of a culture collection strain, <italic>B. longum </italic>NCC2705 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and analysis of the functional attributes of its unique sequences have contributed to a better understanding of attenuation that can occur in these bacteria in a fermentation environment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>Genomic sequencing of a minimally cultured <italic>B. longum </italic>strain</title><p>The power of comparative genomics can provide insights into features that are important for a species to survive and compete in its habitat. The genome sequence of the culture collection strain, <italic>B. longum </italic>NCC2705 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], is available and the ability to compare this genome with one from a strain that was deliberately minimally cultured in vitro may provide new insights to features that may be important for this prominent species from the human large gut. Newly isolated and minimally cultured <italic>B. longum </italic>strains were characterized and strain DJO10A was selected based on its prominent ability to bacteriostatically inhibit other bacteria through the production of siderophores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], a characteristic that appeared attenuated in all culture collection and commercial bifidobacteria analyzed. It was therefore selected for genomic sequencing as an isolate that likely had minimal attenuation from its origin in the intestine. The complete genome sequence of this strain was deciphered and consisted of one circular chromosome (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and two cryptic plasmids, pDOJH10L and pDOJH10S that were described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>B. longum </italic>strain DJO10A (<bold>B</bold>) NCC2705.

Its genomic characteristics were analogous to strain NCC2705, except it contained an extra tRNA_Ser: GCT encoded on its prophage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Codon usage analysis showed that this tRNA is the most frequently used tRNA_Ser in the prophage, while it is not the most used tRNA_Ser for the <italic>B. longum </italic>DJO10A genome (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>), pointing to an evolutionary selective pressure for its presence on the prophage. While both genomes contained tRNA's for every amino acid, the corresponding genes for aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases for both asparagine and glutamine are missing, suggesting a reliance on alternative pathways for translation with these amino acids, similar to many other bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Both these alternative pathways involve <italic>gatABC</italic>, which is present in both genomes as well as <italic>gltX </italic>and <italic>aspS </italic>involved in the glutamine and asparagine alternative translation pathways respectively, substantiating this proposed translation route. Interestingly, the <italic>B. longum </italic>genome contains novel mobile integrase cassettes (MIC) consisting of three different contiguous integrases flanked by an inverted repeat and a palindrome structure sandwiched by two IS<italic>3</italic>-type IS elements (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>).

These regions are extremely highly conserved in both genomes (&#x0003e; 99.9% identity) and consist of three <italic>oriC </italic>clusters and a <italic>terC</italic>, which is consistent with the predicted replication regions from other bacterial genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, the location of the observed <italic>oriC </italic>region in both genomes is slightly different from the predicted location based on genome asymmetry, a feature that has previously been seen in the <italic>Helicobacter pylori </italic>26695 genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. As well as the multiple <italic>oriC </italic>clusters, there are 7 different types of DnaA boxes, consistent with the majority of sequenced genomes and are proposed to be involved in controlling initiation of chromosome replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Restriction and modification (R-M) systems</title><p>The protective role that R-M systems impart on bacteria has been compared to the immune system of higher organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The presence of these systems in numerous bacteria demonstrates their important role for bacterial survival in nature. Both of the <italic>B. longum </italic>genomes encode type I and two type II R-M systems that are highly conserved (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>). They also contain an Mrr system that is predicted to restrict methylated DNA (usually <italic>Hha</italic>II or <italic>Pst</italic>I methylated DNA) that is 100% conserved between both strains (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5A</xref>). The clustering of Mrr with the type I R-M system is similar to <italic>E. coli </italic>K12 (GenBank <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="U00096">U00096</ext-link>). The low identity (40%) between the HsdS proteins in the two strains likely reflects the independent evolution of this type I R-M system in these strains following their evolutionary divergence, as these systems evolve by changing their specificity components (HsdS) to enable it to recognize different sequences. This is substantiated by the existence of an <italic>hsdS </italic>gene that was inactivated by an IS<italic>256 </italic>insertion event and both parts of this disrupted gene exhibit much higher conservation, suggesting the insertion event occurred before their evolutionary divergence (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5A</xref>). Upstream from this locus in strain DJO10A there is another restriction gene, McrA (restricts DNA methylated by <italic>Hpa</italic>II or <italic>Sss</italic>I), that is not present in NCC2705. The conserved type II R-M systems in both strains are isoschizomers of <italic>Sau</italic>3AI and <italic>Eco</italic>RII which restrict DNA at very frequently occurring sites (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5C</xref>). This, together with the range of restriction systems present, may be a factor in limiting the incursion of foreign DNA into these bacteria thus explaining the very low electroporation frequencies reported for bifidobacteria to date.</p></sec><sec><title>Unique genome regions in the <italic>B. longum </italic>strains</title><p>Alignment of the genome sequence of <italic>B. longum </italic>DJO10A with that of strain NCC2705 illustrates that they are highly conserved and collinear, except for the mobile IS and MIC elements (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). There is also an apparent genome reduction in strain NCC2705, consistent with previous observations for microbes growing in a stable environment without horizontal gene transfer opportunities and redundant genes accumulating mutations before subsequent deletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. There are 248 unique sequences of &#x0003e; 10 bp between the two genomes, with the majority of them being short and encoding few if any genes. This high number of unique sequences between the two strains was surprising given that the genomes of a clinical isolate of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </italic>and one that was extensively passaged for decades in the laboratory display only 86 of such regions in genomes twice the size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. There are 23 larger unique regions that encode functional or hypothetical genes and range in size from 3.0 to 48.6 kb, with 17 of these unique regions present in strain DJO10A encoding 219 predicted genes, and 6 unique regions in NCC2705 encoding 84 genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).

The prophage in strain NCC2705, which is truncated, appears to be a longtime resident of the genome as it does not correspond with a Base Deviation Index (BDI) peak (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), as this analysis predicts recent horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events. This appears to have been replaced in the genome of strain DJO10A with a different prophage, that is complete and inducible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and corresponds with a significant BDI peak substantiating this recent HGT event. The other five unique regions in strain NCC2705 contain largely hypothetical genes or genes of diverse functions without any significant gene clusters. However one of these regions (unique region 4') does encode putative xylan degradation genes, which is a function predicted to be important for competition in the large intestine. As this region corresponds to a BDI peak, it suggests it may be a recent acquisition by this strain and its evolution in the large intestine would provide the selective pressure for acquiring this unique region. Of the other 16 unique regions in the strain DJO10A, eight encode significant gene clusters involved in functions predicted to be important for competition in the large intestine, specifically oligosaccharide and polyol utilization, arsenic resistance and lantibiotic production.</p></sec><sec><title>Oligosaccharide and polyol utilization</title><p>According to a COG functional classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], the highest number of unique genes in strain DJO10A with a predicted function belongs to the carbohydrate metabolism [G] category (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>). Interestingly, most of the unique genes in the carbohydrate metabolism category are involved in oligosaccharide utilization, which is the major carbohydrate source available to microbes in the large intestine. In all there are 11 oligosaccharide utilization gene clusters in strain DJO10A, of which 5 are fully present and 2 are partially present in strain NCC2705 (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>). It is noteworthy that one of these clusters (cluster 7 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>) contains an ISL<italic>3 </italic>element in the NCC2705 genome at the precise location of the extra oligosaccharide utilization genes in strain DJO10A (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). A BDI analysis suggested that the extra oligosaccharide gene clusters in strain DJO10A were not acquired following evolutionary divergence from strain NCC2705, as neither corresponds with a BDI peak (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The majority of BDI peaks suggesting recent HGT events were the same in both genomes substantiating this analysis. This would suggest the six unique regions (6, 9, 10, 11, 15 and 17) encoding oligosaccharide utilization genes were likely lost from strain NCC2705 during its adaptation to a fermentation environment. Further evidence for the loss of these unique regions from strain NCC2705 comes from a DNA remnant of 361 bp (98% identity) from the <italic>ushA </italic>gene within the unique region 1 that was left remaining at this locus in NCC2705 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Comparsion of oligosaccharide utilization gene cluster 7 between two <italic>B. longum </italic>genomes.</bold> DJO10A-unique genes in unique region 10 are colored dark grey, ISL3-type IS element is colored black and other matched genes are colored white. <italic>galA</italic>, &#x003b1;-galactosidase; <italic>lacI</italic>, LacI-type repressor; <italic>malEFG</italic>, ABC-type transport system; ISL3, ISL3-type IS element; <italic>agl1</italic>, glycosidase; <italic>ilvA</italic>, threonine dehydratase; <italic>SIR2</italic>, NAD-dependent protein deacetylase; glyH, glycosyl hydrolase; <italic>hyp</italic>, hypothetical protein.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-9-247-3"/></fig><p>Polyols are not digestible by humans and their metabolism is believed to be important for bacterial competition in the human large intestine and their ingestion has been implicated in increased bifidobacteria numbers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].

Two operons encoding ATP-dependent arsenic resistance genes are in unique regions 5 and 7 and may be important for intestinal survival as the human intestine contains low concentrations of arsenic from the diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Many intestinal bacteria such as <italic>E. coli, Lactobacillus </italic>and <italic>Bacteroides </italic>contain arsenic resistance genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>), substantiating the competitive advantage for having this ability in the intestine. As the unique regions, 5 and 7, containing these arsenic resistance genes do not correspond to BDI peaks (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), it suggests they may not be recently acquired by strain DJO10A, but rather lost from strain NCC2705.

This would suggest an elevated mutation frequency. A comparative nucleotide substitution analysis between strains DJO10A and NCC2705 shows the majority of genes are highly conserved (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>), which is to be expected with two closely related strains. However, analysis of the 52 least conserved genes (listed as 'positive selection' in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>) indicates that of the mutations that can be attributed to one strain or the other (frameshifts, deletions, insertions and stop mutations), 11 are from strain NCC2705 and three from strain DJO10A (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref>). Further substantiation of an increased mutation frequency in strain NCC2705 comes from comparing genes encoding surface protein homologs between the two strains. A search of the DJO10A genome for LPXTG motifs, which is a signature of one class of cell surface anchoring proteins found four potential proteins and SignalP analysis of these proteins (BLD1468, BLD1511, BLD1637 and BLD1638) confirmed the presence of a signal sequence in each case (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S10">10</xref>). In addition, BLASTP analysis of these four proteins showed that they are very similar to other known surface proteins containing the LPXTG motif. The NCC2705 showed three of these gene homologs (BLD1468, BLD1637 and BLD1638), and had a predicted protein exhibiting 99% amino acid identity to BLD1511, but was missing the LPXTG motif due to an ISL3 insertion in the 3' end of the gene. This further highlights the rapid evolutionary status of bifidobacteria when they are removed from the human gut into pure-culture fermentation environments.</p></sec><sec><title>IS30 'jumping' in the <italic>B. longum </italic>genome</title><p>The dynamic environment within the <italic>B. longum </italic>cell in a fermentation environment is further substantiated by the intriguing observation during genome sequencing from different batches of DNA that everything was identical except for the location of some IS<italic>30 </italic>elements (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>).

Isolated colonies were then screened for seven unique regions encoding functions predicted to be useful for survival in the human gut. One of these regions (no. 12) involved in the lantibiotic production was found to be missing from 40% of the isolates (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S11">11</xref>) substantiating this hypothesis. Analysis of this adapted strain, DJO10A-JH1, shows the deletion extended over the full lantibiotic region very similar to strain NCC2705 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). It is further noted using Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) that the 39.9 kb <italic>Xba</italic>I band containing this region is missing from strain DJO10A-JH1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). The loss of the complete lantibiotic gene cluster from 40% of the culture was intriguing as the cluster also encodes the immunity gene to protect cells from the lantibiotic activity.
