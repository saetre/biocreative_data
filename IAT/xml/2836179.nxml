Several Arg-interacting proteins are potential links to the actin cytoskeleton, but exactly how Arg stimulates actin polymerization and cellular protrusion has not yet been fully elucidated. We used affinity purification to identify N-WASp as a novel binding partner of Arg. N-WASp activates the Arp2/3 complex and is an effector of Abl. We find that the Arg SH3 domain binds directly to N-WASp. Arg phosphorylates N-WASp on Y256, modestly increasing the affinity of Arg for N-WASp, an interaction that does not require the Arg SH2 domain. The Arg SH3 domain stimulates N-WASp-dependent actin polymerization in vitro, and Arg phosphorylation of N-WASp weakly stimulates this effect. Arg and N-WASp colocalize to adhesion-dependent cell edge protrusions in vivo. The cell edge protrusion defects of <italic>arg</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; fibroblasts can be complemented by re-expression of an Arg-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fusion, but not by an N-WASp binding-deficient Arg SH3 domain point mutant. These results suggest that Arg promotes actin-based protrusions in response to extracellular stimuli through phosphorylation of and physical interactions with N-WASp.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement><funding-source>National Institutes of Health, United States</funding-source></funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>bi901721u</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>bi-2009-01721u</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn id="fn1" fn-type="funding-statement"><label>&#x02020;</label><p>This work was supported by Public Health Service Grants NS39475 and CA133346 to A.J.K. and GM026338 to T.D.P.

We previously reported that cortactin, a weak NPF, is a kinase substrate and binding partner of Arg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>), but it is unclear whether cortactin engagement is sufficient to promote actin polymerization or if other factors are required.</p><p>Here we identify the NPF N-WASp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>) as a potential effector of Arg. We show that the Arg SH3 domain binds directly to N-WASp and that the Arg SH3 domain activates N-WASp-dependent actin polymerization in vitro. Phosphorylation of N-WASp by Arg modestly enhances binding of the Arg SH3 domain to N-WASP and actin polymerization. We also demonstrate that Arg and N-WASp colocalize to adhesion-dependent cell protrusions and that Arg with a mutation that compromises binding to N-WASp is unable to support cell edge protrusion. Thus, Arg interacts with N-WASp through both binding and phosphorylation events to stimulate N-WASp-dependent actin polymerization, pointing to this interaction as a mechanism through which Arg mediates stimulus-dependent actin-based protrusion.</p><!--with a head--><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><!--with a head--><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Identification of Proteins That Interact with Arg</title><p>Whole adult mouse brains were homogenized in homogenization buffer (HB) [20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 25 mM potassium acetate, 320 mM sucrose, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors (aprotinin, benzamidine, chymostatin, leupeptin, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and pepstatin A), and phosphatase inhibitors (sodium fluoride and sodium orthovanadate)] using 1.67 mL of HB/brain.

This observation suggests the higher affinity of GST-Arg-SH3SH2 for pN-WASp is not due to a new SH2&#x02212;phosphotyrosine interaction, but rather to an increased affinity of the Arg SH3 domain for pN-WASp. The increased affinity of the tested Arg fragments for pN-WASp may indicate that N-WASp phosphorylation alters its conformation to allow tighter binding of Arg fragments (see the <xref rid="sec4">Discussion</xref>).</p></sec><!--with a head--><sec id="sec3.5"><title>Arg Stimulates N-WASp-Dependent Actin Polymerization in Vitro</title><p>We used fluorescence enhancement of pyrenyl-actin to measure the ability of Arg fragments, N-WASp, and pN-WASp to stimulate actin polymerization by the Arp2/3 complex. Actin alone polymerizes slowly after an initial lag (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). The Arp2/3 complex with or without N-WASp does not stimulate polymerization, showing that our N-WASp preparation is fully autoinhibited.

GST-Arg-SH3SH2 stimulates N-WASp and pN-WASp with similar potency in spite of the higher affinity of GST-Arg-SH3SH2 for pN-WASp (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C).

In contrast, mutation of the SH2 domain has no effect on the ability of GST-Arg-SH3SH2 to stimulate actin nucleation (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B). These results indicate that Arg uses its SH3 domain to bind to and activate N-WASp and pN-WASp, thereby promoting their interaction with the Arp2/3 complex and stimulating actin polymerization.

First, the Arg SH3 domain binds N-WASp, presumably to a P-x-x-P motif. Second, Arg phosphorylates N-WASp with a <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> similar to those of other endogenous substrates of Arg. This is the second example of multimodal interaction between Arg and an actin-binding protein. The SH3 domain of cortactin binds an Arg P-x-x-P motif, and this interaction is strengthened by an interaction between the Arg SH2 domain and phosphotyrosine residues on cortactin subsequent to Arg phosphorylation of cortactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). We hypothesized that the Arg SH2 domain might bind phosphorylated N-WASp similarly, but this turned out not to be the case.</p><p>We observed two levels of binding affinity between the Arg SH3 and SH2 constructs and N-WASp. The isolated SH3 domain bound pN-WASp and N-WASp with the same high affinity, but all of the larger Arg constructs containing both the SH3 and SH2 domains had a lower affinity for N-WASp than pN-WASp. Steric hindrance due to the added bulk of the Arg SH2 domain and the closed conformation of unphosphorylated N-WASp may explain why the affinity of the Arg SH3 domain for the P-x-x-P binding site in N-WASp is decreased. With both of these steric factors present, interaction of the SH3 domain and P-x-x-P site is weakened, but full binding affinity is restored when either of these factors is removed, either by deletion of the SH2 domain or by opening of the N-WASp conformation through phosphorylation.</p><p>Steric interactions are also important in regulating the accessibility of N-WASp to the kinase domain of Arg. Binding partners that release WASp family proteins from their autoinhibited, conformationally closed state make them better substrates for tyrosine kinases by exposing a buried tyrosine that is the target of these kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>). Although stoichiometric concentrations of GST-Arg-SH3SH2 activate N-WASP, low, catalytic concentrations of Arg are unable to phosphorylate autoinhibited N-WASp. However, in the presence of an excess of GST-Cdc42(G12V), a constitutively active Rho family GTPase known to bind to and open N-WASp, Arg phosphorylates N-WASp with a <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> similar to those of other Arg substrates.</p></sec><!--with a head--><sec id="sec4.2"><title>Regulation of N-WASp-Dependent Actin Polymerization by Arg</title><p>Consistent with our binding data showing that the Arg SH3 domain binds N-WASp, we find that the Arg SH3 domain also activates N-WASp to promote actin polymerization by the Arp2/3 complex. The SH3 domains of other proteins, including Nck and Grb2, also stimulate N-WASp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>). Torres and Rosen proposed that once opened by Cdc42 binding, phosphorylation keeps WASP or N-WASp in an active configuration, a form of &#x0201c;molecular memory&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>). We find that Arg-SH3SH2 binding is sufficient to activate N-WASp, or phospho-N-WASp, even in the absence of Cdc42. This Arg-dependent activation may represent a novel activation mode in which Arg-SH3SH2 binding, rather than phosphorylation, keeps N-WASp open.</p><p>Dimers of WASp family constructs are much more active NPFs than monomeric constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>) because of their ability to occupy both NPF binding sites on the Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>). GST-induced dimerization presumably contributes to the ability of proteins with two SH3 domains such as our GST-Arg-SH3 constructs to activate N-WASp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>). Although full-length Arg contains only one SH3 domain, Arg binds cooperatively to actin filaments, which promotes clustering of Arg on actin filaments in vitro and likely helps concentrate Arg within protrusive structures in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>). In this manner, two adjacent Arg molecules, cross-linked by actin filaments, may act as a functional unit with two SH3 domains to efficiently activate N-WASp. In addition, since Arg contains multiple protein&#x02212;protein interaction domains, Arg likely further facilitates N-WASp stimulation by putting it in the proximity of its other binding partners, including actin filaments, cortactin, and the Nck adaptor protein.</p><p>Our in vitro experiments describe a mechanism by which Arg regulates actin polymerization through interaction with N-WASp. We also show that Arg and N-WASp colocalize at the cell periphery in response to adhesive cues. The Arg SH3 domain, which mediates binding of Arg to N-WASp, is required for this adhesion-dependent protrusion, pointing to this interaction as a mechanism through which Arg mediates stimulus-dependent actin-based protrusion. We propose a model in which Arg and cortactin weakly associate at the cell periphery until PDGF or integrin signaling activates Arg to phosphorylate both cortactin and N-WASp. These phosphorylation events facilitate binding of Arg to phosphorylated cortactin via its SH2 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>) and pN-WASp via its SH3 domain. In this way, Arg may act in a scaffolding capacity, bringing cortactin and N-WASp together in close proximity to each other and allowing them to bind to each other, the Arp2/3 complex, the actin filament, and an actin monomer, thereby initiating the actin polymerization to drive cell edge protrusion.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Xianyun Ye and Hongli Chen for technical assistance; S.
