Among these features is the presence of long intergenic regions, which are common in other eukaryotes, but generally absent in Eumetazoa. Here we analyse poriferan mitochondrial intergenic regions, paying particular attention to repetitive sequences within them. In this context we introduce the mitochondrial genome of <italic>Ircinia strobilina </italic>(Lamarck, 1816; Demospongiae: Dictyoceratida) and compare it with mtDNA of other sponges.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Mt genomes of dictyoceratid sponges are identical in gene order and content but display major differences in size and organization of intergenic regions. An even higher degree of diversity in the structure of intergenic regions was found among different orders of demosponges. One interesting observation made from such comparisons was of what appears to be recurrent invasions of sponge mitochondrial genomes by repetitive hairpin-forming elements, which cause large genome size differences even among closely related taxa. These repetitive hairpin-forming elements are structurally and compositionally divergent and display a scattered distribution throughout various groups of demosponges.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Large intergenic regions of poriferan mt genomes are targets for insertions of repetitive hairpin- forming elements, similar to the ones found in non-metazoan opisthokonts. Such elements were likely present in some lineages early in animal mitochondrial genome evolution but were subsequently lost during the reduction of intergenic regions, which occurred in the Eumetazoa lineage after the split of Porifera. Porifera acquired their elements in several independent events. Patterns of their intra-genomic dispersal can be seen in the mt genome of <italic>Vaceletia </italic>sp.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Organellar genomes display a tendency of size reduction (deletional bias) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. This tendency manifests itself in the loss of mitochondrial (mt) protein genes or their relocation to the nucleus, and in the loss of intergenic non-coding sequences. For example, comparison between animal mt genomes and that of the choanoflagellate <italic>Monosiga brevicollis </italic>revealed that a major reduction of mtDNA has taken place in the animal lineage, which involved the translocation of mitochondrial genes into the nucleus and dramatic size reduction of intergenic regions (IGR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Indeed, the IGRs account for almost 50% of the 76 kb mt genome of <italic>M. brevicollis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], while the poriferan genomes examined so far from Demospongiae, Homoscleromorpha and Hexactinellida (no mt genome is yet available for class Calcarea) possess less than 24% IGRs (in <italic>Axinella corrugata </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]). Similarly, the number of genes is reduced from 55 in <italic>M. brevicollis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] to 40 - 18 in demosponges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. This diminution of mt DNA culminates in bilaterian animals, where IGRs are frequently absent (with adjacent genes often overlapping each other) and occasionally genes being lost. As a result, the majority of non-coding nucleotides in bilaterian mt genomes is located in a single control region, which contains important elements for the replication of mtDNA (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] for an overview). Although such control region has not unambiguously been identified in non-bilaterian Metazoa, some characteristic features like repetitive sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], conserved sequence blocks and potential secondary structures for the initiation of replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] have been found in the mt genome of <italic>Acropora tenuis </italic>(Cnidaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]). In Porifera, non-coding regions with repetitive features are speculative control regions, but similarity to their eumetazoan counterparts and conservation among different species are low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>The structure and biological function of mt genes is well-studied owing to their pivotal role in respiration and oxidative phosphorylation and several of these genes are frequently used as phylogenetic markers. By contrast, elements involved in the replication and expression of mtDNA have been investigated only in a few species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, it has been observed that mtDNA outside of bilaterian animals usually contains multiple IGRs of similar length and these genomes often harbour numerous repetitive sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Such repeats occur mostly in intergenic regions but were also found inside protein coding or ribosomal RNA genes (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]). These mt repetitive sequences can comprise all classes of their nuclear counterparts, which include direct-, dispersed-, inverse-, tandem- and satellite-like repeats (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] for an overview). Frequently, repetitive mtDNA elements have a potential to form a particular secondary structure with stems and loops. Conserved and potentially mobile palindromic repeats are well known from non-metazoan mtDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Most abundant are single hairpin-forming motifs (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]), but double hairpin elements were also found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In the following we will refer to such elements as Repetitive Hairpin-forming Elements (RHE).</p><p>Despite their regular occurrence in fungi, plants, and other eukaryotes, no adaptive function of RHEs is known, although their potential roles as control elements in mRNA processing and translation have been discussed. For example, inverted repeat sequence elements are often found in the 3' - untranslated regions of mRNAs and have been suggested as candidate structures for RNAse access [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Alternatively, inverted repeats forming stem-loop structures at 3' termini of mRNAs have also been found to be stabilizing signals in both bacteria and chloroplasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Besides their involvement in RNA processing, repeat structures and, in particular, (double-) hairpin elements could facilitate recombination and lead to mt genome reorganization. This function would be analogous to G-C rich clusters in the mt genome of <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], which can be folded into several different motifs of stem-and-loop structures with high similarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and are regarded as preferential recombination sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Finally, mt repetitive elements, like their cytoplasmatic counterparts, could have simply evolved out of transposable elements or by errors during mt DNA replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>These insights from non-metazoan opisthokonts indicate that mt IGRs may play an important role in the evolution of the metazoan mt genome. To our knowledge there is no information about the presence of RHE in choanoflagellates, Ichtyosporea and Placozoa. In Bilateria, the impact of RHE was reduced concurrently with the condensation of the mt genome to the highly compact circular ~16 kb DNA molecule, as present today in most animal phyla. To investigate the potential impact of RHE on early metazoan mt DNA evolution, we studied the IGRs in all available mt genomes from sponges, which form the basal divergence with Eumetazoa within the animal lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In this paper, we will initially focus on the mt genomes of keratose demosponges (Keratosa), which, together with the Myxospongiae, form the sister group to all other extant demosponge lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and then extend our analysis to other groups of demosponges and sponges in general.</p><p>The keratose sponge order Dictyoceratida encompasses sponges with a high morphological diversity. Most genera, such as <italic>Hippospongia or Ircinia </italic>possess a purely organic skeleton of spongin fibers. Recent molecular data, however, demonstrated that <italic>Vaceletia</italic>, a sponge with a 'sphinctozoan' -type skeleton, i.e. with a hypercalcified (so-called "coralline") mineral skeleton of aragonite with trabecular inner structure, likewise belongs to the Dictyoceratida [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], a taxon that normally is devoid of biomineral-production. In this context we present the mt genome of an additional non-coralline dictyoceratid sponge, <italic>Ircinia strobilina</italic>, which allows us to get a better insight on intra-ordinal variation of sponge mtDNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Organization of dictyoceratid demosponge mtDNA</title><p>The mt genomes of dictyoceratid demosponges <italic>Ircinia strobilina</italic>, <italic>Hippospongia lachne </italic>and <italic>Vaceletia </italic>sp. comprise 16,414, 16,755, and 20,658 bp, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). They code for the standard 14 demosponge protein genes (which include <italic>atp9</italic>), small and large subunit ribosomal RNA (<italic>rns </italic>and <italic>rnl</italic>) but only two tRNAs (<italic>trnW(uca) </italic>and <italic>trnMf(cau)</italic>).

A closer analysis of the AT-rich repetitive regions reveals the presence of repetitive small, subunits, which form perfect hairpin structures. Two different RHE types have been detected: the first type consists of two uninterrupted complementary regions of 15 bp each, occasionally separated by 5 bases, which will in the following be referred to as "<italic>blue15</italic>" (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). We have found 32 complete, i.e. hairpin-forming copies of this type. The second type consists of two complementary regions of 18 bp with a 7 bp terminal loop (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The <italic>Vaceletia </italic>mt genome contains 17 complete copies of this type, which will in the following be referred to as "<italic>yellow18</italic>".

However, these species belong to two different families: Spongiidae and Irciniidae, each with a very distinct morphology: In contrast to Spongiidae, Irciniidae have very fine collagenous filaments with beaded ends in the mesohyl, which supplement the fibre skeleton and are unique among demosponges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Such a well-defined autapomorphy is extremely rare among dictyoceratid sponges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. The genetic distances of mt genes do not indicate a particularly long evolutionary time for Irciniidae to develop this elaborated morphological feature.</p><p>The discrepancy between short branch lengths in phylogenetic trees inferred from mt data and a large extent of morphological divergence can have several explanations. On the one hand, it is possible that the morphological changes have taken place in a relatively short time span. This hypothesis is supported by previous findings on <italic>Merlia normani</italic>, (Poecilosclerida: Merliidae), a demosponge species known to possesses forms with and without a calcified basal skeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].

Alternatively, the evolutionary rates in Dictyoceratida might have decreased dramatically since their radiation (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).

However, reduction in the cnidarian and dictyoceratid mt tRNA gene sets must have evolved independently given that both Myxospongia, the sister group of Keratosa, and Hexactinellida, the putative sister group of Demospongiae, possess a full complement of mt tRNA genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Hairpin elements and the evolution of metazoan mt genomes</title><p>Our study demonstrates that repetitive inverted repeats with potential to form secondary structures such as hairpins, double hairpins or even more elaborate structures, are found repeatedly in demosponge mt genomes. Their presence in sponge mt DNA is remarkable because repetitive elements other than in the control region are hardly known from Bilateria (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]). This observation underlines the intermediate appearance of sponge mtDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] relative to Eumetazoa, in which such elements are almost unknown, and to non-metazoan opisthokonts such as fungi, in which repetitive elements are abundant.</p><p>A correlation between IGR length and the presence of repetitive elements is obvious (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>): RHEs are more common in sponge taxa with an increased IGR length. However, an attempt to explain this correlation leads to the Aristotle's 'Chicken or the Egg?' question: Long IGRs present in most poriferan taxa provide more targets for the accumulation and fixation of RHE, in contrast to the greatly reduced IGRs in Eumetazoa. Insertion of RHE in reduced and highly economized mt genomes of bilaterian animals could almost exclusively take place in the coding regions only (besides the control region) and would very likely interfere with the functionality of crucial genes. As a consequence, a RHE will less likely be fixed in the population. Vice versa, the accumulation of repetitive elements causes a prolongation of IGRs, which reach up to 25% of the total genome size in demosponges. Nevertheless, we found many poriferan taxa without significant RHEs in their mt genomes, but with IGRs of considerable length (e.g. <italic>Agelas schmidti</italic>, <italic>Amphimedon queenslandica</italic>, <italic>Chondrilla nucula</italic>, <italic>Negombata magnifica </italic>and <italic>Iotrochota birotulata</italic>), which suggest that RHE are not the sole responsible elements for IGR length.</p><p>In a few cases RHEs are present in coding regions of the mt genomes - mostly in ribosomal RNA genes such as <italic>rnl </italic>(Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>) and <italic>rns </italic>(Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>), and less frequently in protein genes. Most insertions into ribosomal RNA genes have taken place at sites, in which extensive length differences have been reported earlier, and their presence may not have a significant influence on the function of the ribosomal RNA (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]). Therefore, excision of the elements out of the transcript may not be necessary to maintain the function of the RNA in the ribosomes. Studies with fungal mt double hairpin elements inserted in genes revealed that RHEs are not removed from the transcripts, which is consistent with their absence from structurally important portions of genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Likewise GC-rich clusters in the <italic>var1 </italic>ORF or in rRNAs of yeast mitochondria are neither removed nor edited at the RNA level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Taxonomic distribution of repetitive hairpin-forming elements in Porifera</title><p>Our analyses leave the question of whether the distribution of RHEs in poriferan mt genomes has any taxonomic preferences unresolved. It seems possible that some clades are more susceptible to invasions of RHEs than others - but additional poriferan mt genomes will be necessary to test this hypothesis. So far, Keratosa (c.f. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]) and, to lesser extend, Myxospongiae (c.f. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]) display a higher abundance of RHE compared to the clades of marine Haplosclerida and the 'G4' group (c.f. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]). In the two latter, repetitive hairpin forming elements are only present in <italic>Ephydatia muelleri, Axinella corrugata </italic>and <italic>Suberites domuncula</italic>. For Hexactinellida, no unambiguous prediction is possible as only three taxa of two orders were investigated and two out of the three sequences are incomplete. Homoscleromorpha, which is a species-poor taxon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], do not possess relevant repetitive structural elements, which therefore might not occur in this group. However, one of the two species of homosclermomorphs contains two introns - another type of "selfish" DNA - in <italic>cox1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>].</p><p>Repetitive hairpin elements are not uncommon among demosponges and therefore putatively some could have been present in (now extinct) taxa diverging earlier from the lineage leading to the last common ancestor of Porifera. Furthermore, as ancestral mt genomes have likely had larger IGRs, they provided more target sites for insertions of RHEs within a mt genome, it is also possible that RHEs were present in (now extinct) taxa diverging earlier from the lineage towards the last common ancestor of Metazoa. Subsequent genome compression in the lineage towards Bilateria after the split of Porifera combined with the loss of IGRs prevented the infestations of RHE in higher metazoan mt genomes.</p><p>The scattered distribution of RHEs that we observed in the present study could either suggest an early origin with subsequent parallel loss, or multiple independent invasions. The latter possibility appears more plausible given the structural differences between RHE elements found among demosponge taxa. Consequently, repetitive hairpin-forming elements may have invaded metazoan mt genomes repeatedly during their evolution. They may be secondarily lost again in some poriferan lineages, but are, with the exception of the control region, mostly absent in eumetazoan mt genomes due to their compact organization with subsequent loss of the preferred target sites within the IGRs (but see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]).</p></sec><sec><title>Evolution of repetitive hairpin-forming elements in Porifera</title><p>Large differences in secondary structures and nucleotide composition observed in RHEs of sponges suggest their independent origin and evolution. RHEs in the keratose sponges <italic>Vaceletia</italic>, <italic>Hippospongia </italic>and <italic>Igernella </italic>have an extremely high AT content. Both "<italic>yellow18</italic>" and "<italic>blue15</italic>" motifs in <italic>Vaceletia </italic>mtDNA likely have a common origin. It is possible that the short fraction of the "<italic>yellow18</italic>" type RHE evolved into the "<italic>blue15</italic>" type RHE, of which subsequently several copies independently inserted into other parts of the <italic>Vaceletia </italic>mt genome. Apparent double hairpins (which are known from other genomes) are likewise formed by tandem insertion of "<italic>blue15</italic>" and/or "<italic>yellow18</italic>" RHEs into the mt genome.</p><p>The stem regions of both, "<italic>blue15</italic>" and "<italic>yellow18</italic>" RHE types are conserved, while the loop regions display a few differences. We interpret this as an indication of either their recent origin and rapid spread through the genome or considerable pressure for maintaining a hairpin secondary structure and note that this pattern is in contrast with other structured RNAs, such as group I and group II introns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], in which the loops tend to be more conserved than the helical regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This lack of sequence conservation in the loops in demosponge hairpin elements suggests their lack of structural importance and their unlikely involvement in any tertiary interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This observation is supported by the substitution pattern in large repetitive, triple hairpin forming regions of <italic>Igernella notabilis</italic>, in which helix regions are also conserved and substitutions only occur in the loop regions.</p><p>The RHE found in other demosponges have a higher GC-content. In particular, the stem regions of RHE in <italic>Halisarca dujardini </italic>are up to 100% G+C. Substitutions only occur at the loop positions, which parallels to the structural constraints observed in the keratose RHE.</p><p>The lack of similarity between the RHE of different sponge taxa implies that they infested the mt genome in multiple, independent events rather than in a single infestation followed by proliferation into different elements. This inference is supported by the abundance of structural different repetitive hairpin-forming elements in fungi and other non-metazoan opisthokonts. In particular, the distinction into GC-rich and AT-rich elements raises evidence for at least two, but probably more infestation events in Porifera. This is consistent with many earlier observations that well-distinguishable structure forming repetitive elements are frequently confined to groups of closely related species, where the distribution indicates direct exchange of genetic material (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] for examples, but also for evidence for mobility).</p><p>The relatively conserved structures of sponge RHEs within the individual mt genomes suggest their recent multiplication and dispersal throughout the mt genome. However, we also have to consider that alternatively, reduced substitution rates in diploblast mt genomes, which are up to 10-20 times lower than their bilaterian counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] may contribute to the low number of base substitutions observed between copies of each element.</p></sec><sec><title>Proliferation of repetitive hairpin-forming elements within poriferan mt genomes</title><p>The extensive repetitive and secondary-structure-forming regions in the <italic>Vaceletia </italic>mt genome provide insight into the intra-genomic dispersal of the hairpin elements. The large identical IRG clusters indicate that the hairpin elements are not necessarily only copied as single elements. Instead, larger motifs such as the 399 bp repetitive region ("<italic>red399 motif"</italic>, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) are likewise duplicated and inserted at different positions of the mt genome. Shorter fragments with high sequence identity to those fragments such as the 236 and 219 bp ("<italic>red motifs</italic>") fragment might be derived from a copy of the 339 bp counterpart and subsequently reduced after insertion as full length elements. The spread of RHEs in <italic>Vaceletia </italic>was apparently a rapid process compared to (and probably largely independent from) other genomic changes like substitutions and rearrangements in the gene order as evident by comparing the mt genomes of <italic>Vaceletia </italic>and <italic>Ircinia</italic>. The latter genome has an identical gene arrangement, but completely lacks RHEs.</p><p>Evidence for lateral transfer and inter-genomic mobility of repetitive hairpin elements could not be found due to the lack of sufficient population samples. In non-metazoan taxa inter-genomic mobility of RHE was hypothesized e.g., for fungi of the genus <italic>Allomyces</italic>, where closely related species possess different frequencies of RHE insertions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] in congruence to previous observations in rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Mechanisms for mobility of RHE may be different. Mobility of the yeast RHE, located in GC-rich clusters, is believed to happen by means of transposition at the DNA level similar to DNA transposons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. By contrast, a different mode of transposition, potentially via RNA intermediates, has been suggested for the <italic>Allomyces </italic>RHEs because of the lack of duplications in the flanking regions typical for DNA-transpositions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. For Porifera, the lack of mt sequences of closely related species yet prevents speculation on their RHE transposition mechanisms.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Several poriferan mt genomes possess large IGRs, which are target sites for repetitive hairpin elements. RHEs themselves also contribute to the large size variation found among sponge mt genomes. Their scattered distribution and dissimilar structure strongly suggests multiple independent invasions of RHEs instead of a single ancestral event with subsequent loss in some lineages. Additionally, the presence of RHE- clusters in <italic>Vaceletia </italic>sp. implies a rapid proliferation in combination with intra-genomic mobility of such motifs.</p><p>As RHEs are not uncommon among extant demosponges, occasional RHE invasions might also have occurred in (now extinct) taxa diverging earlier from the lineage leading to the last common ancestor of Porifera. Furthermore, as ancestral mt genomes were probably richer in IGRs, and therefore provided more target sites for insertion of RHEs, it is likely that occasional RHEs infestations already occurred very early in metazoan mt genome evolution (and affected now extinct lineages). Subsequent genome compression in the lineage towards Bilateria after the split of Porifera combined with the loss of IGRs lead to the loss of RHE in eumetazoan mtDNA.</p><p>The mt genomes of Dictyoceratida provide information on metazoan mt genome evolution. The high nucleotide and structural similarity of the dictyoceratid mt genomes is opposed to the different morphology of its taxa, which must be accounted for in evolutionary studies on other poriferan groups with a similar degree of morphological differences.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p><italic>Ircinia strobilina </italic>was collected by Robert Thacker at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute's Bocas del Toro Research Station in Panama.
