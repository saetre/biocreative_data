Indeed, the process of adipocyte differentiation is governed by a tightly regulated cascade of transcription factors that are either activated or repressed at specific times during differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004743-Feve1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004743-Rosen1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. These variations in expression or activation lead to differential gene expression that will eventually guide precursor cells through their differentiation in adipocytes. Important members of this genetic cascade are the CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins (C/EBP) family members C/EBP&#x003b2; and C/EBP&#x003b4;, which are highly expressed early during differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004743-Salma1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. C/EBP&#x003b2; and C/EBP&#x003b4; then elicit the expression of C/EBP&#x003b1; and the PPAR&#x003b3; (Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x003b3;) isoform PPAR&#x003b3;2, two transcription factors working in a cooperative manner to promote the expression of various adipocyte-specific genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004743-Farmer1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

Of particular interest to this study is the demonstration that mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004743-Kyriakis1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, which include extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), p38 kinases and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), modulate either positively or negatively adipogenesis as a result of their ability to regulate the proadipogenic transcription factors C/EBP&#x003b2; and PPAR&#x003b3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004743-Camp1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004743-Bost1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, it has also been shown that MLK3, a JNK activator belonging to the mixed-lineage kinase (MLK) subgroup of MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK), plays a role in adipocyte differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004743-Brancho1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Support for this notion derives from the observation that the expression and phosphorylation of C/EBP&#x003b1; and C/EBP&#x003b2; were significantly increased at early times during differentiation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) deficient in <italic>Mlk3</italic> (MLK3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>). Furthermore, it was found that MLK3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells accumulate more lipids than wild-type MEF and that overexpression of MLK3 in these cells inhibited adipogenic differentiation.</p><p>In contrast to MLK3, which is widely expressed in many tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004743-Brancho1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, the MLK family member dual leucine zipper-bearing kinase (DLK) exhibits a more restricted pattern of expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004743-Nadeau1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004743-Blouin1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. During development, expression of DLK mRNA has been primarily detected in neuronal tissues such as brain and spinal ganglion, as well as in the epithelia of the skin, intestine, pancreas, and kidney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004743-Nadeau1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. In all these tissues, the expression of DLK mRNA increases with development and correlates with areas undergoing terminal cell differentiation. Consistent with a causal role for DLK in differentiation, ectopic expression of DLK in normal human keratinocytes promotes their terminal differentation, as evidenced by up-regulation of filaggrin, DNA fragmentation and activation of transglutaminases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004743-Robitaille1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Based on these observations, it thus appears likely that DLK may fulfill specific signaling functions required in either the induction or the maintenance of the differentiated state for a wide variety of cell populations. In keeping with this hypothesis, we demonstrate herein that DLK is expressed in mouse adipose tissue and that its expression dramatically increases during adipogenic differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. In addition, our results show that 3T3-L1 cells depleted in DLK by specific shRNA failed to accumulate lipids or express C/EBP&#x003b1; and the adipocyte-specific PPAR&#x003b3;2 isoform in response to adipogenic stimuli. Finally, we provide evidence that DLK depletion does not perturb the ability of C/EBP&#x003b2; to bind to the <italic>c/ebp&#x003b1;</italic> and <italic>ppar&#x003b3;2</italic> promoters, indicating that DLK acts upstream of the master adipogenesis regulators C/EBP&#x003b1; and PPAR&#x003b3;2 but downstream of their activator C/EBP&#x003b2;.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>DLK is expressed in adipose tissue and differentiating adipocytes</title><p>Because DLK is expressed in a tissue-specific manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004743-Nadeau1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004743-Robitaille1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, it has been proposed to serve as a regulator of differentiation. To further characterize the function of DLK, we decided to investigate whether this protein is involved in adipocyte differentiation. This issue was first addressed by examining the protein levels of DLK in the adipose organ, which is composed in mammals of white and brown adipose tissues organized in various subcutaneous or visceral depots. White adipose tissue is specialized for lipid storage, whereas brown adipose tissue generates body heat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004743-Hansen1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Immunoblot analysis of various white (gonadal, retroperitoneal, omental, mesenteric and inguinal) and brown (intrascapular) adipose depots showed that DLK is expressed to high levels in both mesenteric white adipose and brown adipose tissue. In comparison, heart as well as gonadal, retroperitoneal, omental and inguinal white adipose tissue depots expressed barely detectable levels of DLK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004743-g001">Fig. 1 A</xref>). The presence of DLK in differentiating adipocytes was then assessed in a widely used model of adipogenesis, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004743-Green1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, that were induced to differentiate for different periods of time (2, 4, 6, 8 or 10 days). Differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells was confirmed by blotting total cell lysates with antibodies directed against the two PPAR&#x003b3; isoforms, PPAR&#x003b3;1 and PPAR&#x003b3;2, and the mature adipocyte markers adiponectin and fatty acid synthase (FAS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004743-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Interestingly, DLK expression in differentiating cells increased gradually until reaching a plateau from day 6 to day 10 of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004743-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>), and this increase paralleled that seen with the protein levels of PPAR&#x003b3;1, PPAR&#x003b3;2 and adiponectin, . Moreover, an immunocomplex kinase assay showed that DLK is active during differentiation of 3T3-L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004743-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>), reflecting the accumulation of DLK detected by immunobloting.</p><fig id="pone-0004743-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004743.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Up-regulation of DLK expression and activity during 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation.</title><p>(A) Homogenates of mouse heart, white adipose tissue from various depots (gonadal, retroperitoneal, omental, mesenteric and inguinal) and brown adipose tissue (BAT) were subjected to Western blot analysis with specific antibodies against DLK or GAPDH.

On the other hand, our results also demonstrated that JNK and p38 exist as constitutively phosphorylated proteins in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, and upon differentiation of the cells, p38 activity progressively decreased while JNK activity increased to reach a maximum at day 4. Immunoblots processed in parallel with antibodies insensitive to the phosphorylation state of these MAPKs demonstrated that there was no apparent difference in the expression of either ERK, p38 or JNK during adipocyte differentiation, suggesting that their activity are positively or negatively regulated by the differentiation inducers.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>DLK is required for lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells</title><p>To further characterize the role of DLK in adipogenesis, we silenced its expression in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes by RNA interference and stained cells for lipids with Oil Red O (ORO) at day 6 of differentiation. Knockdown of DLK was accomplished by infecting cells with a lentiviral vector carrying a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) that targets mouse DLK mRNA (mDLK). To exclude potential nonspecific effects, cells were also infected with an empty lentiviral vector (EV) or a lentiviral vector expressing a human DLK shRNA (hDLK). In some experiments, the vector for hDLK had slight effect on DLK expression in 3T3-L1 cells, but this was considered negligible when compared to cells infected with the sh-mDLK lentivirus. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004743-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, the sh-mDLK construct abolished almost completely DLK protein expression, whereas the empty or sh-hDLK vector had no such effect. The intracellular level of tubulin was also unaffected by any of these constructs. ORO staining clearly demonstrated that there was no obvious accumulation of lipids in DLK-depleted cells, as opposed to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004743-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Lack of lipid accumulation could not be attributed to cell mortality, as preadipocyte-shaped undifferentiated cells were still visible after 6 days of differentiation (upper right corner, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004743-g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Spectrophotometric analysis of the extracted neutral lipids confirmed that DLK-depleted cells were devoid of lipids when compared to cells infected with the control lentiviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004743-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0004743-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004743.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>DLK depletion in 3T3-L1 impairs lipid accumulation in response to differentiation inducers.</title><p>3T3-L1 cells infected with an empty lentiviral vector (EV) or with a lentivirus expressing human (hDLK) or mouse (mDLK) DLK shRNA were induced to differentiate for 6 days.

For this purpose, 3T3-L1 cells were infected with the empty lentivirus or lentiviruses expressing mouse or human DLK shRNA and induced to differentiate for 6 days. The expression levels of four transcription factors known to be involved in adipogenesis, namely C/EBP&#x003b4;, C/EBP&#x003b2;, C/EBP&#x003b1; and PPAR&#x003b3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004743-Rosen2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> were measured every two days by Western blotting with specific antibodies. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004743-g003">Figure 3</xref>, cells infected with the sh-mDLK lentivirus showed a marked reduction of DLK protein expression compared with the control.

Accordingly, expression of the mature adipocyte markers adiponectin and FAS was impaired in DLK-depleted cells compared with cells infected with control lentiviruses. The effect of DLK depletion on C/EBP&#x003b1; and PPAR&#x003b3;2 was not attributable to a change in the subcellular localization of C/EBP&#x003b2;, which is essential for their expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004743-Zuo1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, since the presence of C/EBP&#x003b2; in the nucleus was confirmed by immunoblot analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions (data not shown).

Adding to this complexity, our results identify the MLK family member DLK as a novel regulator of adipocyte differentiation. Immunoblot analyses of various mouse adipose depots indeed demonstrated that DLK was specifically expressed in mesenteric white and brown adipose tissue, suggesting a role for this protein in differentiation and function of particular adipocyte subpopulations. Using the 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line as a model, we then showed that the protein level of DLK gradually increased upon differentiation like the adipogenic markers PPAR&#x003b3;2, adiponectin and fatty acid synthase. This increase in DLK expression was paralleled by either an increase or decrease in phosphorylation of the MAPKs ERK, p38 and JNK, which are recognized to have both positive and negative regulatory effects on adipocyte differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004743-Bost1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Using gene silencing of DLK by RNA interference, we demonstrated that this protein is essential for lipid accumulation and expression of the two master regulators of adipocyte differentiation, C/EBP&#x003b1; and PPAR&#x003b3;2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004743-Wang1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004743-Tontonoz1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004743-Werman1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. In agreement with this result, we found that DLK depletion was accompanied by decreased expression of adiponectin and fatty acid synthase that are downstream genes of C/EBP&#x003b1;, PPAR&#x003b3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004743-Qiao1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004743-Gustafson1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref> and SREBP-1c (sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 c), a transcription factor involved in fatty acid metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004743-Kim1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, respectively. This effect was reversed by the PPAR&#x003b3; agonist rosiglitazone, suggesting that the absence of DLK does not impair the capacity of an activated form of PPAR&#x003b3; to promote adipogenesis, and that DLK action takes place upstream of PPAR&#x003b3;. The capacity of ligand-activated PPAR&#x003b3; to rescue adipogenesis in DLK-depleted cells is in agreement with previous work showing the relative contribution of the two different PPAR&#x003b3; isoforms, PPAR&#x003b3;1 and PPAR&#x003b3;2, to adipogenesis. In their study, using engineered 3T3-L1 cells devoid of PPAR&#x003b3;1 and PPAR&#x003b3;2, Ren et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004743-Ren1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> demonstrated that only ectopic expression of PPAR&#x003b3;2 can induce adipocyte differentiation in the absence of exogenous ligand. Although it is not clear why this difference is observed, Werman and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004743-Werman1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref> reported that PPAR&#x003b3;2 contains a constitutive activation function in the N-terminus that is up to 10-fold stronger than that of PPAR&#x003b3;1. Moreover, it has been found that the N-terminus of PPAR&#x003b3;2 binds a small protein, termed PGC-2, itself having adipogenic action <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004743-Castillo1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, combined to these findings, our results suggest that the absence of DLK most likely prevents adipocyte conversion of 3T3-L1 cells by impairing the expression of PPAR&#x003b3;2.</p><p>Of particular interest was the finding that neither the expression nor the nuclear localization of C/EBP&#x003b2; was affected by the loss of DLK. This suggests that the early events in adipogenesis such as CREB (cAMP response element binding protein) activation by protein kinase A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004743-Gonzalez1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref> and its consequent up-regulation of C/EBP&#x003b2; remain unmodified under these conditions. RNA interference studies also led us to find that the depletion of DLK has no effect on JNK activity during 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. Although surprising, since DLK has been identified as an upstream activator of the JNK pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004743-Gallo1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, this result is not entirely without precedent. Published data from overexpression and RNA interference-mediated knockdown studies in other cell systems, such as COS and NIH 3T3 cells, also support a role for DLK in activation of the p38, ERK and Akt signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004743-Fan1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004743-Daviau1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, the possibility that an effector other than JNK mediates the action of DLK during adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells can not be excluded.</p><p>As demonstrated by the results of our RT-qPCR analyses, DLK depletion affects the accumulation of C/EBP&#x003b1;, PPAR&#x003b3;, adiponectin and fatty acid synthase proteins during adipocyte differentiation by directly down-regulating the expression of their encoding genes. Because ChIP assays revealed no difference in C/EBP&#x003b2; recruitment to the <italic>cebp&#x003b1;</italic> and <italic>ppar&#x003b3;2</italic> promoters before and after DLK depletion, it is tempting to speculate that DLK action in adipogenesis lies between C/EBP&#x003b2; DNA binding and initiation of <italic>cebp&#x003b1;</italic> and <italic>ppar&#x003b3;2</italic> gene transcription. C/EBP&#x003b2; binding to the <italic>cebp&#x003b1;</italic> and <italic>ppar&#x003b3;2</italic> promoters without being able to induce their transcription is a naturally occurring process during adipogenesis. Indeed, once induced by adipogenic stimuli, C/EBP&#x003b2; binds to the <italic>cebp&#x003b1;</italic> and <italic>ppar&#x003b3;2</italic> promoters well before initiation of transcription starts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004743-Salma1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. This is followed by recruitment of the Ini1, Brg1 and Brm subunits of the chromatin-remodelling SWI/SNF complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004743-Salma2">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref> at the <italic>ppar&#x003b3;2</italic> promoter, which leads to activation of <italic>ppar&#x003b3;2</italic> transcription. The resulting accumulation of PPAR&#x003b3;2 is a prerequisite to the expression of C/EBP&#x003b1;, since active PPAR&#x003b3;2 has the ability to displace a repressive complex composed of mSin3A/histone deacetylase (HDAC)1 from the <italic>cebp&#x003b1;</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004743-Zuo1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, if the SWI/SNF complex is not recruited to the <italic>ppar&#x003b3;2</italic> promoter, neither PPAR&#x003b3;2 nor C/EBP&#x003b1; will be expressed during adipogenesis, a phenomenon similar to what is seen in DLK-depleted 3T3-L1 cells. Our observation that rosiglitazone treatment restores, at least in part, the expression of C/EBP&#x003b1; in DLK-depleted cells is consistent with the idea that PPAR&#x003b3; activation facilitates C/EBP&#x003b1; expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004743-Ren1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, it is likely that rosiglitazone-mediated activation of PPAR&#x003b3;1 in DLK-depleted cells is sufficient to displace the repressive mSin3A/HDAC1 complex from the <italic>cebp&#x003b1;</italic> promoter and allow the expression of C/EBP&#x003b1;, which in turn induces PPAR&#x003b3;2, the most potent regulator of adipogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004743-Rosen3">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Another potential mechanism by which DLK depletion might decrease PPAR&#x003b3;2 and C/EBP&#x003b1; mRNA levels is by altering phosphorylation of C/EBP&#x003b2;. This idea is supported by the fact that C/EBP&#x003b2; has multiple phosphorylation sites, some of which are involved in the regulation of DNA-binding activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004743-Tang1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, while others are key determinants of its transactivation capacity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004743-Park1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Of particular interest among them is threonine 188, a consensus phosphorylation site for both ERK and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004743-Tang1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Mutation of this threonine to alanine disrupts C/EBP&#x003b2;'s ability to activate C/EBP&#x003b1; expression, but not DNA binding to C/EBP response element within the proximal promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004743-Park1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. The T188A mutation also makes C/EBP&#x003b2; incapable of inducing adiponectin gene expression, probably as a result of loss of C/EBP&#x003b1; expression. Taken together, these results imply that phosphorylation of C/EBP&#x003b2; at threonine 188 is critical for transcriptional activity in the context of the C/EBP&#x003b1; promoter. Additional support for a role of phosphorylation in the control of C/EBP&#x003b2; function also comes from the findings of Roy et al. who recently demonstrated that MLK3 activates C/EBP&#x003b2; in response to IFN-&#x003b3; by a mechanism involving decreased phosphorylation of a specific serine residue within transactivation domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004743-Roy1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, even if C/EBP&#x003b2; binds the <italic>cebp&#x003b1;</italic> and <italic>ppar&#x003b3;2</italic> promoters in DLK-depleted cells as efficiently as in control cells, a change in its phosphorylation state that would impair its function or interaction with transcriptional co-activators is also consistent with our results.</p><p>In summary, the results presented in this report identify DLK, a MLK family member, as one of the key regulators of adipocyte differentiation. Although the exact mechanisms by which DLK controls this process remain to be identified, DLK action most likely takes place downstream of C/EBP&#x003b2; DNA-binding to the <italic>cebp&#x003b1;</italic> and <italic>ppar&#x003b3;2</italic> promoters but upstream of transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004743-g007">Fig. 7</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0004743-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004743.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Proposed model for the role of DLK in adipogenesis.</title><p>Early events in adipogenesis lead to the expression of C/EBP&#x003b2; and C/EBP&#x003b4; (step 1), which then bind to the <italic>cebp&#x003b1;</italic> and <italic>ppar&#x003b3;2</italic> promoters (step 2).

Supernatant was then analysed with a spectrophotometer at 520 nm.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Immunocomplex kinase assay for DLK</title><p>3T3-L1 cells at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 or 10 days of differentiation were homogenized in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1&#x00025; Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 0.2 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation and the concentration of total protein in the supernatant fraction was quantified using the modified Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Typically, 500 &#x000b5;g of protein extract were incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with constant rotation using DLK polyclonal antibody (Abgent, 1&#x02236;100 dilution) and protein A&#x02013;sepharose beads. After incubation, the immunocomplexes were washed three times with lysis buffer and three times with kinase buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml aprotinin). Immunocomplex kinase assays were performed by incubating the immune complexes in 40 &#x000b5;l of kinase buffer containing 2.5 mCi of &#x0005b;&#x003b3;<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), 25 mM ATP, and 1 mg of myelin basic protein as substrate. Following 20 min incubation at 30&#x000b0;C, the reaction was stopped by adding an appropriate volume of 6&#x000d7; SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography after fractionation by SDS-PAGE.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation</title><p>Each experiment was done with one confuent 100-mm dish of 2 days differentiated 3T3-L1 cells infected with an empty lentiviral vector (Empty vector) or lentiviruses expressing mouse (mDLK) or human (hDLK) shRNA. Briefly, infected cells were crosslinked for 10 min at room temperature with 1&#x00025; formaldehyde in PBS. Cells were then washed in PBS, resuspended in 200 &#x000b5;l of ChIP lysis buffer &#x0005b;1&#x00025; sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 10 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and protease inhibitors&#x0005d; and sonicated (60&#x00025; maximum output for 15 s with 3 min pause, 3 cycles; Branson Sonifier Type 450 with microtip; Danbury, CT) in an ice bath. The chromatin solution was diluted 10-fold in ChIP dilution buffer (0.01&#x00025; SDS; 1.1&#x00025; Triton X-100; 1.2 mM EDTA; 16.7 mM Tris, pH 8.1; 16.7 mM NaCl; and protease inhibitors). 5&#x00025; of the lysate was used for purification of total DNA. Each sample was precleared by incubating with 2 &#x000b5;g salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose 50&#x00025; gel slurry (Roche Diagnostics, Laval, Quebec, Canada) for 2 hours at 4&#x000b0;C. An aliquot of 10 &#x000b5;g of indicated antibody (or no antibody for the control) was added and immunoprecipitated at 4&#x000b0;C overnight. The immunoprecipitate was collected using salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose and washed sequentially with the following buffers: low-salt wash buffer (0.1&#x00025; SDS; 1&#x00025; Triton X-100; 2 mM EDTA; 20 mM Tri-HCl, pH 8.1; 150 mM NaCl); high-salt wash buffer (0.1&#x00025; SDS; 1&#x00025; Triton X-100; 2 mM EDTA; 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1; 500 mM NaCl); LiCl wash buffer (0.25 M LiCl; 1&#x00025; Nonidet P-40; 1&#x00025; sodium deoxycholate; 1 mM EDTA; 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) and TE (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 1 mM EDTA). DNA- protein cross-links were reversed by incubation at 65&#x000b0;C overnight followed by proteinase K treatment. DNA was recovered by purification with the Qiaquik PCR purification column (Qiagen).
