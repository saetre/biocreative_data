The <italic>rTS </italic>gene was later shown to code for two proteins (rTS&#x003b1; and rTS&#x003b2;) through alternative RNA splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The mRNA for rTS&#x003b1; is complementary to thymidylate synthase mRNA, while the mRNA for rTS&#x003b2; is not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The rTS&#x003b2; protein is the major protein product of the <italic>rTS </italic>gene and its expression is associated with the down-regulation of thymidylate synthase protein as cultured cells enter growth arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Expression of rTS&#x003b2; correlates with the production of small molecules that appear to mediate the down-regulation of thymidylate synthase protein by a novel intercellular signaling mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Overproduction of rTS&#x003b2; occurs in some cells resistant to inhibitors of thymidylate synthase or dihydrofolate reductase, indicating a role for the <italic>rTS </italic>gene in folate and nucleotide metabolism, as well as anticancer drug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>While the specific function(s) of the <italic>rTS </italic>gene products are currently under investigation, we now report a new rTS protein isoform and its association with mitochondria. The existence of this new isoform, rTS&#x003b3;, was first predicted using a computational comparative genomic sequence analysis approach and was then verified experimentally. This unexpected observation suggests that rTS may have functions in addition to intercellular signaling.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>A conserved extended protein N-terminus can be deduced from all available <italic>rTS </italic>genes</title><p>Comprehensive analysis of all available database sequences revealed that <italic>rTS </italic>genes demonstrate an atypical phylogenetic distribution. <italic>rTS </italic>exists only in a few groups of eubacteria, two fungal lineages (<italic>Ascomycota </italic>and <italic>Basidiomycota</italic>), and most animal species from insects to mammals. Among bacterial <italic>rTS </italic>orthologous genes, several were annotated with a longer N-terminus based on a start codon located further upstream. These proteins include NP_355739.1 (<italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens str. C58</italic>), NP_540624.1(<italic>Brucella melitensis </italic>16M), NP_639408.1 (<italic>Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris str</italic>. ATCC 33913), NP_669902.1 (<italic>Yersinia pestis </italic>KIM), NP_828458.1 (<italic>Streptomyces avermitilis </italic>MA-4680), CAD61030.1 (<italic>Arthrobacter ilicis</italic>), and ZP_00227861.1 (<italic>Kineococcus radiotolerans </italic>SRS30216), while many other proteins, including NP_405150.1 (<italic>Yersinia pestis </italic>CO92), NP_437232.1 (<italic>Sinorhizobium meliloti</italic>), NP_533476.1 (<italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens str</italic>. C58), NP_744975.1 (<italic>Pseudomonas putida </italic>KT2440), ZP_00213853.1 (<italic>Burkholderia cepacia </italic>R18194), ZP_00281771.1 (<italic>Burkholderia fungorum </italic>LB400), AAM39023.1 (<italic>Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri str</italic>. 306), and YP_070105 (<italic>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</italic>) were annotated with an N-terminus equivalent to that of human rTS&#x003b2;. Therefore, we determined whether an equivalent extended N-terminus could be predicted in the human <italic>rTS </italic>gene. Previously, all available human <italic>rTS </italic>genomic sequences appeared to contain a sequence gap immediately upstream of the start codon of rTS&#x003b2;, and the published 5'-end of the <italic>rTS </italic>mRNAs was originally determined by RACE (Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends) analysis of cloned sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Thus, a longer N-terminal was not predicted initially, and not expected based upon the existing experimental evidence. However, at the time we started this analysis, one BAC clone, RP11-778P8 [AC021474.1], was found to contain the sequence covering an extended exon region as well as the rest of the gene, although its sequence was in a status of unordered fragments. In addition, a GenBank entry for the human <italic>rTS </italic>gene by Dolnick and Su [<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AF305057">AF305057</ext-link>] contains the complete 5'-end upstream sequence. Analysis of this sequence by GenScan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] predicts a start codon upstream of the start codon for rTS&#x003b2;, yielding an extended N-terminal that is 27 amino acids longer than rTS&#x003b2; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). A sequence comparison between the extended human rTS protein region and the bacterial rTS proteins possessing a longer N-terminus revealed a high level of sequence similarity in the extended region. Therefore, we reasoned that a longer N-terminus may exist in all <italic>rTS </italic>orthologous genes, and this was confirmed by the presence of a possible equivalent extension of the N-terminus in all available <italic>rTS </italic>genomic sequences (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A&#x02013;E</xref>). We named this potential new isoform rTS&#x003b3; to distinguish it from rTS&#x003b2; and rTS&#x003b1;. During our preparation of this manuscript, NCBI released a new RefGene entry for human rTS&#x003b2; [NM_202758 and NP_059982.1]. This entry, dated Dec-20-2004, predicted a different N-terminus and was subsequently replaced by another entry [NM_017512 and NP_059982.2] on 02-March-2005, which has a deduced protein product identical to that described in this report. While all available animal <italic>rTS </italic>genes, including those from human, three fish species (fresh and salt water pufferfish and zebrafish), the basal chordate, <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic>, and the invertebrate <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>, share the same intron/exon boundary position at least for the first exon/intron junction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A&#x00026;B</xref>), the fungal <italic>rTS </italic>genes seem to vary in gene structure making them different from the animal genes, as well as from each other (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C&#x00026;D</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Prediction of extended N-termini for rTS genes. </bold>The genomic sequences and the predicted protein translations for the N-terminal regions from four different species, <italic>Homo sapiens, Anopheles gambiae, Ustilago maydis</italic>, and <italic>Sinorhizobium meliloti</italic>, are shown in panels A to D, respectively.

Initially, a cytosolic fraction and an organellar pellet (including mitochondria and lysosomes) were prepared from CCRF-CEM human cells, and their proteins were resolved by electrophoresis and analyzed for rTS protein expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The results indicate that two rTS proteins with apparent molecular mass of 52.7 &#x000b1; 1.8 and 47.6 &#x000b1; 0.7 kDa (approximately corresponding to the difference in the predicted molecular mass of the rTS&#x003b2; and &#x003b3; isoforms, respectively) are present. There was a preferential distribution of the higher molecular mass species in the organellar fraction as compared to the cytosolic fraction. The presence in the organellar fraction of both lysosomal (LAMP-1) and mitochondrial (MnSOD) marker proteins, however, did not allow us to conclude that rTS proteins are present in the mitochondria, rather than in the lysosomes. To resolve this, we partially separated lysosomes from mitochondria using a 5&#x02013;20% iodixanol gradient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>](Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). The protein profile of the iodixanol gradient shows a peak centered on fractions 14&#x02013;15 with a pronounced shoulder in fractions 10&#x02013;12. GDH activity appears in fractions 12&#x02013;18 with a peak at fraction 15, indicating the presence of mitochondria in these fractions. The shoulder in the protein profile (fractions 10&#x02013;12) that lacks GDH activity suggests the presence of non-mitochondrial organelles, including lysosomes. This suggestion was confirmed by Western blotting of the gradient fractions for MnSOD and LAMP-1 markers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Analysis of the distribution of rTS&#x003b2; in the gradient indicates that both the rTS&#x003b2; and &#x003b3; species co-localize with MnSOD, but not LAMP-1, conclusively demonstrating their presence in mitochondria, but not lysosomes.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Localization of rTS&#x003b2; and rTS&#x003b3; to mitochondria.

The signaling associated with rTS&#x003b2; was also shown to act intercellularly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Sequence analysis of the <italic>rTS </italic>gene suggested the presence of a mitochondrial leader sequence that would be expected to increase the length of rTS&#x003b2; from 416 to 443 amino acids in rTS&#x003b3; with an expected change in molecular mass from 46,892 to 49,742 Da. Based upon the prediction of a mitochondrial leader sequence, we evaluated whether there is a mitochondrial form of the rTS protein. The results shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> indicate that this is the case, with two species being present in the mitochondria. These two protein species have apparent molecular masses of 52.7 &#x000b1; 1.8 and 47.6 &#x000b1; 0.7 kDa. The smaller species corresponds well to the predicted size expected for rTS&#x003b2; with the mitochondrial leader sequence cleaved off, while the larger species differs by 3 kDa from the predicted molecular mass for the isoform with the leader sequence. The amounts of rTS&#x003b3; and rTS&#x003b2; in the combined cytoplasmic and mitochondrial fractions differ from that expected to result from combining equal amounts of each fraction. The increased abundance of rTS&#x003b2;, relative to rTS&#x003b3; in the combined fraction may be the result of <italic>in situ </italic>cleavage of the rTS&#x003b3; mitochondrial leader sequence by cytosolic proteases, which has been observed to occur in yeast cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], although transfer of protein may also contribute to the change in signal strength as the MnSOD signal is weaker in the lane with the combined fractions than in the lane loaded with just the organelle protein. Although the migration of proteins in SDS-PAGE gives only approximate estimation of molecular masses, there is a possibility that other post-translational modifications may contribute to this discrepancy. The co-localization of rTS&#x003b2; and rTS&#x003b3; with GDH and MnSOD after subcellular fractionation strongly suggests that the extended N-terminal sequence serves as the leader sequence for mitochondrial location of the protein and that it is likely this is partially cleaved to generate the &#x003b2; isoform, once rTS&#x003b3; is transported into the mitochondria. The presence of the rTS&#x003b2; protein in mitochondria raises the question of what role this enzyme and the rTS signaling pathway may play there. Mitochondria are a major site for folate metabolism in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Thymidylate synthase is also found within mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], despite the absence of a canonical mitochondrial leader sequence, and the relationship of rTS signaling to thymidylate synthase and folate metabolism may ultimately provide the explanation for this phenomenon. Recent evidence indicates that treatment of cells with an rTS&#x003b2; signaling mimic can affect the cytoskeleton and cause down-regulation of <italic>TYMS </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The co-localization of rTS and thymidylate synthase in the mitochondria may indicate that rTS&#x003b2;, in addition to its role in intercellular signaling, also provides intracellular signals that regulate thymidylate synthase levels in the mitochondria.</p><p>Since the extended N-termini of rTS are conserved from bacteria to human, we believe that the rTS&#x003b3; form of the <italic>rTS </italic>gene represents the ancestral form of this gene, while rTS&#x003b2;, which seems to be the predominantly expressed form in the cytosol, represents an isoform that appeared later during evolution and came to co-exist with the ancestral isoform, at least in <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>. Based on a recent study which shows that suboptimal AUG codons can support translation via leaky scanning and reinitiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], the co-existence of protein products translated using different AUG codons in the same reading frame may not be a rare phenomena. In fact, the starting AUG codons for rTS&#x003b3; and rTS&#x003b2; are both qualified as optimal start codons according to recent studies of translation initiation in mammalian and plant genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], providing an explanation for the co-existence of rTS&#x003b3; and rTS&#x003b2;. A recent study suggests that many alternative splicing forms cause differential subcellular localization, especially in targeting either peroxisomes or mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and our data serves as evidence supporting such a notion. An interesting subject for future studies will be to determine when the shorter rTS&#x003b2; isoform appeared during evolution.</p></sec><sec><title>Phylogenetic distribution and origin of <italic>rTS </italic>gene</title><p>rTS is highly conserved, being found in a variety of species, ranging from bacteria to human. Unlike other enolase genes with a wider phylogenetic distribution, or the thymidylate synthase (<italic>TYMS</italic>) gene, which is ubiquitous in organisms from all three kingdoms and is highly conserved, <italic>rTS </italic>demonstrates an unusual phylogenetic distribution. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, the presence of <italic>rTS </italic>is limited to a few groups of eubacteria including &#x003b1;-, &#x003b2;-, and &#x003b3;-proteobacteria, actinobacteria, some fungi, and animal species spanning the phylogenetic range from insects to mammals. Among the vertebrate species for which draft genome sequences and/or a large number of EST sequences are available, we were able to identify <italic>rTS </italic>sequences from all species with the exception of chicken and mouse [see a complete list of deduced amino acid sequences in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file 1</xref>].

While the absence of <italic>rTS </italic>sequence in chicken may be due to the insufficiency of available genome sequences or ESTs, we were puzzled by the failure to retrieve any <italic>rTS </italic>sequences in mouse, considering the fact that the mouse genome sequence is now fairly complete and its EST data is quite comprehensive. However, we recently obtained preliminary data showing expression of mouse rTS protein and mRNA (data not shown). Another unusual observation is that the <italic>rTS </italic>gene does not seem to be present in <italic>E. coli </italic>while the <italic>rTS </italic>gene is present in another enterobacterium,<italic>Yersinia pestis</italic>. Similarly, although the <italic>rTS </italic>gene is present in <italic>Anopheles gambiae </italic>and several other insect species, but is not found in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. So far, no <italic>rTS </italic>gene has been identified in any plant or yeast species despite the fact that complete genome sequences and comprehensive EST sequences are available for a number of species in these lineages. We also find no rTS sequences from <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans </italic>or other worm genome sequences. The same is true for all archaebacteria and many eubacteria lineages. These observations suggest that the <italic>rTS </italic>gene originated as a bacterial gene which was either horizontally transferred into certain animal and fungal lineages, or alternatively, was lost in all the lineages that do not contain <italic>rTS </italic>genes. An interesting observation is that, while the rTS branches for the animal lineage and the fungal lineage show a topology that agrees well with commonly accepted tree of life for these species, the branches for the bacterial lineages conflict with the commonly accepted tree for the bacterial lineages (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The latter is demonstrated by the fact that species from the same lineage do not always group together, while species from different bacterial lineages do cluster together in many cases (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). For example, one &#x003b2;-proteobactial rTS sequence (rTS_bc) is grouped with &#x003b1;-proteobacterial sequences, while the other two &#x003b2;-proteobacterial sequences cluster with a &#x003b3;-proteobacterial sequence and the three rTS sequences from the High G+C gram positive bacteria are located on three different branches, which all consist of sequences from multiple groups (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Although not all nodes for the bacterial groups are supported by a high bootstrap value, many nodes are supported with high confidence. This type of unexpected phylotree shown by the rTS sequences suggests the possibility of horizontal gene transfer among the bacteria species, which is common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The fact that most of the bacteria and fungi that have a <italic>rTS </italic>gene are human and/or animal pathogens (<italic>Aspergillus nidulans, Brucella suis</italic>, <italic>Brucella melitensis</italic>, <italic>Burkholderia cepacia Burkholderia fungorum, Cryptococcus neoformans, Yersinia pestis, Silicibacter sp)</italic>, plant pathogens (<italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic>, <italic>Gibberella zeae, Xanthomonas axonopodis</italic>, <italic>Xanthomonas campestris</italic>.<italic>, Ustilago maydis, Magnaporthe grisea</italic>), or in one instance a plant symbiont (<italic>S. meliloti</italic>), adds weight to the hypothesis of horizontal gene transfer events. In the case of plant pathogens, the plants can serve as a mediator between a bacterial donor and an animal acceptor. This may also suggest that the <italic>rTS </italic>gene is required to create and/or maintain a certain type of host-pathogen relationship. Therefore, a better understanding of the biological function of the <italic>rTS </italic>gene may provide new insights for disease control related to these bacterial pathogens.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Unusual phylogenetic distribution of the rTS gene. </bold>The sequences of the same set of proteins displayed in Fig. 2 were used to generate a neighbor-joining tree using ClustalX.

In addition to the extension of the N-terminus as indicated in Fig. 2, adjustments to the currently annotated exon boundaries for a few rTS genes were necessarily made based on the best match between their genomic sequences and the human rTS&#x003b3; protein sequence (see detailed modifications in supplemental materials).

Through this study, we have made a comprehensive collection of rTS orthologous sequences and have made a list of suggested modifications to the existing gene annotation (see detailed modifications in the supplemental materials). In addition, by searching all annotated human genes, we identified a few other genes in which evolutionarily conserved alternative upstream AUG codons exist (similar situation as rTS&#x003b2;). These genes include SELL [NM_000655], SPCS1 [NM_014041.1], NT5C3 [NM_016489], and SDN1 [NM_014390] (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, through comparative genomic analyses we revealed an unusual phylogenetic distribution of the <italic>rTS </italic>gene and identified a novel mitochondria isoform of this gene and verified it experimentally.

Among all identified rTS&#x003b2; orthologous protein sequences, the ones with an N-terminus equivalent to human rTS&#x003b2; were identified and their corresponding genomic sequences, including sufficient 5'-end upstream sequences for analysis, were retrieved. Extended N-termini were deduced by extending the start codon to the next available "ATG" upstream of the start codon used by the existing annotation. In addition to the <italic>rTS </italic>orthologous genomic sequences, we also searched the NCBI EST database by performing a TBLASTN search with the extended human rTS&#x003b2; protein sequence to collect rTS cDNA sequences from additional species. To predict any potential new function or cellular location contributed by the extended N-terminus, we analyzed the human rTS&#x003b3; and rTS&#x003b2; protein sequences with Mitoprot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], TargetP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], PSORTII [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], and Mitopredict [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Subcellular fractionation of CCRF-CEM cells</title><p>The human T-lymphoblastic cell line CCRF-CEM was cultured as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Subcellular fractions of CCRF-CEM cells were isolated essentially as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], except that protease (0.5 mM Pefabloc) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mM sodium metavanadate and 1 mM NaF) were included in all buffers. All steps were performed at 0 &#x02013; 4&#x000b0;C. Briefly, 1-liter of CCRF-CEM cells (~3.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells/ml) was centrifuged at 1000 &#x000d7; g for 5 min and the pellet was washed with iced 0.9% NaCl, and then suspended in 5 pellet volumes of ice-cold hypotonic buffer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and allowed to swell for 5 min on ice. The suspension was homogenized in an ice-cold 7-ml glass Dounce homogenizer with 15 strokes of the tight pestle to obtain &#x0003e; 95% cell disruption. The homogenate was immediately made up to 250 mM sucrose and centrifuged at 1000 &#x000d7; g for 5 min. The pellet was washed once with 2.5 original pellet volumes of cold isotonic buffer (1 mM Na<sub>2</sub>-EDTA, 250 mM sucrose; pH 6.9). The two supernatants were combined to generate the post-nuclear supernatant (PNS). The PNS was centrifuged at 17,000 &#x000d7; g, 15 min to generate a cytosolic fraction (supernatant) and an organellar pellet containing both mitochondria and lysosomes. The organellar pellet was suspended in 1 ml of HES (20 mM HEPES-NaOH, 1 mM Na<sub>2</sub>-EDTA, 250 mM sucrose; pH 7.4). Subcellular fractions were assayed in duplicate for activity of the cytosolic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and mitochondrial matrix enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] to ensure that fractionation was successful. To separate mitochondria and lysosomes, this organellar suspension was made up to 30% (w/v) iodixanol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] in a final volume of 2.2 ml and placed on a 5&#x02013;20% linear iodixanol gradient (9 ml), centrifuged at 70,000 &#x000d7; g for 1.5 hr, and collected as 0.5-ml fractions, which were then diluted with 0.5 ml ice-cold HES and centrifuged at 30,000 &#x000d7; g for 15 min. The resulting organelle pellets were suspended in 200 &#x003bc;l of isotonic buffer (as above, except that NaF was 50 mM). Protein concentration was determined using the BioRad (Hercules, CA) protein assay kit.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blotting</title><p>Proteins were resolved by denaturing gel electrophoresis using 10% polyacrylamide and transferred to PVDF membranes essentially as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].
