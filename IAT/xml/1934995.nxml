Numerous studies have revealed the evolutionarily conserved secondary structure of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) across species [reviewed by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>)]. Among ribosomal protein constituents, several families of highly conserved proteins are recognized between evolutionarily divergent groups [e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2 B3 B4 B5">2&#x02013;5</xref>)]. Primary rRNA-binding proteins are within the group of structurally conserved proteins that recognize highly conserved features of rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Other ribosomal proteins are less well-conserved in structure between lineages. Variability in ribosomal protein composition contributes to diversity in ribosome composition observed in many organisms. Thus, within a given species evolutionarily conserved and structurally divergent ribosomal components may comprise the translation apparatus.</p><p>An important ribosomal protein family is defined by <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> protein EL23. Numerous structural equivalents have been recognized in many organisms, identified as &#x02018;L23&#x02019; in most prokaryotes, &#x02018;L25&#x02019; in yeasts and as &#x02018;L23a&#x02019; in most eukaryotes, including insect lineages discussed in this paper. Ribosomal protein L23(a)/L25 is an essential protein, binding to precursor large subunit rRNA early in ribosome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9 B10 B11">7&#x02013;11</xref>). The multifaceted roles of L23 become increasingly apparent; the protein functions in early assembly events as well as in early and late stages of rRNA processing in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). After the completion of ribosome maturation, L23 later assumes a co- and post-translational role as the nascent polypeptide emerges from the ribosome. L23 interacts with several protein folding and targeting apparatus components, including the chaperone trigger factor (TF) in <italic>E. coli</italic>, signal recognition particle, Sec61 translocation channel, and the nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14 B15 B16 B17 B18 B19 B20">14&#x02013;20</xref>).</p><p>Yeast L25 is the most widely studied eukaryotic member of the L23(a)/L25 protein family. Three distinct functional domains, essential for rRNA maturation, have been identified within the yeast protein: an N-terminal region which harbors the nuclear localization signal (NLS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), a central domain required for rRNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), and a C-terminal region which is required for 60S large subunit assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Although L25 is reportedly involved in early and late rRNA processing steps, a specific function for L25 during rRNA processing has yet to be defined.</p><p>L23(a)/L25 binds within Domain III of 23S&#x02013;28S&#x02009;rRNA, near the peptidyl transferase center of the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Within the large ribosomal subunit, L23 assumes a prominent position on the subunit surface at the exit tunnel for the nascent polypeptide, based on structural studies of the <italic>Haloarcula marismortui</italic> ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), residing next to proteins L29, L19 and L39e (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). The interior surface of the exit channel consists primarily of rRNA domains. The proximity of L23 to the nascent polypeptide and the membrane translocon, and its documented interactions with several protein folding and translocation components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14 B15 B16 B17 B18 B19 B20">14&#x02013;20</xref>), favor the proposal that L23 also plays a key role in targeting inner membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p><p>Numerous L23(a)/L25 homologues have been identified, each with the signature rRNA-binding domain and the nearly invariant RNA-binding motif KKAYVRL, found in the C-terminal portion of the protein. Several studies have confirmed the ability of L23 family members to interact with 25S&#x02013;28S&#x02009;rRNA-binding sites from different organisms, demonstrating that a core of conserved interactions must exist between L23(a)/L25 proteins and the rRNA-binding site [e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>)]. In two cases, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> L23a (L23aA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) and rat L23a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) have both been confirmed as functional homologues of yeast L25 through their abilities to rescue yeast strains grown under nutritional conditions in which the endogenous L25 gene was not expressed. In each case, the plant and mammalian homologues are structurally similar to yeast L25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Schematic alignment of L25/L23a ribosomal proteins.

Although all known eukaryotic members of this protein family have an N-terminal extension of variable length, harboring the NLS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), the proposed <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> L23a homologue (and several other L23a homologues discussed in this paper) is even more structurally divergent in the N-terminal region. Fruit fly L23a carries an extra domain of approximately 135 amino acids (aa) with similarity to histone H1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), extending its overall size to 277&#x02009;aa (33; accession NP_523886) compared to the yeast L25 protein of 142&#x02009;aa (34; accession P04456; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).

Sequencing of the L23aFLAG insert within pL23a-FLAG showed three nucleotide changes that alter the deduced amino acid sequence at three positions relative to the GenBank <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> L23a sequence (accession number NP_523886). All three amino acid changes occur at positions where amino acid variation is present within L23a sequences (Supporting <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Although this L23a variant may have arisen due to errors induced in RT-PCR by Taq DNA polymerase, it is likely that the variant is a naturally occurring form. From numerous independent isolations of cloned PCR products derived from RT-PCR experiments using different RNA preparations, we have only been able to recover the canonical version of L23a (accession number NP_523886) or the variant described here containing all three amino acid changes (accession number DQ450529).

Initial analyses clearly showed the presence of FLAG-tagged L23a protein within strain YCR16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>a and b). FLAG-tagged yeast L25 protein was also readily detected within strain YCR10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>a and b). However, no FLAG-tagged L23a protein was detected within strain YCR11 containing the pL23a-FLAG plasmid and an intact chromosomal copy of L25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>a and b). Our inability to detect L23a-FLAG protein within strain YCR11 was confirmed in several instances (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>a and b, for example). Interestingly, yeast FLAG-tagged L25 protein was detected in strain YCR13 that carries a plasmid encoding L25-FLAG along with an intact chromosomal copy of L25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>b). Protein expression levels for L25 and L25-FLAG in strain YCR13 are not identical. Within strain YCR13, L25 expression appears to be less than the level that accumulates in strain YCR11; however, in a separate isolate of this strain (carrying a chromosomal copy of L25 and a plasmid-encoded FLAG-tagged L25; called strain YCR14 not described in this study), no differences in L25 and L25-FLAG protein levels were seen, indicating expression variation between strains when both L25 and L25-FLAG genes are present (data not shown).</p><p>Several possibilities might account for the lack of fly L23a-FLAG protein within strain YCR11. There was no rationale for proposing a negative interaction between chromosomal and plasmid genes since simultaneous expression of both genes was readily detectable within strain YCR13. By restriction analysis of rescued plasmid pL23a-FLAG, we ruled out any gross changes in sequence that might affect plasmid gene expression, although small differences would not be detectable with this method. By RT-PCR analysis, we determined if the plasmid was transcribed within strain YCR11. Using L23a H1 domain-specific primers, L23a-specific RT-PCR products were detected within YCR11, but not in YCR10 where only FLAG-tagged L25 is expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). The YCR11 product is the same size as the product generated using <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> adult RNA as a template for amplification. A noticeable reduction in the amount of PCR product for strain YCR11 compared to strain YCR16 (shown in this particular RT-PCR experiment) was not consistently observed in all experiments, likely reflecting experimental variation. Equivalent amounts of PCR product for YCR16 and another strain that is genotypically equivalent to YCR11 (not discussed here, called YCR12; note that L23a-FLAG protein also fails to accumulate in this strain&#x02014;data not shown) were observed in other RT-PCR experiments (data not shown). Since the analysis was not designed as a quantitative PCR, we cannot confirm if there is reduced L23a plasmid transcription within strain YCR11 compared to strain YCR16. The data implicate a post-transcriptional mechanism to account for the lack of fly L23a-FLAG protein within strain YCR11. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>L23a-FLAG RNA is expressed within strain YCR11.

A delay is clearly evident at a later processing step (C<sub>2</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>a) to form mature 25S&#x02009;rRNA within strain YCR16 compared to strain YCR9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>b). At 5&#x02009;min into the chase period, 25S&#x02009;rRNA is clearly evident within the YCR9 strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>b). It is not however until 10&#x02013;15&#x02009;min into the chase period that 25S&#x02009;rRNA becomes apparent within YCR16. A delay in 27S&#x02009;rRNA processing was consistently seen in replicates of this experiment. No significant differences in the kinetics of 20S&#x02009;rRNA processing into18S&#x02009;rRNA were detected between strains. While it is unknown if the 27S&#x02009;rRNA processing delay is accompanied by any changes in rRNA synthesis and/or turnover in the YCR16 strain, it is plausible that the slower processing kinetics alone may be sufficient to explain the strain's slower growth rate.</p><p>It is possible that a decrease in 25S&#x02009;rRNA maturation kinetics would affect the steady state levels of 25S&#x02009;rRNA in strain YCR16. Northern blot analysis of RNAs isolated from cultures grown overnight shows that the steady state levels of 35S, 25S and 18S&#x02009;rRNAs are diminished compared to levels in strain YCR9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>c), even though equal amounts of RNA were loaded onto gels (confirmed by using <italic>PGK1</italic> as a loading control). Although the rate of rRNA synthesis within strain YCR16 may be diminished, increased rRNA degradation may be a contributing factor, affecting not only the steady state levels of 25S&#x02009;rRNA, but the levels of 35S and 18S&#x02009;rRNAs as well. In light of the reduced amount of rRNA and yet nearly equivalent amount of L23a-FLAG compared to L25-FLAG detected by Western blot in strains YCR16 and YCR10, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>a), the level of L23a-FLAG appears to be in excess of the amount of rRNA substrate in strain YCR16. Rapid degradation to eliminate excess yeast L25 protein was previously reported when the L25 gene dosage was increased nearly 50-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). Within strain YCR16, the level of L23a-FLAG protein may be below a threshold required for rapid degradation. Protein turnover may also be affected by slower kinetics of ribosome maturation observed in this strain.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Fly L23a-FLAG protein can replace yeast L25 function in yeast ribosome biogenesis and ribosome function</title><p>The ability of several heterologous L23a proteins to replace the function of yeast L25 has been documented previously [e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>)]; however, in no case has the disparity in L23a protein structure been as remarkable as is the case for <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> L23a compared to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> L25. Translation function within strain YCR16 is sufficient to maintain cell viability although there are clearly phenotypic deficiencies highlighted by the slow growth pattern in the strain at 23&#x000b0;C and at 30&#x000b0;C.</p><p>Several factors may account for the growth deficiency in strain YCR16, including inefficient utilization of the fly L23a NLS by the yeast transport machinery affecting the rate of L23a-FLAG protein nuclear transport or the presence of the small FLAG tag on L23a interfering with interactions required for ribosome synthesis or for post-ribosome maturation steps. Although neither of these possibilities can be completely excluded, the N-terminal extension itself may impede the kinetics of ribosome assembly or post-ribosome maturation processes at crucial steps, ultimately affecting the rate of growth. Earlier studies in which yeast L25 was either mutated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) or genetically depleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) revealed early and late rRNA processing defects. Our studies suggest that 35S&#x02009;rRNA processing (A<sub>0</sub>&#x02013;A<sub>2</sub>) to produce pre-27S&#x02009;rRNAs is not severely compromised, but that the efficiency of late steps (including C<sub>2</sub>) to produce mature 25S&#x02009;rRNA is affected in strain YCR16. This may affect the ribosome pools available for translation (as suggested by the diminished steady state levels of mature rRNAs), even if translation and post-translation processes proceed normally.</p></sec><sec><title>Lack of accumulation of fly L23a-FLAG protein within strain YCR11 that also expresses yeast L25</title><p>Although the plasmid-encoded L23a-FLAG gene is transcribed within strain YCR11, no L23a-FLAG protein accumulates. In principle, the difference in L25 gene dosage between strains YCR11 and YCR16 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>) might elevate protein levels beyond what is required for pre-rRNA binding and large ribosomal subunit assembly, resulting in degradation of excess protein in a mechanism previously described in other studies [e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>)]. If so, we would then expect both L25 and L23a-FLAG proteins to be represented in the YCR11 ribosome population, with excess protein degraded. Yet, lack of any detectable accumulation of L23a-FLAG suggests that an alternative explanation must account for the strain's protein accumulation pattern. A reasonable hypothesis is that yeast L25 competes more efficiently for nuclear import and/or for incorporation into yeast 60S ribosomal subunits than fly L23a-FLAG in this strain, ultimately excluding L23a-FLAG protein from being assembled and leading to its rapid turnover. On the other hand, the impact of protein competition is not a factor within strain YCR16 because the fly L23a-FLAG gene provides the sole source of this essential protein. Although the rate of L23a-FLAG protein turnover may be affected due to a change in ribosome maturation kinetics overall, it is clear that fly L23a-FLAG protein accumulates, ribosome assembly proceeds and growth is supported, albeit at a slower rate.</p><p>Our results differ from those of Jeeninga <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) in which rat L23a competed efficiently with yeast L25 for incorporation into yeast ribosomes, even in the presence of endogenous L25. Rat L23a shows 62% sequence identity with yeast L25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), is comparable in size to yeast L25, and lacks the extended N-terminal domain. This general structural similarity may be sufficient to minimize binding affinity differences that would affect ribosome assembly.</p></sec><sec><title>Structural and evolutionary considerations</title><p>How does the yeast ribosome accommodate the extra domain of fly L23a-FLAG? To propose a hypothesis for positioning the fly L23a-FLAG extra domain within a chimeric yeast ribosome, we have considered several L23 and protein chaperone interactions as well as the spatial organization of other ribosomal proteins at the exit tunnel. Along with proteins L19, L22, L24, L29 and L31e, L23 surrounds the base of the exit channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) and interacts with the protein folding apparatus (see Supporting <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> for the position of L23a on the <italic>H. marismortui</italic> 50S subunit). High-resolution structural studies of the 50S subunit from <italic>D. radiodurans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>) and <italic>H. marismortui</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) have revealed L23 structural differences between organisms. All L23 protein family members have a conserved globular domain, but unlike eubacterial L23, archaea and eukaryotic members lack an internal loop that extends into the exit tunnel interior cavity [reviewed by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>)]. The other end of L23 is positioned on the solvent side, close to the opening of the tunnel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53 B54 B55">53&#x02013;55</xref>).</p><p>Forming a hydrophobic cradle to nestle the emerging peptide just outside the exit tunnel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>), TF binds to the ribosome on a composite surface formed from two separate exposed regions in the <italic>D. radiodurans</italic> L23 globular domain, a single exposed region of L29, and regions of Domain III of 23S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>). One exposed region in <italic>D. radiodurans</italic> L23 includes glutamate-14 (Glu-18 in <italic>E. coli</italic> L23) and the other region includes C-terminal amino acid positions 92&#x02013;94 (Supporting <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Glutamate-18 is located in the center of the binding surface, with 23S&#x02009;rRNA interactions on one side of the binding surface and interactions with L29 and the C-terminal portion of L23 on the other side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>). Although TF is only found in eubacteria and chloroplasts, yeast NAC reportedly binds to <italic>E. coli</italic> and yeast ribosomes, suggesting that even in the absence of a direct test of which eukaryotic L23a residues are involved in binding, it is likely that NAC interacts through an identical binding surface that includes yeast L25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).</p><p>Based on amino acid alignment of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> L23a with <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>D. radiodurans</italic> L23 (Supporting <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), critical residues required for TF (and NAC) binding are found at fly L23a amino acid positions 196&#x02013;200 (20; also Supporting <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), within the conserved C-terminus. Thus, within the chimeric ribosomes of strain YCR16, binding surface residues for NAC would include fly L23a positions 196&#x02013;200 and additional residues at the C-terminal end.</p><p>Taken together, we speculate that the N-terminal extra domain of fly L23a forms an exposed &#x02018;appendage&#x02019; on the chimeric ribosome, distal to the C-terminal portion of L23a itself and projecting away from the peptide tunnel and ribosomal proteins L29 and L19. Other ribosome interactions may stabilize the position of the proposed appendage. This configuration is favored over a proposal in which the extra domain assumes an internal position within the tunnel where it could sterically occlude the tunnel in a fashion similar to some macrolide antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>) and is consistent with structural models in which an internal L23a loop is absent from eukaryotic L23a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). Whether or not the &#x02018;surface appendage&#x02019; proposal can be extrapolated to fly ribosomes remains to be determined.</p><p>From an evolutionary perspective, the coding capacity for the L23a extra domain in insect lineages may have been acquired through an insertion into the 5&#x02032; half of an ancestral L23a gene at a position that did not pre-empt existing L23a function(s). Alternatively, other groups may have lost the extra sequence over time with insect lineages maintaining the ancestral L23a gene. A more definitive answer to this question will require a broad comparative survey of L23(a)/L25 sequences, as yet unavailable.</p><p>Over time the extra domain may have acquired additional functions within insect lineages. Whatever novel interactions may have evolved, it would be expected that they are congruent with other L23a functions. One interesting possibility is that the L23a extra domain may have a role in processing reactions that create the &#x02018;gap&#x02019; within 28S rRNA in several insect lineages. This hypothesis is currently under investigation.</p><p>Interactions between L23a and poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), mediated through the novel H1-like domain, have already been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), but not fully explored. PARP plays an important role in many cellular processes, including DNA repair, transcription and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>). The possibility that L23a may function along with PARP in non-ribosomal pathways is intriguing. In fact, a recent finding that fly L22 co-purifies with histone H1 and is involved in chromatin interactions required for transcriptional repression broadens the concept of ribosomal protein function in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>). Both fly L22 and L23a carry the histone H1-like N-terminal extra domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). A possible role for the L22 N-terminal extension along with PARP in mediating these novel interactions with chromatin was not investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>). It is unknown if similar chromatin-L23a interactions occur. Other L23a extra domain interactions, yet to be discovered, may contribute further to the multifunctional capacity of the L23a ribosomal protein family.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkm428_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="nar_gkm428_nar-00075-a-2007-File010.doc"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="nar_gkm428_nar-00075-a-2007-File011.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was supported in part by a Block Grant from the Pennsylvania Department of Health and research funds provided by Lehigh University.
