Recent studies indicate that workers integrate sensory information during foraging flight for dance communication. The neural mechanisms that account for this remarkable ability are, however, unknown. In the present study, we established a novel method to visualize neural activity in the honeybee brain using a novel immediate early gene, <italic>kakusei</italic>, as a marker of neural activity. The <italic>kakusei</italic> transcript was localized in the nuclei of brain neurons and did not encode an open reading frame, suggesting that it functions as a non-coding nuclear RNA. Using this method, we show that neural activity of a mushroom body neuron subtype, the small-type Kenyon cells, is prominently increased in the brains of dancer and forager honeybees. In contrast, the neural activity of the two mushroom body neuron subtypes, the small-and large-type Kenyon cells, is increased in the brains of re-orienting workers, which memorize their hive location during re-orienting flights. These findings demonstrate that the small-type Kenyon cell-preferential activity is associated with foraging behavior, suggesting its involvement in information integration during foraging flight, which is an essential basis for dance communication.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>A variety of animals, from nematode to human, show social behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000371-Fitzpatrick1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000371-Robinson1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The social behaviors allow for individuals to create an entity greater than the sum of the individuals and provide the key to successful adaptation to the environment. One of the most striking features of the highly-ordered animal society is the ability to share information among individuals.

Although methods to detect the expression of immediate early genes (IEGs) as markers of neural activity are widely used in vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000371-Guzowski1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000371-Mello1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, neural IEGs have not yet been identified in insects. In the present study, we identified a novel IEG that can be used as a neural activity marker and found that the neural activity of a mushroom body (MB) neuron subtype is preferentially increased in foraging honeybees, suggesting its involvement in information integration during foraging flight.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>A novel non-coding IEG, <italic>kakusei</italic>, can be used as a marker to visualize neural activity in the honeybee brain</title><p>To identify IEGs, we used the differential display method to search for honeybee genes that are immediately induced in the brain by neural activity. To evoke strong neural activity in the brain, seizures were induced by awakening workers from ice-cold induced anesthesia, because some of the IEGs were identified by inducing seizures in the animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000371-Brakeman1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000371-Kato1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. When the workers are awoken from anesthesia, they show seizure-like movement with their legs and body shaking. Using differential display screening of approximately 6500 bands, which were derived from mRNAs extracted from the brains of seizure-induced and non-treated bees, 49 candidate bands were identified. Among them, we selected nine candidates that showed a pronounced difference in band intensity between the seizure-induced and non-treated bees. After preliminary Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of these candidates, we finally focused on a single candidate that showed the most prominent and reproducible seizure-induced transcript increase. As a result, we identified a novel IEG that we named <italic>kakusei</italic> after the word &#x02018;awakening&#x02019; in Japanese (the whole sequence of <italic>kakusei</italic> was deposited as DDBJ accession number AB252862). To examine the size of the <italic>kakusei</italic> transcript, we performed Northern blot analysis using total RNA isolated from whole brains of bees anesthetized with CO<sub>2</sub> and bees awakened from CO<sub>2</sub>-induced anesthesia. The results indicated that the induced <italic>kakusei</italic> transcript was approximately 7 kb long (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000371-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). There was no significant open reading frame in any of the three possible reading frames of the <italic>kakusei</italic> cDNA sequence, suggesting that the <italic>kakusei</italic> transcript functions as a non-coding RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000371-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). RT-PCR experiments and sequence analysis also confirmed that the contig <italic>kakusei</italic> sequence is expressed as continuous transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000371-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p><italic>Kakusei</italic> expression was transiently induced in the whole brain after awakening the workers from anesthesia induced by either CO<sub>2</sub> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000371-g001">Figure 1D</xref>; Sz (seizure)-induced&#x0005d; or ice-cold (data not shown). Real-time RT-PCR revealed that <italic>kakusei</italic> is expressed predominantly in the brain, suggesting a brain-specific function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000371-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization revealed that <italic>kakusei</italic> expression can be detected in every brain region, including the MBs, optic lobes (OLs), and antennal lobes (ALs) in a seizure induction-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000371-g002">Figure 2C&#x02013;J</xref>), suggesting that <italic>kakusei</italic> can be used as a marker in broad brain regions. In addition, <italic>kakusei</italic> signals (purple) were detected exclusively in the nuclei (green) of brain neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000371-g002">Figure 2K&#x02013;O</xref>), reflecting the characteristics of the <italic>kakusei</italic> transcript as a non-coding RNA. This notion was clearly demonstrated when the <italic>kakusei</italic> transcript localization was compared to that of <italic>actin</italic>, which is transported to the cytoplasm to be translated into protein and is detected as a broadly-distributed signal in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000371-g002">Figure 2P</xref>). This characteristic <italic>kakusei</italic> signal staining enabled us to count and quantify the number of <italic>kakusei</italic>-positive neurons.</p><p>We next examined whether <italic>kakusei</italic> expression reflects physiological neural activity by testing whether <italic>kakusei</italic> expression was induced in the brain upon light exposure. First, workers were dark-adapted by keeping them in the dark overnight. The next day, experimental bees (light-exposed) were exposed to white light for 30 min, and then used for <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization. Dark-adapted bees were used as a control. <italic>Kakusei</italic> expression was detected in the OL and MB neurons of the light-exposed bees (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000371.s001">Figure S1A&#x02013;F</xref>). The expression of <italic>kakusei</italic> was particularly prominent in the lamina neurons, which receive direct input from retinal neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000371.s001">Figure S1C and D</xref>). In contrast, there was no strong <italic>kakusei</italic> expression in the AL neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000371.s001">Figure S1G and H</xref>). These results indicate that <italic>kakusei</italic> can be used as a marker to visualize physiological neural activity in the honeybee brain.</p><p>To further examine whether <italic>kakusei</italic> expression can be detected in the brains of bees that exhibit physiologic behaviors, we studied <italic>kakusei</italic> expression in the brains of bees exhibiting phototactic behavior. According to a previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000371-BenShahar1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, we collected foragers that moved to the lighted side and nurse bees that did not move to the lighted side 30 min after the start of the phototactic behavior, and investigated <italic>kakusei</italic> expression in the brains (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000371.s002">Figure S2</xref> for the experimental procedures). Almost the same <italic>kakusei</italic> expression pattern was observed in the brains of both the foragers and nurse bees: a large number of neurons in the optic lobes were <italic>kakusei</italic>-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000371-g003">Figure 3</xref>), which was similar to the findings in the light-exposed bees (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000371.s001">Figure S1</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>kakusei</italic> expression is not so sensitive as to be induced by the neural activity specific to phototactic behavior, and that the activity in the optic lobes, which could be induced by visual inputs upon light illumination, is predominant even in the brains of bees that exhibited phototaxis. The fact that <italic>kakusei</italic> expression was observed in the optic lobes of bees that were not dark-adapted and had natural phototactic behavior strongly suggests that <italic>kakusei</italic> expression reflects neural activity under normal physiologic conditions, although we still cannot exclude the possibility that light-exposure is a stressor to the honeybee.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Neural activity is increased in the small-type Kenyon cells of the dancer brain</title><p>The workers shift their tasks from nursing their brood (nurse bees) to foraging for nectar and pollen (foragers) according to the number of days after eclosion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000371-Winston1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000371-Seeley1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. When foragers successfully find food sources, some of them perform a dance to enroll followers to forage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000371-Seeley1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, we next examined <italic>kakusei</italic> expression in the brains of the dancers, followers, and nurse bees to identify the brain regions involved in dance communication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000371-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The individual workers were caught immediately after confirming their behaviors in the observation hives, and used for <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization. The bees caught from the observation hives were immediately anesthetized by ice-cold water and kept on ice until use for <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization to maintain the current state of the <italic>kakusei</italic> transcripts in the brain. There was a characteristic <italic>kakusei</italic> expression pattern in the dancer brains, especially in the MBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000371-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). The honeybee MBs consist of three types of intrinsic neurons termed large-type Kenyon cells (lKCs), small-type KCs (sKCs), and class II KCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000371-g004">Figure 4E</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000371-Mobbs1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000371-Sawata1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. The most prominent <italic>kakusei</italic> expression was observed in the sKCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000371-g004">Figure 4B and F</xref>), whose somata are located in the center of the MBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000371-g004">Figure 4A and E</xref>). In contrast, only a small number of positive cells were detected in the brains of followers and nurse bees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000371-g004">Figure 4C, D, G, and H</xref>). <italic>Kakusei</italic> expression in the central complex neurons was not clear, as we could not identify the central complex neurons in our <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization experiments.</p><p>Quantitative analysis revealed that the number of <italic>kakusei</italic>-positive cells in the sKCs was approximately 20 times higher in the dancers than in the followers or nurse bees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000371-g004">Figure 4I</xref>). In addition, <italic>kakusei</italic> expression was also weakly induced in the lKCs and class II KCs, as well as in the dorsal and ventral OL neurons (dOL and vOL, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000371-g004">Figure 4I</xref>). A three-factor ANOVA &#x0005b;F1: bee type; F2: brain region (repeated measure); F3: brain hemisphere (repeated measure)&#x0005d; revealed that there was a significant difference between the bee type and brain region (F1 and F2: <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001, respectively; significant interaction between F1 and F2: <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001). In contrast, there was no significant difference between the right and left hemispheres (F3: <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.9455). Significant differences between bee types were observed in the dOL, vOL, lKCs, sKCs, and class II KCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000371-g004">Figure 4I</xref>; &#x0002a;, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05; &#x0002a;&#x0002a;, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01; Tukey-Kramer's test). These results indicate that the neural activity in these brain regions, especially the sKCs, is increased in the dancer brain. The differences in <italic>kakusei</italic> expression between dancers and followers could not be due to their different developmental stages but only to their behavioral differences, because both the dancers and followers are thought to be of the same behavioral stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000371-vonFrisch1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000371-Seeley1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the prominent neural activity in the sKCs observed in the dancer brains is likely due to their characteristic behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Neural activity of the small-type Kenyon cells is also increased in the forager brain</title><p>According to the expression profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000371-g001">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000371-g002">Figure 2K&#x02013;O</xref>), <italic>kakusei</italic> expression reflects neural activity that occurred 15 to 60 min prior to sampling of the bees. In our observation, dancers repeated the dance every 5 to 7 min and the foraging every 10 to 15 min. Thus, the neural activity detected in the dancer brains might be due not only to the dancing behavior, but also to the preceding foraging behavior. To address this question, we examined <italic>kakusei</italic> expression in the brains of foragers. Only some of the foragers that succeed in finding food display dance behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000371-Seeley1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000371-Seeley2">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, when we analyze foragers, only some of them are expected to be dancers.</p><p>Therefore, we collected foragers with pollen loads (an indication that they were successful in finding food) in front of the hive entrance before we checked whether or not they danced in the hive. The results indicated that every forager (N&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;12) had a <italic>kakusei</italic> expression pattern similar to that of the dancers (N&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6). In addition, there was no significant difference in the density of <italic>kakusei</italic>-positive cells in the MB neurons, including in the sKCs, between these bees &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000371-g005">Figure 5</xref>; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05, two-factor ANOVA (F1: bee type; F2: brain hemisphere)&#x0005d;. Thus, these results suggest that the increased sKC neural activity in the dancer brain is associated with foraging behavior rather than dancing behavior, although we cannot exclude the possibility that the foragers we examined also exhibited the dance behavior shortly before the observation period.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Re-orienting bees showed different <italic>kakusei</italic> expression patterns from foragers and dancers</title><p>Foraging behavior might involve multiple behavioral processes, such as visual, olfactory, tactile, and gustatory experiences, flying, landmark learning and memory, information processing for the dance communication, etc. We next examined whether the sKC-preferential <italic>kakusei</italic> expression is associated with forager-specific behavioral components or components that are common to the other behaviors, such as flying, visual experience, or landmark learning and memory. We investigated <italic>kakusei</italic> expression in the re-orienting bees, which were collected as the workers that fly around the hive to re-orient themselves to the hive when the location of the hive has changed. For this, we moved the hives at night with the entrance closed. The next morning, we opened the entrance for 5 min and then caught the bees flying around the hive 0, 15, and 30 min later. <italic>Kakusei</italic> expression was increased in the MBs in a time-dependent manner in the re-orienting bees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000371-g006">Figure 6A&#x02013;C and E</xref>), suggesting that this neural activity is induced by re-orienting behavior. One-way ANOVA among re-orienting bees revealed that the time effect was significant for every MB neuron type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000371-g006">Figure 6E</xref>: <italic>P'</italic>s&#x0003c;0.0001&#x02013;0.003). In contrast to sKC-preferential <italic>kakusei</italic> expression in the foragers, however, <italic>kakusei</italic> was induced in all KC types in the re-orienting bees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000371-g006">Figure 6A&#x02013;C and E</xref>). The proportion of <italic>kakusei</italic>-positive cells in the sKCs compared to that in the lKCs was significantly higher in the foragers than in the re-orienting bees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000371-g006">Figure 6F</xref>). To exclude the possibility that the neural activity in the re-orienting bees is due to the increased light exposure when they leave the hive, a similar experiment was performed using re-orienting bees from transparent observation hives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000371-g006">Figure 6G and H</xref>). In this experiment, a significant time-dependent increase in <italic>kakusei</italic> expression was observed in every MB neuron subtype in the re-orienting bees (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001, one-way ANOVA), like in the re-orienting bees from the normal hives, indicating that the increased <italic>kakusei</italic> expression in the re-orienting bees is due to re-orienting behavior, and not merely to light-exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000371-g006">Figure 6G and H</xref>). Here, the workers that performed re-orientation flights were probably foragers, also suggesting that the differences in the <italic>kakusei</italic> expression pattern between the brains of re-orienting bees and foragers/dancers are due to differences in behavior, but not age. These results demonstrate that the active brain regions are different between the re-orienting bees and foragers/dancers, suggesting that the sKC-preferential <italic>kakusei</italic> expression in forager/dancer brains is not due to behavioral components in common with those of re-orienting bees, like visual experience, flying, or landmark learning and memory. Rather, the forager-specific behavioral components are likely to be responsible for the sKC-preferential <italic>kakusei</italic> expression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, using novel methods to visualize neural activity in the honeybee brain, we demonstrated that neural activity in the MBs, especially the sKCs, is prominently increased in the brains of dancer and forager honeybees.

Although these findings imply that the MBs are the appropriate brain regions to process complex information during foraging behavior, such as the calculation of distance and direction, there was no direct evidence whether the MB neurons are actually active in forager brains. The methods that we established in this study provide the first opportunity to investigate neural activity in the brains of naturally behaving honeybees and revealed that the MB neurons are active in the dancers and foragers, although these methods are limited to labeling only cell bodies and not the neuropile because <italic>kakusei</italic> encodes a non-coding RNA whose expression is confined to the nuclei.</p><p>Our study demonstrated that neural activity of the sKCs, one of the MB neuron subtypes, was prominently increased in the dancer and forager brains. Although the inputs and outputs of the sKCs have been well investigated, the role of the neural circuitry composed by the sKCs is unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000371-Mobbs1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000371-Strausfeld1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000371-Ehmer1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000371-Gronenberg1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000371-Schrter1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.

On the other hand, all sensory modalities investigated (visual, olfactory, gustatory, and mechanosensory) project to both the basal ring and lip/collar zones, which are then relayed to both sKCs and lKCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000371-Mobbs1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000371-Strausfeld1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000371-Ehmer1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000371-Schrter1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Studies of the anatomy of the bee brain suggest that the basal ring zone receives multi-modal (visual, olfactory, gustatory, and mechanosensory) inputs and extensive recurrent inputs from extrinsic MB neurons, whereas the lip and collar zone receive mono-modal (olfactory and visual, respectively) inputs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000371-Mobbs1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000371-Grnewald1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000371-Rybak1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, the sKCs are composed of neurons with different morphologies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000371-Mobbs1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, we speculate that the sKC-preferential neural activity observed in the forager/dancer brains reflects the complex activity within the MB neural networks required for sensory integration during the foraging flight. Recent studies suggest functional differences among the KC types based on their gene expression patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000371-Takeuchi1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000371-Sawata1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000371-Paul1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000371-BenShahar2">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. For example, activation of <italic>Amfor</italic>, one of the genes preferentially expressed in the sKCs, affects the onset of foraging behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000371-BenShahar1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000371-BenShahar2">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. These findings are also consistent with our notion that the sKCs play roles in higher integration of the complex information that accompanies foraging experience.</p><p>Prominent <italic>kakusei</italic> expression was detected only in the forager brains, not in the follower brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000371-g004">Figure 4</xref>), possibly due to the differences in their foraging experience during the hour before sampling. The followers often show reduced foraging activity before they start following the dance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000371-Seeley1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000371-Seeley2">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, considering the short half-life of <italic>kakusei</italic> expression, it is possible that this behavioral difference is reflected in the <italic>kakusei</italic> expression in the follower brains. In addition, there were strikingly different <italic>kakusei</italic> expression patterns in the MBs between the re-orienting and foraging workers. Because the re-orienting bees fly around to form spatial memory regarding their hive location <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000371-Menzel2">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, they have several behavioral components in common with the foragers. How then are the differences in <italic>kakusei</italic>-expression between re-orienting and forager/dancer bees explained? Foraging behavior is different from orienting behavior in some ways: for example, foragers need to calculate the distance and direction of food sources, memorize them in association with food information, and recall them repetitively to repeat foraging, which involves much broader and multi-modal sensory integration than just orienting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000371-Menzel2">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000371-Giurfa1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, it is possible that the increased activity in the sKCs in the forager brains is associated with these behavioral components and reflects such sensory integration. Alternatively, it is also possible that the sKC activity is important for both the foraging and re-orienting behaviors and the relative repression of the lKC activity is important for the foraging behaviors. If this is the case, the integration of sensory information during foraging flight might result from interactions between active sKCs and inactive lKCs.</p><p>Here we identified the transcript of novel IEG, <italic>kakusei</italic>, as a non-coding nuclear RNA.

Thus, <italic>kakusei</italic> might regulate gene expression as a long non-coding RNA to modulate neural function.</p><p>Although methods using IEGs as markers of neural activity are widely applied in vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000371-Guzowski1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000371-Mello1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, no IEG has yet been reported in the insect brain.

characterization of a novel non-coding immediate early gene, <italic>kakusei</italic>. (A) Northern blot analysis was performed using RNAs extracted from the brains of workers collected 15 min after seizure induction (Sz-induced lane) and workers anesthetized with CO<sub>2</sub> for 15 min (Control lane). Using the same membrane, <italic>actin</italic> was detected as a loading control. The approximately 7-kb long signal is indicated by a triangle. (B) Overview of <italic>kakusei</italic> cDNA contig and open reading frame analysis. Arrows indicate cDNA subclones identified by 5&#x02032;-and 3&#x02032;-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) methods. The thin red bar in the middle of the arrows shows the DNA fragment identified by differential display screening (DD fragment). The solid bar indicates the full-length consensus <italic>kakusei</italic> cDNA. Lower box indicates open reading frame analysis in each reading frame of the consensus <italic>kakusei</italic> DNA. Note the lack of significantly long open reading frames. (C) Actual expression of the assembled cDNA sequence was confirmed by RT-PCR using primers designed to amplify the regions shown in (B). Bands of the expected size were detected for both regions (a) and (b), and the sequence was the same as the consensus sequence. Experiments were repeated five times, and performed with (&#x0002b;) or without (&#x02212;) the RT (reverse transcriptase) reaction, confirming that there is no genomic DNA contamination in the samples. (D) Time course of <italic>kakusei</italic> expression investigated by real-time RT-PCR. (E) <italic>Kakusei</italic> expression in various body parts investigated by real-time RT-PCR (&#x0002a;, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.0487; &#x0002a;&#x0002a;, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.0036; Student's <italic>t</italic>-test).
