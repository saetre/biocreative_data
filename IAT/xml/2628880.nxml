Tolerance can act via deletion, receptor down-regulation, blockade of signal transduction or via the action of suppressive cytokines. Monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs) belong to the innate immune system but they are instrumental in instructing the cells of the adaptive immune system via antigen presentation and cytokine production. One of the main cytokines produced by these cells is tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a cytokine that acts at various levels in order to promote immune response and inflammation.</p><p>TNF is produced upon activation of monocytes and DCs by microbial products like lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Pam<sub>3</sub>Cys, which act by binding to toll like receptors (TLRs). When cells are exposed to these compounds repeatedly, then the TNF production is decreased, i.e. the cells have become tolerant. The molecular mechanism of tolerance to date has been studied only in monocytes and macrophages. For LPS stimulation it was shown early on that the CD14 co-receptor was not down but rather up-regulated in tolerant cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Also, signal transduction still occurred with mobilisation of p50/p65 of NF-&#x003ba;B, but there was at the same time an increase in NF-&#x003ba;B p50-homodimers which bind to the promoter and displace the p50/p65 heterodimer. Since p50 cannot transactivate this will lead to blockade of TNF gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In addition to this p50-homodimer mechanism, blockade in LPS tolerant monocytes can also occur through interruption of the signalling cascade at the level of IRAK-1 in that this adaptor protein is proteolytically degraded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. For monocytes tolerant to the TLR-ligand Pam<sub>3</sub>Cys this mechanism also applied and there was a strong and complete ablation of IRAK-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Different mechanisms of tolerance operate in different cell types in that in lymphocytes deletion of cells is a major mechanism, while in monocytes blockade of signal transduction predominates. Because of this tissue specificity in tolerance mechanisms we have induced and analysed tolerance in mature human DCs.</p><p>When looking at tolerance induction in DCs Karp et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and demonstrated that pre-culture with a low dose of LPS led to a 80% reduction of IL-12 protein production upon secondary stimulation with a high dose of LPS. Other than that little is known about tolerance in mature DCs after TLR-ligation and the molecular mechanisms have not been studied. We show herein that tolerance can be induced in dendritic cells both with TLR2 and TLR4 ligands and that the mechanism involved is the ablation of the adaptor molecule IRAK-1. Such tolerance of DCs, which is characterised by lack of proper production of TNF and IL-12, will contribute to reduced immune responses in clinical settings like sepsis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Generation of DCs and induction of TNF</title><p>We generated DCs by culturing of PBMC for 5 days with GM-CSF and IL-13 followed by further culturing for 2 days with addition of PGE<sub>2</sub>.

We therefore asked whether LPS tolerance in DCs is regulated by this transcription factor. For this we infected DCs with an adenovirus containing 4 copies of a NF-&#x003ba;B binding motif upstream of the luciferase reporter gene and analysed the response to tolerance induction. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> the NF-&#x003ba;B dependent luciferase was strongly induced in na&#x000ef;ve cells (in average 96.8 -fold) and this was down to only 20.4 -fold in LPS tolerant cells. Taken together, these data show that LPS tolerance in human DCs operates at the level of the TNF promoter and is crucially dependent on NF-&#x003ba;B.</p><p>LPS is a prototypic stimulus of monocytes and in these cells it acts via CD14, MD2 and TLR4 cell surface receptors with TLR4 transmitting the signal into the cells by engaging molecules like MyD88 and TRIF. The MyD88 pathway involves recruitment of IRAK-1, which initiates a signalling cascade that leads to activation of IKKs and these will phosphorylate I-&#x003ba;B. I-&#x003ba;B is degraded and allows for NF-&#x003ba;B to be released and to go into the nucleus and transactivate genes like TNF. Blockade of signal transduction has been reported to occur at various levels in LPS tolerance and here the predominant mechanisms are a) up-regulation of p50 homodimers and b) ablation of IRAK-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In preliminary experiments we could not detect an increase in p50 homodimers in tolerant DC (not shown). Therefore, we have asked whether tolerance to LPS in DCs may be due to blockade at the level of IRAK-1. As shown by Western blotting IRAK-1 is clearly detectable in na&#x000ef;ve DCs but after induction of tolerance it is strongly reduced (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). In average of 4 experiments LPS tolerant cells (pre-treated without additional stimulation, lane 3 Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>) showed IRAK-1 at a level of 20.5 +/- 7.7% of the na&#x000ef;ve cells (p &#x0003c; 0.05). Under the same conditions SHIP protein did not show any change with the tolerant cells giving only a slightly higher expression level of the protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> versus 1: 157.2% +/- 98.8). These data suggest that LPS tolerance in human DCs acts by interrupting signal transduction at the level of IRAK-1.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of LPS tolerance induction on levels of IRAK1 protein.</bold> Day 7 dendritic cells were cultured for additional 2 days with LPS at 5 ng/ml and then washed and stimulated at 500 ng LPS/ml.

Tolerance in the immune system can operate via deletion of reactive cells, receptor downregulation, blockade of signalling and suppression via cytokines. TLR-ligand induced tolerance in monocytes/macrophages has been studied extensively and blockade of signal transduction appears to be the main mechanism of tolerance in these cells. Here blockade has been demonstrated to operate at various levels along the signalling cascade and this includes failure of MyD88 to be recruited to TLR4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], up-regulation of IRAK-M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] or SHIP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], up-regulation of suppressor of cytokine signalling-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and down-regulation of MAP-kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>A major mechanism of tolerance that can be demonstrated in macrophages but also in T cells and tumor cells is the up-regulation of p50 mRNA and increased translocation of p50-homodimers into the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. More recently the proteolytic degradation of IRAK-1 has been shown to represent another major mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].

The cells generated with LPS did, however, fail to express the DCs marker CD83 and it appears that TNF production was compared between 2 different types of DCs rather then in mature DCs that were pre-cultured without and with LPS. For mature dendritic cells TLR-mediated tolerance has been addressed only in 2 reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and for human DCs a down-regulation of IL-12 protein was demonstrated when cells, pre-cultured with a low dose of LPS, were stimulated with a high dose of LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The molecular mechanism of tolerance in these cells has, however, not been studied.</p><p>We have analysed tolerance to TLR-ligands in the human system and for this have generated monocyte-derived DCs via 7 day culture with GM-CSF, IL-13 and PGE<sub>2</sub>.

We have used this step deliberately since maturation with standard signals like LPS or TNF may induce tolerance on their own. The cells generated in our study were clearly DCs based on their expression of CD1a, CD83 and DC-SIGN. Stimulation of such cells was done with LPS from <italic>S. abortus equi</italic>, which was highly purified LPS to remove any contaminant lipoprotein such that TLR4 but not TLR2 was targeted. This LPS induced a rapid production of TNF mRNA which was still high at 1 ng/ml with a decreased response at 0.1 ng/ml. For induction of tolerance to LPS we used a low dose of LPS (5 ng/ml) and after pre-culture for 2 days stimulated with a high dose of 500 ng/ml, i.e. a 100-fold higher dose. The low dose still was capable to almost completely block the TNF production by the high dose of LPS, thus demonstrating the efficiency of blockade. There was, however, some residual TNF expression in the tolerant cells and this has also been seen in previous studies with tolerant monocytes/macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. This blockade of TNF production in the present study was clearly due to mechanisms operating in DCs since it could be equally demonstrated in purified CD83<sup>+ </sup>cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).</p><p>When addressing the molecular mechanism of this LPS tolerance we initially looked at the activity of the human TNF promoter and of NF-&#x003ba;B restricted reporter constructs. Since DCs are difficult to transfect with standard procedures, we have used adenoviral promoter luciferase reporter constructs for this purpose. These studies demonstrated a reduced TNF promoter activity in tolerant cells and this is similar to what has been shown in LPS tolerant monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. This suggested that the blockade is at or up-stream of the transcription level. The finding of downregulation of a construct carrying 4-NF-&#x003ba;B motifs furthermore suggested that the NF-&#x003ba;B signalling pathway might be involved. In preliminary gelshift analysis (data not shown) we found no consistent increase of p50-homodimers but rather a failure of NF-&#x003ba;B p50p65 to be mobilised into the nucleus. We therefore went on to study upstream elements by Western blotting. In these studies we found no change in the expression of the SHIP protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>) but IRAK-1 protein was strongly depleted in LPS tolerant cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Since IRAK-1 is an essential adaptor protein in the signalling cascade, leading from the TLR receptor structure to mobilisation of NF-&#x003ba;B, this depletion of IRAK-1 explains the tolerance of DCs. When looking at tolerance induction after ligation of TLR-2 we also found a strong down-regulation of TNF mRNA and IRAK-1 was also completely ablated by this treatment. The effect of Pam<sub>3</sub>Cys appeared much stronger in this system since IRAK-1 had already completely disappeared after 1 h of treatment with Pam<sub>3</sub>Cys and in cells treated with Pam<sub>3</sub>Cys for 2 days no IRAK-1 protein was detectable (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). Hence, it appears that for both TLR4 and TLR2 ligands the same mechanism of tolerance operate in human DCs. While these data are highly suggestive of a role of IRAK-1 in tolerance of human DCs, over-expression in tolerant cells of IRAK-1 using for instance adenoviral vectors will be required to confirm this conclusion.</p><p>The downregulation of IRAK-1 did occur at the protein level, since RT-PCR analysis did not demonstrate any significant change in IRAK-1 transcript levels (data not shown). An additional mechanism of tolerance is the downregulation of TLR-4 such that signal transduction is blocked at the receptor level as described by Nomura et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. We have addressed this point but were unable to obtain detectable cell surface staining with anti-TLR4 in the in-vitro generated DCs, probably due to a low number of receptors on these cells. Analysis of TLR-4 mRNA demonstrated that levels were unchanged in tolerance (data not shown). Still, it is conceivable that in DCs tolerance in response to different stimuli acts at multiple levels including receptors expression, signal transduction and gene expression.</p><p>When using different TLR-ligands cross-tolerance can be observed and this has been shown by several groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The study by Sato has clearly shown that cross-tolerance will occur when signalling pathways converge. Hence, TLR2 and TLR4 ligands induce cross-tolerance with respect to TNF via the shared MyD88 pathway and TLR3 and TLR4 ligands do so with respect to IP-10 via the shared TRIF pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. With respect to dendritic cells a similar scenario can be expected but further studies are needed to address this point.</p><p>IRAK-4 is another crucial kinase and adaptor, which interacts with the TLR receptor complex and mediates activation of IRAK-1 and NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Defects of IRAK-4 can lead to immunodeficiency with decreased cytokine production leading to increased susceptibility to infection with pyogenic bacteria, like staphylococci and streptococci during childhood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. We therefore have asked whether in tolerant DCs, which do not activate NF-&#x003ba;B and fail to produce cyokines, there may be an additional decrease in expression of IRAK-4. Our data show, however, that this protein is not altered in tolerant DC (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>).</p><p>In human macrophages induction of LPS tolerance has been shown to lead to down-regulation of MHC Class II molecules with subsequent reduction of activation of T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In the present study on DCs we could not demonstrate such a decrease, in that na&#x000ef;ve cells showed Class II expression at 91.6 +/- 29.1 channels in flow cytometry and LPS tolerant cells were at 83.8 +/- 25.6 channels. Similarly there was no change in expression of MHC Class I in Pam<sub>3</sub>Cys tolerant cells (data not shown). These data suggest that with respect to MHC expression mechanisms of TLR-mediated tolerance are different between macrophages and DCs. We do not know at this stage, whether the tolerant DCs generated in this study will show a reduced activation of antigen specific T cells. We assume, however, that given the almost complete down-regulation of the crucial cytokines TNF and IL-12 tolerance in DCs will lead to inferior activation of TH1 lymphocytes and lower expression of IFN&#x003b3; by these cells. Such tolerant cells may preferentially activate TH2 cells and non-polarized T cells as described by Langenkamp et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>In this study we have focused on the expression of the TNF gene but we could also demonstrate blockade of IL-12 gene expression in tolerant DCs. Since IL-12 is also governed by NF-&#x003ba;B transcription factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] it is conceivable the molecular mechanism of ablation of IRAK-1 is responsible for the blockade of IL-12, as well.</p><p>In the present report we have induced tolerance in mature CD83+ dendritic cells, while others have looked at immature cells treated with LPS or TNF plus IL-1beta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. When looking at immature cells the analysis is complicated by the problem that treatment with a given stimulus will induce two processes, i.e. maturation and tolerance, such that it is difficult to define whether down-regulation of a given gene is due to maturation or to tolerance.</p><p>We have induced maturation with PGE<sub>2</sub>, which is used for DC generation in many clinical trials and we have found PGE<sub>2 </sub>induced cells to be highly informative for the study of tolerance. While Kalinski et al have reported that such cells show no IL-12 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] we found a robust expression of IL-12 mRNA. This difference may be explained by the fact that Kalinski et al added PGE<sub>2 </sub>from the start of culture, while we have added this compound only for the final 2 of the 7 days of culture.</p><p>For the purpose of this study we have not used maturation with LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], TNF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] or a combination of TNF and IL-1&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], since maturation with all of these stimuli may induce a state of tolerance, such that we cannot study the mechanisms of tolerance in response to LPS anymore.</p><p>In addition to tolerance via TLR-ligands the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF has also been shown to induce tolerance in monocytic cells and here a mechanism of c/EBP interference with NF-&#x003ba;B phosphorylation was demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. The dose of LPS used for pre-culture in the present study (5 ng/ml) will induce TNF and this TNF could contribute to tolerance via the c/EBP mediated interference with NF-&#x003ba;B. Such an additional mechanism may come into play in settings where the depletion of IRAK-1 is incomplete.</p><p>While the present work has been done on in-vitro generated human DCs it remains to be shown whether similar mechanisms will operate in primary DCs isolated from tissue. Such tolerance of primary dendritic cells after TLR- ligation in settings of infection will likely contribute to a reduced immune response, which may be detrimental but could also be beneficial in that an over-reaction of the immune system is avoided.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study provides the first data on molecular mechanisms on tolerance in DCs. We show that TLR-ligands can render DCs tolerant with respect to TNF gene expression by a mechanism that likely involves blockade of signal transduction at the level of IRAK-1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Culture medium</title><p>Culture medium was RPMI 1640 plus non-essential amino acids, L-glutamine, Penicillin, Streptomycin, oxalacetate, pyruvate and insulin <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.monocytes.de"/>.
