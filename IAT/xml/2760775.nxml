The relationship betweena gain in <italic>reg4</italic> gene copy number and cancer development was investigated on the human pancreatic cancer cell line Mia-PaCa2 xenografted under the skin of nude mice. When cells were transfected with a vector allowing reg4 expression, they generated tumors almost twice larger in size. In addition, these tumors were more resistant to gemcitabine treatment than control tumors. Interestingly, weekly intraperitoneal administration of a monoclonal antibody to reg4 halved the size of tumors generated by Mia-PaCa2 cells, suggesting that the antibody interfered with a paracrine/autocrine mechanism involving reg4 and stimulating cancer progression. The addition of gemcitabine resulted in further reduction, tumors becoming 5 times smaller than control. Exposure to reg4 antibody resulted in a significant decrease in intra-tumor levels of pAkt, Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, survivin and cyclin D1.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>It was concluded that adjuvant therapies targeting reg4 could improve the standard treatment of pancreatic cancer with gemcitabine.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pancreatic cancer represents 2&#x00025; of all new cases of cancer but leads to 5&#x00025; of all cancer deaths, with a five year survival rate of only 4&#x00025; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007495-Jemal1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

In addition, it can be inherited as part of a multi-cancer syndrome but the vast majority of pancreatic cancers are sporadic.

The early amplification of its gene in pancreatic cancer described in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007495-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007495-g002">2</xref>) and its oncogenic activity reported in the literature prompted us to further study the role of REG4 in pancreatic tumorigenicity and in resistance of pancreatic cancer to gemcitabine treatment. The first observation was that pancreatic cancer-derived cells overexpressing REG4 protein grew more rapidly and were more resistant to gemcitabine treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007495-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The second, more important observation was that, in a xenograft model, tumors induced with Mia-PaCa2 cells expressing reg4 grew more rapidly than control tumors, obtained with native Mia-PaCa2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007495-g005">Figure 5</xref>). In addition, we found that the tumors induced by Mia-PaCa2 cells expressing reg4 were more resistant to gemcitabine treatment than control tumors, in agreement with <italic>in vitro</italic> data and previous reports suggesting the involvement of REG4 in cell resistance to anticancer drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007495-Violette1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007495-Mitani1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> and response to chemoradiotherapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007495-Eguchi1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. The third, very exciting result was obtained when mice with Mia-PaCa2-induced tumors were treated with systemic administration of a specific anti-reg4 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007495-g006">Figure 6</xref>). We observed an important reduction in tumor size and an increased sensitivity to gemcitabine treatment in mice given once a week anti-reg4 antibody. Because the limited efficiency of pancreatic cancer treatment with gemcitabine might be due to the presence of stroma in tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007495-Olive1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, we looked whether reg4 overexpression influenced the extent of stroma formation in subcutaneously xenografted Mia-PaCa2 cells. Semiquantitative analysis revealed no significant difference between tumors overexpressing or not REG4, or treated with REG4 antibody, all of them showing very limited stroma (data not shown). However, our results could be explained, at least in part, by the fact that levels of the antiapoptotic-associated proteins such as activated AKT, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and surviving, as well as the cell cycle-associated protein cyclin D1, were strongly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007495-g007">Figure 7</xref>) indicating that apoptosis and cell cycle are regulated by reg4. Because antibodies are not supposed to penetrate tumor cells in large amounts, an autocrine or paracrine effect must be considered. Upon secretion by tumor cells, reg4 would activate, probably through specific receptors, intracellular pathways that favor cancer progression. These data are in agreement with results found in colon and gastric cancer cells <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007495-Bishnupuri1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007495-Kuniyasu1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Altogether, these results suggest that overexpression of the REG4 protein, induced by its early gain in gene copy number, plays a major role in pancreatic tumor development and resistance to anticancer drugs. Targeting circulating REG4 protein appears as a promising adjuvant to current therapies of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, based on gemcitabine administration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Study of the <italic>reg4</italic> gene copy number in pancreatic cancer</title><p>Fourteen consecutive pancreatic cancer samples were obtained by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided fine needle aspiration cytology between June 2007 and September 2007 at the Hospital Nord, Marseille. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Six samples were obtained from patients without detectable metastasis whereas 8 presented with metastases at the time of the punction. DNA was extracted, amplified and hybridized on Affymetrix Genome-Wide human SNP array 6.0 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Affymetrix Inc.). The Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 features more than 1.8 million markers of genetic variation, including more than 906,600 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and more than 946,000 probes for the detection of copy number variation. The median inter-marker distance taken over all 1.8 million SNP and copy number markers combined is 696 bases. The array also contains 202,000 probes targeting 5,677 known regions of copy number variation, resolve into 3,182 distinct, non-overlapping segments, from the Toronto Database of Genomic Variants. Hybridization, washing, staining, and chip scanning were performed by the CRCHUL microarray Core Facility using materials and methods provided by the manufacturer (Affymetrix Inc.).</p><p>Overall hybridization quality was estimated by the call rate index obtained from GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE, birdseed algorithm using default parameter settings). Allelic ratios were calculated with the Partek Genomics Suite, version 6.4 (Partek Inc., St. Louis, MO) using the proprietary default parameters. A 270 HapMap samples was used to create copy number from baseline. Genomic segmentation was utilized as a method to detect copy number alterations. Regions were detected using the following segmentation parameters: minimum of 10 genomic markers; segmentation p-value threshold lower than 0.001; and a signal to noise equal to 0.3. Using these parameters, 10263 segments were detected.
