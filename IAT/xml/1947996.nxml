In humans relaxin can also activate, but with lower affinity, the closely related receptor for the insulin-like peptide from Leydig cells, RXFP2, previously known as LGR8. The lack of relaxin impairs male fertility but the precise distribution and the function of relaxin receptors in the male reproductive tract is not known. We investigated the distribution of Rxfp1 and Rxfp2 in the reproductive tract of the male rat and the function of relaxin in the vas deferens, a tissue with high expression of both receptors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The presence of mRNA for Rxfp1 and Rxfp2 was investigated in testes, cultured Sertoli cells, epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicle, prostate, and spermatozoa by RT-PCR and Southern blot. Protein expression in the testis, vas deferens, primary culture of Sertoli cells, and spermatozoa was assessed by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. The role of relaxin in the vas deferens was evaluated by contractility studies and radioimmunoassay of cAMP production. The effect of relaxin on mRNA levels for metalloproteinase-7 was measured by Northern blot.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Transcripts for Rxfp1 and Rxfp2 were present in almost all parts of the male reproductive tract, with high levels in testis and vas deferens. Both receptors were immunolocalized in late stage germ cells but not in mature spermatozoa, although mRNAs for both receptors were also present in mature spermatozoa. Rxfp1 but not Rxfp2 was detected in cultured Sertoli cells. Strong immunostaining for Rxfp1 and Rxfp2 was seen in muscular and epithelial layers of the vas deferens and in arteriolar walls. Relaxin did not affect contractility and cyclic AMP production of the vas deferens, but increased the levels of mRNA for metalloproteinase-7.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Rxfp1 and Rxfp2 are widely and similarly distributed throughout the male reproductive tract. Our results suggest that Rxfp1 on spermatids and Sertoli cells may be important in spermatogenesis. Relaxin in the vas deferens does not affect contractility, but may affect vascular compliance and collagen and matrix remodeling.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Relaxin belongs to a superfamily of hormones structurally related to insulin that includes, among others, the relaxins 1, 2 and 3 and the insulin-like peptide from Leydig cells (INSL3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Humans have three forms of relaxin (H1, H2 and H3), encoded by three different genes, but other mammals like rat, mouse and pig seem to have only two forms of relaxin (relaxins 1 and 3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The recent discovery that relaxin can bind to and activate the G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) LGR7 and LGR8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] was a major breakthrough in the field. Recently the IUPHAR commitee renamed these receptors to RXFP1 and RXFP2 respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The human relaxins H1 and H2 and porcine relaxin 1 strongly bind to and activate both RXFP1 and RXFP2 with almost the same affinity, but the rat relaxin 1 binds only weakly to Rxfp2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Relaxin H3 is a selective ligand for RXFP1 but is also able to bind to GPCR135 (RXFP3) and GPCR142 (RXFP4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Insl3 is a selective ligand for Rxfp2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Relaxin is well known for its relaxing effect on the pubic ligament before parturition, but many other actions have been discovered for this hormone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The physiological role of relaxin in the male is not so well defined. In humans and many other mammals, relaxin is produced by the prostate and released almost exclusively in the seminal fluid. The mRNA for RXFP1 and RXFP2 has been detected in testis and in prostate, and the mRNA for RXFP2 has also been detected in gubernaculum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. A detailed study of the expression of Rxfp2 in the testis identified the mRNA in Leydig and germ cells of the rat and the protein in human Leydig and germ cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. RXFP2 was also present in the human epididymis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>With the recent availability of knockout animals for relaxin or its receptors it has been possible to establish the physiological importance of this hormone. Relaxin has an antifibrotic effect in several tissues, and the relaxin knockout mouse is a model of fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Relaxin interferes with collagen metabolism and increases the expression and activity of metalloproteinases (MMPs) in uterine, cardiac, vascular and renal tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In the reproductive tract of female mice, the disruption of the relaxin or the <italic>Rxfp1 </italic>gene causes the same abnormalities: an absence of the relaxation and elongation of the interpubic ligament and impaired nipple development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In male mice the disruption of the relaxin gene causes a delayed development of the reproductive tract, with an arrest of the sperm maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], but disruption of <italic>Rxfp1 </italic>does not always cause the same abnormalities. Kamat et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] did not find abnormalities in the testes and prostate of <italic>Rxfp1 </italic>knockout mice. Krajnc-Franken et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], using a different strain of knockout mice, observed impaired spermatogenesis, leading to azoospermia and reduced fertility in animals from the first generations but the following generations or older animals had normal fertility.</p><p>The interaction of Insl3 with Rxfp2 controls the differentiation of gubernaculum, the caudal genitoinguinal ligament critical for testicular descent, and deletion of <italic>Insl3 </italic>or <italic>Rxfp2 </italic>causes cryptorchidism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Transgenic overexpression of relaxin did not prevent cryptorchidism in <italic>Insl3</italic>-knockout animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Therefore it seems that relaxin does not physiologically activate RXFP2, although both RXFP1 and RXFP2 can bind relaxin in vitro. Nevertheless, it is possible that binding of relaxin to RXFP2 contributes to some of the actions of relaxin in some species.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to map the expression of Rxfp1 and Rxfp2 in the reproductive tract of the male rat. The presence of messenger RNA was investigated in testis, primary culture of Sertoli cells, epididymis (caput and cauda), vas deferens, seminal vesicle, prostate, and spermatozoa by RT-PCR and Southern blot. The localization of both receptors was investigated by immunostaining in the vas deferens, testis, primary culture of Sertoli cells, and spermatozoa. The functional role of relaxin was investigated in the vas deferens by assessing the ability of the hormone to affect contractility, cyclic AMP production, and the transcription of metalloproteinase-7 (Mmp-7), a member of the stromelysin subfamily of MMPs preferentially expressed in epithelial cells of the reproductive tract and present in human semen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals and biological samples</title><p>Male Wistar rats were housed in the Animal Facility at the Instituto Nacional de Farmacologia, UNIFESP-EPM, and maintained on a 12 h light, 12 h dark lighting schedule, at 23&#x000b0;C, with food and water available <italic>ad libitum</italic>.

To validate a semiquantitative analysis of the results, we determined the linear range for the PCRs, measuring the amount of product in function of the number of thermal cycles. To amplify the transcript from a transmembrane region of Rxfp1 (exon 14 to exon 16) the following thermal cycles were used: 1 denaturing cycle at 94&#x000b0;C for 5 min; 25 to 45 cycles at 94&#x000b0;C for 1 min, 46&#x000b0;C for 1 min and 72&#x000b0;C for 2 min, with a final extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 7 min. To amplify the transcript from aminoterminal to transmembrane region (exons 4 to 16) of Rxfp1 the following thermal cycles were used: 1 denaturing cycle at 94&#x000b0;C for 5 min; 35&#x02013;55 cycles at 94&#x000b0;C for 1 min, 55&#x000b0;C for 1 min and 72&#x000b0;C for 2 min, with a final extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 7 min.

The PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel. The gel was denatured and neutralized and the nucleic acid bands were transferred by capilarity to a nylon membrane (Zeta Probe GT, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Membranes were cross-linked with UV light and prehybridized for 3 h at 65&#x000b0;C in 6 &#x000d7; SSC (standard saline citrate) containing 5 &#x000d7; Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 100 &#x003bc;g/mL sheared denatured salmon sperm DNA.

These two receptors interact with members of the superfamily of insulin-related hormones, relaxin and Insl3. In human males, relaxin is produced mainly in the prostate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] and released primarily if not exclusively into the seminal fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], where its concentration ranges 1 to 73 ng/mL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. On the other hand, in males INSL3 is a major secretory product of the testicular Leydig cels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] and is now recognized as a major circulating hormone. In several species, relaxin can activate both Rxfp1 and Rxfp2, and it is still unknown whether the concomitant presence of both receptors may contribute to the final response to relaxin.</p><p>Our data show that mRNA for Rxfp1 is present in all tested tissues. High levels were found in the testis and vas deferens, and lower levels in the prostate, Sertoli cells, caput and cauda epididymis, seminal vesicle, and spermatozoa. Immunohistochemistry of the testis showed that Rxfp1 protein is especially abundant in late stage germ cells (elongate spermatids). The location of these receptors on late stage germ cells and on Sertoli cells suggests a role in spermatogenesis. However, while disruption of the relaxin gene is known to cause an arrest in sperm maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], disruption of the <italic>Rxfp1 </italic>gene does not have the same effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Immunohistochemistry of the vas deferens showed receptors in longitudinal and circular muscle layers, in the epithelial layer, and in arterioles. It has previously been shown by immunohistochemistry that relaxin is present in the vas deferens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. This relatively neglected part of the male reproductive tract has a complex epithelium with absorptive and secretory functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Our results suggest that muscular Rxfp1 receptors may be important in the organization of the extracellular matrix, but they do not seem to be involved in acute modulation of contractility. Whether Rxfp1 receptors on the epithelium are involved in regulation of secretion is not yet clear. The presence of Rxfp1 in arterioles suggests that relaxin may regulate local vascular resistance. Both relaxin and Rxfp1 were previously detected in the thoracic aorta and in small renal and mesenteric arteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], suggesting a more general role of the relaxin-Rxfp1 receptor system in the regulation of local arterial function.</p><p>Although Rxfp1 mRNA was present in mature spermatozoa, the levels were low, and Rxfp1 protein was undetectable. Nevertheless, the presence of Rxfp1 receptor on spermatozoa would help explain many studies that suggest that relaxin stimulates sperm motility. For example, antiserum against relaxin reduces sperm motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], relaxin stimulates sperm motility and attenuates the decline in the percentage of motile spermatozoa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], helps restore decreased sperm motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], and improves penetration of spermatozoa into cervical mucus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Finally, Carrell et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] demonstrated that recombinant relaxin binds to sperm with high affinity. In contrast, Jockenhovel et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] and Newinger et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] failed to find an effect of relaxin on sperm function. In conclusion, it is not yet clear if spermatozoa contain functional relaxin binding sites, and if they do, whether they are alternative binding sites.</p><p>The distribution of Rxfp2 in the testis and epididymis was recently analyzed by Anand-Ivell et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Their finding of high Rxfp2 levels in late stage germ cells, the presence of RXFP2 in the epididymis, and the absence of Rxfp2 in Sertoli cells is firmly supported by our results. In addition, we found high levels of Rxfp2 in the vas deferens. Rxfp2 transcripts were also present in the seminal vesicle. The absence of Rxfp2 transcripts in the prostate of the rat contrasts with a study by Klonisch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] that reported RXFP2 transcripts in epithelial cells of the human prostate.</p><p>Our results also show that the distribution of Rxfp1 and Rxfp2 is similar in many tissues and both receptors are expressed in late-stage germ cells.

However, it seems that Rxfp2 is not essential for spermatogenesis, because if the cryptorchidism that results from the lack of Rxfp2 is surgically corrected at birth, sperm maturation appears normal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Although Rxfp1 receptors were found in the muscular layer of the vas deferens, and although relaxin is known to reduce uterine tone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>], our results clearly suggest that relaxin is not involved in modulation of contractility in the vas deferens. Relaxin did not affect spontaneous contractions of the rat vas deferens, did not relax the depolarized contracted organ, and did not affect the contractile response to noradrenaline, but all these responses were blocked in control experiments with drugs that affect cyclic AMP levels such as forskolin or IBMX.</p><p>Relaxin can increase cyclic AMP after interacting with recombinant RXFP1 and RXFP2 in heterologous systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>].

However, our data clearly indicate that relaxin does not stimulate the production of cAMP in the vas deferens. This result is in accordance with previous observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. In rat atria and in fibroblasts from the human lower uterine segment, relaxin also produced little or no cyclic AMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. It remains to be determined whether other signaling pathways such as the tyrosine kinase signaling pathway mediate relaxin actions in the vas deferens.</p><p>It should be pointed out that activation of RXFP2 by INSL3 reduces cyclic AMP in testicular germ cells and oocytes, and this effect is prevented by treatment with pertussis toxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Stimulation of the recombinant RXFP2 receptor with INSL3 resulted in a delayed phase coupled to G<sub>0B </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Therefore we speculate that the joint presence of both Rxfp1 and Rxfp2 in the same tissue can result in a more complex regulation of the cyclic AMP pathway. An additional complication is the presence of RXFP1 splice variants, which are found in man [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>], rats, and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The absence of exon 4 leads to the production of a truncated RXFP1 receptor that can act as an inhibitor of RXFP1 signaling. The Rxfp1 transcripts detected in the present study in the testis and the vas deferens however did contain exon 4. Splice variants for RXFP2 have also been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. In the rat, the Rxfp2 transcripts found so far in the testis, germ cells and epididymis encoded the full-length receptor, but the gubernaculum produces a Rxfp2 product that lacks exon 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Relaxin is well known for its antifibrotic action and for its stimulation of the expression and activity of metalloproteinases.

Relaxin has also been shown to enhance in-vitro invasiveness of breast cancer cells, where it increases the production of several metalloproteinases, including MMP-7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. In turn MMP-7 activates MMP-1, -2 -8 and -9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The majority of the metalloproteinases are produced by mesenchymal cells in the stroma, whereas MMP-7 expression is restricted to epithelium, particularly glandular epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Messenger RNA for MMP-7 has been found in epithelial cells lining the efferent duct and in prostatic epithelial cells in mouse and human, and MMP-7 activity has also been detected in human semen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. This expression pattern of MMP-7 almost exclusively to reproductive tissues suggests a role in the reproductive function. We here show that MMP-7 mRNA is also present in the vas deferens and is increased by relaxin, suggesting a role for relaxin with regulation of extracellular matrix components, including other MMPs activation, collagen remodeling and apoptosis, as already shown in other tissues. A significant increase in the collagen expression in the prostate and testis of relaxin knockout mice has been documented before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study we detected by RT-PCR and Southern blot the presence of transcripts for the GPCRs Rxfp1 and Rxfp2, both of which are present throughout the male reproductive tract. Rxfp1 on spermatids and Sertoli cells may be important in spermatogenesis. Relaxin in the vas deferens is not involved with contractility, but is probably involved with vascular compliance and collagen and matrix remodeling and/or apoptosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MF and LCC contributed equaly for this paper: MF carried out the RT-PCR, Southern blot and immunohistochemistry studies; LCC participated in the RT-PCR and Southern blot studies and carried out the functional assays (cyclic AMP and contractility) and the Northern blot analysis.
