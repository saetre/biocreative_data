Unfortunately, cDNA libraries constructed according to conventional methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] contain a high percentage of 5' truncated clones due to the premature stop of reverse transcription (RT) of the template mRNA. This is especially true for large mRNAs and those tending to form secondary structures. In addition, there is a size bias against large fragments inherent in the cloning procedure. For these reasons, large full-length cDNAs are strongly underrepresented in conventional libraries. Several methods have been developed to construct cDNA libraries that are enriched for full-length cDNAs. Most are based on either RNA oligo ligation to the 5' end of mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], 5' cap affinity selection via eukaryotic initiation factor 4E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], or 5' cap biotinylation followed by biotin affinity selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Common to these methods is that they are laborious and contain several enzymatic steps that must be performed on mRNA. Therefore, they are sensitive to quality loss through RNA degradation. Furthermore, they require high amounts of starting mRNA (5&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;g depending on method).</p><p>In contrast, using SMART technology for full-length enrichment of cDNA is very straightforward and robust and requires only 0,025&#x02013;1 &#x003bc;g of starting mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This technology utilizes the property of some MMLV reverse transcriptases to add a few C residues at the 3' end of the first strand cDNA when they reach the end of the mRNA template, but not at prematurely terminated reverse transcripts. An RNA oligo ending in three G residues and present in the reaction, forms base pairings with the added Cs and serves as a prolonged template for reverse transcription. By these means, full-length cDNAs but not prematurely terminated ones are 5'-tagged and can be amplified by an RNA oligo-specific primer (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, step 1 and 2). The percentage of full-length clones in libraries constructed with the SMART technique is much higher compared to conventional libraries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and, when transcripts up to 3 kb are compared, better than libraries constructed with other full-length enriching techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, large clones are rarely found in SMART libraries as well as in libraries constructed according to the other full-length enriching techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], unless specialized lambda vectors are used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. We modified the proven and robust SMART technique to construct cDNA libraries with large average insert sizes in convenient plasmid vectors. We here report the construction of size fraction sub-libraries enriched for full-length clones having an average insert size of up to 7 kb and the analysis of full-length percentage for these libraries.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Library construction process </bold>Schematic representation of the library construction process.

There is no need for any mRNA manipulative step prior to the reaction and the only difference is the presence of the SMART RNA oligo in the reaction (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, step 1 and 2). Synthesis must be done with a MMLV RTase that is RNaseH negative to ensure addition of C residues, and to prevent SMART RNA oligo degradation during base pairing with these residues. The full-length selective step is the PCR amplification following cDNA synthesis, therefore, there is a bias against large cDNAs, as smaller cDNAs are preferentially amplified during PCR (personal observation). In our strategy, cDNA is size-fractionated prior to this PCR amplification step and PCR is performed with the different size fractions in separate reactions (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, step 3 and 4). Because large cDNAs are less frequent, more PCR cycles must be done on the large fractions compared to smaller fractions to obtain an equivalent amount of PCR product for cloning. But, to avoid increasing redundancy and to reduce errors introduced by PCR polymerase, as few PCR cycles as possible must be performed. We typically did 12 to 16 cycles, depending on size fraction. By these means, large cDNAs could be amplified as efficiently as smaller ones. These large cDNAs are strongly underrepresented in control amplification products of unfractionated cDNA (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, panel A).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Quality control of cDNA and sub-libraries </bold>Panel A: Amplified cDNA size fractions. cDNA was size-fractionated and separate size fractions (1&#x02013;4) were PCR-amplified.

Therefore, it is crucial to perform as few PCR cycles as possible, as each duplication increases the number of introduced errors by a factor of two, assuming a constant error rate of the used polymerase. The Expand&#x02122; PCR System we used was tested to have an error rate of 8,5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-6 </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Starting with PolyA+ RNA, we could restrict the number of cycles to 12 to 16. Levesque et al., who also combined SMART cDNA amplification with size fractionation, startet with total RNA and did 45 to 47 cycles in total. In contrast to our approach, where amplification follows size fractionation, they did 33 cycles before and 12&#x02013;14 after fractionation. In their study, the obtained sub-libraries were not analysed for insert size range, instead, they screened them with three gene-specific probes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Insert size of libraries</title><p>In conventionally-constructed libraries, large insert clones are rarely found. This is because very long transcripts often get truncated during cDNA synthesis, and because there is a strong size bias against large fragments inherent in the cloning procedure, i.e. ligation and bacterial transformation. In our strategy, PCR-amplified cDNA size fractions are restriction digested and separately cloned into a plasmid vector to obtain size fraction sub-libraries. To analyse the range of insert sizes within these sub-libraries, clone pools of 5000&#x02013;10,000 clones were grown in semi-solid agar and plasmid restriction digests of the clone pools were performed. Each sub-library almost exclusively contains inserts within the size range of the corresponding cDNA size fraction that was cloned to produce this sub-library (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, panels A and B). In sub-library 1 for example, most inserts are between 6 and 8 kb. Such inserts are rarely found in conventional libraries.</p></sec><sec><title>Full-length content</title><p>The full-length enriched cDNA sub-libraries generated according to the protocol described here serve as clone resource for the cDNA sequencing efforts of the German cDNA Consortium <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dkfz-heidelberg.de/mga/groups.asp?siteID=48"/>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Within this project, over 100,000 5'ESTs have been generated. All sequences are submitted to public databases and clones are available through the German Resource Center for Genome Research <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rzpd.de"/>. To determine the full-length cDNA content of our libraries, 5'ESTs were blasted against human RefSeq sequences according to parameters specified in the Methods section. The total number of hits to known mRNAs were set as 100% and the percentage of clones containing the 5' end of the hit was calculated. Accordingly, full-ORF content was determined by BLAST analysis against the SWISSPROT database.</p><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> shows full-cDNA and full-ORF percentages of three size fraction sub-libraries made from an endometrium carcinoma cell line. With 3827 5'ESTs blasted in total for these three sub-libraries, 1439 hits to known mRNAs were found in human RefSeq and 513 hits to known proteins were found in SWISSPROT. For calculation of full-cDNA/full-ORF percentage, only hits within the corresponding size range of the sub-library were taken into consideration. Full-length percentages range from 46% to 59%, and full-ORF percentages from 63% to 76%, depending on sub-library. Full-length content does not decrease significantly with increasing cDNA/ORF size, as it is observed in conventional cDNA libraries. In the sub-library containing 4&#x02013;10 kb inserts, the percentage of full-coding clones is still almost 70%, which is extremely high for this size range (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Completeness of cDNA and coding region in different size fraction sub-libraries of a cDNA library </bold>Sequences from an endometrium carcinoma cell line library were analysed. Completeness of cDNA/ORF was calculated by BLAST analysis against human RefSeq ("full-length") / SWISSPROT ("full-ORF") database, respectively, with parameters specified in the Methods section. 3827 5'ESTs were blasted, 1439 hits were found in human RefSeq, and 513 hits in SWISSPROT. Percentages of full-length/full-ORF hits were calculated.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-5-36-3"/></fig><p>Unlike other full-length enriching protocols, there is no negative selection against truncated mRNA molecules in the SMART technique, because the basic principle is selection for full-reverse transcribed mRNA molecules rather than mRNA cap selection. Therefore, mRNA quality is crucial. The starting mRNA of the library, which full-length analysis is shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, was of highest quality, i.e. in a control agarose gel mRNA smeard up to 10 kb. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> shows the analysis of sequence data from over ten different libraries made from mRNAs of various qualities. With 50,023 5'ESTs blasted in total, 12,208 hits to known proteins were found in the SWISSPROT database. Size windows shown correspond to the size of the SWISSPROT hits. For better orientation, the calculated corresponding mRNA/cDNA size is also shown. Here, full-ORF content decreases with increasing mRNA size, as can be expected due to the fact that for large transcripts there is a higher probability of truncated molecules in the starting mRNA. For transcripts up to 3 kb 60&#x02013;70% contain the complete ORF. This number gradually decreases to 30% for 5&#x02013;6 kb and 20% for 7 kb. Although these numbers are still reasonably high bearing transcript size in mind, they are lower than in the library shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. Probably, this is due to lower quality of starting mRNAs.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Completeness of coding region in different size ranges </bold>Completeness of ORF was calculated by BLAST against the SWISSPROT database, with parameters specified in the Methods section.

In both studies, the sub-libraries were not analysed for insert sizes. In consequence, it remains unclear, if the sub-libraries actually contained the expected range of insert sizes. Levesque et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] also combined the SMART technique with cDNA size fractionation, but did not analyse the overall full-length content, instead, they screened the libraries with three gene-specific probes. Draper et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] calculated the percentage of full-coding clones in size fractionated libraries from BLAST results of 78 hits in total and down to 3 hits per size range. We calculated the percentage of full-coding clones in the libraries generated according to the presented method from BLAST results of over 12,000 hits in total and between 99 and 3363 hits per size range. The high number of hits for a given size range permit a much more reliable calculation of full-length percentages compared to former studies. Furthermore, because of the large insert size of our sub-libraries, large size ranges can be analysed (up to 10 kb), which had not been analysed before in similar studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The method presented is attractive for the construction of full-length enriched cDNA libraries with large average insert sizes for several reasons. First, there is no additional enzymatic step for the enrichment, which saves time. Second, it is easy-to-use, as enzymatic steps performed on mRNA, which are necessary in other full-length enriching techniques, are extremely critical in terms of mRNA degradation and quantity loss. Third, the cDNA sizing protocol presented is very efficient and can be performed with basic laboratory equipment. cDNA libraries constructed according to the method presented also yield high full-length percentages for large cDNAs/ORFs when high quality starting mRNA is used.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>cDNA synthesis</title><p>First strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 &#x003bc;g of mRNA with the "SMART cDNA Library Construction Kit" (Clontech) in a 10 &#x003bc;l reaction according to the manufacturers protocol. In this reaction, a fraction of full-transcribed first strand cDNA molecules but not truncated cDNAs is tagged with a short sequence complementary to the SMART oligo.

After first strand synthesis, 40 pmol of 5' PCR primer (corresponding to the SMART oligo sequence) was added and first strand cDNA was denatured for 5 min at 95&#x000b0;C. The reaction was cooled to 60&#x000b0;C and second strand reaction mix was added to give a final concentration of 1x PCR reaction buffer (Expand 20 kb<sup>PLUS </sup>PCR System, Roche), 0.5 mM dNTPs, and 8.3 U/&#x003bc;l Expand 20 kb<sup>PLUS </sup>enzyme mix (Roche) in a volume of 60 &#x003bc;l.
