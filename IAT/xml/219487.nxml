As a genetic approach to examine Scp160p function, we applied an ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) screen for loci synthetically lethal with <italic>scp160</italic> loss, and identified a single candidate gene, <italic>EAP1</italic>, whose protein product functions in translation as an eIF4E-binding protein, with additional uncharacterized spindle pole body functions. To reconfirm <italic>scp160</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>eap1</italic> synthetic lethality, we constructed a strain null for both genes, supported by an <italic>SCP160</italic> maintenance plasmid. We used this strain to establish a quantitative assay for both Scp160p and Eap1p functions <italic>in vivo</italic>, and applied this assay to demonstrate that Y109A <italic>EAP1</italic>, a previously described allele of <italic>EAP1</italic> that cannot bind eIF4E, is markedly impaired with regard to its <italic>SCP160</italic>-related activity. In addition, we explored the possibility of physical interaction between Eap1p and Scp160p, and discovered that Eap1p associates with Scp160p-containing complexes in an RNA-dependent manner. Finally, we probed the impact of <italic>EAP1</italic> loss on Scp160p, and vice versa, and found that loss of each gene resulted in a significant change in either the complex associations or subcellular distribution of the other protein. These results clearly support the hypothesis that Scp160p plays a role in translation, demonstrate that the interaction of <italic>SCP160</italic> and <italic>EAP1</italic> is biologically significant, and provide important tools for future studies of the <italic>in vivo</italic> functions of both genes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The gene <italic>SCP160</italic> encodes a 160 kDa protein in yeast originally hypothesized to function in the maintenance of ploidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c1">1</xref>), due in part to its null phenotype, which includes abnormal cell size and shape, increased DNA content and missegregation of genetic markers through meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c1">1</xref>). A number of more recent biochemical studies have demonstrated the encoded gene product, Scp160p, to be an RNA-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c2">2</xref>) that associates <italic>in vivo</italic> with a specific subset of mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c3">3</xref>) as a component of both soluble and membrane-associated mRNPs and polyribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c6">6</xref>). Target messages specifically associated with Scp160p include <italic>DHH1</italic>, an RNA helicase that functions in mRNA decapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c7">7</xref>), <italic>BIK1</italic>, a component of the kinetochore&#x02013;microtubule binding interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c8">8</xref>), and <italic>NAM8</italic>, an RNA-binding protein required for the meiosis-specific splicing of <italic>MER2</italic> and <italic>MER3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c9">9</xref>). Subcellular localization studies, using both indirect immunofluorescence and green fluorescent protein-tagged alleles, have demonstrated that the majority of Scp160p is cytoplasmic, with significant enrichment around the nuclear envelope and rough endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c6">6</xref>), consistent with the distribution of polyribosomes in yeast. Combined, these data implicate Scp160p for a role in cytoplasmic mRNA metabolism, potentially including translation, although the precise biological role of Scp160p remains unknown.</p><p>Biochemical studies of Scp160p-containing mRNP complexes, which migrate by native size exclusion chromatography at &#x0003e;1300 kDa, have revealed the presence of a large number of other proteins, including Pab1p and Bfr1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c5">5</xref>). The identities of most of the other proteins in these complexes remain unknown. Similarly, little is currently known about the structure of Scp160p, although amino acid sequence homology studies have demonstrated the presence of 14 copies of the hnRNP K homology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c10">10</xref>), or KH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c11">11</xref>). Indeed, Scp160p bears greatest similarity to a large family of multiple KH domain proteins collectively known as vigilins. First identified in chicken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c12">12</xref>), vigilin orthologs have now been found in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c13">13</xref>), <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c14">14</xref>), <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c16">16</xref>), <italic>Caenorhabdtis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c2">2</xref>), <italic>Schizo saccharomyces pombe</italic> (GenPept 7493335), <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> (GenPept 7899383) and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c11">11</xref>). Although all vigilin proteins reported to date appear to bind nucleic acid, in most cases both the type of nucleic acid bound and the functional significance of the interaction remain unclear. One notable exception is <italic>Xenopus</italic> vigilin, which was demonstrated not only to bind specifically to a defined sequence in the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region of the vitellogenin message, but also to inhibit cleavage of that sequence by the mRNA endonuclease polysomal ribonuclease 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c17">17</xref>). Whether Scp160p functions in a similar manner with regard to its target messages is a subject of current study.</p><p>As an independent approach to explore the function of Scp160p <italic>in vivo</italic>, we conducted a genetic screen to identify additional loci in the yeast genome that, when mutated, are lethal in combination with <italic>scp160</italic> loss. This approach, termed a synthetic lethal screen, is a powerful tool to help define the function of any given non-essential gene in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c19">19</xref>). The rationale is 2-fold. First, by definition, the loci identified in a synthetic lethal screen interact in some functionally significant way with the gene of interest, albeit not always directly or physically. Often these are either genes of overlapping function, or genes of distinct function that nonetheless contribute to the same pathway or biological process as the gene of interest. Secondly, once a synthetic lethal relationship has been defined between two non-essential genes, strains null for either gene provide a genetic background in which the second gene is rendered essential, offering a powerful tool for further genetic or structure&#x0002f;function studies. We report here the results of an ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) synthetic lethal screen for <italic>SCP160</italic>, from which we identified a single candidate gene: <italic>EAP1</italic>.</p><p><italic>EAP1</italic> is a non-essential gene in yeast whose product, Eap1p, was identified by Cosentino <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c20">20</xref>) as a novel protein that binds directly to eIF4E, the cap-binding subunit of the cap-dependent translation initiation complex, eIF4F. Almost simultaneously, an independent function for Eap1p was discovered by Chial <italic>et al</italic>., who identified <italic>EAP1</italic> in the course of a synthetic lethal screen with <italic>ndc1-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c21">21</xref>), a cold-sensitive allele of the essential <italic>NDC1</italic> gene required for spindle pole body duplication and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c22">22</xref>). The independence of these functions was most clearly demonstrated by studies involving the Y109A allele of <italic>EAP1</italic>, which fully rescued the synthetic lethal phenotype of <italic>ndc1-1</italic>&#x0002f;&#x00394;<italic>eap1</italic> yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c21">21</xref>), despite the fact that this substitution replaces a key residue in the eIF4E-binding domain of Eap1p, thereby precluding its ability to bind eIF4E both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c20">20</xref>).</p><p>The results reported here demonstrate four important points with regard to both <italic>SCP160</italic> and <italic>EAP1</italic>. First, loss of both genes in yeast is a synthetically lethal event, implicating a functional relationship, either direct or indirect, between the two gene products. Considering what is already known about the role of Eap1p in both translation and spindle pole body function, this relationship both supports and extends previous hypotheses concerning the function of Scp160p <italic>in vivo</italic>. Secondly, the Y109A allele of Eap1p, which no longer binds eIF4E, is largely impaired in its ability to complement <italic>scp160&#x0002f;eap1</italic> synthetic lethality. This result clearly supports the hypothesis that Scp160p plays a role in cytoplasmic mRNA metabolism, including translation. Thirdly, Eap1p associates with at least a subset of Scp160p-containing complexes in an RNA-dependent manner, although these data in no way implicate a direct physical interaction between the two proteins. Finally, <italic>eap1</italic> loss results in a subtle but reproducible redistribution of Scp160p from predominantly large to both large and smaller complexes in yeast, while <italic>scp160</italic> loss results in an apparently complete loss of Eap1p from the membrane pellets but not from the soluble portion of fractionated lysates. Together, these data reconfirm the functional significance of the interaction between <italic>SCP160</italic> and <italic>EAP1</italic>, and offer clues to the associations and mechanisms of action for both proteins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids and yeast strains</title><p>All plasmid manipulations were performed according to standard techniques utilizing <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strains XL1-Blue (Strategene, Inc.) and XL10-Gold (Stratagene, Inc.), as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c23">23</xref>).

Due to concerns over potential and progressive aneuploidy in the <italic>scp160</italic>-null strains, these strains were always freshly generated from JFy4100 just prior to use by plasmid curing on medium containing 5-fluoro-orotic acid (5-FOA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c26">26</xref>). Similarly, all haploid strains genomically null for <italic>scp160</italic> were generated by two-step gene replacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c26">26</xref>), with the introduction of an <italic>SCP160</italic> maintenance plasmid into the strain prior to the genomic deletion event.</p></sec><sec><title>An EMS-based synthetic lethal screen using JFy2806 yeast genomically null for <italic>scp160</italic></title><p>The haploid strain JFy2806 (MATa <italic>scp160</italic>&#x00394; <italic>ade2-1 ade3</italic>&#x00394; <italic>his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 ura3-1 trp1-1 can1-100 RAD5&#x0002b;</italic>) was generated from its W303 parent (the generous gift of Dr R.

Deletion of <italic>scp160</italic> was accomplished by standard two-step gene replacement using the Alani&#x02013;Kleckner cassette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c27">27</xref>), with the introduction of an <italic>SCP160</italic> maintenance plasmid following the genomic integration but preceding the genomic deletion event.

For the actual mutagenesis procedure, cells were grown for 48 h in SD-ura medium, to ensure the presence of the <italic>URA3 SCP160</italic> maintenance plasmid (JF3116), at which point 2.5 ml of this culture was spun down, washed twice with 50 mM K<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> pH 7.0, and resuspended in a final volume of 10 ml of 50 mM K<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>. Next, 625 &#x000b5;l of EMS was added, the cells were mixed by vortex agitation, and allowed to incubate for 30 min at 30&#x000b0;C, at which point 300 &#x000b5;l of 10&#x00025; (w&#x0002f;v) sodium thiophosphate was added to deactivate the EMS and stop the mutagenesis. The cells were then spun down, washed twice with sterile water, and counted using a hemocytometer. Four hundred cells were spread onto each of twenty 10 cm YPD plates for a total of 8000 cells. Plates were incubated for &#x0223c;3 days, or until 2&#x02013;3 mm diameter colonies were clearly visible and sectoring status could be easily scored by visual inspection. To intensify the red color, in some experiments the plates were stored at 4&#x000b0;C for 1&#x02013;2 days prior to scoring. From the background of sectoring colonies, solid red colonies were picked and streaked onto fresh YPD. After 12 rounds of screening, as described above, only one mutant, designated 12007, was isolated as reproducibly failing to sector on YPD, yet exhibiting restored sectoring in the presence of an alternative (non-<italic>URA3</italic>) <italic>SCP160</italic> maintenance plasmid (JF2803). Sectoring was not restored to this strain in the presence of the plasmid backbone alone (JF1102). This strain was designated JFy3400, and was backcrossed twice to the parental strain to remove unrelated EMS mutations prior to further analysis. The resulting strain was designated JFy3751.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA sequencing of the <italic>EAP1</italic> genomic locus</title><p>To identify the EMS mutation(s) present in the <italic>EAP1</italic> locus of JFy3751 versus its unmutagenized parent (JFy2806), a 2570 bp fragment including the entire <italic>EAP1</italic> coding sequence was PCR amplified from the genomic DNA of each strain using the primers EAP1F1 (5&#x02032;-gcgcgaattcgacttatcattcactttggtttag-3&#x02032;) and EAP1R1 (5&#x02032;-gcgcgtcgacccagaacaagtggataaactaatcc-3&#x02032;).

Prior to each step involving cell counting, the cultures were treated so as to minimize cell clumping. In brief, cells were placed in a 1.5 ml sterile snap-cap tube and centrifuged at 13 000 r.p.m. for 10 s. The medium was decanted and the cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of sterile water.

This elution pattern for Scp160p is RNA dependent, as has been demonstrated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c5">5</xref>), suggesting that the Scp160p-containing complexes are mRNPs.

These results suggest that in the absence of <italic>eap1</italic>, at least some Scp160p complexes are partially impaired, either in terms of the extent of their assembly or in terms of their stability. No parallel impact of <italic>scp160</italic> loss was evident on Eap1p complexes.</p><p>With regard to polyribosome association, as measured by sucrose gradient subcellular fractionation, we observed that, as previously reported, FLAG-Scp160p co-fractionated predominantly with polyribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c6">6</xref>), while HA-Eap1p co-fractionated predominantly with smaller complexes and perhaps with ribosomal subunits and&#x0002f;or monosomes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg810f5">5</xref>, upper left set of panels). Collapse of the polyribosomes by pre-treatment with RNase (see Materials and Methods) moved the FLAG-Scp160p signal to the top of the gradient (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg810f5">5</xref>, right set of panels), as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c5">5</xref>). RNase pre-treatment had little apparent effect on distribution of the HA-Eap1p signal, which was already concentrated predominantly near the top of the gradient (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg810f5">5</xref>, right set of panels). Loss of <italic>eap1</italic> again appeared partially to impair or destabilize at least a subset of Scp160p complexes, although the majority of Scp160p clearly remained associated with very large complexes consistent with polyribosomes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg810f5">5</xref>, lower left panels). As above, little if any parallel impact of <italic>scp160</italic> loss was evident on the size distribution of the majority of Eap1p complexes, although some subtle changes at both the high and low ends of the gradient were seen (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg810f5">5</xref>, left bottom panel).</p><p>Finally, with regard to the distribution of Scp160p and Eap1p between the soluble and membrane-associated subcellular pools, in yeast expressing wild-type alleles of both genes, both tagged proteins fractionated predominantly although not exclusively with the membrane-associated pool (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg810f6">6</xref>, upper left panels) and, for both proteins, the membrane association was RNase sensitive (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg810f6">6</xref>, right panels).

First, loss of both genes in yeast is a synthetically lethal event. This point is not surprising, considering that both gene products have previously been implicated for roles in some aspect of cytoplasmic mRNA metabolism, although the observation of synthetic lethality serves to strengthen the argument that these roles must overlap in some functionally significant way. Considering that Eap1p is known to serve a general role in translation, competing with eIF4G for binding to eIF4E, and thereby inhibiting cap-dependent translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c20">20</xref>), while Scp160p has been demonstrated to associate with only a small subset of mRNAs in the cytoplasm and on polyribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c3">3</xref>), the mechanism of functional interaction between these two proteins that would lead to their synthetic lethality is not immediately obvious. One possibility stems from the fact that eIF4G is known to bind to the poly(A)-binding protein Pab1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c29">29</xref>), a component of Scp160p-associated complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c4">4</xref>). One could speculate that the lack of both Eap1p and Scp160p in this system may result in some loss of translational regulation, perhaps leading to the abnormal expression of one or more genes, causing lethality to the cell. The observation that Eap1p physically associates with at least a subset of Scp160p-containing complexes further suggests that Eap1p may influence translational initiation of at least some of the mRNAs in these complexes, although other interpretations also remain viable, as will be discussed below. Uncertainties remain concerning the synthesis, folding and stability of the truncated protein. Nonetheless, it is tempting to use the position of the EMS-generated premature stop codon (N397X) reported here as a clue to discerning the nature of the functional interaction between Scp160p and Eap1p. The point of truncation occurs C-terminal to both the eIF4E-binding domain (residues 109&#x02013;115) and the potential bipartite nuclear localization sequence (residues 183&#x02013;197), but N-terminal of a noted Walker A motif (residues 440&#x02013;449) and a series of proline-rich regions (residues 452&#x02013;457, 482&#x02013;485 and 536&#x02013;541) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c20">20</xref>).</p><p>One model that may explain the synthetic lethal relationship between <italic>EAP1</italic> and <italic>SCP160</italic> involves the potentially abnormal expression of target genes normally regulated by Scp160p. If Scp160p acts to mediate the expression of other genes, then the reliance of a &#x00394;<italic>scp160</italic> cell on <italic>EAP1</italic> could also result from the effect of a downstream gene. While there are countless possibilities, one gene stands out as particularly noteworthy: <italic>NDC1</italic>.</p><p>The <italic>ndc1-1</italic> mutant allele is synthetically lethal with <italic>EAP1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c21">21</xref>). Overexpression of wild-type Ndc1p has been demonstrated to cause spindle pole body duplication defects indistinguishable from those observed in <italic>ndc1-1</italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c30">30</xref>). It has been hypothesized that gene products affecting Ndc1p expression levels may, if mutated, cause phenotypes similar to those observed with the <italic>ndc1-1</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c21">21</xref>). Thus, if Scp160p is required to maintain a proper dosage of Ndc1p, then an <italic>SCP160</italic>-null cell could have a phenotype similar to that caused by the <italic>ndc1-1</italic> mutation, and hence require <italic>EAP1</italic> for survival. Indeed, using RT&#x02013;PCR and <italic>NDC1</italic>-specific primers, we have demonstrated that <italic>NDC1</italic> mRNA is significantly enriched in Scp160p-associated complexes (data not shown). The potential role of <italic>NDC1</italic> in mediating <italic>EAP1&#x0002f;SCP160</italic> synthetic lethality will be a focus of future work.</p><p>The second key point demonstrated here is that the eIF4E-binding capacity of Eap1p is important, although not absolutely essential, to its <italic>SCP160</italic>-related function. This conclusion stems from the observation that the Y109A allele of Eap1p, which no longer binds eIF4E <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c20">20</xref>), is &#x0223c;4-fold less effective at complementing <italic>scp160&#x0002f;eap1</italic> synthetic lethality than is its wild-type counterpart. This result clearly supports the hypothesis that Scp160p plays a role in cytoplasmic mRNA metabolism, most probably including translation. However, the fact that Y109A Eap1p retains almost 25&#x00025; of its ability to complement <italic>scp160&#x0002f;eap1</italic> synthetic lethality implies either that the Y109A substitution does not completely impede the function of Eap1 in translation, or that some other aspect of Eap1p function, independent of translation, is involved. Considering that missegregation of genetic markers through meiosis is one aspect of the <italic>SCP160</italic>-null phenotype, it seems possible that the spindle pole body function of Eap1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c21">21</xref>) may be relevant. Clearly, other functions, unknown at this time, may also be involved.</p><p>Thirdly, as mentioned above, Eap1p physically associates with at least a subset of Scp160p-containing complexes, and that association is RNA dependent. This conclusion stems from the observation that HA-tagged Eap1 co-purifies with anti-tag affinity isolated FLAG-Scp160p, and that this co-purification is disrupted by pre-treatment of the sample with RNase. It is important to note that co-purification from a cell lysate, as was demonstrated here, does not necessarily imply a direct binding between the two proteins; their association may be mediated by other factors. Indeed, the RNA-dependent nature of the association implies either that both Scp160p and Eap1p associate with overlapping sets of RNAs, or that RNA binding by one (or both) of the proteins otherwise impacts the affinity of that protein for its partner(s).</p><p>Considering the semi-quantitative nature of the assay utilized here, it is impossible to estimate the stoichiometries of association between Scp160p and Eap1p. However, considering the differential profiles observed for Scp160p and Eap1p by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, it appears that only a fractional component of either protein pool would be in a position to associate with the other. Whether those molecules of Eap1p that do associate with Scp160p are in any way structurally or functionally distinct from the remainder of the Eap1p pool remains to be determined.</p><p>The final point presented here deals with the size distribution of Scp160p and Eap1p-containing complexes, and the impact of loss of each protein on complexes involving the other. As described above, loss of <italic>eap1</italic> resulted in a notable shift in the size profile of Scp160p-containing complexes, as seen by both size exclusion column chromatography and sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. Indeed, although some Scp160p complexes remained as large as those seen in the presence of <italic>EAP1</italic>, a significant &#x02018;tail&#x02019; of smaller complexes was seen, stretching all the way to &#x0223c;440 kDa, which is the migration position of native monomeric Scp160p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg810c4">4</xref>). Loss of <italic>eap1</italic> had no major impact on the apparent distribution of Scp160p between the soluble and membrane-associated pools. The change in apparent size distribution of Scp160p complexes in the absence of <italic>EAP1</italic> could reflect either impaired assembly or partial destabilization.</p><p>Loss of <italic>scp160</italic> resulted in only minor if any changes in the apparent size distribution of Eap1p complexes in yeast, consistent with the scenario raised above, namely that only a fraction of Eap1p associates with Scp160p-containing complexes. However, the striking loss of Eap1p from membrane pellets in the absence of Scp160p suggests that while the soluble fraction may contain both Scp160p-associated and Scp160p-independent pools of Eap1p, the membrane pellet contains exclusively Eap1p that is associated with Scp160p. Considering that RNase pre-treatment also resulted in a significant loss of HA-Eap1p signal from the membrane pellet of fractionated cells, it appears likely that RNase pre-treatment simply uncoupled Eap1p from the Scp160p complexes that held it there.</p><p>Finally, embedded within the science presented here is a powerful assay that utilizes the relative degree of <italic>SCP160</italic> maintenance plasmid loss to provide a quantitative measure of <italic>in vivo</italic> function for test alleles of either <italic>SCP160</italic> or <italic>EAP1</italic>. While this assay was applied in only a limited manner here, enabling comparison of the functional capacities of high copy versus low copy (tagged) versus a single mutated allele of <italic>EAP1</italic>, this approach could be applied easily to enable a more thorough structure&#x0002f;function analysis of both proteins.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg810f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> A synthetic lethal screen using <italic>scp160</italic>-null cells.
