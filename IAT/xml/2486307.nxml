Despite the presence of a multitude of C-terminal degradation products of this protein, only the highest mobility forms were significantly phosphorylated, suggesting that this DBT target occurs close to the C-terminus of PER. Shorter PER fragments collectively encoding residues 947&#x02013;1,136 were not phosphorylated by DBT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g003">Figure 3</xref>, lanes 12, 13, and 14). The strong phosphorylation of GST-PER 1,101&#x02013;1,224 places the C-terminal DBT target within PER 1,136&#x02013;1,224.</p><p>To summarize, in vitro DBT appears to preferentially phosphorylate sequences in three discrete regions of PER: aa 149&#x02013;170, aa 580&#x02013;645, and aa 1,136&#x02013;1,224. All of these regions are serine- and threonine-rich (17&#x00025;&#x02013;26&#x00025;). However, as further discussed below, a sequence motif previously implicated as a preferential target for phosphorylation in mammalian studies of CKI (S/TXXS/T) is encountered in only one of the target regions of PER. Although we have not determined whether the PER phosphorylation sites detected in vitro correspond to sites phosphorylated in vivo, the limited duration of the in vitro kinase assay is likely to favor phosphorylation of higher affinity sites, rather than secondary, nonspecific sites. Our analysis does not exclude the possibility that DBT phosphorylates PER at other sites in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Identification of Individual DBT Phosphorylation Sites in PER</title><p>In order to define individual phosphorylation sites, three fusion proteins were chosen for phosphopeptide analyses. Fusion proteins (GST-PER149&#x02013;365, GST-PER580&#x02013;645, and GST-PER1101&#x02013;1224) from each DBT target region were phosphorylated by recombinant DBT in the presence of radiolabeled ATP, and the resulting phosphorylated PER proteins isolated and subsequently digested with trypsin for further analysis (Materials and Methods). <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0060183-t001">Table 1</xref> shows the identified phosphopeptide sequences with phosphorylated residues indicated. The bulk of the radioactivity in the N-terminal PER target was located in one long peptide that contained the last 16 amino acids of GST followed by the first 27 amino acids of the fused PER sequence. The long N-terminal sequence composing the GST portion of the fusion protein precluded a further analysis by Edman sequencing. The recovery of this tryptic phosphopeptide (PER aa 149&#x02013;176) was consistent with our earlier mapping of a preferential phosphorylation site(s) between aa 149 and aa 170. The amino acid sequence of the latter PER interval contains five serine residues at positions 149, 151, 153, 164, and 169. These residues are therefore potential substrates for DBT in the N-terminus of PER.</p><table-wrap id="pbio-0060183-t001" content-type="2col" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Phosphopeptides Generated from GST-PER Fusion Proteins by Reaction with DBT</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0060183.t001"/></table-wrap><p>Phosphorylation of GST-PER580&#x02013;645 was predominantly associated with the three tryptic peptides shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0060183-t001">Table 1</xref>.

However, mass spectroscopy also indicated that none of the three peptides was detectably phosphorylated at multiple sites. Thus, each tryptic fraction proved to be a mixture of alternatively phosphorylated versions of the same peptide. Serine 604 was not amenable to Edman sequencing due to its position at the end of a longer tryptic peptide.

In contrast, all mutations in the per-short downstream (perSD, Figure4) domain reduced PER function in this assay, and a mutation of serine 589, in the per-short domain, enhanced PER's activity as a CLK repressor (Figure5A). With respect to mutations of the perSD domain, the inhibitory effect varied depending on the residue(s) mutated: Strongest effects were seen in combinatorial mutations. For example, when residues 604 and 629 were both mutated to alanine, PER function was disabled to a greater extent than that of either single mutant (compare mutant 604/629 with 604 and 629 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). Little or no repressor activity was observed for a combinatorial PER mutant containing alanine substitutions at all per-short and perSD phosphorylation sites (mutant 6A in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g005">Figure 5</xref>A).</p><p>An inverse relationship was observed between S589A and mutations of the perSD domain.

Following transfection of S2 cells with equal amounts of DNA, both PER 589 and PER &#x00394;S appeared to produce greater transcriptional repression than wild-type PER, despite the low levels of PER 589 and PER &#x00394;S protein detected in these assays (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). In contrast, high levels of the PER 6A and PER 604/629 proteins produced only weak repression, suggesting that increased or decreased protein levels are not responsible for the apparent changes in activity levels. To further address this issue, we determined the level of repression associated with wild-type and mutant forms of PER as a function of the amount of protein present in the assay (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). When normalized to the wild-type PER protein levels, measured activities of the PER S589A and PER&#x00394;S repressors were higher than that of wild-type PER, indicating approximately twice the activity per unit protein.

Alternatively, DBT may require posttranslational modification(s) and/or the presence of a stimulating activity or cofactor(s) to produce an active conformation that is not available in bacterial cells. Nevertheless, in this report, we have shown that recombinant DBT can be expressed and recovered in an enzymatically active state from an insect cell line. However, even this insect-derived activity is short-lived (S. Kivim&#x000e4;e, unpublished data).</p><p>Recombinant DBT in vitro preferentially phosphorylates PER protein. No significant phosphorylation was observed when TIM, SGG, and CYC were used as a substrate in vitro. Although no direct DBT phosphorylation of the N-terminal half of CLK was observed, recent studies by others have shown that DBT is required for the generation of a highly phosphorylated and unstable form of CLK in vivo &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;.

An assessment of potential differences of this sort might come from further mapping studies of the target specificities of DBT<sup>S</sup> versus DBT on PER substrates in vitro.</p><p>Three distinct regions of PER are preferentially phosphorylated by DBT in vitro. In the C-terminal region of PER, we have identified two phosphorylation targets, serine 1,134 and threonine 1,219. No prior genetic or biochemical studies have suggested a specific role for this PER interval, and our cultured cell assays indicate that both phosphorylation targets can be removed without a detectable effect on PER's function as a CLK repressor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Near the N-terminus of PER, a region of 20 amino acids (residues 149&#x02013;169) contains five serines that are candidate phosphorylation sites for DBT. This interval is located upstream of the PAS domain of PER. A region important for DBT/PER binding in vitro has been mapped to the first 300 amino acids of PER &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. However, we have not determined whether there is a closer physical correspondence of the binding and phosphorylation target sequences, or whether elimination of potential DBT targets in this PER interval affects PER/DBT binding. As in the case of our cultured cell studies of serine 1,134 and threonine 1,219, elimination of all phosphorylation targets between aa 149&#x02013;169, produced no detectable effect on PER-dependent repression in cultured cells.</p><p>Interestingly, two of the putative CKI sites, serine 151 and serine 153, are substrates of casein kinase 2 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;.

This is a genetically well-studied interval previously implicated in the regulation of behavioral rhythms. As described earlier, mutations of a portion of this region, the per-short domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g004">Figure 4</xref>), are predominantly associated with short-period behavior &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;.

Earlier work has also shown that <italic>per</italic><sup>S</sup> leads to premature nuclear degradation of PER &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;, and our current studies of transgenic <italic>Drosophila</italic> producing a PER protein truncated by 17 amino acids including serine 589 (<italic>per</italic>&#x00394;<italic>S</italic>), similarly indicate a role for this sequence in regulating PER stability and function as a repressor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g006">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g007">7</xref>). Thus, the wild-type per-short domain appears to promote PER stability while reducing its activity as a transcriptional repressor.</p><p>We note that earlier work has also suggested that the mutation <italic>per</italic><sup>S</sup> enhances DBT activity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. If serine 589 is no longer an available DBT target in <italic>per</italic><sup>S</sup>, by what mechanism might DBT function be elevated? Although mutating serine 589 enhances PER's activity as a repressor, this response is partially suppressed by a further mutation of some phosphorylation sites in the perSD region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g005">Figure 5</xref>). As well, little or no repressor activity is detected if all phosphorylation targets are removed from perSD, even in the presence of the <italic>per</italic><sup>S</sup> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Together, these results suggest that the phosphorylation state of serine 589 may influence DBT activity on downstream targets within perSD that are required for PER's function as a CLK repressor. In such a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g008">Figure 8</xref>), dephosphorylation of the per-short domain would promote DBT-directed phosphorylation of perSD, enhancing PER's activity as a repressor and also destabilizing the protein. Reciprocally, phosphorylation of serine 589 would depress activity of DBT with respect to perSD, providing a more stable, but less active, PER protein. In this view, a fully dephosphorylated state would provide the most stable protein, but would provide an inactive form of PER, consistent with our findings in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g005">Figure 5</xref>) and transgenic flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060183-g007">Figure 7</xref>), and with earlier studies of DBT-deficient <italic>Drosophila</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;.

This mutant PER protein displays increased stability and low-amplitude oscillations.

A novel, bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) is found in this region that influences nuclear localization of PER in S2 cells. Recent mapping studies of CCID led to the identification of a smaller, PER-DBT binding domain (PDBD; aa 755&#x02013;809) that upon deletion increases PER stability, decreases PER phosphorylation, and severely impairs PER function as a transcriptional repressor &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;.

Studies of the latter deletion in transgenic flies showed that a hypophosphorylated form of PER is constitutively expressed at high levels and is a very poor repressor.

Extracts were mixed with Luciferase Assay Reagent (Promega) in a 1:5 ratio, and luciferase activity was measured using liquid scintillation counter LS6000IC (Beckman) in single-photon collection mode. Luciferase activity was normalized to cotransfected &#x003b2;-gal activity in each sample. To determine the amount of PER protein present in each luciferase assay, a small sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the presence of PER protein was detected using anti-PER antibodies. To quantitate the strength of repression as a function of the amount of protein, S2 cells were transfected with increasing amounts of <italic>per</italic> DNA. Half of each cell sample was used to measure PER-dependent repression, with the remaining half used to determine the amount of PER protein in the assay.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Protein extraction and western analysis.</title><p>Total protein from fly heads was extracted in HE buffer (20 mM Tris &#x0005b;pH 7.5&#x0005d;, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1&#x00025; Triton, 1 mM DTT) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Calbiochem). Protein concentration was measured with BCA protein measurement kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol.</p><p>For detection of PER and TIM proteins, 20 &#x003bc;g of total protein was resolved in 6&#x00025; SDS-PAGE. The following antibodies at indicated dilutions in 5&#x00025; nonfat milk were used for protein detection: anti-TIM 1:2,000 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060183-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d;, anti-PER 1:20,000 (gift from Dr. J.

Two micrograms to 20 &#x003bc;g of total RNA was resolved in 1&#x00025; formaldehyde gel following the RNeasy Northern gel protocol and transferred to NytranN membrane (Schleicher and Schuell) in 10&#x000d7; SSC. Membranes were UV crosslinked in Stratalinker (Stratagene). Prehybridization was carried out for 0.5&#x02013;2 h, and hybridization was performed overnight in 10 ml of Ultrahybe buffer (Ambion). Blots were washed four times in washing buffer (0.2&#x000d7; SSC, 1&#x00025; SDS) at 65 &#x000b0;C.

The oligonucleotide was phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase and annealed to the ssDNA XmaI-XmnI fragment recovered from <italic>per</italic> genomic DNA and cloned in pGEM 7-zf. The second strand was synthesized with DNA polymerase (Klenow fragment), and T4 DNA ligase was added to close the gap of the new strand. Nci I and exonuclease III were used to nick and then partially digest the parent strand. The mutant homoduplex was formed by incubating this partially double-stranded DNA in the presence of DNA polymerase I and T4 DNA ligase.
