During the process of evolution the distribution of genes on chromosomes is rearranged by illegitimate recombination and translocation. Species sharing a recent common ancestor tend to have fewer chromosomal rearrangements than distantly related species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Orthologous genes serve as landmarks for the definition of related chromosomal regions. Orthologous segments are defined by at least one pair of orthologous genes; conserved synteny relates to at least two pairs of orthologous genes located on the same chromosomal segment in two different species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>With increasing sequence data comparative genomics is no longer restricted to genes, as evolutionary conserved intergenic sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] can now also be taken into account. In addition, comparison of genomic sequence data of two different species facilitates the identification of novel genes and conserved regulatory elements.</p><p>We use comparative genomics for a positional cloning approach in order to identify candidate genes for the mouse mutation <italic>wobbler (wr)</italic> which causes muscle weakness due to motor neuron degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and a spermiogenesis defect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].

PX19 was first identified in chicken as a cDNA with a LEA (late embryogenesis abundant) motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. By searching the human draft genome sequence we detected more than 5 intronless copies of this gene, and also in the limited data of the mouse genome several copies were present (data not shown).</p><p>Human gene content and order on our contig was compared with the annotated draft sequence of the human genome (UCSC genome browser, December 2001). Nearly all genes/cDNAs are present on both and the gene order is identical with one exception (HCC8 and UGP2) which is due to gaps in the human draft sequence. On the basis of the human draft sequence and our YAC contig it was possible to determine the orientation of most human genes (PELI1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], MDH1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], HCC8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], UGP2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], LOC51057 and KIAA0903 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]). In the mouse, genes were ordered and oriented by our high resolution BAC contig combined with sequence analysis of seven selected mouse BACs (AC091422, AC091423, AC091424, AC091428, AC091419, AC091420, AC091421).</p><p>Murine genomic clones, YAC clone ymWIBR100H6 (500 Kb) and BAC clone 135B4 (200 kb), comprised sequences from both, <italic>Kiaa0903</italic> and <italic>Hspc159</italic>; this indicated a different gene order of mouse and man in the <italic>wobbler</italic> critical region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

During the draft phase of genome projects sequence information has to be used with caution since multiple gaps lead to incorrect orientation and order of the sequence fragments. High-resolution maps based on contigs of genomic clones as presented in this work help to overcome this problem. For example, the positions of genes UGP2 and HCC8, whose 5' ends are less than 2 kb apart, were shown to be inverted in the human draft version relative to the correct orientation, and most of the UGP2 gene was not available. The correct gene order was resolved with the high resolution map presented here. Furthermore, genes are missing from the chromosome maps if their transcripts have not been described although the protein is known. For example, OTX1 was not annotated in the draft sequence because its cDNA sequence was not present in the database.</p><p>By the identification of 20 orthologous gene pairs we were able to show that the gene content of proximal mouse Chr11 and human Chr2p13-14 is highly conserved. On the other hand, the gene order appears disrupted by an inversion which comprises 1.5 Mb. Despite the fact that the present mouse draft sequence suggests an orientation as in the human genome our results indicate an inversion. The exact inversion breakpoints are not known, and despite extensive screens no mouse BACs spanning the distal breakpoint were detected. Low complexity and reiterative sequences may be responsible for both, the chromosomal rearrangement between mouse and man and the difficulty to clone these regions. A comparable inversion of about 1 Mb has been reported for human Chr19p13.3 and mouse Chr10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Carver and Stubbs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] suggest that continuous regions of conserved syntenies without insertions, deletions and inversions are rather the exception than the rule. Further small-scale rearrangements within regions of conserved synteny are expected to be discovered with high-resolution maps and availability of sequence data.</p><p>The only exceptions from the conservation of gene content are PX19 and ELP which are probably pseudogenes that have integrated on human Chr2p after the divergence of rodents and primates. Although some cDNA clones are listed in the databases, no expression of ELP could be detected and the sequences contain several mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. We conclude that the human ELP is a pseudogene. Murine <italic>Elp</italic> probably arose by retroposon-mediated gene duplication and secondarily acquired a testis-specific promotor and thus a limited expression. The Chr2p copy of PX19 is truncated compared to the functional PX19 cDNA, with the 3' UTR partially missing. No human EST corresponding to the Chr2p copy was detected, implying it to be a pseudogene. The polyA tail in the genomic sequence suggests that it may have arisen by the integration of an alternatively polyadenylated PX19 transcript. Although first identified as a human cDNA clone, <italic>Homoloc2</italic> neither has an open reading frame nor could a transcript be detected by RT-PCR. The high conservation of its genomic sequence between man and mouse suggests a regulatory function.</p><p>Establishing full-length cDNA sequences for all genes within the <italic>wobbler</italic> critical region was the basis for an extensive comparative sequencing effort aimed to detect a mutation. So far, no mutation and no difference of transcript levels was found.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The comparative mouse-man genomics approach has proven a valuable tool to find new candidate genes for disease mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. However, inversions and insertions have to be taken into account if the human genome is to be used as a framework for the sequence assembly of the mouse. Besides providing new candidates comparative genomics leads to the identification of conserved noncoding sequences, which might have important biological functions. Mutations such as <italic>wobbler</italic> for which all candidate genes have been excluded might affect a conserved noncoding sequence with a cis-acting effect on genes that might be located outside the critical region as defined by recombination.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>BAC and YAC clones</title><p>For the mouse BAC and YAC clones and the human YAC clones see Resch et al.

Subsequently, physical mapping was carried out by STS and radiation hybrid mapping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of RNA and RT-PCR</title><p>Mouse RNA from wildtype and <italic>wobbler</italic> (<italic>wr</italic>/<italic>wr</italic>)was prepared from various tissues of C57Bl/6J mice by standard procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Human RNA was purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, USA).
