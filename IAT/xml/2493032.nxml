In the absence of a clear rationale to justify the evolutionary retention of a death only pathway, we hypothesize that yca1 also influences non-apoptotic events. We report that genetic ablation and/or catalytic inactivation of Yca1p leads to a longer G1/S transition accompanied by slower growth in fermentation conditions. Downregulation of Yca1p proteolytic activity also results in failure to arrest during nocodazole treatment, indicating that Yca1p participates in the G2/M mitotic checkpoint. 20s proteasome activity and ROS staining of the <italic>&#x00394;yca1</italic> strain is indistinguishable from its isogenic control suggesting that putative regulation of the oxidative stress response by Yca1p does not instigate the cell cycle phenotype.

Arguments to rationalize apoptosis in yeast have included altruism in the presence of reactive oxygen species or killer toxins, a program to execute cells that fail to mate in response to pheromone and a mechanism for lateral gene transfer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002956-Buttner1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002956-Frohlich2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002956-Severin1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, the validity of these hypotheses has yet to be fully explored and may not justify the development and retention of a biochemical pathway devoted solely to cell death. Without an incontrovertible justification for an apoptotic response in yeast, it is also reasonable to conjecture that proteins such as Yca1p may have initially developed or co-evolved other vital non-death functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002956-Fernando1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002956-Fernando2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Caspase activity is an inductive signal for non-death functions such as cell cycle progression, proliferation, cell migration and differentiation in mammalian cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002956-Fernando1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002956-Li1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

DNA content analysis of <italic>&#x00394;yca1 vs.</italic> wild-type shows that Yca1p accelerates G1/S and antagonizes G2/M transitions granting Yca1p-expressing cells an increased fitness in fermentive conditions. Analysis of a Yca1p catalytic inactivation mutant revealed that enzymatic activity of Yca1p is upstream of the G1/S transition phenotype. The slow growth phenotype of the <italic>&#x00394;yca1</italic> strain was exacerbated in the presence of the catalytic inactivation mutant resulting in an even longer procession through the S and G2/M cell cycle phases. Furthermore, genetic or chemical inhibition of Yca1p results in desensitization to nocodazole. These findings support the hypothesis that the canonical apoptotic proteins also regulate critical non-death functions in single cell organisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ablation of <italic>yca1</italic> alters DNA content profiles</title><p>Mammalian caspase activity can alter cell cycle timing when observed under specific conditions.

DNA content of wild-type BY4741 and Yca1p disrupted (<italic>&#x00394;yca1</italic>) yeast strains were quantified to examine this hypothesis. Strains were grown to mid-exponential phase and DNA content was analyzed by flow cytometry (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002956.s002">Figure S2</xref> for example distributions, gating and controls).

To examine whether the enzymatic activity of Yca1p influenced cell cycle progression/equilibrium, the yca1-C297A mutant was constructed and expressed under its endogenous promoter with the selectable trophic marker leu2 in the <italic>&#x00394;yca1</italic> background strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002956.s003">Figure S3</xref>).

In all cell cycle experiments, the LEU2 strain behaved identically to the <italic>&#x00394;yca1</italic> strain indicating that the selectable marker did not influence cell cycle behavior (unpublished observation).

The percentage of cells in each gate were quantified and averaged for all samples over the indicated time points. The averages of biological replicates were compared for the different strains and summarized as pie charts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002956-g002">Fig. 2 a</xref>). The doubling time of the exponentially growing cultures was then calculated based on optical density measurements. We observed that both the <italic>&#x00394;yca1</italic> and C297A strains had a protracted progression through the cell cycle suggesting that endogenous expression of Yca1p improves robustness of yeast cells in fermentive conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002956-g002">Fig. 2 b</xref>). The actual time spent in each phase of the cell cycle was derived by multiplying the percentage of cells in a particular phase by the observed doubling time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002956-g002">Fig. 2 c</xref>). One-way ANOVA confirmed significant variation of the mean within the group of different strains for each observed phase of the cell cycle (G1, S and G2/M; P&#x0003c;0.01). During exponential growth the time required for <italic>&#x00394;yca1</italic> cells to pass from G1 to S is significantly extended, passage through G2/M is accelerated and the S-phase was relatively unaffected when compared to BY4741 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002956-g002">Fig. 2 c</xref>). The C297A strain displayed a comparable delay through the G1/S transition just as the <italic>&#x00394;yca1</italic> strain suggesting that timely G1/S transition is dependent on the enzymatic activity of Yca1p. The time required for the C297A strain to pass through G2/M was comparable to that of BY4741 implying that the accelerated transition through G2/M observed for the <italic>&#x00394;yca1</italic> could be corrected by replacement of Yca1p without regard to its proteolytic activity. Interestingly, the C297A strain also demonstrated a protracted progression through S phase when compared to both the BY4741 and <italic>&#x00394;yca1</italic> strains. It is not immediately apparent how the C297A strain could alter S phase when the comparable knockout strain did not yield a similar effect. However, the substantial delay of the doubling time observed in the C297A strain suggests that YCA1-C297Ap may be acting in a dominant inhibitory fashion, interacting with the Yca1p targets and limiting their respective activity. Such an interaction could convey an illusory correction of the G2/M timing phenotype that is observed. Together, these results clearly implicate a role for the yeast metacaspase protein in a cell cycle timing function, modulating both G1/S and G2/M progression.</p><fig id="pone-0002956-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002956.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Derivation of the duration of cell cycle phases.</title><p>(a) BY4741 (wild-type), <italic>&#x00394;yca1</italic> and C297A catalytic inactivation mutant were grown to mid-logarithmic phase in acidic YPD media.

Given the preponderance of G1 cells in the <italic>&#x00394;yca1</italic> strain, the increased presence of Rad23p in these cells suggests the potential activation and stabilization of the NER associated checkpoint <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002956-Ortolan1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. We examined the possibility of direct interaction between Yca1p and Rad23p; however, we were unable to demonstrate any association through co-immunoprecipitation of Rad23p with the Yca1p-TAP strain or Yca1p with the Rad23p-TAP strain (unpublished observations). The lack of Rad23p cleavage products in the western blots in addition to the failure to co-immunoprecipitate suggests that the Rad23p response is secondary to Yca1p activity. However, the increase in Rad23p in the <italic>&#x00394;yca1</italic> strain might suggest the occurrence of alternate DNA processing events which may contribute to the G1/S phenotype.</p><p>Low-level ROS has been reported to act as a proliferative signal, stimulating G1/S progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002956-Deng1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002956-Sattler1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. We cannot discount the possibility that retention of Rad23p and the G1/S transition phenotype result from subtle differences in ROS levels that are not detectable by our methods. However, the absence of 20s proteasome activity and ROS staining suggest that oxidative stress-associated DNA damage is not directly invoking an NER response in <italic>&#x00394;yca1</italic> cells. In fermentive conditions, both strains grow in a healthy manner free of excessive oxidative stress or cell death suggesting that these are not the direct causes of the cell cycle phenotype.</p><p>In conclusion, our results demonstrate a previously unrecognized role for the yeast metacaspase Yca1p in cell cycle progression. Yca1p accelerates the G1/S transition and slows the G2/M transition. In the first instance Yca1p confers a growth advantage by promoting the transition between G1 and S phase. Secondly, our results show that Yca1p antagonizes cell growth by limiting the G2/M transition. Furthermore, we observed that <italic>&#x00394;yca1</italic> and Yca1p inhibited cells are similarly desensitized to the nocodazole induced G2/M checkpoint. Reduced response to nocodazole has been detected in mammalian systems in which the Yca1p related enzyme caspase-3 is inhibited. Based on these observations, we speculate that the disparate ability of metacaspases to both promote and antagonize different cell cycle checkpoints may represent an early form of the proliferation/differentiation regulating activity exhibited by metazoan caspases.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Yeast strains and growth conditions</title><p>S. cerevisiae strains used in this study include wild-type haploid BY4741 (MATa his3&#x00394;1 leu2&#x00394;0 met15&#x00394;0 ura3&#x00394;0) and the knockout <italic>&#x00394;yca1</italic> strain from the BY4741 background (Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL).
