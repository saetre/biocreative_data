Because DMs lack centromeric sequences it has remained unclear how they segregate through mitosis and, consequently, how they are maintained and amplified in a growing NB cell population.

The aims of the present study were (1) to characterise the cell cycle dynamics of DMs in NB cells and assess to which extent their behaviour is similar to that inferred by studies in other model systems, (2) to deduce the statistical principles of DM segregation, and (3) to investigate the topography of DM binding sites on human chromosomes. Based on our findings, we finally sought to assess whether unequal segregation of DMs to daughter cells at mitosis could play a mechanistic role in <italic>MYCN</italic> gene amplification by generating cell populations with heterogeneous DM copy-numbers on which Darwinian principles could be imposed.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cell cycle dynamics of DMs</title><p>To locate DMs in relation to chromosomes through the cell cycle, <italic>MYCN</italic> amplicons in the two NB cell lines CHP-212 and SK-N-AS were detected by combined fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and beta-tubulin immunofluorescence using epifluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003099-g001">Figure 1A&#x02013;F</xref>).

In contrast, &#x0003c;20&#x00025; of DMs in interphase cells located peripherally, while the remaining DMs were distributed at locations not overlapping with the outer chromatin border. This fluctuation in distribution between interphase and mitosis was observed in all the cell lines, without any significant difference between them in the fraction peripheral DMs at interphase or mitosis.</p><p>The mitotic location of DMs adjacent to chromosome termini prompted us to investigate whether DMs co-localized with telomeric repeat sequences in LA-N-5 and CHP-212.

AFM is a well established technique in material sciences, making it possible to map surface topography with nanometre resolution. Superimposition of FISH images and AFM topography plots made it possible to establish the location of single and clustered DMs with high precision in three dimensions and confirmed the peripheral localisation of DMs at mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003099-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Approximately half of the totally 50 DMs analysed were located on the surface of chromosomes, corresponding to peaks of approximately 200 nm in the AFM surface plots. The other DMs were located in grooves between chromosomes. In interphase cells, there was no clear correlation between DMs and surface features by AFM (data not shown). Taken together, our FISH and AFM data thus indicated that DMs underwent repeated topographical fluctuations during the cell cycle, moving rapidly from locations in the nuclear interior at interphase to positions adjacent to the telomeres at prometaphase, where they remained through telophase to finally drift back into the interior of the newly formed interphase nucleus.</p><fig id="pone-0003099-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003099.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Atomic force microscopy.</title><p>A.

To evaluate whether scoring by two-dimensional microscopic analysis was a sufficiently precise method for this, we first scored DMs, detected by <italic>MYCN</italic> or <italic>MYC</italic> probes, in 30 interphase cells from each of CHP-212, LA-N-5, and MC-IX, both by serial confocal sections (3D; 1 AU pinhole) and a single wide confocal section (2D; &#x0003e;5 AU pinhole). The average difference in DM copy number per cell by 2D analysis compared to 3D analysis was very low in each cell line up to a copy-number of approximately 100 (3.4&#x02013;3.9&#x00025; of the total DM copy-number; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003099-g003">Figure 3A&#x02013;C</xref>). Based on this, we then scored DM copy-number by epifluorescence microscopy in ana- and telophase cells, identified by cross-labelling with beta-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003099-g003">Figure 3D</xref>; 100 cells scored in CHP-212, 100 in LA-N-5, and 50 in MC-IX). Plotting of copy-number data revealed a similar pattern in the three cell lines. An identical DM copy-number in two opposite daughter poles was very rare, but the interpolar differences in copy number were typically small and there was a positive correlation in copy-number between opposite poles (r&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.53 in LA-N-5, r&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.92 in CHP-212, r&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.94 in MC-IX; p&#x0003c;0.05 for all).

In total, 20 colonies from each cell line were analysed. With few exceptions, the colonies showed modal DM copy-numbers similar to those of the original cultures. In order not to overestimate the number of cells with copy-numbers produced by a non-binomial distribution, cells that deviated in &#x0003e;20 DM copies from each clone's modal value (outlier cells) were tested against a hypothetical binomial segregation, using the cell with the DM copy-number closest to its own as its presumed post-mitotic sister cell. It has been shown that DMs separate into single minutes during G1-phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003099-Deng1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> and it could therefore not be excluded that outlier cells with higher copy-numbers than a specific colony's modal value represented cells where the DMs had just separated into single-minutes, leading to a duplication of the actual DM copy-numbers. Therefore, only outlier cells with copy-numbers below each colony's modal copy-number were tested. Using this approach, cells with copy-numbers not consistent with binomial segregation were found in 2&#x02013;6 monoclonal colonies from each cell line (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003099.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Using the total number of cells in each colony to calculate the minimum number of cell divisions that occurred during colony-formation, the frequency of non-binomial DM segregations were approximately 3&#x00025; (3/88) in CHP-212, 2&#x00025; (2/100) in MC-IX, and 8&#x00025; (6/73) in LA-N-5. These values were consistent with the data from direct analysis of ana- and telophase cells, also showing a higher frequency of non-binomial segregation in LA-N-5 (10&#x00025;) compared to CHP-212 (2&#x00025;) and MC-IX (2&#x00025;). Hence, even though non-binomial distributions were rare in the three cell lines, they were sufficiently frequent to generate cells with a DM copy-number strongly deviating from the modal value of the cell population.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Non-binomial distribution occurs through clustering at high DM copy numbers</title><p>One potential explanation of non-binomial DM segregation is detachment of multiple DMs at anaphase, leading to a decreased number of DMs in one of the daughter cells. Further image analysis of the ana- and telophase cells with non-binomial segregation showed that these cells rarely exhibited DMs that detached from the chromosomes, and no more than 4 DMs were observed to be detached in any single cell. This argued against loss of DMs through micronucleus formation as a mechanism for non-binomial segregation. However, the ana- and telophase cells with a non-binomial DM distribution had a higher median DM copy-number than those with a binomial distribution (median 74 vs. 40; P&#x0003c;0.0001 Mann-Whitney test; two-sided; pooled data from the three cell lines). Based on this, we selected 10 ana-telophases with a DM copy-number &#x0003e;50 from each cell line for a detailed analysis by confocal microscopy. This showed that all of the totally 30 analyzed ana-telophases exhibited at least one cluster of DMs at or adjacent to the chromosome termini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003099-g004">Figure 4A and B</xref>). The precise number of DMs in each cluster could not be determined at the obtained resolution level, but each cluster appeared to contain at least 5 DMs. In contrast, only approximately one third of ana-telophase cells with 50 or fewer DMs contained clusters, typically containing only two or three DMs.</p><fig id="pone-0003099-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003099.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Clustering of DM at high copy-number.</title><p>A&#x02013;B.

Furthermore, the randomness function best approximating the behaviour of DMs had not been determined.</p><p>In the present study, we show that DMs in NB cells exhibit a regular topographic fluctuation during the cell cycle, translocating rapidly from the nuclear interior to the periphery of the prometaphase rosette at the initiation of cell division, attaching close to the telomeric repeat sequences. For the vast majority of DMs, this attachment was retained from prometaphase through telophase. After reconstitution of the interphase chromatin structure, the DMs relocated to the nuclear interior, possibly to occupy positions at the periphery of chromosome territories <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003099-Solovei1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, separate to single minutes during G1-phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003099-Deng1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, and replicate in S-phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003099-Itoh1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> as described.

Thus our description of the mitotic topography of DMs mainly serves to confirm that previously suggested models of DM behaviour at cell division are applicable to NB. In contrast, our findings regarding the statistical distribution of DMs are novel and confirm a long held suspicion of the origin of oncogene copy-number heterogeneity.</p><p>We showed that the skewed frequency distributions of DM copy-number could be modelled by combining binomial mitotic segregation with a selection pressure favouring cells with a higher DM copy-number up to a certain level. The binomial distribution is the discrete probability distribution of the numbers in a sequence of <italic>n</italic> independent events, each of which yields one out of two possible outcomes with the probability <italic>p</italic>. In the context of DM segregation, <italic>n</italic> corresponds to the DM copy-number at metaphase. Because we assumed that each DM was equally likely to segregate to one of the daughter cells as to the other, <italic>p</italic> was set to 0.5. Our finding that DM copy-numbers can be described by a simple binomial distribution has at least three implications for the evolution of <italic>MYCN</italic> amplicons in NB cells: (1) <italic>MYCN</italic>-copies in DMs segregate independently of each other in a random fashion up to a certain copy-number level. (2) When this level has been reached, the random binomial model is no longer applicable; our experimental data indicate that this level is determined by the copy-number at which DMs start to interact with each other to form clusters, presumably because of the spatial restrictions of the mitotic figures. (3) The modal DM copy-number in the tumour cell population reflects the number of <italic>MYCN</italic>-copies conferring the greatest proliferative advantage under these cells' specific growth conditions. In the established cell lines and tumours used in the present study, this number varied between 25 and 50 DMs.</p><p>We cannot completely exclude that non-binomial segregation of clustered DMs also has a role in generating the skewed frequency distribution found in tumour bulk populations. However, non-binomial segregations were relatively rare in our material. Furthermore, they would be more likely to generate discrete sub-populations at non-modal copy-numbers rather than a continuous, skewed distribution. Our findings do not unequivocally explain the negative selection pressure at higher DM copy-numbers, although it points to clustering as a cause of non-binomial segregation at high copy-numbers. Such mitotic clustering should cause dramatic shifts in <italic>MYCN</italic>-copy number after cell division, potentially leading to dysregulation of <italic>MYCN</italic>-dependent intracellular signalling systems and apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003099-Tang1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Nevertheless, our mathematical model is supported by several studies showing that <italic>MYCN</italic> amplification confers a proliferative advantage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003099-Narath1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003099-delCarmenMejia1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003099-Schweigerer1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, and also by our own finding of a higher DM copy number among colony-forming CHP-212 cells compared to non-colony forming cells.</p><p>Our findings do not explain the molecular mechanisms underlying the topographical fluctuation of DMs during the cell cycle. The co-localisation of DMs and telomeric TTAGGG-repeats at mitosis could suggest that DMs bind to parts of the telosome multiprotein complex. However, disruption of telomere stability by telomere shortening induced by MST-312 failed to perturb the binomial segregation of DMs at cell division. Even though our studies do not fully exclude that DMs bound to the telomeres that remained intact after telomerase inhibition, our data speak against a specific interaction between DMs and the telosome complex. This was further supported by the finding that not all DMs co-localised with telomere repeats at cell division and also by our confocal microscopy and AFM images showing that several DMs were localised to interstitial segments close to the termini, rather than to the termini <italic>per se</italic>. A previous study has demonstrated that DMs are typically located at the periphery of folded chromosome territories in interphase nuclei <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003099-Solovei1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. It is possible that the centripetal force acting on centromeres during formation of the prometaphase rosette results in a centrifugal movement of DMs relative to the chromosomes as DMs do not interact with the mitotic spindle. The peripheral translocation of DMs at prometaphase formation would then be caused by DMs sliding longitudinally along the chromosomes as the interphase chromosome territories condense at prometaphase and are pulled centrally by the spindle fibres. Our findings are consistent with those of a previous study, based on the COLO322 cell line, showing that DMs were repelled from the spindle poles while they attached to the chromosome periphery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003099-Kanda1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Disrupting microtubule organization eliminated such peripheral localization of DMs in this model system, but it did not affect their association with chromosomes, indicating that a microtubule-mediated antipolar force would be responsible for the mitotic fluctuation of DMs. Together with our data, these findings imply that unspecific, weak biophysical forces cause the attachment of DMs to chromosomes during mitosis. This is supported by our finding that DMs could move freely in the interphase nuclei of interspecies hybrids.</p><p>The present study is one of a few showing a specific mechanism causing genetic heterogeneity by random events, which in turn can form the substrate for selection according to Darwinian principles, ultimately leading up to oncogene amplification and an increased proliferation of tumour cells. Furthermore, by clarifying the statistical principles of <italic>MYCN</italic> amplicon segregation, we have now acquired a precise standard against which the effects of potential anti-neuroblastoma drugs acting through <italic>MYCN</italic> amplicon elimination can be compared. The mechanisms by which DMs bind to chromosomes in NB clearly need to be studied further, particularly as the molecules participating in this attachment would be attractive therapeutic targets. If the binding of DMs to chromosomes could be efficiently, and specifically, inhibited, this could be an efficient way of eliminating <italic>MYCN</italic> amplicons from NB cells, thus causing growth reduction and apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003099-Narath1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003099-Yaari1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.
