To study mechanisms, we engineered &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells to conditionally express talin and protease-activated receptor (PAR) thrombin receptors. Human PAR1 or murine PAR4 stimulation activates &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3, which was measured with antibody PAC-1, indicating complete pathway reconstitution. Knockdown of Rap1&#x02013;guanosine triphosphate&#x02013;interacting adaptor molecule (RIAM), a Rap1 effector, blocks this response. In living cells, RIAM overexpression stimulates and RIAM knockdown blocks talin recruitment to &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3, which is monitored by bimolecular fluorescence complementation. Mutations in talin or &#x003b2;3 that disrupt their mutual interaction block both talin recruitment and &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 activation. However, one talin mutant (L325R) is recruited to &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 but cannot activate it. In platelets, RIAM localizes to filopodia and lamellipodia, and, in megakaryocytes, RIAM knockdown blocks PAR4-mediated &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 activation. The RIAM-related protein lamellipodin promotes talin recruitment and &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 activity in CHO cells but is not expressed in megakaryocytes or platelets. Thus, talin recruitment to &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 by RIAM mediates agonist-induced &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 activation, with implications for hemostasis and thrombosis.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: BiFC, bimolecular fluorescence complementation; IRES, internal ribosomal entry site; PAR, protease-activated receptor; RIAM, Rap1-GTP&#x02013;interacting adaptor molecule; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; VASP, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Integrins are &#x003b1;/&#x003b2;-heterodimeric receptors that mediate cell&#x02013;matrix and cell&#x02013;cell adhesion through interactions with extracellular adhesive ligands and cellular counterreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hynes, 2002</xref>). Ligand binding to many, if not most, integrins is regulated by inside-out signaling. In this process, occupancy of cell surface agonist receptors (e.g., G protein&#x02013;coupled receptors and receptor protein tyrosine kinases) initiates intracellular signaling to activate integrins. Ultimately, activation signals are thought to converge on the integrin &#x003b1; and/or &#x003b2; cytoplasmic domains, leading to conformational changes that are propagated to the transmembrane and extracellular domains to increase receptor affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Calderwood, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ginsberg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Luo et al., 2007</xref>). In platelets, affinity modulation regulates the interaction of &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 with cognate ligands, including fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, and fibronectin, leading to platelet spreading and aggregation at sites of vascular damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shattil and Newman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jackson, 2007</xref>). In humans, abnormalities in inside-out signaling may cause either reduced platelet adhesive function and bleeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pasvolsky et al., 2007</xref>) or heightened platelet function and thrombosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ruggeri, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Michiels et al., 2006</xref>). Consequently, substantial efforts have been made to unravel the molecular mechanisms of inside-out signaling in platelets and other cells, with recent studies focusing on candidate proteins that may interact with the integrin cytoplasmic domains to flip the activation switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ginsberg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Leisner et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Talin1 (talin) is an &#x0223c;270-kD protein with an N-terminal globular head and a C-terminal rodlike tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Critchley, 2004</xref>). The talin head contains a FERM domain capable of engaging several proteins, including integrin &#x003b2; cytoplasmic domains, and the talin rod contains a second integrin-binding site and binding sites for filamentous actin and vinculin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Knezevic et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Critchley, 2004</xref>). Overexpression of the talin head or FERM domain promotes activation of &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 and other integrins in model cell systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Calderwood et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouaouina et al., 2008</xref>). Talin knockout in the mouse is embryonic lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Monkley et al., 2000</xref>). However, knockdown of talin in megakaryocyte platelet precursors with short hairpin RNA (shRNA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tadokoro et al., 2003</xref>) and hematopoietic- or platelet/megakaryocyte-specific talin knockout in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nieswandt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Petrich et al., 2007b</xref>) cause severe impairment of agonist-induced &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 activation and a bleeding diathesis. In unstimulated platelets, talin resides in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bertagnolli et al., 1993</xref>), presumably in an autoinhibited conformation, with the head and tail interacting in an intra- or intermolecular fashion to limit access to binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Calderwood, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Critchley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ginsberg et al., 2005</xref>). Platelet stimulation by thrombin or other agonists is hypothesized to relieve this autoinhibition and promote talin recruitment to and activation of &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3. However, several critical details of talin's function in platelets and other cells remain sketchy, particularly the process of talin recruitment to activate integrins.</p><p>Among the proteins that have been implicated in integrin-mediated cell adhesion are the Rap1 GTPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bos, 2005</xref>) and Rap1-GTP&#x02013;interacting adaptor molecule (RIAM), a Rap1 effector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lafuente et al., 2004</xref>). RIAM is a member of the MRL family of adaptor molecules that includes lamellipodin and its <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> orthologue, Mig-10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krause et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lafuente et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2006</xref>). Each contains an N-terminal coiled-coil region, central Ras association and pleckstrin homology domains, a proline-rich C-terminal region, and multiple FPPPP motifs capable of interacting with the EVH1 domains of the actin regulatory proteins Ena/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP). RIAM but not lamellipodin interacts with Rap1-GTP to promote the adhesion of Jurkat T cells through &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b2;2 integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krause et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lafuente et al., 2004</xref>). Lamellipodin, on the other hand, promotes lamellipodia formation through Ena/VASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krause et al., 2004</xref>), and Mig-10 promotes axon guidance and outgrowth through the Ena/VASP homologue, unc-34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Recent evidence supports roles for both Rap1 and RIAM in &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 affinity modulation. Knockdown or knockout of Rap1b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chrzanowska-Wodnicka et al., 2005</xref>) or of CalDAG-GEFI, a Rap1 exchange factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eto et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crittenden et al., 2004</xref>), is associated with defective agonist-induced &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 activation. Furthermore, overexpression of activated Rap1a (V12) or RIAM in CHO cells leads to talin-dependent &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 activation as measured with the ligand-mimetic antibody PAC-1. In contrast, knockdown of either protein by shRNA has the opposite effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Han et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, Rap1a (V12) promotes RIAM association with talin, as determined indirectly by coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence colocalization techniques. However, it remains to be determined whether RIAM promotes talin recruitment directly to &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 in living cells, whether it mediates inside-out signaling in response to a platelet agonist, and whether it regulates integrin activation in platelets or megakaryocytes. Moreover, a role for lamellipodin, if any, in &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 activation has not been addressed. In this study, we have resolved these issues by using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kerppola, 2008</xref>) to monitor talin recruitment to &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 in living cells and by studying RIAM&#x02013;talin&#x02013;&#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 relationships in platelets and megakaryocytes. The results establish that RIAM but not lamellipodin is a central player in agonist-induced recruitment of talin to &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3. Furthermore, a specific interaction between the talin FERM domain and &#x003b2;3 is required for the recruited talin to activate &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Talin recruitment to &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 in living cells</title><p>To study the process of talin recruitment to &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3, we developed a method to monitor specific, proximal interactions between full-length talin and &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 in living cells based on BiFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shyu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kerppola, 2008</xref>). Two chimeras were constructed for this purpose (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). One, VN-talin, consists of the N-terminal half of the Venus fluorophore fused to the N terminus of mouse talin. The other chimera, &#x003b1;IIb-VC, consists of the C-terminal half of Venus fused to the C terminus of human &#x003b1;IIb. The latter was cotransfected with human &#x003b2;3 to establish stable cell lines expressing &#x003b1;IIb-VC&#x003b2;3. We reasoned that after transfection of VN-talin into these cells, this protein would be recruited from the cytoplasm to &#x003b1;IIb-VC&#x003b2;3 in response to an inside-out stimulus. Assuming proper orientation, the split Venus moieties associated with talin and &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 would then interact and refold to complement Venus fluorescence (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). On the other hand, fluorescence complementation would be reduced in cells that express a &#x003b2;3 deletion mutant (&#x003b2;3 &#x00394;724) that lacks the NPXY interaction site for the talin FERM domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wegener et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, each experiment included cells expressing &#x003b1;IIb-VC&#x003b2;3 (&#x00394;724) as a control for fluorescence unrelated to this specific talin&#x02013;&#x003b2;3 interaction.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Talin recruitment to &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 can be visualized in living cells by BiFC.</bold> (A) Principle of BiFC.

Also depicted are wild-type &#x003b2;3 and &#x003b2;3 (&#x00394;724), which were cotransfected into CHO cells with &#x003b1;IIb-VC to enable the expression of &#x003b1;IIb-VC&#x003b2;3 and &#x003b1;IIb-VC&#x003b2;3 (&#x00394;724), respectively.

See Results for further discussion. (B) Flow cytometry with antibody D57 was used to determine &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 surface expression in cells stably transfected with &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3, &#x003b1;IIb-VC&#x003b2;3, or &#x003b1;IIb-VC&#x003b2;3 (&#x00394;724). Parental CHO cells were used as a negative control. Expression of the chimeric integrins was equivalent to that of wild-type &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3. (C) Western blotting illustrates the molecular sizes of the &#x003b1;IIb and &#x003b2;3 subunits obtained from cells shown in B. (D) VN-talin complements Venus fluorescence better than talin-VC. The N-terminal half of Venus was fused to either the talin N terminus (VN-talin) or the talin C terminus (talin-VN) and transiently transfected into &#x003b1;IIb-VC&#x003b2;3 cells. BiFC was then measured by flow cytometry. The same experiment was performed in parallel with &#x003b1;IIb-VC&#x003b2;3 (&#x00394;724) cells, which lack a major talin interaction site in &#x003b2;3. Data are means &#x000b1; SEM (error bars) of three experiments. (E) &#x003b1;IIb-VC&#x003b2;3&#x02013;CHO cells and &#x003b1;IIb-VC&#x003b2;3 (&#x00394;724)&#x02013;CHO cells were cotransfected with VN-talin and Rap1a (V12). 48 h later, cells were plated on fibrinogen for 60 min, fixed, and analyzed by deconvolution microscopy. Note that in the &#x003b1;IIb-VC&#x003b2;3 cells, BiFC fluorescence (green) was colocalized with vinculin (red) to lamellipodial edges (arrow), focal complexes (arrowheads), and focal adhesions (double arrowhead). Only minor colocalization was noted in the &#x003b1;IIb-VC&#x003b2;3 (&#x00394;724) cells. Bars, 10 &#x003bc;m.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1811211f01"></graphic></fig><p>Cell lines expressing &#x003b1;IIb-VC&#x003b2;3 or &#x003b1;IIb-VC&#x003b2;3 (&#x00394;724) showed integrin surface expression profiles that were equivalent to that of a cell line expressing &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Furthermore, the &#x003b1;IIb-VC, &#x003b2;3, and &#x003b2;3 (&#x00394;724) subunits each migrated as expected in Western blots of cell lysates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). We chose VN-talin for these studies rather than placing VN at the C terminus of talin (talin-VN) because in preliminary studies, overexpression of VN-talin in &#x003b1;IIb-VC&#x003b2;3 cells consistently yielded greater fluorescence complementation than did talin-VN (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). This may be explained by the fact that in VN-talin, the split fluorophore is contiguous with the talin FERM domain rather than with the rodlike tail. The fluorescence complementation we observed between VN-talin and &#x003b1;IIb-VC&#x003b2;3 in the absence of an inside-out stimulus is likely the result of overexpression and/or stabilization of the VN/VC pair, as seen in a previous study using BiFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kerppola, 2008</xref>). To further validate the BiFC approach, cells transiently transfected with VN-talin were allowed to bind to immobilized fibrinogen, which activates &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Du et al., 1991</xref>) and promotes cell spreading. Fixed and stained &#x003b1;IIb-VC&#x003b2;3&#x02013;CHO cells were well spread, and BiFC was prominent at vinculin-rich lamellipodial edges, focal complexes, and focal adhesions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). In contrast, &#x003b1;IIb-VC&#x003b2;3 (&#x00394;724) cells spread poorly and exhibited only minor colocalization of BiFC and vinculin at focal adhesions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). No BiFC was observed if VN-talin or &#x003b1;IIb-VC&#x003b2;3 was expressed independently. These results indicate that VN-talin can interact specifically with &#x003b1;IIb-VC&#x003b2;3 and at sufficient proximity to monitor talin interaction with &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3.</p><p>Next, we asked whether inside-out signals can lead to activation of &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 by recruiting talin to the integrin. When &#x003b1;IIb-VC&#x003b2;3 cells were cotransfected with constitutively active Rap1a (V12) and VN-talin, they exhibited significant increases in BiFC and PAC-1 binding when compared with the same cells not transfected with VN-talin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). In contrast, &#x003b1;IIb-VC&#x003b2;3 (&#x00394;724) cells transfected with Rap1a (V12) and VN-talin showed lower fluorescence complementation and no increase in PAC-1 binding. VN-talin expression was similar in both cell lines (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). BiFC involving VN-talin and &#x003b1;IIb-VC&#x003b2;3 did not require the presence of an &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 ligand, such as fibrinogen or PAC-1. Thus, Rap1a induces both talin recruitment and &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 activation. To determine whether talin recruitment is necessary and sufficient for &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 activation, we tested talin FERM domain mutants (L325R and W359A) and a &#x003b2;3 cytoplasmic domain mutant (Y747A), all of which are reported to be defective in supporting &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tadokoro et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Petrich et al., 2007a</xref>). However, when cotransfected with Rap1a (V12), VN-talin (L325R) was recruited normally to &#x003b1;IIb-VC&#x003b2;3 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). In contrast, both the recruitment of VN-talin (W359A) to &#x003b1;IIb-VC&#x003b2;3 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>) and recruitment of VN-talin to &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 (Y747A; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>) were significantly impaired (P &#x0003c; 0.001). All three mutants failed to support Rap1a (V12)-mediated PAC-1 binding to &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 (P &#x0003c; 0.001) despite levels of talin expression similar to that of &#x003b1;IIb-VC&#x003b2;3 cells transfected with VN-talin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). Thus, talin recruitment appears to be necessary for &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 activation in response to an inside-out stimulus such as that imparted by activated Rap1a. However, the results with VN-talin (L325R) indicate that events subsequent to talin recruitment are also needed. Crystallographic experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wegener et al., 2007</xref>) have shown that the talin FERM domain makes contact with membrane-distal residues in the NPXY region of &#x003b2;3, a contact disrupted by the talin (W359A) substitution. In contrast, talin (L325R) disrupts interaction with the more membrane-proximal region of &#x003b2;3.

Coupled with studies in primary cells and successful reconstitution of agonist-induced inside-out &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 signaling in heterologous cells, the major conclusions are (1) &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 activation initiated through platelet PAR thrombin receptors requires the recruitment of talin to &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3, a process regulated by the Rap1 effector, RIAM; (2) RIAM is required for agonist-induced activation of &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 in primary megakaryocytes; (3) in platelets, RIAM is present in platelets within filopodia and lamellipodia, subcellular locales where integrin activation would be expected to take place; and (4) lamellipodin can promote talin recruitment and &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 activation in CHO cells; however, unlike RIAM, it may not function downstream of Rap1 and is not detectable in megakaryocytes or platelets. Given the central role of &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 activation in platelet function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shattil and Newman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jackson, 2007</xref>), these findings have implications for hemostasis or thrombosis.</p><p>Signal transduction from PARs or other agonist receptors to &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 involves a network of protein&#x02013;protein interactions and posttranslational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brass, 2004</xref>). The inherent complexity of mammalian signaling networks need not preclude eventual identification of all essential elements. Global analyses of the platelet transcriptome and proteome are contributing toward this goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garcia et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maguire et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gnatenko et al., 2006</xref>), but formal characterization of candidate proteins will require additional strategies. Our approach here was to attempt to fully reconstitute and analyze a thrombin-induced &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 activation pathway in CHO cells and characterize proteins within this pathway in platelets and megakaryocytes. The starting point for this study was the observation that transient overexpression of full-length mouse talin in &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3-CHO cells is sufficient to induce &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 activation in response to overexpression of activated Rap1a or RIAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Han et al., 2006</xref>). However, CHO cells are inherently unresponsive to thrombin or other platelet agonists, leaving the role of RIAM in agonist-induced &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 activation unclear.</p><p>This issue was resolved here by coexpressing talin in &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3-CHO cells with either human PAR1 or murine PAR4, the dominant platelet PARs in these species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kahn et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sambrano et al., 2001</xref>). In some experiments, PAR1 and talin were expressed in a tetracycline-regulatable fashion to gain better control of overexpression levels and to limit prolonged contact of the PARs with thrombin or other proteases in serum to avoid desensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoxie et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kahn et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kuliopulos et al., 1999</xref>). Under these conditions, thrombin or highly specific agonist peptides for PAR1 or PAR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vu et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Faruqi et al., 2000</xref>) stimulated &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 activation, as measured by binding of the ligand-mimetic antibody, PAC-1, the antibody generally used to study &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 affinity modulation in human platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Michelson, 2006</xref>). Using shRNA to partially knock down specific proteins, RIAM was identified as a necessary distal element of the thrombin-mediated and talin-driven &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 activation machinery both in the CHO model system and megakaryocytes. Thus, it should now be possible to identify and order other essential PAR pathway components, some of which may be Rap1 dependent and others Rap1 independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coughlin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brass, 2004</xref>). PARs in platelets also signal to activate the integrin &#x003b1;2&#x003b2;1 collagen receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jung and Moroi, 2001</xref>).

Because talin normally resides in the cytoplasm of unstimulated platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bertagnolli et al., 1993</xref>), agonist stimulation is thought to induce posttranslational and conformational modifications within talin to expose integrin-binding sites, resulting in talin recruitment to integrin cytoplasmic domains and inside-out integrin activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Calderwood, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Critchley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ginsberg et al., 2005</xref>). We propose that it is RIAM that mediates talin recruitment to &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 in platelets. First, when Rap1a (V12), RIAM, and talin are overexpressed in CHO cells, RIAM coimmunoprecipitates and colocalizes with talin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Han et al., 2006</xref>). Second, RIAM coimmunoprecipitates with talin after human platelets are stimulated by a PAR1 agonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Han et al., 2006</xref>). Third, Rap1a (V12) and RIAM promoted talin recruitment to &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 in living cells, as demonstrated here by BiFC (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Fourth, there was tight linkage between talin recruitment and &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 activation, and mutants in either talin or &#x003b2;3 that abrogate their mutual interaction blocked both responses (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Finally, RIAM was strategically localized in platelets for a role in &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 activation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>), and RIAM knockdown inhibited agonist-induced &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 activation in megakaryocytes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 D</xref>).</p><p>In fibroblasts, lamellipodin regulates lamellipodia formation and protrusion velocity through interactions with Ena/VASP and other effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krause et al., 2004</xref>).

Although this makes BiFC unsuitable for assessing dynamic changes in protein interactions, any secondary stabilization of the talin&#x02013;&#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 interaction may have proved useful in our case by also stabilizing the high-affinity state of &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 and, thus, its detection with PAC-1. Recently, FRET was used to cleverly monitor the activation state of &#x003b2;1 integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Parsons et al., 2008</xref>). There, the &#x003b2;1 subunit was tagged with GFP, and the isolated talin rod domain was tagged with mRFP. Addition of &#x003b2;1 extracellular ligands induced the association of &#x003b2;1 integrin with the talin rod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Parsons et al., 2008</xref>), which is consistent with previous observations that the binding of adhesive ligands activates integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Du et al., 1991</xref>). Interestingly, interaction of the isolated talin head domain with &#x003b2;1 integrin could not be demonstrated by FRET, possibly because of fluorophore orientation. Although inside-out integrin signaling was not evaluated in the FRET study, it is apparent that FRET and BiFC will provide powerful complementary approaches to study integrin signaling and, in particular, to characterize newly identified effectors of integrin function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moser et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Identification of a functional RIAM&#x02013;talin&#x02013;integrin axis in platelets may provide new insights into clinical disorders of hemostasis or thrombosis.

On the other hand, excessive or inappropriate &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 activation may complicate atherothrombosis and other diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ruggeri, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Michiels et al., 2006</xref>). Current oral antiplatelet agents, such as aspirin and ADP receptor antagonists, are only partially effective in reducing arterial thrombosis in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhatt and Topol, 2003</xref>). Thus, there is an unmet need for more effective, long-term platelet function blockade, and oral &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 antagonists have not proven useful in this regard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhatt and Topol, 2003</xref>). Accordingly, RIAM and talin, by virtue of their central roles in a final common pathway of inside-out &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 activation, provide potential targets for new antithrombotic drugs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Reagents and plasmid vectors</title><p>Agonist peptides specific for human PAR1 (SFLLRN; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vu et al., 1991</xref>) and murine PAR4 (AYPGKF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Faruqi et al., 2000</xref>) were synthesized and purified by the Scripps Center for Protein Sciences.

For tetracycline-inducible expression of PAR1 and/or talin, cells were incubated with doxycycline (Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 h. PAC-1 binding and &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 surface expression were determined by incubating cells with 0.4% PAC-1 ascites or 0.25% antibody D57, respectively, for 10 min at room temperature. To study agonist-induced &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 activation in CHO cells expressing PAR1, the cells were incubated in duplicate or triplicate with PAR1 agonist peptide SFLLRN during the PAC-1 incubation phase. After washing the cells, AlexaFluor647-conjugated anti&#x02013;mouse IgM (for PAC-1) or anti&#x02013;mouse IgG (for D57) was added for 20 min at 4&#x000b0;C, and antibody binding to living (propidium iodide negative) cells was determined by flow cytometry using a dual-laser FACSCalibur and Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">O'Toole et al., 1994</xref>). Cells transiently transfected with expression plasmids or transduced with shRNAs were typically identified and gated in the flow cytometer by their GFP or td-Tomato fluorescence.

The N-terminal half of Venus (VN) was amplified to place appropriate restriction sites, and the PCR product was inserted in-frame into the 5&#x02032; end of talin cDNA in pcDNA3.1 to form VN-talin. For inducible expression, VN-talin was subcloned into pcDNA4/TO. cDNAs encoding wild-type &#x003b2;3 and &#x003b2;3 (&#x00394;724) were cloned into pcDNA3.1. VN-talin mutants (L325R and W359A) and the &#x003b2;3 (Y747A) mutant were created from wild-type cDNAs by mutagenesis (QuikChange Mutagenesis kit; QIAGEN). All coding sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing.

Clones stably expressing the recombinant integrin were obtained by single-cell FACS sorting using anti-&#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 antibody D57.
