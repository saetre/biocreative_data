However, experimental validation of the performance of these methods at the genome scale has remained elusive. Here we assess the global performance of four existing classes of inference algorithms using 445 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content> Affymetrix arrays and 3,216 known <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> regulatory interactions from RegulonDB. We also developed and applied the context likelihood of relatedness (CLR) algorithm, a novel extension of the relevance networks class of algorithms. CLR demonstrates an average precision gain of 36&#x00025; relative to the next-best performing algorithm. At a 60&#x00025; true positive rate, CLR identifies 1,079 regulatory interactions, of which 338 were in the previously known network and 741 were novel predictions. We tested the predicted interactions for three transcription factors with chromatin immunoprecipitation, confirming 21 novel interactions and verifying our RegulonDB-based performance estimates. CLR also identified a regulatory link providing central metabolic control of iron transport, which we confirmed with real-time quantitative PCR. The compendium of expression data compiled in this study, coupled with RegulonDB, provides a valuable model system for further improvement of network inference algorithms using experimental data.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Organisms can adapt to changing environments&#x02014;becoming more virulent, for example, or activating stress responses&#x02014;thanks to a flexible gene expression program controlled by the dynamic interactions of hundreds of transcriptional regulators. To unravel this regulatory complexity, multiple computational algorithms have been developed to analyze gene expression profiles and detect dependencies among genes over different conditions. It has been difficult to judge whether these algorithms can generate accurate global maps of regulatory interactions, however, because of the absence of a model organism with both a compendium of gene expression data and a corresponding network of experimentally determined regulatory interactions. To address this issue, we assembled 445 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content> microarrays, applied four classes of inference algorithms to the dataset, and validated the predictions against 3,216 experimentally determined <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> interactions. The top-performing algorithm identifies 1,079 regulatory interactions at a confidence level of 60&#x00025; or higher. Of these predicted interactions, 741 are novel and illuminate the regulation of amino acid biosynthesis, flagella biosynthesis, osmotic stress response, antibiotic resistance, and iron regulation. By defining the capabilities and limitations of network inference algorithms for large-scale mapping of prokaryotic regulatory networks, our work should facilitate their application to the mapping of novel microbes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>A novel, machine-learning method is developed to predict transcriptional regulatory interactions, making use of microarray data.

Further progress in the understanding of an organism's biology requires development and refinement of techniques to determine the dynamic interactions among an organism's molecular parts &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050008-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. A major difficulty of this task is the context-specific nature of gene regulation. The total space of possible transcriptional regulatory interactions for an organism is the number of transcription factors multiplied by the number of genes multiplied by the number of environmental contexts in which the cell might find itself. Methods to identify regulatory interactions must efficiently determine the thousands of true regulatory interactions out of the billions of possible ones.</p><p>Pioneering efforts to identify regulatory interactions on a genome scale have used machine-learning algorithms to identify <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory motifs or transcription factor target genes using a large set of expression arrays &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050008-b002">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050008-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;, genome-wide location analysis chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-Chip) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050008-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050008-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;, or a combination of these and other high-throughput methods &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050008-b021">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050008-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. In general, the precision of these methods has been evaluated by testing for functional enrichment of co-regulated genes, experimental confirmation of a few selected regulatory relationships, or cross-validation within the training dataset. However, experimental validation of the precision of these methods at the genome scale has remained elusive due to the lack of a model organism with both a known regulatory structure and compatible experimental data. Therefore, the relative merits and broader utility of these approaches remain difficult to judge.</p><p>Here we demonstrate an unsupervised network inference method, context likelihood of relatedness (CLR), which uses transcriptional profiles of an organism across a diverse set of conditions to systematically determine transcriptional regulatory interactions. We take advantage of the extensive knowledge of transcriptional regulation in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content> to assess the performance of the CLR algorithm and several other algorithms on a genome scale. In <italic>E. coli,</italic> a set of 3,216 experimentally confirmed regulatory interactions among 1,211 genes have been curated in the RegulonDB database &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050008-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;, which can be used for performance assessment.</p><p>We assembled a compendium of 445 new and previously published <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> Affymetrix Antisense2 microarray expression profiles collected under various conditions including pH changes, growth phases, antibiotics, heat shock, different media, varying oxygen concentrations, and numerous genetic perturbations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050008-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050008-t001">Table 1</xref>). This compendium, combined with the knowledge in RegulonDB, allowed us to assess the genome-scale performance of the CLR algorithm and multiple other unsupervised network inference algorithms applied to experimental data. The compendium and algorithms are available on the Many Microbe Microarrays database (M<sup>3D</sup>) Web site (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://m3d.bu.edu/">http://m3d.bu.edu/</ext-link>). We included several versions of relevance networks (the foundation for the CLR algorithm) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050008-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050008-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;, ARACNe &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050008-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;, Bayesian networks &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050008-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;, and regression networks in this algorithm comparison. CLR, the top-performing inference method, predicted 1,079 regulatory interactions at a 60&#x00025; true positive rate. Sequence analysis of the promoters of the inferred gene targets yielded many known and novel promoter motifs. We also tested, via ChIP, more than 250 of the interactions inferred for three transcription factors at all confidence levels to verify the algorithm precision estimates based on RegulonDB and to confirm 21 of the novel predictions. In addition, an analysis of the CLR inferred network led to the discovery of an unexpected regulatory link between central metabolism and the regulation of iron import into the cell, which we confirmed with real-time quantitative PCR.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The CLR Algorithm</title><p>The CLR algorithm is an extension of the relevance networks approach &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050008-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050008-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d; for identifying transcriptional regulatory interactions. Although the relevance networks algorithm was written primarily for clustering, its authors also suggest its utility for identifying regulatory networks &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050008-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;. The original relevance networks method used mutual information for scoring the similarity between the expression levels of two genes in a set of microarrays. A gene and a transcription factor are predicted to interact if the mutual information between the expression levels of the gene and its potential regulator is above some set threshold. Like correlation, mutual information is a metric that detects statistical dependence between two variables. But unlike correlation, it does not assume linearity, continuity, or other specific properties of the dependence &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050008-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050008-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. As such, mutual information possesses the flexibility to detect regulatory interactions that might be missed by linear measures such as the correlation coefficient.</p><p>In the relevance networks algorithm, there are tradeoffs between true positive and false positive rates in choosing a threshold for the identification of significant regulatory interactions. A high threshold results in a smaller network with fewer false positives, but it also eliminates potential novel interactions. Conversely, a low threshold will often capture false positive interactions due to a number of factors, including background correlation and misinterpretation of indirect dependence as direct interaction.</p><p>The CLR algorithm builds upon the relevance network but applies an adaptive background correction step to eliminate false correlations and indirect influences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050008-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). After computing the mutual information between regulators and their potential target genes, CLR calculates the statistical likelihood of each mutual information value within its network context. The algorithm compares the mutual information between a transcription factor/gene pair to the &#x0201c;background&#x0201d; distribution of mutual information scores for all possible transcription factor/gene pairs that include either the transcription factor or its target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050008-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). The most probable interactions are those whose mutual information scores stand significantly above the background distribution of mutual information scores. This step removes many of the false correlations in the network by eliminating &#x0201c;promiscuous&#x0201d; cases, where one transcription factor weakly co-varies with a large numbers of genes, or one gene weakly co-varies with many transcription factors. Such promiscuity arises when the assayed conditions are inadequately or unevenly sampled, thus failing to distinguish direct interactions from indirect influences, or when microarray normalization fails to remove false background correlations due to inter-lab variations in methodology.</p><p>We applied CLR to the 4,345 genes on the <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> Antisense2 microarray using the 445 profiles in the compendium to identify the gene targets of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> transcription factors. For comparison, we ran several variants of commonly used network inference algorithms on the compendium data; the top-performing variant of each algorithm is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050008-g002">Figure 2</xref> (a detailed comparison of each algorithm and the tested variants is available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050008-sd001">Protocol S1</xref>). As a point of reference on algorithm performance, we also show the performance attained by randomly guessing interaction scores from a uniform distribution. Interactions for all algorithms were only allowed from 328 known or predicted transcription factors to any of the 4,345 genes, enabling clear biological interpretation, assignment of direction (from transcription factors to non&#x02013;transcription factor genes), and validation of the predictions. Interactions were also identified between transcription factors, but direction was not assigned.</p><p>To score our results, we compared our predicted interactions with the set of 3,216 interactions in the RegulonDB database &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050008-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. We computed two measures: recall, which is the fraction of the 3,216 known <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> interactions that CLR successfully identified; and precision, which is the fraction of identified interactions that are true positives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050008-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). RegulonDB contains regulatory information for about one-fourth of the genes in the <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> genome and about one-half of the transcription factors. Thus, it is large enough to make sound estimates of algorithm performance at the genome scale. Yet, we caution that the accuracy of our performance estimates may be biased by the incomplete nature of this dataset. We also verified the accuracy of these performance estimates by performing ChIP experiments on a large number of interactions, inferred by CLR, that are not present in RegulonDB.</p><p>CLR outperforms all other algorithms run on the compendium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050008-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). With 60&#x00025; precision (CLR threshold <italic>z</italic>-score &#x0003d; 5.78), CLR recovers a total of 1,079 regulatory interactions&#x02014;338 of these among genes included in RegulonDB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050008-g003">Figure 3</xref>, blue and green edges) and 741 novel interactions not present in RegulonDB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050008-g003">Figure 3</xref>, red edges). In addition, the targets of many transcription factors in this network are significantly enriched for one or more biological functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050008-g004">Figure 4</xref>), and the enriched biological functions reflect the conditions sampled in the microarray compendium. CLR also scores 426 of the 1,079 interactions at a higher confidence of 80&#x00025;. All 426 interactions identified at 80&#x00025; precision (CLR threshold <italic>z</italic>-score &#x0003d; 6.92) are illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050008-sg001">Figure S1</xref>. All identified interactions are available on the M<sup>3D</sup> Web site (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://m3d.bu.edu">http://m3d.bu.edu</ext-link>) as a graphical map and as tab-delimited text files.</p><p>Although we identified hundreds of known regulatory interactions correctly at high precision, this represents only a fraction of known interactions in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content>. The recall of the algorithm depends on several factors, including the number and diversity of expression profiles. As discussed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050008-sd001">Protocol S1</xref>, the CLR algorithm can achieve maximum recall and precision using as few as 60 expression profiles selected for maximum diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050008-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Large environmental perturbations are the most common conditions amongst these 60 profiles, suggesting environmental perturbations are generally more informative than genetic perturbations for network inference, in agreement with earlier studies (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050008-sd001">Protocol S1</xref> for details) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050008-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. The remainder of the profiles in the compendium contribute mainly redundant information about gene expression responses and regulatory interactions. Thus, the recall achieved by the CLR algorithm appears to be limited largely by the low phenotypic diversity of the dataset. This conclusion is supported by a more detailed analysis of the recovered interactions. For transcription factors with at least two predicted targets, the mean recall per transcription factor is 47&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050008-sg002">Figure S2</xref>), supporting the idea that when a transcription factor and its targets are adequately perturbed in the dataset, high recall is obtained. For example, when minimal media conditions are included in the compendium, nearly all targets of Lrp are identified (Lrp is a regulator of multiple biosynthetic operons). But when those conditions are removed, the algorithm fails to identify any Lrp targets (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050008-sd001">Protocol S1</xref> for details).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Discovery of Novel Regulatory Pathways</title><p>We used the regulatory network predicted by CLR to explore and validate newly inferred regulatory interactions. We confirmed the algorithm's performance using two additional approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050008-g001">Figure 1</xref>). First, we applied the tools of sequence analysis to discover new regulatory motifs in the promoters of the regulated genes. Second, we performed ChIP experiments to verify many of the novel interactions identified by the algorithm.</p><sec id="s2b1"><title>Further validation of CLR by sequence analysis of regulatory motifs.</title><p>Using the set of gene targets predicted for each transcription factor, we applied sequence analysis algorithms to infer the sequence motif bound by each regulator. Not all transcription factors have enough targets to allow reliable motif detection, but for those that do, the motif provides a specific location for the regulatory interaction. A significant sequence motif for a group of genes provides an additional level of validation, as it is unlikely that the group of genes would share a common motif but not a common transcription factor regulator. To detect sequence motifs, we selected all transcription factors predicted to regulate five or more operons with at least a 60&#x00025; confidence (61 total). For each group of operons regulated by the same transcription factor, we analyzed approximately 150 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site with the MEME multiple alignment system &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050008-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>LexA, a major regulator of DNA repair, is known to have a single well-conserved DNA-binding motif. It is one of the best-perturbed regulators in the microarray compendium due to the compendium's emphasis on DNA-damaging conditions. Consequently, the LexA protein has a large set of correctly predicted targets and exhibits a highly significant motif almost identical to the known canonical LexA motif (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050008-sg003">Figure S3</xref>A). Five out of eight promoters containing the LexA motif in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050008-sg003">Figure S3</xref>A are known LexA targets according to RegulonDB. The other three promoters for <italic>dinI, dinP,</italic> and <italic>yebG</italic> are confirmed LexA targets &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050008-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d; but are not catalogued in RegulonDB.</p><p><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050008-sg003">Figures S3</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050008-sg003">S3</xref>D illustrate this approach applied to two putative regulators, YmfN and YnaE. YmfN is a putative DNA-binding protein homologous to a phage terminase. We found a strong motif (<italic>p</italic> value &#x02248; 0.0061) in all six of the operons inferred for this transcription factor by CLR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050008-sg003">Figure S3</xref>D). The gene <italic>ymfN</italic> attains its highest levels of expression in our compendium upon exposure to norfloxacin, a DNA-damaging bactericidal agent, and its inferred targets show enrichment in prophage and DNA repair categories (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050008-st001">Table S1</xref>).</p><p>YnaE (Rac prophage) is another putative DNA-binding protein. The latest computational annotation for YnaE available in EcoCyc (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ecocyc.org/">http://ecocyc.org/</ext-link>) suggests that its function is also phage-related &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050008-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. There is enrichment for cold-shock response proteins in the predicted YnaE regulon (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050008-st002">Table S2</xref>). Also present are rhsE, a stationary-phase survival-related protein, and b1374, a putative transposon resolvase. In the compendium, <italic>ynaE</italic> was highly expressed when Lon protease or YoeB toxin was genetically up-regulated, and when either norfloxacin antibiotic or mussel defensin protein was present. Based on our analysis, YnaE may control a small, specialized stress response network in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content>.</p><p>Overall, we were able to detect a significant (one-tailed <italic>p</italic> value &#x0003c; 0.05) binding motif for 28 out of the 61 transcription factors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050008-st003">Table S3</xref>). Of these regulators, 13 had a known motif in PRODORIC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://prodoric.tu-bs.de/">http://prodoric.tu-bs.de/</ext-link>). We compared the predicted motifs for the 13 regulators to all known <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> motifs. For seven of the 13 MEME-predicted motifs (54&#x00025;), we identified the known motif in the top ten best matches (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050008-st003">Table S3</xref>). Some correctly reconstructed regulators made a relatively poor match to their correct motif. In the majority of these six cases, including Lrp (rank &#x0003d; 15) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050008-sg003">Figure S3</xref>B), this was due to the presence of combinatorial or conditional regulation. For Lrp, two motifs in the database (&#x000b1; leucine) were incorrectly collapsed into one by motif analysis. In other cases, a gene was regulated by multiple transcription factors, and the MEME motif analysis picks up the stronger motif in the sequence, which may not be the motif of the transcription factor we are looking for. This ambiguity in cases of combinatorial regulation is a limitation of motif analysis, because it only looks for statistical enrichment of regions of sequence and does not consider the actual binding properties of the transcription factor.</p></sec><sec id="s2b2"><title>In vivo confirmation of new regulatory interactions.</title><p>We performed ChIP with quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) to obtain physical confirmation for many of the regulatory interactions inferred by CLR and to verify that performance estimates based on the known subset of interactions in RegulonDB extrapolate beyond this subset. In particular, we studied three transcription factors (Lrp, PdhR, and FecI) with substantial connectivity in the network mapped by CLR. For each transcription factor, 26&#x02013;35 operons with at least one inferred interaction were tested by ChIP-qPCR for a total of 93 tested operons (244 genes). We tested 24 known regulatory interactions as a positive control to verify that known interactions were detectable by ChIP for a total of 268 tested interactions.</p><p>Network inference results are typically verified for a few hand-picked samples that are studied in detail. Thus, the biological intuition of the experimenter may play a role in the success of a hand-picked verification. RegulonDB provides a way to overcome this problem in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content>. Because we have no control over the interactions present in RegulonDB, our algorithm performance estimates are unbiased by our selective validation. Likewise, when performing ChIP validation experiments, we wanted to be as unbiased as possible. Although choosing the three transcription factors is a form of hand-picking, the targets tested for those transcription factors were selected in a systematic way, by choosing approximately 30 of the highest-scoring targets of each of the three transcription factors. Choosing this many targets results in many interactions with confidence levels below 20&#x00025; in our ChIP-qPCR experiments, allowing us to verify that our confidence estimates are reliable across the entire range of precision.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050008-g005">Figure 5</xref> shows the global, RegulonDB-based precision scores assigned to the ChIP-tested interactions versus the transcription factor&#x02013;specific precision estimated with RegulonDB plus ChIP, including many interactions for genes not present in RegulonDB. The global precision estimate based on RegulonDB corresponds very well to the local precision estimate based on RegulonDB plus ChIP. Only the two extreme cases of greater than 80&#x00025; precision and greater than 0&#x00025; precision deviate from the expected values. The greater than 0&#x00025; precision interactions yield an inflated ChIP precision, because our choosing of the highest-scoring targets for validation causes this category to be undersampled. Likewise, the greater than 80&#x00025; precision has only two samples, because interactions of this significance are rare in the dataset, making the ChIP estimate unreliable for this threshold.

Excess iron can be toxic to cells; iron uptake must therefore be carefully dictated by the need for cellular iron.</p><p><italic>fecABCDE</italic> is an operon that encodes a ferric citrate transporter and plays a central role in the import of cellular iron. Existing literature described only two regulators of <italic>fecABCDE</italic>&#x02014;FecI and Fur. The Fur regulation is not apparent in the compendium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050008-g006">Figure 6</xref>A), while the FecI regulation is clear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050008-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). However, the bifurcation of the plot suggests a more complex combinatorial regulation for <italic>fecABCDE</italic>. The CLR algorithm identified PdhR, a pyruvate-sensing repressor and necessary component of the energy transduction cascade, as a possible additional regulator of the <italic>fecA</italic> operon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050008-g006">Figure 6</xref>C).

Moreover, in undefined, rich media (Luria-Bertani &#x0005b;LB&#x0005d; with 0.2&#x00025; glucose), our ChIP results showed a significant enrichment for PdhR-<italic>fecA</italic> binding when judged by a <italic>t</italic>-test (<italic>p</italic> value &#x0003d; 0.004) and a modest enrichment using a nonparametric rank-sum test (<italic>p</italic> value &#x0003d; 0.1).</p><p>Inspection of the compendium data suggested that FecI and PdhR might regulate the <italic>fecA</italic> operon using AND-like logic, where both proteins must be activated for expression of the <italic>fecA</italic> operon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050008-g006">Figure 6</xref>F). Because PdhR is a repressor that is derepressed upon binding with pyruvate, the gate is NOT (bound PdhR) AND (bound FecI) at the promoter level; self-feedback at the <italic>pdhR</italic> promoter makes the gate appear as <italic>(pdhR)</italic> AND <italic>(fecI)</italic> at the level of mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050008-g006">Figure 6</xref>F).

The <italic>fecA</italic> operon reached its highest levels of induction only when citrate and pyruvate were both present in high concentrations, supporting the hypothesis that full activation of <italic>fecA</italic> is only possible in the presence of derepressed PdhR and activated FecI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050008-g006">Figure 6</xref>H).</p><p>Such an explicit regulatory link between central metabolism and iron transport has not, to our knowledge, been previously identified in microbes. This link is perhaps not surprising, given that iron is a critical component of several proteins involved in both the tricarboxylic acid cycle (aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase) and electron transport (cytochromes and ferredoxin); the magnitude of carbon/electron flux through the citric acid cycle and electron transport chain thus plays a major role in determining the cellular need for iron. It is possible that an increase in intracellular pyruvate, which is the inducer for PdhR, may signal the need for increased flow through respiratory pathways. This novel role for pyruvate is plausible given that pyruvate serves as a common catabolite for a diverse collection of carbon sources and stands just one enzymatic step away from entering the tricarboxylic acid cycle itself.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>A Platform for Mapping Transcriptional Regulation</title><p>This work rigorously assesses the genome-scale performance of multiple network inference algorithms using an experimental compendium of 445 expression profiles and a &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; of known regulatory interactions.

Our new algorithm, CLR, increases the contrast between the physical interactions and the indirect relationships by taking the network context of each relationship into account. CLR uses the local network context to compute a significance estimate for any statistical metric of similarity between gene expression profiles. We have shown that CLR performs best with mutual information but also performs well with Pearson correlation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050008-sd001">Protocol S1</xref>).</p><p>Like relevance networks and ARACNe, CLR uses the matrix of mutual information values between all probe sets on the Affymetrix array. The CLR algorithm estimates a likelihood of the mutual information (MI) score for a particular pair of genes, <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic>, by comparing the MI value for that pair of genes to a background distribution of MI values (the null model). The background distribution is constructed from two sets of MI values: &#x0007b;MI<italic><sub>i</sub></italic>&#x0007d;, the set of all the mutual information values for gene <italic>i</italic> (in row or column <italic>i</italic>), and &#x0007b;MI<italic><sub>j</sub></italic>&#x0007d;, the set of all the mutual information values for gene <italic>j</italic> (in row or column <italic>j</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050008-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Because of the sparsity of biological regulatory networks, most MI scores in each row of the mutual matrix represent random background MI (e.g., due to indirect network relationships). We approximate this background MI as a joint normal distribution with MI<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> and MI<italic><sub>j</sub></italic> as independent variables, which provides a reasonable approximation to the empirical distribution of mutual information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050008-sg004">Figure S4</xref>). Thus, the final form of our likelihood estimate becomes <inline-formula id="pbio-0050008-ex001"><inline-graphic xlink:href="pbio.0050008.ex001.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> , where <italic>Z<sub>i</sub></italic> and <italic>Z<sub>j</sub></italic> are the <italic>z</italic>-scores of MI<italic><sub>ij</sub></italic> from the marginal distributions, and f(<italic>Z<sub>i</sub></italic>,<italic>Z<sub>i</sub></italic>) is the joint likelihood measure. We experimented with other approximations of the background MI distribution, including the generalized extreme-value distribution, the Rayleigh distribution, and the Gaussian kernel density estimator (empirical), always achieving similar results and sacrificing speed of execution for the more expensive distribution fits. </p><p>Our method of estimating the likelihood of mutual information differs from the conventional ways of estimating significance. For example, both the analytical Roulston metric of significance &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050008-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d; and shuffling &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050008-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d; calculate the statistical significance given a random model of the interaction in question (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050008-sd001">Protocol S1</xref>). In contrast, CLR calculates the likelihood of mutual information given the observed network context, which consists of the background distribution formed by the mutual information for all possible incoming and outgoing edges for one gene in the network.</p></sec><sec id="s3m"><title>Bayesian networks and linear regression networks.</title><p>Unlike the pairwise algorithms described above, Bayesian networks exhaustively or heuristically search through the multivariate space of possible graphs (i.e., regulatory networks), scoring each, and keeping either the best-scoring network or a network constructed by averaging over all the searched graphs and weighting them by their score. This multivariate approach comes at a computational cost. None of the publicly available Bayesian network learning software that we tried were designed to infer a network of the size we attempted with this study, nor would they run to completion. Those that did not crash due to memory problems were unable to generate a network after several weeks of computational time.</p><p>For computational tractability, we wrote a Bayesian network algorithm that implemented a series of constraints. Every gene was restricted to having at most two regulators, and interactions were only allowed between transcription factors and genes. We tested several scoring functions for the algorithm: discrete (two-state, genes are OFF or ON), linear, logistic, polynomial approximation, and hill function. Scores for the linear function were estimated with linear least-squares fitting. Scores for nonlinear functions were estimated with nonlinear least-squares fitting using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. All scores were adjusted for the number of parameters using Bayesian information criterion. Of the tested scoring methods, the linear function offered the best balance between speed and quality of reconstruction.</p><p>We used a model averaging procedure to score the likelihood of each edge in the regulatory network. Transcription factor/gene interactions were exhaustively scored as follows. For a particular gene <italic>A</italic><sub>i</sub> in a regulatory network allowing only one regulator per gene, the likelihood of being regulated by a given transcription factor <italic>B</italic><sub>j</sub> was calculated as <inline-formula id="pbio-0050008-ex002"><inline-graphic xlink:href="pbio.0050008.ex002.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> where <italic>k</italic> is indexed over all identified transcription factors. This function was generalized to the case of two transcription factors per gene to account for the scoring of the same transcription factor/gene interactions in multiple network models. </p><p>Transcription factor/transcription factor interactions were initially scored using a different approach. We sampled directed acyclic graphs of the transcription factor only network using Metropolis Coupled Markov Chain Monte Carlo. We then applied the averaging approach above for the sampled networks. However, we found that in practice, both the speed and precision of the algorithm improved if the transcription factors were scored in the same way as for transcription factor/gene interactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050008-sd001">Protocol S1</xref>).

Of the interactions, 2&#x00025; could not be matched to probe sets on the expression array or had only self-regulation. We removed these interactions from the reference set. In addition, several genes thought to be <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> regulators were present in our reference set but were not known to regulate anything within it. Therefore, we also removed these genes from all inferred networks when estimating the algorithm's performance, leaving 3,216 non-self interactions among 1,211 genes as the reference network. We also obtained a list of 328 putative and known transcription factors from RegulonDB.</p></sec><sec id="s3o"><title>Measurement of algorithm performance.</title><p>To evaluate the performance of all algorithms, we constrained the resulting network maps to include only the genes available in our RegulonDB control set. We computed the precision and recall of the inferred networks by comparing the inferred network to the reference network. Precision is the fraction of predicted interactions that are correct &#x0005b;<italic>TP</italic>/(<italic>TP</italic> &#x0002b; <italic>FP</italic>)&#x0005d;, and recall is the fraction of all known interactions that are discovered by the algorithm &#x0005b;<italic>TP</italic>/(<italic>TP</italic> &#x0002b; <italic>FN</italic>)&#x0005d;, where <italic>TP</italic> is the number of true positives, <italic>FP</italic> is the number of false positives, and <italic>FN</italic> is the number of false negatives. Precision and recall were computed over a range of pruning thresholds; interactions with scores below the pruning threshold were removed from the inferred network. Both precision and recall are reported as percentages.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s4"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio-0050008-sg001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>The Transcriptional Regulatory Map Inferred by CLR with an Estimated 80&#x00025; Precision</title><p>The precision of the network is obtained by measuring the percentage of correctly inferred edges (blue lines) out of all the predicted edges for genes with known connectivity (blue lines and green lines).
