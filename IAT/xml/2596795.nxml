This organism possesses many advantages including ease of experimentation, optical clarity, drug administration, amenability to <italic>in vivo </italic>manipulation and feasibility of reverse and forward genetic approaches. The fish reach sexual maturity in only 3 to 4 months, and adult females are capable of producing 100 to 200 eggs weekly. Many thousands of animals can be kept in a fish facility requiring much less space than mice or other mammals, and hence the zebrafish is regarded as a cost-effective experimental vertebrate model for large-scale genetic screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Furthermore, the high degree of homology between the zebrafish genome and that of humans makes such discoveries especially pertinent to human disease and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Morpholino antisense oligonucleotides (MO) have been widely used to inhibit gene function in zebrafish embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and are usually used as sequence-specific translation-blocking or splicing-blocking agents. Recently, a quantitative assessment of the knockdown efficiency of morpholinos has been performed in zebrafish embryos and its effectiveness proved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, microinjection of DNA constructs into single-cell fertilized zebrafish embryos has also proven successful in the generation of transgenic zebrafish. The widespread use of fluorescent proteins in mammalian systems has been successfully adapted for use in zebrafish, which are well-suited to the use of fluorescence because of their optical clarity and external development. By linking a fluorescent protein such as enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) or <italic>Discosoma sp</italic>. red fluorescent protein (DsRed) to a gene or promoter of interest, expression can be easily visualized in living animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The dual luciferase assay has been widely used in cell lines to determine rapidly and accurately the activity of a given promoter. Although this strategy has been very useful, it does not allow analysis of the promoter and gene function in the context of the whole organism. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a protocol based on the dual luciferase system in zebrafish embryos. We illustrate the usefulness of this system for studying the promoter of telomerase, a key enzyme in the fields of cancer, stem cells and aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and a NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent promoter, a master regulator of the immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The luciferase reporter DNA plasmids were injected into zebrafish embryos at the one-cell developmental stage, together with MO or the expression constructs of interest, and the luciferase activity was determined in the time frame of MO activity (24&#x02013;48 h later). In addition, the flexibility of this assay is also illustrated by activation of the NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent promoters by simultaneous microinjection of different pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs).</p><p>The protocol presented here provides details of how to apply the dual-luciferase assay to determining the activity of constitutive and inducible promoters in zebrafish embryos. This approach involves three steps: (1) cloning the promoter of interest in the firefly luciferase reporter construct, (2) microinjecting the embryos with this construct together with the appropriate <italic>Renilla </italic>luciferase reporter and (3) measuring the promoter activity with the dual luciferase system in whole embryo extracts.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The protocol presented here should result in very sensitive and accurate measurement of promoter activity and analysis of gene function in the context of the whole organism, which represents an important advantage over traditional measurement in cell lines. We first illustrated the usefulness of our protocol to analyze the promoter activity of zebrafish telomerase-reverse transcriptase (zfTERT) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). At 24 h post-injection (hpi), the 3 Kb fragment upstream of the zfTERT coding sequence was able to drive the expression of the firefly luciferase reporter while the 1 Kb fragment failed to significantly increased the basal expression. Therefore, the relative promoter activity of each fragment could be quantitatively determined.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Analysis of zfTERT promoter activity in whole zebrafish embryos</bold>. Zebrafish one to eight-cell embryos were microinjected with plessEGFPLuc, zfpTERT(1 Kb)-EGFPLuc or zfpTERT(3 Kb)-EGFPLuc and the pRL-CMV (10:1) reporter vectors. Twenty-four hours after microinjection, the firefly and Renilla luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System. The results are expressed as the mean &#x000b1; S.E. of normalized luciferase activity relative to plessEGFPLuc injected embryos. *p &#x0003c; 0.05 vs. plessEGFPLuc. <sup>&#x02020;</sup>p &#x0003c; 0.05 vs. zfpTERT(1 Kb)-EGFPLuc.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1472-6750-8-81-1"/></fig><p>The critical step in the protocol presented here is the correct choice of the promoter used for normalization. The cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early promoter is a strong promoter used for both the <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>expression of proteins in signal transduction and gene therapy studies. However, CMV activity is induced by external stimuli such as endotoxin from Gram-negative bacteria (lipopolysaccharide, LPS), cytokines and phorbol esters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Therefore, for the study of NF-&#x003ba;B activation, we first have studied the effects of bacterial LPS and DNA in the expression of several <italic>Renilla </italic>luciferase reporter constructs. Among the four candidates tested, the CMV promoter was strongly induced by both PAMPs, i.e. <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>LPS (<italic>Ec</italic>LPS) and <italic>Vibrio anguillarum </italic>DNA (<italic>Va</italic>DNA), whereas the translation elongation factor EF1&#x003b1; promoter was inhibited by <italic>Ec</italic>LPS and, to some extent, by <italic>Va</italic>DNA. In contrast, the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK) promoter and the early SV40 enhancer/promoter region showed a more constant expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) and were therefore selected for further studies. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> illustrates the profound effects of the plasmid used for normalization in the measurement of the induction of NF-&#x003ba;B. When using <italic>Ec</italic>LPS, a 29 vs. 14 fold induction of NF-&#x003ba;B activity was obtained with the TK and the CMV promoters, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), indicating that induction of CMV by <italic>Ec</italic>LPS resulted in the underestimation of the NF-&#x003ba;B activation by this PAMP. Similarly, 21 vs. 738 fold induction of NF-&#x003ba;B was observed with <italic>Va</italic>DNA when using the SV40 and the TK promoters, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), indicating that the inhibition of the TK promoter by <italic>Va</italic>DNA resulted in the overestimation of the NF-&#x003ba;B induced by this PAMP.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Optimization of the different <italic>Renilla </italic>luciferase reporter constructs</bold>.

The results showed that injection of the MO against MyD88 resulted in a significant inhibition (&#x0003e; 30%) of the NF-&#x003ba;B activation induced by bacterial DNA, while injection of a MO directed against TLR3, which is involved in the recognition of double-stranded RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], failed to affect the NF-&#x003ba;B activation induced by bacterial DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>An example of the usefulness of MO-gene mediated knockdown in combination with the dual-luciferase assay for the analysis of the NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway</bold>.

Beyond genetics and experimental tools, the strength of the zebrafish resides in the analysis of phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Perhaps no other organism (and certainly no vertebrate) is better suited to high-throughput phenotyping. The scale that can be achieved in zebrafish experiments is impressive by vertebrate standards. Early zebrafish embryos are less than 1 mm in diameter, allowing several embryos to fit easily in a single well of a 384-well plate. Whole organisms offer several advantages over cell lines for forward chemical genetic screens, providing information on tissue specificity, toxicity and accounting for bioavailability. Furthermore, cells are not transformed and are in their normal physiological milieu of cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Use of the whole organism can also allow the screening of processes that are not easily replicated <italic>in vitro </italic>such as organ development. The advantages of zebrafish screening over invertebrate model organisms are their closer evolutionary relationship to humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Therefore, the assay described here represents a promising route to the identification and validation of novel drug targets. Analysis of the promoter of newly identified genes that underlie zebrafish disease phenotypes might lead directly to the identification of novel drug targets or genes that can correct the phenotype.</p><p>Because zebrafish development occurs <italic>ex uterus </italic>and they have a large number of offspring, hundreds or thousands of embryos can be injected per day and the results of this assay can be obtained within 24&#x02013;48 h, although shorter time points can also be analyzed if either the mRNA coding for the gene under study or the recombinant protein are used. Although some variation was found between replicates, these can be easily avoided by the high number of technical replicates achievable. The high-fold induction of luciferase activity, together with barely detectable levels of basal expression, makes it an ideal system for the <italic>in vivo </italic>analysis of inducible promoters. In addition, the assay can be combined with powerful MO-gene mediated knockdown or gene over-expression to rapidly determine the functions of a particular gene (1&#x02013;2 days compared with months-years needed for the generation of knockout mice). Therefore, this technique appears to be suitable for studying the activity and responses of different promoters and gene functions as well as for the validation of genetic constructs. However, this technique does not provide spatial information on gene expression and, therefore, it might be useful as a complementary technique to <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization and fluorescent microscopy. To avoid this limitation, all our promoters drive the expression of a fusion of eGFP and firefly luciferase, which might allow the simultaneous determination of the expression levels and the spatial localization of the promoter under analysis.</p><p>A shortcoming of the present assay, however, is the transient expression of the constructs and, therefore, only short-term responses of promoters can be studied. For example, the adaptive immune response can not be studied with the assay since it develops after several weeks. On the other hand, we have found that normalization is absolutely required for the elimination of experimental variations. As we have found that the <italic>Renilla </italic>luciferase plasmid used for normalization can be induced by external stimuli, the choice of the normalization plasmid is critical. Thus, the CMV immediate-early promoter, which is commonly used for normalization in both <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>studies, is significantly induced by external stimuli such as endotoxin (LPS) and genomic DNA from bacteria, as previously reported in cell lines with LPS, cytokines and phorbol esters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, this limitation could be easily overcome using other commercial <italic>Renilla </italic>luciferase reporter vectors, such as those driven by the herpes simplex virus TK promoter (pRL-TK) or the early SV40 enhancer/promoter region (pRL-SV40).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have developed a rapid and sensitive assay based on the classical dual-luciferase reporter technique which can be used as a new tool to characterize the minimum promoter region of a gene and the <italic>in vivo </italic>response of inducible promoters to different stimuli as well as in high throughput screening experiments. The flexibility of this assay is demonstrated by induction of the NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent promoters using simultaneous microinjection of different PAMPs as well as with the use of MO-gene mediated knockdown.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>&#x02022; Firefly (<italic>Photinus pyralis</italic>) luciferase reporter plasmids (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Reporter plasmids used in this study</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center"><bold>Plasmid name</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Purpose</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Relevant features</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">pEGFPLuc</td><td align="left">Positive control for assaying the effectiveness of transfection</td><td align="left">Kanamycin/neomycin marker.
