One such marker, the transcription factor Pax2, is expressed at the midbrain-hindbrain boundary and in the cerebellum, spinal cord, retina, optic stalk, and optic chiasm. We recently described a group of diencephalic cells that express Pax2 as early as embryonic day (E) 10.5, and become part of the eminentia thalami by E11.5. The discovery of this previously undescribed cell population prompted us to examine Pax2 protein expression in the developing mouse forebrain in more detail.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We determined the expression pattern of Pax2 in the forebrain of wild type mouse embryos between E10.5 and postnatal day (P) 15. Pax2 expression was detected in the septum of the basal forebrain, hypothalamus, eminentia thalami and in the subfornical organ. To evaluate Pax2 as a marker for septal cells, we examined Pax2 expression in <italic>Pax6</italic><sup><italic>Sey</italic>/<italic>Sey </italic></sup>mutants, which have an enlarged septum. We found that Pax2 clearly marks a population of septal cells equivalent to that seen in wild types, indicating its utility as a marker of septal identity. These cells did not express the GABAergic marker calbindin nor the cholinergic marker choline acetyltransferase and were not detectable after P15.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Pax2 is expressed in populations of cells within the developing septum, hypothalamus, and eminentia thalami. It seems especially useful as a marker of the telencephalic septum, because of its early, strong and characteristic expression in this structure. Further, its expression is maintained in the enlarged septum of <italic>Pax6</italic><sup><italic>Sey</italic>/<italic>Sey </italic></sup>mutants.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Pax2 is a member of the Pax family of transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], characterised by the presence of a paired-type homeodomain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. <italic>Pax2 </italic>is expressed in a number of different organs in the developing mouse embryo, including the ureteric bud, kidneys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and otic vesicle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In the developing nervous system, <italic>Pax2 </italic>is first detected at embryonic day (E) 7.5 in the neural plate, in the area of the presumptive midbrain-hindbrain region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. At E8.0, <italic>Pax2 </italic>displays a broad expression domain in this region, which by E9.5 is restricted to the isthmus at the midbrain-hindbrain boundary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Pax2 expression in the isthmus ceases after E11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In the cerebellum, Pax2 is specifically expressed by a subset of cerebellar GABAergic interneurons and their precursors, from E12 until the end of cerebellar development (postnatal day 15) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In the spinal cord, Pax2 expression is found in the intermediate zone as early as E10.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In the developing eye,<italic>Pax2 </italic>expression is initiated at E9 in the ventral half of the optic vesicle. By E11, after invagination of the optic vesicle, both Pax2 transcript and protein are detected at high levels in the ventral opening of the optic cup, the optic fissure, and the optic stalk, ending at the border with the diencephalon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. After E12.5, Pax2 protein expression is still present in the ventral optic cup, although the level is decreased, and it is no longer detected after E16.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Pax2 is also expressed in glial cells in the optic nerve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Pax6, another member of the Pax family, is expressed in the dorsal telencephalon, diencephalon, hindbrain regions and spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and throughout the developing optic cup, but is absent from the optic stalk and optic nerve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Mutant mice lacking functional Pax6 protein (<italic>Pax6</italic><sup><italic>Sey</italic>/<italic>Sey </italic></sup>mice), display a large range of nervous system defects, including absence of eyes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], disruption of dorsoventral telencephalic patterning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and the diencephalic-mesencephalic boundary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Pax6 and Pax2 are expressed in neighbouring, but mutually exclusive domains in the developing eye (with the exception of the ventral optic cup), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and in the diencephalic-mesencephalic region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In the developing spinal cord, Pax2 is expressed by many types of early differentiated neurons, located in the mantle zone and surrounding Pax6-positive neural precursors in the ventricular zone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Fewer Pax2-positive interneurons are found in the <italic>Pax6</italic><sup><italic>Sey</italic>/<italic>Sey </italic></sup>mutant, indicating that Pax6 is required for their development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>We have recently described a group of diencephalic cells at the border region between the diencephalon and the telencephalon that expresses Pax2 protein at E10.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. At E12.5, these Pax2-immunopositive cells form a distinct cell population at the most dorso-lateral tip of the eminentia thalami [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], a diencephalic structure that joins the ventral diencephalon to the dorsal and ventral telencephalon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Here, we describe previously unidentified areas of Pax2 expression in the developing mouse forebrain. Further, we show that Pax2 expression is maintained in the septum of <italic>Pax6</italic><sup><italic>Sey</italic>/<italic>Sey </italic></sup>mutants, which are known to have an enlarged septum. This study highlights the value of Pax2 as a novel marker of forebrain development.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Domains of Pax2 expression in the developing mouse forebrain</title><p>We examined Pax2 expression in the early forebrain using immunohistochemistry on sagittal sections of E10.5 and E11.5 embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). At E10.5, a few Pax2-immunopositive cells were detected within the ventral telencephalon in lateral sagittal sections (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, a-arrowheads), with the staining becoming more intense in mid-sagittal sections (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a'</xref>). In addition, a small population of Pax2 immunopositive cells was detected in the neuroepithelium of the anterior hypothalamus, adjacent to the optic recess area (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B,b</xref>).

A few Pax2-immunopositive cells were also detected along the base of the hypothalamus, excluding the midline region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>, arrows).

In coronal sections of the caudal forebrain, specific Pax2 expression was also detected in a small cluster of cells resembling a nucleus in the neuroepithelium of the anterior hypothalamus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C,c</xref>).

Here, the expression of Pax2, a well-studied marker of the isthmus, spinal cord and developing eye, has been re-examined, using a polyclonal antibody, and novel areas of Pax2 protein expression have been identified in the ventral telencephalic septum and the developing hypothalamus. The polyclonal antibody used in the present study recognizes the same epitope described by Dressler and Douglass (1992) and has been previously used by several groups to characterize Pax2 protein distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In this study, the use of paraffin sections subjected to microwaving for antigen retrieval, in contrast to the cryostat sections used previously, may have allowed the identification of the previously undescribed domains of Pax2 expression.</p><p>Pax2 staining in the hypothalamus is first detected at E10.5 and comprises a few cells in the ventricular zone, dorsal to the optic recess. By E11.5, Pax2 positive cells are found in a region that extends from the area of the optic recess to the lateral ventricle that will give rise to the anterior hypothalamus. Comparison of the distribution of Pax2 positive cells in this region at E12.5 and E10.5 suggests that they might follow a migratory path towards dorsal regions of the anterior hypothalamus. By E14.5, fewer Pax2-positive cells are present than at E12.5, and these are restricted to the dorsal anterior hypothalamus. Pax2 is expressed in the optic stalk, a structure that joins the optic cup to the brain, and that ends at the base of the hypothalamus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. It is therefore possible that the small population of Pax2/&#x003b2; tubulin III-positive cells in the developing anterior hypothalamus described here, may arise from the optic stalk and collaborate with other cellular hypothalamic cues in guiding the trajectory of the optic nerve.</p><p>Pax2 is also expressed in the eminentia thalami, a transient developmental structure of unknown function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] that joins the ventral diencephalon to the telencephalon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Pax2 expression in the eminentia thalami is first detected at E10.5 at the dorsal border between the diencephalon and telencephalon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], and this staining can not be detected after E13.5. The Pax2-positive cells in the eminentia thalami do not express &#x003b2;-tubulin III, indicating that they are most likely to be neuronal precursors. The early appearance of these cells at the diencephalic-telencephalic boundary (this study and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]) suggests that they might be important for the formation of this boundary.</p><p>Consistent, high levels of Pax2 expression were also observed in the septum of the basal forebrain. Pax2 is first expressed at E10.5 by a small number of cells located in the ventral telencephalon. It seems likely that these cells give rise to the Pax2-positive population observed in the septal area one day later. By E12.5, septal Pax2 expression although strong, is confined to the septal neuroepithelium, mainly at levels proximal to the lamina terminalis. Only a few Pax2-positive cells are observed in the differentiating layer of the septum. Septal expression is also observed at later developmental stages, but by E16.5 it is downregulated and becomes restricted to a small population of differentiated cells in the medial septum. During septal development in rodents, cells migrate from the lateral ventricle towards the midline. The medial nucleus is one of the first nuclei formed in the septum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that the sparse Pax2-positive cells observed at E16.5 correspond to the Pax2-positive cells observed in the differentiating field of the septum between E12.5 and E14.5 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref> and not shown).</p><p>Pax2 is still expressed by a few cells located in the medial and lateral septal areas during postnatal development and it is not detected after P15. The majority of neurons in the medial and lateral septum are cholinergic or GABA-ergic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Mature cholinergic neurons express the enzyme choline acetyltransferase (Chat) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], whose expression in the septum becomes detectable at around P8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. At this age, Pax2 expressing neurons are still found in the septal region but do not co-express Chat, suggesting that these cells might not be of the cholinergic type. However, it is also possible that the Pax2 immunopositive cells might develop into cholinergic neurons at later time points when Chat expression has increased and Pax2 expression has been turned off. Similarly, calbindin is expressed by a large number of somatospiny GABA-ergic neurons in the adult septum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and it is present in the postnatal septal area, but it does not co-localize with Pax2, indicating that the Pax2 septal neurons are not of this particular GABA-ergic type. As there many different types of GABA-ergic neurons in the septum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], it is possible that the Pax2-positive cells might develop into a different type, such as the septohippocampal projection neurons, a prominent GABA-ergic population comprised of parvalbumin-positive cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Although a few of these cells are first detected at around P8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], when Pax2 expression is still detectable in the septum, they become clearly visible after P15, when Pax2 expressing cells are no longer present in the septum. Again, this expression pattern precludes us from being able to draw conclusions about the specific neuronal type of these cells based solely on immunostaining techniques. Cell fate experiments using a Pax2-cre mouse strain and an appropriate cre reporter strain would allow us to address which type of neurotransmitter fate and properties the Pax2-positive septal neurons adopt.</p><p>In the developing eye, there is a sharp boundary between the domains of Pax2 expression in the optic stalk and Pax6 expression in the optic cup, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Mutual cross-repressive interactions between Pax2 and Pax6 are essential for formation of this boundary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Here we show that Pax2 and Pax6 are expressed in neighbouring, non-overlapping domains in the rostral telencephalon, reminiscent of the pattern observed in the developing eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Given this expression pattern, and the fact that the septum is enlarged in <italic>Pax6</italic><sup><italic>Sey</italic>/<italic>Sey </italic></sup>mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], we hypothesised that the Pax2 septal expression domain might be expanded in this mutant. However, we found no increase in the extent or intensity of Pax2 expression in this region in <italic>Pax6</italic><sup><italic>Sey</italic>/<italic>Sey </italic></sup>mutants. Nevertheless, the Pax2 expression domain was found at a more dorsal position than in the wild type, consistent with the previously described size increase of the septum in the <italic>Pax6</italic><sup><italic>Sey</italic>/<italic>Sey </italic></sup>mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The Pax2 expression domain still lies within the ventral telencephalon, as shown by co-expression of the septal marker Lim1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>There are several mouse models with different types of mutations in the <italic>Pax2 </italic>locus, including the Krd mice (Krd/+), a mutant with a chromosomal deletion that includes this locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], <italic>Pax2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>null mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], and <italic>Pax2</italic><sup>1<italic>Neu </italic></sup>mice with a frameshift mutation in <italic>Pax2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].

It would be of interest to study the telencephalic septum in these different mutants, to identify any possible alterations due to loss of Pax2 expression in this region.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Pax2 is expressed in the anterior hypothalamus, eminentia thalami and telencephalic septum in the developing mouse forebrain, in neuronal progenitors and early born neurons. Between E11.5 and E14.5, it is strongly expressed in the septal neuroepithelium, at a level close to the lamina terminalis and it is no longer detectable by P15. Further, the absence of functional Pax6 does not cause gross alterations of Pax2 expression in the septum. Thus Pax2 represents an ideal marker for the study of the developing septum.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p>Animal care was in accordance with institutional guidelines and UK Home Office regulations.
