Quantitative mass spectrometric analyses including selected reaction monitoring (also known as multiple reaction monitoring) were applied to the EGFR and associated proteins. In response to epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation of cells, phosphorylations at EGFR Ser<sup>991</sup> and Tyr<sup>998</sup> accumulated more slowly than at receptor sites involved in RAS-ERK signaling. Phosphorylation-deficient mutant receptors S991A and Y998F activated ERK in response to EGF but were impaired for receptor endocytosis. Consistent with these results, the mutant receptors retained a network of interactions with known signaling proteins including EGF-stimulated binding to the adaptor GRB2. Compared with wild type EGFR the Y998F variant had diminished EGF-stimulated interaction with the ubiquitin E3 ligase CBL, and the S991A variant had decreased associated ubiquitin. The endocytosis-defective mutant receptors were found to have elevated phosphorylation at positions Ser<sup>1039</sup> and Thr<sup>1041</sup>. These residues reside in a serine/threonine-rich region of the receptor previously implicated in p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent stress/cytokine-induced EGFR internalization and recycling (Zwang, Y., and Yarden, Y. (2006) p38 MAP kinase mediates stress-induced internalization of EGFR: implications for cancer chemotherapy. <italic>EMBO J.</italic> 25, 4195&#x02013;4206). EGF-induced phosphorylations at Ser<sup>1039</sup> and Thr<sup>1041</sup> were blocked by treatment of cells with SB-202190, a selective inhibitor of p38. These results suggest that coordinated phosphorylation of EGFR involving sites Tyr<sup>998</sup>, Ser<sup>991</sup>, Ser<sup>1039</sup>, and Thr<sup>1041</sup> governs the trafficking of EGF receptors. This reinforces the notion that EGFR function is manifest through spatially and temporally controlled protein-protein interactions and phosphorylations.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Upon activation by ligand, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="G1"><sup>1</sup></xref> dimerizes, sometimes as heterodimers with other EGFR family members; is catalytically activated by reorientation of kinase region subdomains; becomes covalently modified by phosphorylation and ubiquitination; and interacts with a variety of intracellular proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). These events activate intracellular signaling cascades, and concurrently the dimerized receptors become internalized through endocytosis and then may be recycled to the cell surface or degraded in lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Systematic analysis of EGFR family phosphorylation-dependent protein interactions has been assessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), and many of the known EGFR-interacting proteins can be categorized as functioning in cellular processes such as EGF-induced signal transduction and EGFR endocytosis and trafficking. Temporal analysis of tyrosine phosphorylation following EGF treatment of cells revealed groups of EGFR substrates with shared profiles of phosphorylation kinetics, including some that display rapid kinetics of phosphorylation accumulation and are involved in signal transduction (<italic>e.g.</italic> ERK kinase activation) and others that accumulate more slowly following ligand treatment and are involved in receptor internalization and down-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Although advances in MS and the definition of phosphorylation-dependent protein-protein interactions have led to a greatly expanded view of EGFR function and regulation, our understanding of the biological consequences and spatial-temporal relationships of individual modifications is incomplete.</p><p>In a previous quantitative phosphoproteomics study aimed at the identification of drug-modulated changes in phosphorylation associated with the EGFR network, a cluster of three sites of phosphorylation in the EGFR carboxyl tail region was identified as affected by receptor stimulation by EGF and inhibited by the ATP-competitive EGFR inhibitor PKI166 in human A431 tumor cells and xenograft tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The three sites in the cluster, Ser<sup>991</sup>,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN3"><sup>2</sup></xref> Ser<sup>995</sup>, and Tyr<sup>998</sup>, are localized within a single tryptic peptide having the sequence MHLPSPTDSNFYR that spans residues 987&#x02013;999. The phosphorylation of Tyr<sup>998</sup> was first described by Stover <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), whereas the two serine sites were shown previously to be phosphorylated by Heisermann and Gill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Numerous recent studies using different cultured cell models have verified the phosphorylation of EGFR at Tyr<sup>998</sup> and Ser<sup>991</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), and Thr<sup>993</sup> was also observed to be phosphorylated within this same region of the EGFR in EGF-stimulated HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The modulation of these sites by EGF and the EGFR inhibitor implicates them in EGFR signaling and suggests that they may have utility as pharmacodynamic markers of EGFR activity. However, the function and importance of these sites, their modulation by kinases and phosphatases, and possible roles in EGFR function remain unknown.</p><p>Several amino acid residues in the EGFR have been implicated in the regulation of its trafficking. Sorkin <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) showed that substitution of Tyr<sup>998</sup> with phenylalanine rendered high density EGFRs defective for endocytosis and interaction with AP-2. More recent kinetic studies using MS indicated that EGFR phosphorylation at both Tyr<sup>998</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) and Ser<sup>991</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) occurs relatively slowly compared with other EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylations known to be involved in receptor-proximal signal transduction. For example, Mann and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) recorded maximal phosphorylation at EGFR sites Tyr<sup>1110</sup>, Tyr<sup>1172</sup>, and Tyr<sup>1197</sup> at 1 min post-EGF, whereas EGF-stimulated phosphorylation at Tyr<sup>998</sup> was still increasing at 15 min post-EGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), and a peptide containing both Ser(P)<sup>991</sup> and Thr(P)<sup>993</sup> peaked after 10 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). However, the role of phosphorylation at Tyr<sup>998</sup> and Ser<sup>991</sup> has not been reported. Another region of the EGFR, spanning residues 1026&#x02013;1046, was identified by Zwang and Yarden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) as a target of phosphorylation downstream of the stress-activated mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase p38 and associated with transient internalization and recycling of the EGFR in response to cytokine (TNF&#x003b1;) and stress challenges such as UV irradiation and the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatinum. Within this part of the receptor, a 13-residue section spanning 1029&#x02013;1041 and the leucines at 1034 and 1035 in particular were found to be essential for ligand- and dimerization-induced EGFR endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Although both EGF- and stress-induced EGFR internalization may be clathrin-mediated, they differ in that the former leads to receptor down-regulation and involves the E3 ubiquitin ligase CBL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), whereas the latter involves receptor recycling, is not associated with receptor phosphorylation at the CBL binding site Tyr(P)<sup>1069</sup>, and, in the case of TNF&#x003b1; treatment, involves activation of the transforming growth factor &#x003b2;-activated kinase TAK1 upstream of p38 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Interestingly although p38 kinase is not required for EGF-induced EGFR internalization, it is required for CBL-dependent receptor degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Therefore, alternate pathways involving p38 kinase regulate the down-regulation or recycling of the EGFR in response to diverse extracellular signals. However, the molecular details that govern these two processes are not fully understood.</p><p>In the current study, EGFR phosphorylation, signaling, protein-protein interactions, and trafficking were analyzed to address the role of Tyr<sup>998</sup> and Ser<sup>991</sup> in EGFR endocytosis. This was achieved by application of complementary methods including quantitative selected reaction monitoring (SRM, also known as MRM for multiple reaction monitoring) mass spectrometry, fluorescence imaging and cell sorting, immunoaffinity protein enrichment and blotting, and site-directed mutagenesis. Substitution mutations that prevented phosphorylation at EGFR Tyr<sup>998</sup> and Ser<sup>991</sup> did not prevent EGFR-to-ERK signaling but impaired EGF-induced receptor internalization and stimulated p38 kinase-dependent receptor phosphorylation at positions Ser<sup>1039</sup> and Thr<sup>1041</sup>. These findings confirm the importance of Tyr<sup>998</sup> and reveal a role for Ser<sup>991</sup> in EGF-mediated EGFR internalization possibly involving cross-talk with the p38 kinase-dependent EGFR recycling pathway.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Constructs and Reagents</title><p>Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate Tyr<sup>998</sup>-to-Phe and Ser<sup>991</sup>-to-Ala mutations in a construct encoding a chimeric EGFR-FLAG-GFP protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).

The instrument method consisted of one MS full scan (400&#x02013;1400 <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>) in the Orbitrap mass analyzer, an automatic gain control target of 500,000 with a maximum ion injection of 500 ms, one microscan, and a resolution of 60,000. Three data-dependent MS/MS scans were performed in the linear ion trap using the three most intense ions at 35% normalized collision energy. The MS and MS/MS scans were obtained in parallel fashion. In MS/MS mode automatic gain control targets were 10,000 with a maximum ion injection time of 100 ms. A minimum ion intensity of 1000 was required to trigger an MS/MS spectrum. The dynamic exclusion was applied using a maximum exclusion list of 500 with one repeat count with a repeat duration of 30 s and exclusion duration of 45 s.</p><p>SRM analysis was carried out by using a TSQ Quantum Ultra triple quadrupole MS instrument (Thermo Scientific) with a Proxeon source and LC system as described above except that the gradient time associated with the Orbitrap was 120 min and was 40 min with the TSQ instrument.

The validated transitions for all phosphopeptides and unphosphorylated peptides for EGFR immunoprecipitates are listed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/M900148-MCP200/DC1">supplemental Table 1</ext-link> and were monitored for the duration of the run. Most peptides were followed by using two unique transitions. Q2 gas pressure was 1.5 millitorrs, and collision energy was calculated relative to the precursor ion mass by the following formula: <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> &#x000d7; 0.034 V + 3 V. The scan width was 0.02 Da, and the dwell time was 10 ms. Q1 was operated at a resolution of 0.2, and Q3 resolution was 0.7. Xcalibur data acquisition software and SRM Builder software (Thermo Scientific) were used for data acquisition and total ion current calculations.</p></sec><sec><title>MS Data Analysis</title><p>Tandem mass spectra were extracted by BioWorks version 3.3. All MS/MS samples were analyzed using SEQUEST (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA; version 27, revision 12) and X! Tandem (The Global Proteome Machine Organization; version 2006.04.01.2). Both search engines were set up to search the IPI human database (version 3.18, 60,090 entries) assuming trypsin digestion, allowing two missed cleavages, and using a fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.5 Da and a parent ion tolerance of 0.02 Da. The iodoacetamide derivative of cysteine was specified as a fixed modification. The phosphorylation of Tyr was specified in SEQUEST and the phosphorylation of Tyr, Ser, and Thr was specified in X! Tandem as variable modifications.</p><p>Scaffold (Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR; version Scaffold-01.06.05) was used to validate MS/MS-based peptide and protein identifications. Peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 95.0% probability as specified by the Peptide Prophet algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Protein identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 95.0% probability as assigned by the Protein Prophet algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Proteins that contained similar peptides and could not be differentiated based on MS/MS analysis alone were grouped to satisfy the principles of parsimony. The assignment of post-translational modifications was made by the search engines (described above) and verified manually. Modification by sulfation was not distinguishable from phosphorylation with the mass accuracy of these experiments. However, these isobaric modifications were assumed to be phosphorylation if anti-Tyr(P) enrichment was used for peptide purification.</p><p>Label-free relative quantification was approached by two methods. In the first, differential abundance was estimated based on spectral counts; <italic>i.e.</italic> the total number of peptides identified by MS/MS and assigned to a protein. For a given protein, the total non-phosphorylated peptides from four experiments were summed, and values were normalized according to non-phosphorylated EGFR peptide spectral counts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). In the second, peak areas of SRM transitions were determined by using SRM Builder prototype software (Thermo Scientific; version 1.0) after confirming for each peptide the co-elution of all transitions. The most abundant transition for each peptide was used for quantification unless interference in this channel was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). For those cases, the second most abundant transition was used. Noise levels were estimated based upon visual inspection of signals preceding and following peptide peaks, and the signal-to-noise ratio was calculated by dividing peak intensity by the proximal noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). When the signal-to-noise ratio was less than 3 in a set of samples, these peptides were excluded in the protein quantification analysis.</p><p>SRM intensities for associated proteins were divided by the value measured for the EGFR normalization peptide YSFGATCVK (residues 285&#x02013;293; see &#x0201c;Results&#x0201d;) intrinsic to that sample. Hence calculated associated protein amounts are per unit of EGFR. The assumption was made that the amount of EGFR in cells did not change significantly after 15 min of EGF stimulation or SB-202190 incubation. Western blot results verified this assumption (<italic>e.g.</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>E</italic>). Results from three independently repeated experiments were used to calculate statistical significance by the Student's <italic>t</italic> test.

counts of these EGFR-associated proteins were noted as a crude measure of their abundance in the IP samples. Spectral counts were normalized by adjusting for the number of spectral counts from non-phosphorylated EGFR peptides. EGFR peptides, as expected, were by far the most abundant class of peptide in the samples (<xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">Table I</xref>), and this observation served to validate that the IP method was specific for this antigen. For each of the proteins mentioned above, VAV2, and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p85 subunits (PIK3R1 and PIK3R2), spectral counts associated with WT EGFR increased as a consequence of EGF treatment of cells. Furthermore with the exception of EGF and CBLB, the spectral counts for these proteins measured with EGF-stimulated Y998F and S991A receptors were less than those observed for WT (<xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">Table I</xref>).</p><p>To quantify the receptor-associated proteins, including changes due to EGF stimulation and as a consequence of the Y998F and S991A mutations, SRM analysis was applied to the receptor&#x000b7;immunoprecipitate complexes isolated from cells before and after EGF treatment. An SRM method that tracked the top six EGFR-associated proteins (according to spectral counts associated with WT EGFR; <xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">Table I</xref>) was formulated based on transitions summarized in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/M900148-MCP200/DC1">supplemental Table 2</ext-link>. The fragmentation patterns obtained during discovery analyses with the LTQ-Orbitrap were a useful starting point toward the development of the SRM transitions. However, the resonance excitation-based fragmentations produced in the linear ion trap were not identical with the true CIDs undertaken in Q2 of the triple quadrupole TSQ instrument that was used for SRM. The intensity of b ions was generally greater in the linear ion trap, which also had a low molecular weight cutoff (<italic>i.e.</italic> &#x02153; rule) that made low <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> ions more predominant in the triple quadrupole TSQ instrument. In addition, the LC gradients were of different durations (120 min with the Orbitrap and 40 min with the TSQ instrument). The SRM method was applied in three independent biological experiments resulting in the quantification the EGFR and the six receptor-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="TII">Table II</xref>).

The immune complexes were converted to tryptic peptides, which were subjected to SRM analysis to specifically monitor transitions derived from the indicated EGFR-associated proteins (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="TII">Table II</xref>). Protein amounts are expressed per unit of EGFR protein after normalization with an intrinsic EGFR peptide (see &#x0201c;Experimental Procedures&#x0201d;).

The largest EGF-stimulated -fold increases in receptor binding were observed for CBL followed by GRB2. CBL association with WT EGFR increased more than 7-fold following EGF treatment but was less than 5-fold with S991A and was &#x0223c;4-fold with the Y998F variant.

EGF-stimulated receptor association of GRB2 was roughly 3-fold, which was a statistically significant increase over that observed without EGF treatment, and the measurements for GRB2 were not different between WT and the variant receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). The associations of VAV2 and SOS1 were measured to be essentially constitutive and unaffected by the phosphorylation site mutations because no statistically significant differences were noted following EGF treatments or between the WT and the variant receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). The binding of SHC1 to WT EGFR was stimulated more than 2-fold by EGF, but for the receptor variants, EGF-stimulated SHC1 association was associated with too much variation to be considered significant. The capture of ubiquitin with WT and Y998F was increased more than 3-fold by EGF but to a lesser extent with the S991A variant. Furthermore with EGF-treated cells the amount of receptor-associated ubiquitin was significantly reduced in S991A compared with WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="TII">Table II</xref> shows the peptides, SRM transitions, and coefficients of variance associated with the data depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>.

The co-immunoprecipitation of ubiquitin may reflect the ubiquitination of any of the proteins in the receptor (anti-FLAG) immunoprecipitates. However, prominent anti-ubiquitin immunostaining was concentrated at or slightly above the migration of the receptors, suggesting that ubiquitination of the receptors, as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), may account for a portion of the ubiquitin measured by MS.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Fig. 6.</label><caption><p><bold>Western blot analysis of EGFR and associated proteins.</bold> FLAG-tagged wild type receptor (<italic>EGFR</italic>) and the variants Y998F and S991A, as indicated, were collected by anti-FLAG IP from total cell lysates prepared from cells treated without or with EGF (15 min, 37 &#x000b0;C, 100 ng/ml; see &#x0201c;Experimental Procedures&#x0201d;).

variants (see bold region in <xref ref-type="table" rid="TIII">Table III</xref>). There were, respectively, 20 and 23 phosphorylated peptides identified by spectral counting for these variants but only six in the case of WT (<xref ref-type="table" rid="TIII">Table III</xref>). Most notable were phosphorylations at positions Thr<sup>1041</sup> and especially Ser<sup>1039</sup> for which spectral counts were higher in the two receptor variants than in WT (<xref ref-type="table" rid="TIII">Table III</xref>). Both of these phosphorylations were observed previously in EGF-stimulated HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). These sites reside in the same tryptic peptide spanning residues 1032&#x02013;1052. This peptide was also detected doubly phosphorylated at Ser(P)<sup>1039</sup> and Ser(P)<sup>1041</sup>, but the ion current intensities were relatively low (data not shown).</p><p>The monophosphorylated isobaric isomers containing either Ser(P)<sup>1039</sup> or Thr(P)<sup>1041</sup> were analyzed by LC-MS/MS, which confirmed their identities. For example, their y12 fragment ions were clearly distinctive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>). The two species did not co-elute during reverse phase chromatography, and this facilitated their resolution and ion current measurement by high resolution LC-MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>C</italic>). To facilitate the quantification of these species by SRM, the measurement of transitions involving distinctive y ions was attempted but proved inefficient. Therefore, an optimized SRM method was developed that included neutral loss of phosphoric acid (<italic>i.e.</italic> doubly charged parent &#x02212; 98/2) and y5-associated transitions, which were common to the two phosphoisomers and efficiently detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, <italic>A</italic>, <italic>B</italic>, and <italic>D</italic>). Note that different elution gradients were used for the LC-MS and SRM analyses shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic>, respectively, so the retention times were not identical. The Orbitrap MS extracted ion current chromatograph and triple quadrupole SRM traces were similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, compare <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic>), and several repeats of the LC-MS/MS experiment indicated that the Ser(P)<sup>1039</sup> peptide consistently eluted immediately before the Thr(P)<sup>1041</sup> isomer.</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Fig. 7.</label><caption><p><bold>Detection and quantification of phosphorylation at EGFR Ser<sup>1039</sup> and Thr<sup>1041</sup> by LC-MS/MS and SRM.</bold><italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>, trypsin-digested immuno (anti-FLAG) purified EGFR proteins were analyzed by high resolution LC-MS/MS.

Stress (<italic>e.g.</italic> TNF&#x003b1; or UV irradiation)-induced p38 kinase-dependent phosphorylation within the Ser/Thr-rich segment of the EGFR spanning residues 1026&#x02013;1046, but not at Ser<sup>1039</sup> specifically, was shown by Zwang and Yarden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, <italic>E</italic> and <italic>F</italic>, present a summary of three independent repeats of an experiment that addressed these questions. Stimulation of cells with EGF caused an &#x0223c;3-fold elevation in the abundance of the Ser(P)<sup>1039</sup> peptide (3.4 &#x000b1; 1.3 S.D.) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>E</italic>), whereas both the Y998F and S991A variants showed a roughly 10-fold elevation in the abundance of the Ser(P)<sup>1039</sup> peptide after EGF treatment. The pronounced EGF-stimulated increase in Ser(P)<sup>1039</sup> was largely eliminated by treatment of cells with SB-202190, which is a potent inhibitor of MAP kinases p38&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), indicating that these phosphorylation sites are regulated by p38 kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>E</italic>). A similar phenomenon was observed for Thr(P)<sup>1041</sup> wherein EGF treatment stimulated Tyr(P)<sup>1041</sup> more than 2-fold in WT (2.7 &#x000b1; 1.1 S.D.) but to an even greater extent with the variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>F</italic>). The Thr<sup>1041</sup> modifications were also sensitive to the p38 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>F</italic>).</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>EGFR Mutants Y998F and S991A Signal to ERK but Are Defective in Endocytosis</title><p>Cellular responses to EGFR activation occur with different kinetics, and to some extent this reflects temporal regulation of receptor and substrate phosphorylation and the dynamics of receptor trafficking and protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The phosphorylations of EGFR at Ser<sup>991</sup> and Tyr<sup>998</sup> were found in tumors as sites modulated by EGF and an EGFR kinase inhibitor, suggesting their involvement in EGFR regulation and/or signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). In this study and other published reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) EGF-stimulated phosphorylations at these sites occurred with relatively slow kinetics and in this study were found not to be required for downstream ERK activation, which suggests that their function is not required for signaling along the RAS-ERK axis. Indeed the results from three different assays indicated that the phosphorylation-deficient variants S991A and Y998F were defective in receptor endocytosis. These data indicate that to some extent signaling may proceed independently of normal receptor trafficking.</p><p>Our data indicate that EGFR endocytosis is subject to regulation involving the phosphorylation of Tyr<sup>998</sup> and amino-terminal to it at Ser<sup>991</sup>. Sorkin <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) described Tyr<sup>998</sup> as part of a tyrosine-based internalization motif. Indeed the structural analysis by Owen and Evans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>) of an EGFR peptide containing this residue (FYRALM) bound to the endocytosis adaptor protein adaptin &#x003bc;2 showed Tyr<sup>998</sup> and Leu<sup>1001</sup> tightly bound in pockets and predicted that phosphorylation at Tyr<sup>998</sup>, which was not yet appreciated, would prevent the receptor-&#x003bc;2 interaction. The cell adhesion molecule L1 contains a tyrosine-based endocytosis motif (YRSL) similar to the EGFR Tyr<sup>998</sup> motif (YRAL). In L1, tyrosine phosphorylation of the motif appears to modulate L1 interactions with adaptin AP-2 as a requisite for clathrin-mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). We did not identify adaptins as EGFR-associated likely because our buffers lacked deoxycholate as a reagent necessary for the detection of the EGFR&#x000b7;AP-2 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). A more detailed analysis of the subcellular localization of Y998F and S991A receptor variants may provide more insight into the function of the 998 and 991 phosphorylation sites and mechanisms of EGFR trafficking.</p><p>Given the slow kinetics of Tyr<sup>998</sup> and Ser<sup>991</sup> phosphorylation, in the case of Ser(P)<sup>991</sup> still accumulating 90 min after EGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), it is possible these modifications are not required for receptor internalization <italic>per se</italic> but may play a role at a later stage of endocytosis. For example, phosphorylation at these sites may promote dissociation of proteins from internalized receptors that would otherwise impair subsequent trafficking. Our findings do not indicate the full nature of the receptor endocytosis defect associated with the variant receptors nor the extent to which this phenotype is a consequence of the side chain substitutions or their lack of phosphorylation but clearly establish a role for Ser<sup>991</sup>, in addition to the known requirement for Tyr<sup>998</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), in EGFR endocytosis. This study did not aim to identify the kinase(s) responsible for the phosphorylations at Tyr<sup>998</sup> and Ser<sup>991</sup>. Given evidence that EGFR endocytosis does not require EGFR kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), we predict that the Tyr<sup>998</sup> kinase is not the EGFR itself. Again this is consistent with Tyr<sup>998</sup> phosphorylation accumulating after the initial wave of EGFR autophosphorylation events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Quantification of EGFR-associated Proteins and Phosphorylation by SRM</title><p>The results obtained by SRM-based examination of a limited set of receptor-associated proteins are consistent with the conclusion that the S991A and Y998F variants are defective in EGFR endocytosis. Among the six well established EGFR-associated proteins examined, the ubiquitin E3 ligase CBL and ubiquitin itself were found to differ from WT with one or the other endocytosis-defective receptor variant. Ubiquitin and CBL have defined roles in the down-regulation of EGFR and other receptor tyrosine kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Western blot analysis confirmed the diminished association of CBL with the activated variant receptors compared with WT and demonstrated that the mutant receptors remained competent for phosphorylation at Tyr<sup>1069</sup>, which is the direct binding site on the receptor for CBL. GRB2 is required for EGFR endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). In addition, it interacts with SHC and SOS1/2 as effectors of RAS and ERK downstream of activated tyrosine kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). The EGFR variants Y998F and S991A retained both EGF-stimulated phosphorylation at the principal GRB2 binding site Tyr<sup>1092</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) and GRB2 association in amounts not significantly different from WT. This further indicates that the early stages of ligand-stimulated receptor activation were not impaired by the Y998F and S991A mutations and that the endocytosis defects associated with Y998F and S991A are not a consequence of impaired GRB2 bindings to the receptors.</p><p>The EGF-stimulated increase in receptor-associated ubiquitin displayed by the variant receptors (although for S991A it was less than that of WT) is consistent with the conclusion that to some extent they did become internalized. However, our data do not address which proteins in the receptor complexes were covalently modified by ubiquitin.</p></sec><sec><title>A Link between EGFR Recycling and Degradation Pathways</title><p>Our data revealed an unforeseen connection between the pathways of EGFR recycling and down-regulation. The p38 MAP kinase-dependent phosphorylations at Ser<sup>1039</sup> and Thr<sup>1041</sup> in the endocytosis-defective variants were pronounced. Because the phosphorylations at Ser<sup>1039</sup> and Thr<sup>1041</sup> were EGF-stimulated, we conclude they are a normal part of the EGF response and that the Y998F and S991A mutations do not themselves constitute a &#x0201c;stress&#x0201d; that induced the recycling response in cells. Unmapped p38-dependent phosphorylation(s) in a 21-residue segment of the receptor (spanning 1026&#x02013;1046) that includes these residues was shown previously to be required for EGFR recycling following cell treatments including TNF&#x003b1;, osmotic stress, UV irradiation, and the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatinum but was not linked to EGF ligand-stimulated EGFR endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Indeed p38 kinase is not required for EGF-stimulated EGFR internalization but is required subsequently for CBL-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of internalized EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). We speculate that the phosphorylations at positions Ser<sup>991</sup> and Tyr<sup>998</sup> that accompany EGFR activation by ligand are normally involved in dampening the levels of phosphorylation at Ser<sup>1039</sup> and Thr<sup>1041</sup> as part of a mechanism to prevent receptor recycling and promote receptor destruction. In this model, the endocytosis defects associated with the S991A and Y998F variants may be due in part to inappropriate phosphorylation at Ser<sup>1039</sup> and consequently uncoordinated trafficking of internalized receptors.</p><p>In conclusion, our results identify the Ser<sup>991</sup> and Tyr<sup>998</sup> phosphorylation sites as important determinants in ligand-stimulated EGFR endocytosis linked to p38 MAP kinase-dependent receptor phosphorylation at Ser<sup>1039</sup> and Thr<sup>1041</sup>.
