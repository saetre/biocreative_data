Genetic screens for mutants with altered drug-induced behaviors thus provide an unbiased approach to define novel molecules involved in the process. We identified mutations in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> LIM-only (LMO) gene, encoding a regulator of LIM-homeodomain proteins, in a genetic screen for mutants with altered cocaine sensitivity. Reduced <italic>Lmo</italic> function increases behavioral responses to cocaine, while <italic>Lmo</italic> overexpression causes the opposite effect, reduced cocaine responsiveness. Expression of <italic>Lmo</italic> in the principal <italic>Drosophila</italic> circadian pacemaker cells, the PDF-expressing ventral lateral neurons (LN<sub>v</sub>s), is sufficient to confer normal cocaine sensitivity. Consistent with a role for <italic>Lmo</italic> in LN<sub>v</sub> function, <italic>Lmo</italic> mutants also show defects in circadian rhythms of behavior. However, the role for LN<sub>v</sub>s in modulating cocaine responses is separable from their role as pacemaker neurons: ablation or functional silencing of the LN<sub>v</sub>s reduces cocaine sensitivity, while loss of the principal circadian neurotransmitter PDF has no effect. Together, these results reveal a novel role for <italic>Lmo</italic> in modulating acute cocaine sensitivity and circadian locomotor rhythmicity, and add to growing evidence that these behaviors are regulated by shared molecular mechanisms. The finding that the degree of cocaine responsiveness is controlled by the <italic>Drosophila</italic> pacemaker neurons provides a neuroanatomical basis for this overlap. We propose that <italic>Lmo</italic> controls the responsiveness of LN<sub>v</sub>s to cocaine, which in turn regulate the flies' behavioral sensitivity to the drug.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Expression of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> LIM-only (LMO) gene in circadian pacemaker cells is required for the normal behavioral sensitivity of these animals to cocaine</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cocaine, a naturally occurring plant alkaloid, is the prototype addictive psychomotor stimulant. It elicits a variety of acute behavioral changes ranging from mood elevation, disinhibition, and motor activation at low doses to compulsive stereotypies and psychosis at higher doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Gawin1">Gawin 1991</xref>). Long-term cocaine use generally results in tolerance to many of its subjective effects, an increased craving towards the drug, and, eventually, drug abuse and addiction.</p><p>Cocaine's primary mechanism of action is to bind and inhibit plasma membrane monoamine transporters, thereby increasing synaptic monoamine neurotransmitter levels and potentiating their actions. Cocaine's direct role in increasing dopamine (DA) in the nucleus accumbens via inhibition of the DA transporter (DAT) has contributed to the prevalent DA hypothesis of drug addiction, which posits that the shared ability of drugs of abuse to increase DA in the nucleus accumbens underlies their reinforcing properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Wise1">Wise and Bozarth 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Kuhar1">Kuhar et al. 1991</xref>). More recent animal studies, however, have shown that cocaine still elicits a robust conditioned place preference in mice with genetic deletions of DAT, suggesting that the rewarding properties of cocaine are not solely mediated by its action on DAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Sora1">Sora et al. 1998</xref>). Additional studies on mice in which the serotonin transporter or norepinephrine transporter has been deleted, together with studies using selective serotonin transporter or norepinephrine transporter inhibitors, have suggested roles for both serotonin and norepinephrine systems in mediating cocaine's rewarding properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Uhl1">Uhl et al. 2002</xref>). These data show that the molecular bases for cocaine's psychostimulant and reinforcing properties are more complicated than once thought, and that a combination of actions at multiple sites may mediate its effects. Indeed, multiple genes and signaling pathways have been implicated in the stimulant and rewarding properties of cocaine in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Laakso1">Laakso et al. 2002</xref>).</p><p>The fruit fly <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila melanogaster</named-content> has been advanced as a useful model system for identifying novel genes that regulate behavioral responses to drugs of abuse including cocaine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Wolf1">Wolf and Heberlein 2003</xref>). Several of cocaine's most characteristic properties have been recapitulated in flies. First, cocaine induces motor behaviors in flies (see below) that are remarkably similar to those observed in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-McClung1">McClung and Hirsh 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Bainton1">Bainton et al. 2000</xref>). Second, repeated cocaine administration induces behavioral sensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-McClung1">McClung and Hirsh 1998</xref>), a form of behavioral plasticity believed to underlie certain aspects of addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Robinson1">Robinson and Berridge 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Schenk1">Schenk and Partridge 1997</xref>). Finally, a key role for dopaminergic systems in mediating cocaine's effects has been demonstrated through both pharmacologic and genetic methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Bainton1">Bainton et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Li1">Li et al. 2000</xref>). More importantly, <italic>Drosophila</italic> studies have identified genes and pathways whose role in cocaine responsiveness had not been anticipated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Hirsh1">Hirsh 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Rothenfluh1">Rothenfluh and Heberlein 2002</xref>). For instance, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> circadian gene <italic>period</italic> was identified as a necessary mediator of cocaine sensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Andretic1">Andretic et al. 1999</xref>). Subsequently, mice carrying various <italic>period</italic> mutations were found to have altered cocaine sensitization and conditioned place preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Abarca1">Abarca et al. 2002</xref>).</p><p>In order to identify novel molecules and pathways involved in behavioral responses to cocaine, we carried out a genetic screen for <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutants with altered acute responses to cocaine. Here, we report the phenotypic and molecular characterization of mutations in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> LIM-only gene, <italic>Lmo</italic> (also called <italic>Beadex &#x0005b;Bx&#x0005d;</italic>), isolated due to their increased sensitivity to cocaine-induced loss of negative geotaxis. The products of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammalian <italic>Lmo</italic> genes modulate the function of LIM-homeodomain (LIM-HD) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Milan3">Milan et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Retaux1">Retaux and Bachy 2002</xref>), which in turn regulate various aspects of nervous system development, including the specification of neural identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Thor1">Thor and Thomas 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Hobert1">Hobert and Westphal 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Shirasaki1">Shirasaki and Pfaff 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Tsalik1">Tsalik et al. 2003</xref>). We find that cocaine sensitivity is inversely related to the levels of <italic>Lmo</italic> function: reduced function causes increased sensitivity, while increased function causes resistance. This bidirectional regulation of cocaine responsiveness is mediated by <italic>Lmo</italic> function in a small set of neurons, the ventral lateral neurons (LN<sub>v</sub>s), which are the primary circadian pacemaker cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Helfrich-Forster1">Helfrich-F&#x000f6;rster 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Renn1">Renn et al. 1999</xref>). Like other mutants that affect LN<sub>v</sub> function, <italic>Lmo</italic> mutants show altered circadian locomotor behaviors. However, the roles of the LN<sub>v</sub>s in regulating cocaine sensitivity and circadian behavioral rhythms are genetically separable, as mutants lacking the neuropeptide PDF&#x02014;the only known functional output of these neurons&#x02014;show normal cocaine sensitivity. Thus, <italic>Lmo</italic> defines a novel role for the circadian pacemaker cells in regulating behavioral responses to cocaine.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Loss- and Gain-of-Function Mutations in the <italic>Lmo</italic> Locus Show Altered Cocaine Sensitivity</title><p>To identify novel molecules involved in cocaine-related behaviors, we carried out a genetic screen for mutants with altered acute responses to volatilized freebase cocaine using the crackometer, a simple assay that measures cocaine-induced loss of negative geotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Bainton1">Bainton et al. 2000</xref>). Screening of 400 first chromosome P-element insertions from the EP collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Rorth1">R&#x000f8;rth 1996</xref>) led to the identification of five mutants with reduced cocaine sensitivity and seven with increased sensitivity.

More recently, <italic>Bx</italic> mutants were shown to be overexpression alleles of <italic>Lmo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Milan3">Milan et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Shoresh1">Shoresh et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Zeng1">Zeng et al. 1998</xref>).

The resultant overexpression of <italic>Lmo</italic> causes decreased apterous activity in the dorsal compartment of the wing and, consequently, disorganization of the wing margin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Milan1">Milan and Cohen 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Milan2">2000</xref>).</p><p>We tested multiple available <italic>Bx</italic> alleles, and found that they all caused resistance to the acute effects of cocaine at every dose tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020408-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020408-g002">2</xref>B).

Because in <italic>Bx</italic> mutants <italic>Lmo</italic> transcripts are stabilized in their normal spatiotemporal pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Shoresh1">Shoresh et al. 1998</xref>), the observed cocaine phenotypes likely result from overexpression, rather than from misexpression of <italic>Lmo</italic>. Taken together with the loss-of-function effects described above (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020408-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020408-g001">1</xref>B), these data reveal a graded behavioral response to cocaine that is inversely related to <italic>Lmo</italic> levels.</p><p>In order to study <italic>Lmo</italic> mutant behavior in more detail, we recorded the cocaine-induced patterns of locomotor activity of control and <italic>Lmo</italic> flies using a movement tracking system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Bainton1">Bainton et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Wolf2">Wolf et al. 2002</xref>). Upon mock exposure, control flies showed robust locomotor activity, generally walking in straight lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020408-g001">Figure 1</xref>C, top left panel). At relatively low doses of cocaine (75 and 100 &#x003bc;g), flies engaged in stereotyped circling patterns of activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020408-g001">Figure 1</xref>C, top right panels). At higher doses (125&#x02013;200 &#x003bc;g), flies began to show spasmodic movements (seen as zigzag patterns in movement) and severe hypokinesis (data not shown; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Bainton1">Bainton et al. 2000</xref>). <italic>EP1306</italic> flies, while showing a reduced baseline speed, showed normal patterns of activity upon mock exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020408-g001">Figure 1</xref>C, bottom left panel). Upon exposure to cocaine, these mutant flies showed a shift in the dose&#x02013;response relationship. At low doses (75 &#x003bc;g), <italic>EP1306</italic> flies showed a marked increase in stereotyped circling behavior compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020408-g001">Figure 1</xref>C, bottom middle panel), while at higher doses (100 &#x003bc;g), the mutant flies were more likely to be spasmodic or akinetic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020408-g001">Figure 1</xref>C, bottom right panel). Thus, despite the reduced speed observed in the mock exposures, increases in specific cocaine-induced locomotor behaviors demonstrate that <italic>EP1306</italic> flies have a shifted dose&#x02013;response to cocaine: mutant flies exposed to 75 &#x003bc;g of cocaine behaved similarly to control flies exposed to 100 &#x003bc;g of the drug.</p><p><italic>Bx<sup>J</sup></italic> flies also showed changes in walking patterns that are consistent with a shift in the cocaine dose&#x02013;response relationship. After exposure to 100 &#x003bc;g of drug, most control flies showed slow circling behavior and some were akinetic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020408-g002">Figure 2</xref>C, top middle panel). <italic>Bx<sup>J</sup></italic> flies were much less affected, showing increased locomotion (mostly in straight lines), decreased slow circling, and almost no akinesia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020408-g002">Figure 2</xref>C, bottom middle panel). At 125 &#x003bc;g, control flies showed very little movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020408-g002">Figure 2</xref>C, top right panel), while most <italic>Bx<sup>J</sup></italic> flies continued to show circling behaviors seen in control flies at lower doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020408-g002">Figure 2</xref>C, bottom right panel). <italic>Bx<sup>J</sup></italic> flies, like <italic>EP1306</italic> flies, showed reduced activity upon mock exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020408-g002">Figure 2</xref>C, bottom left panel). Despite this reduced activity, these two mutants showed very different sensitivities to cocaine: <italic>EP1306</italic> flies were more affected and <italic>Bx<sup>J</sup></italic> flies were less affected, suggesting that the reduced activity upon mock exposure is unrelated to the cocaine response. Long-term activity recordings revealed no differences between <italic>Bx<sup>J</sup>, EP1306,</italic> and control lines (data not shown; see below).</p><p>In summary, using two different behavioral assays we show that flies carrying loss-of-function mutations in <italic>Lmo</italic> display increased sensitivity to the effects of cocaine on locomotor behaviors, while gain-of-function mutations show the converse effect, a reduced response to the drug. This inverse relationship between <italic>Lmo</italic> gene activity and drug responsiveness suggests that <italic>Lmo</italic> may regulate the expression of genes that might play a direct role in controlling cocaine responses (see Discussion).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Molecular Characterization of <italic>Lmo</italic> Mutants</title><p>The <italic>Lmo</italic> locus produces at least three transcripts by differential promoter use (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020408-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). The RA and RC transcripts differ only in their 5&#x02032; UTRs and are predicted to encode identical proteins of 313 amino acids; the RB transcript is predicted to utilize an alternative translational start site in its first exon, which would result in an addition of 71 N-terminal amino acids. The insertions that produce increased cocaine sensitivity all lie within the putative promoter region for the RA transcript, 25&#x02013;90 bp upstream of its transcriptional start site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020408-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). In order to identify molecular changes caused by these insertions, we assessed <italic>Lmo</italic> transcript levels by quantitative RT-PCR in wild-type flies and <italic>Lmo</italic> mutants. In wild-type flies the RA transcript was about 4-fold more abundant in heads as compared to bodies, suggesting that this transcript is enriched in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020408-g003">Figure 3</xref>B; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020408-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Importantly, the RA transcript was reduced by greater than 50&#x00025; in the heads, but not the bodies, of <italic>EP1306</italic> flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020408-g003">Figure 3</xref>B); a 40&#x00025; increase in the RA transcript was observed in the heads of <italic>Bx<sup>J</sup></italic> flies (data not shown). Thus, as predicted by the location of the P-element insertion, the <italic>EP1306</italic> mutation causes a reduction in <italic>Lmo</italic> transcript levels, a finding that is consistent with the observation that the cocaine sensitivity of <italic>EP1306</italic> flies is similar to that seen with known loss-of-function alleles of <italic>Lmo</italic> (the <italic>hdp</italic> alleles) and opposite to that seen with gain-of-function <italic>Bx</italic> alleles. In addition, the finding that transcript levels are specifically reduced in the heads of <italic>EP1306</italic> flies, and not their bodies, suggests that this mutation affects a nervous-system-enriched (or -specific) <italic>Lmo</italic> transcript (see below). Finally, none of the P-element insertions in the promoter of the RA transcript leads to a held-up wing phenotype, which is characteristic of loss-of-function <italic>hdp</italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Shoresh1">Shoresh et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Milan1">Milan and Cohen 1999</xref>).

First, we determined whether cocaine sensitivity was regulated by the circadian clock. For this purpose we entrained flies to light&#x02013;dark (LD) cycles and then tested them for cocaine sensitivity during the light and dark phases at 3-h intervals over 24 h (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).

The LN<sub>v</sub>s are a group of 8&#x02013;10 neurons in each brain hemisphere that express the neuropeptide PDF.

The development and structure of the PDF-expressing LN<sub>v</sub>s, the neurons to which we localize <italic>Lmo</italic> action, have been studied in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Helfrich-Forster1">Helfrich-F&#x000f6;rster 1997</xref>). The LN<sub>v</sub>s can be divided into two groups of 4&#x02013;5 neurons based on cell body size, projection pattern, and time of development. The s-LN<sub>v</sub>s, which arise in early larval development, project to the dorsal central brain, terminating near two sets of dorsal neurons that express clock genes at high levels. The l-LN<sub>v</sub>s arise during pupal stages and project onto the surface of the optic medulla, as well as to the contralateral LN<sub>v</sub>s through fibers running in the posterior optic tract. Both s- and l-LN<sub>v</sub>s have dense arborizations in the accessory medulla, a neuropil proposed to be a circadian pacemaker center in cockroaches and crickets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Helfrich-Forster2">Helfrich-F&#x000f6;rster 1998</xref>). An assessment of s-LN<sub>v</sub> and l-LN<sub>v</sub> numbers and detailed projection patterns revealed no differences between wild-type flies and <italic>Lmo</italic> mutants. Furthermore, by both quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, we determined that PDF levels are normal in <italic>Lmo</italic> mutants (data not shown). Expression of PDF, the only known LN<sub>v</sub> output, is restricted to the LN<sub>v</sub>s and a few tritocerebral neurons. As PDF expression is a specific marker for the differentiated state of the LN<sub>v</sub>s, it is unlikely that in <italic>Lmo</italic> mutants these neurons are grossly abnormal in their terminal differentiation.</p><p>The absence of obvious structural abnormalities of LN<sub>v</sub>s suggests that <italic>Lmo</italic> may play an active role in regulating cocaine responses. In fact, evidence is mounting that the expression and activity of LMOs are dynamically regulated within the nervous system.

Flies with LN<sub>v</sub> ablations show reduced sensitivity to cocaine, establishing that these cells normally increase behavioral responses to cocaine. Our experiments also indicate that LN<sub>v</sub>s drive circadian locomotor and cocaine behaviors in distinct ways. First, we found that sensitivity to cocaine is not modulated in a circadian manner, showing that the cocaine response is not simply an output of the central clock. Second, we showed that <italic>Lmo</italic> mutants, <italic>pdf</italic> mutants, and flies in which LN<sub>v</sub>s have been electrically silenced or ablated&#x02014;all known to display similar locomotor rhythm deficits&#x02014;show completely uncorrelated cocaine sensitivities: increased, unchanged, and reduced sensitivity, respectively. Lastly, we provide evidence that the LN<sub>v</sub> outputs that mediate cocaine and circadian behaviors are divergent. PDF, the only known LN<sub>v</sub> neurotransmitter, is required for normal locomotor rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Renn1">Renn et al. 1999</xref>). <italic>pdf</italic> null mutants, however, show normal cocaine responses. Furthermore, while synaptic silencing of PDF neurons does not disrupt circadian locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Kaneko2">Kaneko et al. 2000</xref>), we show here that the same manipulation reduces cocaine responses to the same extent as neuronal ablation. Together, these results imply the existence of an alternate, TeTx-sensitive functional output that mediates LN<sub>v</sub> modulation of cocaine responses. Interestingly, Blau and colleagues have also hypothesized a PDF-independent LN<sub>v</sub> output that regulates another rapid behavioral response, larval photophobicity (E. Mazzoni, C. Desplan, and J. Blau, unpublished data).</p><p>How might LN<sub>v</sub>s modulate circadian rhythmicity and cocaine sensitivity independently? It is possible that these cells use distinct output mechanisms, PDF to regulate circadian locomotor rhythms and another unknown signal to regulate cocaine sensitivity. Alternatively, these behaviors could be regulated by distinct subsets of LN<sub>v</sub>s. For example, several recent findings suggest that l-LN<sub>v</sub>s may play a lesser role in regulating circadian rhythmicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Helfrich-Forster3">Helfrich-F&#x000f6;rster 2003</xref>).

Moreover, the projections of l-LN<sub>v</sub>s connect the l- and s-LN<sub>v</sub>s from both brain hemispheres through projections in the posterior optic tract, suggesting a functional link between the two groups of cells. Whether <italic>Lmo</italic> functions in the s- and/or l-LN<sub>v</sub>s to regulate cocaine sensitivity and circadian rhythmicity cannot be established with currently available tools.</p><p>There is growing evidence for a functional link between circadian neurons and the modulation of cocaine-related behaviors. In mammals, the peptidergic neurons of the SCN have been shown by a variety of studies to be the central pacemakers controlling circadian rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-van1">van Esseveldt et al. 2000</xref>). Interestingly, the fetal mammalian SCN contains DA D1 receptors through which cocaine can influence entrainment of fetal biological rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Simonik1">Simonik et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Viswanathan1">Viswanathan et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Bender1">Bender et al. 1997</xref>). In addition, disruption of another major component of the mammalian circadian system, the pineal gland, or its secretory product melatonin, results in altered cocaine responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Uz1">Uz et al. 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Uz2">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Zhdanova1">Zhdanova and Giorgetti 2002</xref>). Hirsh and colleagues showed that mutants in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> clock genes <italic>period, clock,</italic> and <italic>cycle,</italic> but not <italic>timeless</italic> fail to sensitize to repeated cocaine exposures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Andretic1">Andretic et al. 1999</xref>). These genes, which are expressed at high levels in LN<sub>v</sub>s, have been to shown to act in these cells to modulate circadian behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Kaneko1">Kaneko et al. 1997</xref>). It is not known whether circadian gene function in LN<sub>v</sub>s also regulates behavioral sensitization to cocaine.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>How Might LN<sub>v</sub>s Modulate Cocaine Responses</title><p>We have demonstrated that LN<sub>v</sub> electrical activity and synaptic output contribute to cocaine-induced behavioral responses, raising a number of questions regarding the interaction of cocaine with these neurons and their output. We propose a simple model whereby the activity of some or all LN<sub>v</sub>s directly increases upon cocaine administration, which in turn results in cocaine-induced changes in locomotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020408-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Interestingly, a recent report showed that cultured LN<sub>v</sub> neurons can respond to either DA or acetylcholine, but not to glutamate, serotonin, octopamine, or histamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Wegener1">Wegener et al. 2004</xref>). The inferred presence of DA receptors on a subset of LN<sub>v</sub>s provides a potential mechanism by which LN<sub>v</sub> activity could be directly increased by cocaine administration, as cocaine's primary mechanism of action is to inhibit the reuptake of DA by DAT. In this model, when the LN<sub>v</sub>s are ablated or silenced, one site of cocaine action would be eliminated, thus reducing cocaine's effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020408-g009">Figure 9</xref>B).</p><p>How would <italic>Lmo</italic> fit into this model? We propose that in <italic>Lmo</italic> loss-of-function mutants, LN<sub>v</sub> output is boosted, possibly because of increased expression of DA receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020408-g009">Figure 9</xref>C), leading to enhanced cocaine sensitivity. Conversely, increased <italic>Lmo</italic> expression (in <italic>Bx</italic> mutants or in flies specifically overexpressing <italic>Lmo</italic> in PDF cells) would result in reduced receptor content and, consequently, in dampened cocaine sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020408-g009">Figure 9</xref>D). Further studies are needed to identify the putative DA receptor (or other molecules) that functions in LN<sub>v</sub>s to regulate cocaine-induced behaviors.</p><p>LMO-induced changes in receptor expression are not inconceivable given LMO's interaction with LIM-HD proteins. Changes in LIM-HD protein function have been shown to affect aspects of neuronal subtype identity, including neurotransmitter and receptor expression profiles. For instance, mutations in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> LIM-HD gene <italic>islet</italic> cause a loss of DA and serotonin synthesis, while ectopic expression leads to ectopic expression of tyrosine hydroxylase, an enzyme required for DA biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Thor1">Thor and Thomas 1997</xref>). In addition, expression of a <italic>Drosophila</italic> DA receptor in larval neurons requires the function of the LIM-HD gene <italic>apterous</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Park1">Park et al. 2004</xref>). The observation that DA receptor expression is also altered in various <named-content content-type="genus-species">Caenorhabditis elegans</named-content> LIM-HD mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Tsalik1">Tsalik et al. 2003</xref>) suggests an evolutionarily conserved role of LIM-HD proteins and possibly LMOs in the regulation of neurotransmitter identity and responsiveness. Consistent with this idea is the finding that <italic>Lmo</italic> homologs are highly expressed in the mesolimbic DA system of mice (A. Lasek, D. Kapfhamer, and U. H., unpublished observations)&#x02014;a neural pathway involved in the acute stimulant and rewarding properties of abused drugs. We posit that LMOs are ideally suited to modulate in a subtle manner the neurochemical identity and sensitivity of the nervous system to various stimuli, including drugs of abuse.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title/><sec id="s4a1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> culture and strains.</title><p>All flies were maintained on standard cornmeal molasses agar at 25 &#x000b0;C and 70&#x00025; humidity under constant weak light.

A drug effect score was determined as the average (measured every minute over 5 min) number of flies that remained on the bottom of the cylinder, expressed as percent of the total number of flies. Significance was established for each experiment as described in figure legends. Generally, either Student's paired <italic>t</italic>-tests assuming equal variance or one-way ANOVAs with post hoc Bonferroni planned comparisons or Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons were performed in GraphPad Prism 4 (GraphPad, San Diego, California, United States).

To observe cocaine locomotor activity patterns, ten flies were exposed to volatilized cocaine for 1 min, transferred to a 7.5 cm &#x000d7; 10 cm &#x000d7; 0.5 cm acrylic box, and images were captured on an Apple G4 computer (Apple, Cupertino, California, United States) using Adobe Premiere (Adobe Systems, San Jose, California, United States) at 10 frames/s for 5 min.

Chi-square periodograms were constructed according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020408-Sokolove1">Sokolove and Bushell (1978)</xref>, and significant circadian rhythmicity was defined as presence of a peak in periodogram power that extends above the 0.01 Chi-prosquare significance line. Since this line is equal to a power of approximately 175 at a period of 24 h, flies with no periodogram peak crossing the significance line were assigned a circadian power of 170. This would tend to overestimate the circadian power of these flies, and thus is conservative with regard to assessing statistical differences in power between genotypes exhibiting frequent arrhythmicity and those that are predominately rhythmic.
