Usually, G protein-coupled receptor signalling is negatively regulated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), preventing prolonged or inappropriate signalling. This study investigated whether GRKs regulate ET receptor contractile signalling in adult Wistar rat mesenteric arterial smooth muscle cells (MSMCs).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and results</title><p>ET-1-stimulated phospholipase C (PLC) activity and changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> were assessed using confocal microscopy in rat MSMCs transfected with the pleckstrin-homology domain of PLC&#x003b4;1 (eGFP-PH) and loaded with Fura-Red. ET-1 applications (30 s) stimulated transient concentration-dependent eGFP-PH translocations from plasma membrane to cytoplasm and graded [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increases. ET-1-mediated PLC signalling was blocked by the type A endothelin receptor (ET<sub>A</sub>R) antagonist, BQ123. To characterize ET<sub>A</sub>R desensitization, cells were stimulated with a maximally effective concentration of ET-1 (50 nM, 30 s) followed by a variable washout period and a second identical application of ET-1. This brief exposure to ET-1 markedly decreased ET<sub>A</sub>R responsiveness to re-challenge, and reversal was incomplete even after increasing the time period between agonist challenges to 60 min. To assess GRK involvement in ET<sub>A</sub>R desensitization, MSMCs were co-transfected with eGFP-PH and catalytically inactive <sup>D110A,K220R</sup>GRK2, <sup>D110A,K220R</sup>GRK3, <sup>K215R</sup>GRK5, or <sup>K215R</sup>GRK6 constructs. <sup>D110A,K220R</sup>GRK2 expression significantly attenuated ET<sub>A</sub>R desensitization, whereas other constructs were ineffective. Small interfering RNA-targeted GRK2 depletion equally attenuated ET<sub>A</sub>R desensitization. Finally, immunocyotchemical data showed that ET<sub>A</sub>R activation recruited endogenous GRK2 from cytoplasm to membrane.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These studies identify GRK2 as a key regulator of ET<sub>A</sub>R responsiveness in resistance arteries, highlighting the potential importance of this GRK isoenzyme in regulating vasoconstrictor signalling pathways implicated in vascular disease.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Endothelin-1</kwd><kwd>Endothelin-A receptor</kwd><kwd>G protein-coupled receptor kinase</kwd><kwd>Receptor desensitization</kwd><kwd>Vasoconstriction</kwd><kwd>Resistance artery</kwd><kwd>Mesenteric</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>primary-review-time</meta-name><meta-value><bold>Time for primary review: 23 days</bold></meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Endothelin (ET)-1 is a potent vasoconstrictor controlling vascular tone with an established role in vascular smooth muscle hypertrophy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C2">2</xref></sup> and hyperplasia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C4">4</xref></sup> fibrosis and inflammatory responses, leading to vascular remodelling and hypertension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C5">5</xref></sup> ET-1 plays a crucial role in a number of experimental models of hypertension,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C6">6</xref></sup> and increased plasma ET-1 levels have been reported in hypertensive patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C7">7</xref></sup> Endothelins can signal through two receptor subtypes ET<sub>A</sub> and ET<sub>B</sub>, however in arterial smooth muscle ET<sub>A</sub> receptors (ET<sub>A</sub>R) mediate constrictor responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C8">8</xref></sup> ET<sub>A</sub>Rs couple through G&#x003b1;<sub>q/11</sub> to activate phospholipase C (PLC), generating inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) and diacylglycerol (DAG), and leading to the release of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores and the activation of protein kinase C.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C8">8</xref></sup> ET<sub>A</sub>R-mediated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases underlie a major component of ET-1-induced vasoconstriction.

Over-stimulation of ET<sub>A</sub>R signalling clearly has adverse effects on vascular smooth muscle cells, and understanding the mechanisms that regulate G&#x003b1;<sub>q/11</sub> signalling is of potential importance in understanding and treating vascular diseases. Continual or repeated stimulation of receptors by agonists usually leads to reduced responsiveness to further agonist challenge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C11">11</xref></sup> This process, known as receptor desensitization, has been shown to protect cells from the adverse effects of over-stimulation or inappropriate signalling. Phosphorylation of key serine and/or threonine residues within the third intracellular loop and/or C-terminal tail of the G protein-coupled receptor is thought to be the primary event initiating desensitization and is often mediated by one or more members of a family of seven serine/threonine kinases, the G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C11">11</xref></sup> Phosphorylation by GRKs enhances receptor affinity for the non-visual arrestins 2 and 3, which can sterically suppress further interaction between receptor and G proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C12">12</xref></sup></p><p>Although previous studies have shown that recombinantly expressed ET<sub>A</sub>Rs are phosphorylated and desensitized in a GRK-dependent manner in model cells, such as HEK293 cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C13">13</xref></sup> little evidence is currently available to indicate which, if any, GRKs regulate endogenous ET<sub>A</sub>R signalling in vascular smooth muscle. This is an important issue as recombinant receptors are often regulated very differently to those expressed endogenously. Indeed, a growing number of studies are revealing that precise definition of the GRKs involved in receptor regulation can only be truly defined in a system endogenously expressing the receptor of interest and through manipulation of endogenous GRK populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C16">16</xref></sup> Here, we have combined confocal imaging techniques and specific inhibition of endogenous GRK isoenzymic activities to examine the interaction between GRKs and the native ET<sub>A</sub>R population in isolated, cultured mesenteric smooth muscle cells (MSMCs), a widely studied model of systemic resistance arteries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C17">17</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><label>2.</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><label>2.1</label><title>Isolation and culture of mesenteric arterial smooth muscle cells</title><p>Adult male Wistar rats were sacrificed by stunning and cervical dislocation, a method approved under the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.

Despite the clear potential pathophysiological importance of ET<sub>A</sub>R, relatively little is currently known regarding the regulation of this receptor subtype in native vascular tissue. To address this, we have used simultaneous confocal imaging of IP<sub>3</sub> (using eGFP-PH), [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> (using the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive dye Fura-Red), and DAG/PKC (using eGFP-PKCs) to investigate ET<sub>A</sub>R regulation by ET-1 in smooth muscle cells within days of isolation from resistance arteries. MSMC culture conditions were chosen to enable us to examine ET<sub>A</sub>R regulation in cells maintaining as far as possible an <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotype. High levels of &#x003b1;-actin and calponin expression, combined with visual evidence of smooth muscle cell contractions elicited by ET-1 (and other contractile agonists) indicated the maintenance of a contractile phenotype in these cultures.</p><p>In agreement with the previous reports, for example in HEK293 cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C22">22</xref></sup> the initial increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> stimulated by ET-1 in MSMCs rapidly declined towards basal, even in the continued presence of agonist. Brief (30 s) exposure to ET-1 was sufficient to cause extensive and prolonged loss of ET<sub>A</sub>R responsiveness to subsequent ET-1 re-challenge with respect to both IP<sub>3</sub> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. As expected, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals showed more rapid recovery than IP<sub>3</sub> signals reflecting the greater amplification of the former signal in the ET-1-stimulated ET<sub>A</sub>R-PLC signalling pathway. Previous studies in arterial tissue have tended to use prolonged (&#x0003e;60 min) ET-1 exposures leading to marked reductions in arterial contractions on ET-1 re-challenge, indicating profound ET<sub>A</sub>R desensitization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C23">23</xref></sup> and most probably ET<sub>A</sub>R down-regulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C24">24</xref></sup></p><p>Data from studies in recombinant cell systems suggest that GRKs are able to regulate ET<sub>A</sub>R signalling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C13">13</xref></sup> Indeed, when expressed in HEK293 cells, ET<sub>A</sub>R rapidly desensitized, and phosphorylation of the receptor was enhanced by recombinant over-expression of GRKs 2, 5, or 6.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C13">13</xref></sup> In addition, over-expression of recombinant GRK2 and GRK3 increased ET<sub>A</sub>R phosphorylation in CHO cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C25">25</xref></sup> Together these and other studies suggest that GRKs are able to cause ET<sub>A</sub>R phosphorylation, however, such studies are not necessarily predictive of how/if the receptor will be regulated by specific GRK isoenzymes in native ET<sub>A</sub>R expression systems. Therefore, a key objective here was to delineate for the first time the role that endogenous GRK isoenzymes play in ET<sub>A</sub>R regulation in resistance artery smooth muscle. Owing to the lack of effective and specific pharmacological GRK inhibitors, we applied previously validated molecular approaches to disrupt or decrease activity of specific endogenous GRK isoenzymes. Initially, we used dominant-negative (kinase-dead) GRK mutants to disrupt ET<sub>A</sub>R/GRK isoenzyme-specific interactions in an attempt to attenuate or prevent the reduction in ET<sub>A</sub>R responsiveness observed on re-addition of ET-1. The <sup>D110A,K220R</sup>GRK2 construct, which is mutated to prevent both kinase activity and G&#x003b1;<sub>q/11</sub>-binding,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C19">19</xref></sup> markedly attenuated ET<sub>A</sub>R desensitization. In contrast, over-expression of <sup>D110A,K220R</sup>GRK3, <sup>K215R</sup>GRK5, or <sup>K215R</sup>GRK6 mutants had no effect on the extent or time course of recovery of ET<sub>A</sub>R responsiveness to ET-1.</p><p>A potential criticism of the dominant-negative GRK over-expression approach is the possibility of &#x02018;off-target&#x02019; effects or lack of sufficient specificity towards the GRK isoenzyme being targeted. This clearly was not the case here given the marked contrast between effects of the GRK2 and 3 constructs, nevertheless, to provide a complementary experimental approach we used specific siRNAs to deplete (by &#x02265;75%) endogenous GRKs in MSMCs. In agreement with the <sup>D110A,K220R</sup>GRK2 experiments, siRNA-induced depletion of GRK2 also markedly attenuated the ET-1-induced ET<sub>A</sub>R desensitization with respect to IP<sub>3</sub>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and DAG/PKC signal readouts. Furthermore, redistribution of endogenous GRK2 from the cytoplasm to the membrane could be detected after a brief ET-1 stimulation, most likely indicating recruitment to agonist-occupied ET<sub>A</sub>Rs. Interestingly, despite previous reports of the plasma membrane association of GRK5, this isoenzyme is predominantly located within the nuclei of MSMCs. Nuclear accumulation of GRK5 has been reported previously in cardiomyocytes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C26">26</xref></sup> presumably as a consequence of its nuclear localization sequence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C27">27</xref></sup> Our study also represents a first report of the nuclear GRK5 localization in MSMCs, although the significance of this finding for GPCR signalling and vascular physiology remains to be established.</p><p>Collectively, these data indicate that GRK2 is the key endogenous GRK subtype initiating ET<sub>A</sub>R desensitization in MSMCs, with either GRK2 knockdown or disruption of the normal GRK2-ET<sub>A</sub>R interactions causing an &#x0223c;50% attenuation of ET<sub>A</sub>R desensitization. This partial blockade may arise, because the experimental strategy is incompletely effective, or may indicate that other, so far undefined mechanisms are involved in regulating ET<sub>A</sub>R responsiveness. In MSMCs, ET<sub>A</sub>R activation is known to recruit several PKC isoenzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C20">20</xref></sup> and PKC activation is known to phosphorylate ET<sub>A</sub>R, at least in a HEK293 cell background,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C13">13</xref></sup> suggesting a potential role for this protein kinase family in ET<sub>A</sub>R desensitization. In addition, PKCs are also known to phosphorylate GRK2 enhancing its membrane recruitment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C28">28</xref></sup> and ability to desensitize GPCRs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C29">29</xref></sup> Unfortunately, most of the available PKC inhibitors are fluorescent molecules precluding their use with the translocating, fluorescent biosensors. Consequently, we used the complementary approaches of inhibiting PKC activity with either the broad-specificity PKC inhibitor staurosporine, or down-regulating conventional and novel PKC isoenzymes through chronic treatment of MSMCs with the phorbol ester, PDBu. Neither manipulation of MSMCs suggested that PKCs play a role in the ET<sub>A</sub>R desensitization process nor alter the ability of GRK2 to exert its effect on the ET<sub>A</sub>R. Nevertheless, it remains a possibility that PKC-mediated ET<sub>A</sub>R phosphorylation may have as yet undefined roles in directing the signalling outputs of this receptor subtype (e.g. ET-1-mediated inhibition of K<sup>+</sup> channels to alter vasoconstrictor responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C17">17</xref></sup>). Nonetheless, since GRK2 inhibition appears only partially to prevent ET<sub>A</sub>R desensitization, it is possible that other mechanisms are involved, perhaps involving more distal regulatory processes such as &#x003b2;-arrestin binding,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C25">25</xref></sup> receptor internalization and/or receptor down-regulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C24">24</xref></sup></p><p>Accumulating evidence indicates that GRKs play an important role in the pathogenesis of vascular disease. In experimental systems, adenovirus-mediated over-expression of GRK2 in cultured rabbit aortic smooth muscle cells attenuated ET-1-induced proliferation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C30">30</xref></sup> whereas a two- to three-fold over-expression of GRK2 in vascular smooth muscle significantly reduced functional (increases in mean arterial pressure) responses to angiotensin II in mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C31">31</xref></sup> These findings suggest a protective role for GRK2 expression, presumably by enhancing the desensitization of these pro-hypertensive signals. However, in apparent contradiction to these findings, GRK2 expression has been reported to be enhanced in both hypertensive patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C32">32</xref></sup> and rat models of hypertension. A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that over-expression of GRK2 not only attenuates vasoconstrictor (e.g. angiotensin II) signalling, but also vasodilator signalling. Specifically, signalling through the &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor is substantially reduced in vascular smooth muscle over-expressing GRK2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C31">31</xref></sup> In addition, since GRK2 is able to suppress G&#x003b1;<sub>q</sub>-signalling through its N-terminal RGS-like domain,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C11">11</xref></sup> it is conceivable that elevated GRK2 expression is initially an adaptive response to over-stimulation of G&#x003b1;<sub>q</sub>-signalling pathways, preventing inappropriate vasoconstriction and resultant hypertension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C33">33</xref></sup> It is therefore clear that GRK2 is linked to hypertensive adaptations, but its exact role in the development of hypertension merits further investigation. In summary, here we have provided important new evidence highlighting the role played by GRK2 in regulating ET-1/ET<sub>A</sub>R/G&#x003b1;<sub>q</sub>-mediated vasoconstriction and suggest that this GRK isoenzyme might protect against ET-1-induced vascular dysfunction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CVP310C34">34</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supplementary material</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cardiovascres.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/cvp310/DC1">Supplementary Material is available at <italic>Cardiovascular Research</italic> online.</ext-link></p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was generously supported by the <funding-source>British Heart Foundation</funding-source> [<award-id>PG06/161/22136 and RG06/008/22062</award-id>].
