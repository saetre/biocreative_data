First, WxxxE effector Map triggers transient formation of filopodia. Then, following recovery from the filopodial signals, EPEC triggers robust actin polymerization via a signalling complex comprising Tir and the adaptor proteins Nck. In this paper we show that Map triggers filopodia formation by activating Cdc42; expression of dominant-negative Cdc42 or knock-down of Cdc42 by siRNA impaired filopodia formation. In addition, Map binds PDZ1 of NHERF1. We show that Map&#x02013;NHERF1 interaction is needed for filopodia stabilization in a process involving ezrin and the RhoA/ROCK cascade; expression of dominant-negative ezrin and RhoA or siRNA knock-down of RhoA lead to rapid elimination of filopodia. Moreover, we show that formation of the Tir-Nck signalling complex leads to filopodia withdrawal. Recovery from the filopodial signals requires phosphorylation of a Tir tyrosine (Y474) residue and actin polymerization pathway as both infection of cells with EPEC expressing TirY474S or infection of Nck knockout cells with wild-type EPEC resulted in persistence of filopodia. These results show that EPEC effectors modulate actin dynamics by temporal subverting the Rho GTPases and other actin polymerization pathways for the benefit of the adherent pathogen.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The Rho GTPases are ubiquitous proteins expressed in yeast, plants and mammals. To date, at least 25 Rho GTPases have been identified in human cells where they regulate various cellular processes including actin polymerization, microtubule dynamics, cell cycle and transcriptional regulation, morphogenesis and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2002</xref>). Among the Rho GTPases, Cdc42, RhoA and Rac-1 are particularly well characterized. The Rho GTPase Cdc42 is localized at the plasma membrane and Golgi network and induces formation of filopodia, regulates Golgi to endoplasmic reticulum transport, as well as endocytosis and exocytosis. RhoA, which is found at the plasma membrane and in the cytosol, promotes formation of stress fibres and focal adhesions, regulating cell shape, attachment and motility. Rac-1, which is found exclusively at the plasma membrane, stimulates formation of lamellipodia and membranes ruffles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Wennerberg and Der, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Ridley, 2006</xref>).</p><p>The Rho GTPases act as molecular switches cycling between GTP-bound (active) and GDP-bound (inactive) conformations. Switching a GTPase on and off is mediated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Rossman <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). The Rho GTPases transmit signals in a GTP-dependent manner by activating and/or recruiting downstream effector proteins to their sites of action. In addition, the GDP-bound Rho GTPases can interact with the Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDI) that prevent membrane association by masking the prenyl group and stabilize the inactive form. Because Rho GTPases play multiple roles in the cell and actively control actin cytoskeleton, they are common target of many microbial pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Finlay, 2005</xref>). Indeed, a large number of toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Lemonnier <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>) and bacterial effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Schlumberger and Hardt, 2005</xref>) regulate the Rho GTPases to allow bacteria or viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Favoreel <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>) to invade, spread or survive in the eukaryotic cell. Among these bacteria are <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> and <italic>Shigella</italic> spp. that invade eukaryotic cells and enteropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (EPEC), enterohemorrhagic <italic>E. coli</italic> (EHEC) and the mouse pathogen <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic>, which colonize the gut via attaching and effacing (A/E) lesion formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Frankel and Phillips, 2008</xref>). The ability to induce A/E lesion is dependent on the LEE pathogenicity island that encodes gene regulators, the outer membrane adhesin intimin, a type III secretion system (T3SS) and several effector proteins that upon translocation are able to subvert diverse cellular functions (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Garmendia <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Recently, a number of known T3SS effector proteins from different bacterial pathogens were grouped together based on the presence of a conserved Trp-xxx-Glu (WxxxE) motif and their capacity to affect the Rho GTPase signalling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Alto <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). The WxxxE effectors are found in <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp. (SifA and SifB), <italic>Shigella</italic> spp. (IpgB1 and IpgB2), EPEC strain E2348/69 (Map), EPEC strain B171 (Map, TrcA, EspM1), EHEC O157:H7 (Map, EspM1, EspM2) and <italic>C. rodentium</italic> (Map, EspM2, EspM3, EspT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Arbeloa <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Bulgin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p>The LEE-encoded Map (mitochondrial associated protein) was first described as an EPEC effector protein that is targeted to the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Kenny and Jepson, 2000</xref>) via a small peptide signal corresponding to the amino terminal 44 amino acids. In yeast, Map enters the mitochondria after binding the mitochondrial translocase Tom22, Tom40 and the matrix chaperon mtHsp70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Papatheodorou <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Moreover, Map alters mitochondrial morphology and membrane potential <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Ma <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Papatheodorou <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). In addition, Map triggers transient formation of filopodia in cultured human cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Kenny <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Alto <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Kenny <italic>et al</italic>. (2002</xref>) showed that Map activates Cdc42, while others have suggested that Map can bypass Cdc42, triggering filopodia via a Cdc42 molecular mimicry mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Alto <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Recently, Map was shown to bind, via its carboxy terminal PDZ ligand motif TRL, PDZ1 of the scaffold protein sodium/hydrogen exchanger regulatory factor-1 (NHERF1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Alto <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Simpson <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Importantly, no filopodia were observed at 30 min post infection of HeLa cells with EPEC expressing truncated Map (Map&#x00394;TRL). The mechanism through which the Map-NHERF1 protein complex contributes to filopodia formation is not known. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism-governing Map-induced filopodia formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Kinetic of filopodia formation on fibroblast 3T3 Swiss cells</title><p>In order to investigate the mechanism implicated in Map-induced filopodia formation and withdrawal, we established a Swiss 3T3 cell infection model, as these cells exhibit more active actin dynamic than most cell lines.

Formation of Map-induced filopodia was recorded over time. Filopodia, associated with microcolonies (more than 10 bacteria), were first visible at 5 min post infection with wild-type EPEC, peaked at 10 min (seen in 58% of adherent microcolonies) and disappeared at 20 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref>). In contrast, filopodia were very rarely observed at any time point after infection with E2348/69&#x00394;<italic>map</italic>.

For example, the <italic>Salmonella</italic> Spi1 effector SopE functions as a GEF for Cdc42 and Rac-1 to enable bacterial internalization, before being targeted to the proteosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Schlumberger and Hardt, 2005</xref>). Another Spi1 effector, SptP, then functions as a GAP turning the SopE signalling off. In this paper we have shown that EPEC also uses a two-component mechanism to modulate Rho GTPases; i.e. while Map activates Cdc42 and RhoA, inactivation involves the Tir-Nck-N-WASP signalling complex.</p><p>The cross-talk between Map and Tir requires biologically active effectors as EPEC overexpressing Map<sub>W74A/E78A</sub> has the same phenotype as EPEC &#x00394;<italic>map</italic> (i.e. microcolonies are exclusively associated with pedestals) while EPEC expressing TirY474S behaves as EPEC &#x00394;<italic>tir</italic> (i.e. microcolonies are exclusively associated with filopodia). Consistent with this, inhibition of the Cdc42 pathway blocked filopodia formation and led to widespread pedestals at early time points post infection while eliminating Nck, which links Tir to the actin cytoskeleton, blocked pedestal formation and promoted a long-term presence of filopodia.</p><p>Infection studies using animal models have shown that Tir is an essential virulence factor as deletion of <italic>tir</italic> results in severe colonization attenuation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Frankel and Phillips, 2008</xref>).

The fact that filopodia are seen first suggests that the presence of active Cdc42 and RhoA prior to Tir-mediated actin polymerization is advantageous. Indeed, using human intestinal <italic>in vitro</italic> organ culture it was recently shown that an EPEC <italic>map</italic> mutant induces formation of &#x02018;defective&#x02019; pedestals as the bacteria frequently fall off, leaving behind pedestal footprints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Shaw <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>).

(2006</xref>) suggested that IpgB1 mimics Rac-1, IpgB2 mimics RhoA and Map mimics Cdc42 in a GTPase-independent mechanism. A recent publication by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Handa <italic>et al</italic>. (2007</xref>) has shown that by binding the ELMO-DOCK180 GEF complex IpgB1 activates Rac-1. More recently, EspM effectors were shown to function upstream of RhoA activation leading to stress fibre formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Arbeloa <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). In this study, we demonstrated that Map (of EPEC, EHEC and <italic>C. rodentium</italic>) translocation leads to activation of Cdc42 which colocalizes within the filopodia structures themselves; this result is in agreement with the mechanism proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Kenny and Jepson (2000</xref>). The different conclusions regarding Map-induced filopodia could be due to the fact that while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Alto <italic>et al</italic>.

(2006</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Simpson <italic>et al</italic>. (2006</xref>) reported that the PDZ binding domain of Map is crucial for filopodia formation. These conclusions were made after infection or transfection of epithelial cells. In this study, using the highly dynamic 3T3 cells we found that while the PDZ-binding motif of Map plays no role in filopodia formation <italic>per se</italic>, it appears to have a role in retaining the formed filopodial structures on the cell surface. This activity is dependent on RhoA. One possible link between NHERF1 and RhoA is the ERM proteins, particularly ezrin. Indeed, an identical phenotype (i.e. rapid filopodia withdrawal with increased proportion of pedestals) was seen after infection of 3T3 cells with EPEC expressing Map&#x00394;TRL or infection of 3T3 cells transfected with dominant-negative RhoA or ezrin with E2348/69 &#x00394;<italic>map</italic> overexpressing Map<sub>EPEC</sub>. Similar result was obtained after infection of 3T3 cells treated with RhoA siRNA.</p><p>Based on our data we can now suggest a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7</xref>) in which EPEC infection triggers signal transduction pathways that while individually lead to either filopodia or pedestal formation, when crossed over fine-tune modulation of actin dynamic for the benefit of the adherent bacteria. According to our model following EPEC adhesion to the eukaryotic cell surface, either directly or via interaction with as yet unidentified GEF, Map activates Cdc42, leading to filopodia formation. Before clearing the cytosol and targeting the mitochondria, Map (alone or in complex with the GEF) transitorily interacts via its PDZ ligand motif with PDZ1 of NHERF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Alto <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Simpson <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). This leads to recruitment of activated ezrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Simonovic <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Morales <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>).

This interaction induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Tir (Y474), recruitment of Nck and activation of N-WASP, leading to Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization. Activation of this signal transduction pathway, probably in conjunction of Map mitochondria targeting, signals filopodia withdrawal. Downregulation of filopodia could be due to the fact that Nck sequesters N-WASP from the Cdc42-GTP pathway, as the former was shown to have a greater affinity to N-WASP than the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Tomasevic <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Alternatively, Tir-bound Nck might trigger local activation of GC-GAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Zhao <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>), which were reported to specifically inactivate Rac-1 and Cdc42. It is important to note that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Kenny <italic>et al</italic>. (2002</xref>) have suggested that filopodia withdrawal from infected HeLa cells is due to a GAP &#x02018;GXLR&#x02019; motif localized at the carboxy terminus of Tir itself.</p><p>In summary, our studies revealed a unique feedback regulation of actin dynamics by protein complexes and signal transduction pathways involving bacterial and eukaryotic proteins. The EPEC effectors appear to fine-tune temporal activation and de-activation of Rho GTPases and Nck recruitment for the benefit of the extracellular adherent bacteria. Elucidating this delicate process will undoubtedly contribute to a better understanding of EPEC disease, but will also likely lead to discovery of novel signalling pathway as the study of bacterial pathogens often does.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains and plasmids</title><p>The <italic>E. coli</italic> strains used in this study and their origin are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.
