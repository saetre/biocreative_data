Antizymes regulate polyamine levels primarily through binding ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), an enzyme key to polyamine production, and targeting ODC for destruction by the 26S proteosome. Ornithine decarboxylase antizyme 3 (OAZ3) is a testis-specific antizyme paralog and the only antizyme expressed in the mid to late stages of spermatogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>To see if mutations in the <italic>OAZ3 </italic>gene are responsible for some cases of male infertility, we sequenced and evaluated the genomic DNA of 192 infertile men, 48 men of known paternity, and 34 African aborigines from the Mbuti tribe in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The coding sequence of <italic>OAZ3 </italic>was further screened for polymorphisms by SSCP analysis in the infertile group and an additional 250 general population controls. Identified polymorphisms in the <italic>OAZ3 </italic>gene were further subjected to a haplotype analysis using PHASE 2.02 and Arlequin 2.0 software programs.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 23 polymorphisms were identified in the promoter, exons or intronic regions of <italic>OAZ3</italic>. The majority of these fell within a region of less than two kilobases. Two of the polymorphisms, -239 A/G in the promoter and 4280 C/T, a missense polymorphism in exon 5, may show evidence of association with male infertility. Haplotype analysis identified 15 different haplotypes, which can be separated into two divergent clusters.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Mutations in the <italic>OAZ3 </italic>gene are not a common cause of male infertility. However, the presence of the two divergent haplotypes at high frequencies in all three of our subsamples (infertile, control, African) suggests that they have been maintained in the genome by balancing selection, which was supported by a test of Tajima's D statistic. Evidence for natural selection in this region implies that these haplotypes may be associated with a trait other than infertility. This trait may be related to another function of OAZ3 or a region in tight linkage disequilibrium to the gene.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Polyamines are small, ubiquitous organic molecules derived from arginine or methionine. They carry a positive charge on each nitrogen atom, which allows them to interact with polyanionic macromolecules like DNA, RNA and some proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Often, these interactions are very specific, and play critical roles in normal cell growth and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Abnormal expression of polyamines has been associated with both apoptosis and tumor growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Consequently, polyamine concentrations are tightly regulated at transcriptional, translational, and post-translational levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), which converts ornithine to the first polyamine, putrescine, is the rate-limiting step in polyamine biosynthesis and the key point at which polyamine levels are regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In eukaryotic cells, the most important regulator of ODC is the protein ornithine decarboxylase antizyme (antizyme) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. When polyamine levels rise to a critical level they induce a +1 ribosomal frameshift in antizyme mRNA, producing a functional antizyme protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The antizyme protein binds ODC, preventing formation of the enzymatically-active ODC homodimer and targeting ODC for ubiquitin-independent proteolysis by the 26S proteosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In addition to inhibiting the production of intracellular polyamines, antizyme can also inhibit the import of extracellular polyamines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Antizyme genes have been identified from yeast to mammals. Most invertebrates have a single antizyme gene, while there are at least three independently conserved antizyme isoforms in vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Three main antizymes have been described in mammals. Antizyme 1 (AZ1) and antizyme 2 (AZ2) are generally thought to be present in all tissues except haploid male germ cells, with AZ1 mRNA being present in a 10- to 20- fold excess of AZ2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. AZ1 is more active in the degradation of ODC than AZ2, and both contribute to the negative regulation of polyamine transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Antizyme 3 (OAZ3) is expressed predominanty in round and elongating spermatids. Though AZ1 is expressed in early, diploid testicular germ cells, OAZ3 is the only antizyme present in post-meiotic, male germ cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Expression of OAZ3 follows closely behind ODC expression, which is tightly regulated in the testis, with a sharp spike in expression occurring during the late spermatocyte and early spermatid stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Transgenic male mice that overexpress ODC, resulting in increased synthesis of polyamines are infertile, with an almost complete lack of mature spermatozoa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] This suggests that OAZ3 might play an important role in maintaining spermatogenesis by controlling ODC and polyamine levels. A recent report indicates that OAZ3 may also interact with at least one additional protein in the testis, gametogenetin 1, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], in an unspecified manner. The function of gametogenetin 1 is unknown, but its testis-specific expression is similar to OAZ3 both spatially and temporally.</p><p>Infertility affects approximately 10% of couples, and in about half of these cases a male factor problem can be identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The etiology of male factor infertility is poorly understood. While some can be explained due to Y-chromosome microdeletions, endocrine disruptions, developmental abnormalities or environmental insults, the majority remains idiopathic and potentially genetic in origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Multiple studies, primarily through transgenic animal models, have helped develop a list of candidate genes that may contribute to human, male infertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Given its testis-specific expression and the clear link between deregulation of polyamine expression and infertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], <italic>OAZ3 </italic>is a clear choice for a male infertility candidate gene.</p><p>To determine if mutations in <italic>OAZ3 </italic>account for some cases of male infertility we screened 192 patients and 334 fertile or general population controls by either single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis (SSCP) or directly sequencing the exons and flanking intronic sequence of <italic>OAZ3</italic>. In addition to screening the <italic>OAZ3 </italic>gene for possible mutations associated with infertility we have also examined the frequency of haplotypes that emerged and the evolutionary relationships among the haplotypes. Finally, to examine the relationship between variation in this gene and disease phenotype, we tested for associations between haplotype and phenotype.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patient and control DNA samples</title><p>After obtaining Institutional Review Board approval, a total of 192 men presenting with primary infertility were enrolled at the University of Utah School of Medicine (Salt Lake City, UT) or the Weill-Cornell Medical Center (New York, NY). The patients were either azoospermic, having no sperm in the ejaculate (n = 143) or severely oligozoospermic, having less than five million sperm/ml. of semen (n = 49). These patients were selected because their phenotypes match those observed in mice overexpressing ODC, which exhibit both azoospermia, primarily due to maturation arrest, and oligozoospermia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. To increase the chance of identifying a mutation in the <italic>OAZ3 </italic>gene potentially responsible for male infertility or subfertility, and to decrease possible confounding factors, patients were excluded if they had any suspected or known causes of male infertility. For example, patients with a known Y-chromosome microdeletion, cystic fibrosis, varicocele, Klinefelter's, exposure to chemotherapeutics or radiation etc., were not included. Venous blood was drawn from each patient using standard techniques and DNA extracted using the Puregene DNA extraction kit (Genzyme, Minneapolis, MN).</p><p>In addition to the infertile group, all or part of <italic>OAZ3 </italic>was screened in three different control groups. The first group (n = 48), representing men with established paternity, was obtained from the Utah Genetic Reference Project (UGRP). These individuals are primarily of Northern European ancestry and are genetically very similar to the infertile group. The second group was a sample of central African aborigines (n = 34), all members of the Mbuti tribe from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The group is predominantly male, though there are a few females in the group. It is unknown which, if any of the group, are infertile. They were included in the study because they represent a group of genetically diverse individuals, geographically isolated from the infertile and fertile study groups, which is useful in determining how haplotypes may have evolved. The infertile and African groups were screened identically to the patient group by direct sequencing. A third and final general population group of men (n = 250), which included 90 African and 80 Asian males, was screened by SSCP analysis, specifically for the Pro164Ser change identified in one of the patient samples, but also for mutations in the coding regions in the rest of the gene. To assess evolutionary relationships with non-human primates, DNA was obtained and sequenced for both the common chimpanzee (<italic>Pan troglodytes</italic>) and gorilla (<italic>Gorilla gorilla</italic>).</p></sec><sec><title>Mutation screening</title><p>Primers were designed to amplify the promoter and five coding exons of <italic>OAZ3 </italic>with its flanking intronic sequence, using standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

A visual analysis was also conducted of the trace files to confirm identified polymorphisms and potential mutations. In addition to direct sequencing, the five coding exons of the 192 patient samples and exon 5 of the 250-member panel were screened for variants by SSCP.

Evolutionary relationships among haplotypes were inferred using Arlequin 2.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] to generate minimum spanning trees. Population genetic diversity was measured using two standard statistics, S and pi. S is the number of variable nucleotide positions in a sample, pi is the mean pairwise difference (per nucleotide) between sampled sequences. Pairwise differences among sequences were calculated by counting the number of nucleotide positions distinguishing each possible combination of the 2*N sequences in each sample, where N is the number of individuals in the sample.

Five of the remaining 13 nucleotide variants, numbers 1, 9, 11, 20, and 22 were unique to the infertile group while four variants, numbers 13, 15, 16 and 21 were unique to the aborigines. No significant differences were observed in allele frequencies between the infertile and control group. Significant differences in allele frequencies were found between the African group and both of the other two groups for all polymorphisms identified that were present in more than one individual (p &#x0003c; .001).</p><p>Assuming OAZ3 plays an integral role in spermatogenesis, At least two of the identified variants, variants 1 and 20, may be candidates for involvement in male infertility or subfertility. Variant 1, -239A&#x02192;G, identified in a heterozygous state in the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of an azoospermic patient, generates a new potential translation initiation ATG codon within a Kozak consensus sequence and occurs two basepairs downstream from a putative Inr binding site. Though translation initiated at this position encounters a stop codon just prior to the normal translation initiation site, it could potentially reduce the amount of OAZ3 mRNA available to translate. In this way it may reduce the total amount of OAZ3 in the testis and affect fertility.</p><p>The second variant, variant 20 (4280C&#x02192;T) in exon 5, results in the amino acid change Pro164Ser, and was identified in the heterozygous state in a single azoospermic patient by both direct sequencing and SSCP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This proline residue is conserved in human, mouse, rat, cow, pig, dog and opossum OAZ3. To further evaluate the significance of this change, exon 5 was screened by SSCP in an additional 250 controls, including 90 African and 80 Asian males. The P164S variant was not identified in this group, or any of the other controls. The patient was also negative for microdeletions of the Y-chromosome, the most common genetic cause of male infertility, using the Promega Y-chromosome microdeletion kit (Madison, WI). The parents and family of the affected individual were not available for screening to explore the possibility of haploinsufficiency produced by the mutation.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Segregation of SSCP bands for exon 5 of <italic>OAZ3</italic>.

Of the 16 variable nucleotides used, separate analyses of the affected, control, and African subsamples revealed 12, 7, and 12 variable nucleotide positions, respectively.</p><p>Analysis using the PHASE computer program indicated that the nucleotide variants were partitioned into 15 haplotypes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Most haplotypes were observed just once or twice in the sample, and haplotype frequencies were similar among the affected, control, and African subsamples. Three haplotypes (5, 9, and 12) accounted for more than 90% of observations and these were the most common haplotypes in all subsamples. However, while haplotype 12 was the most common haplotype in the affected and control subpopulations, followed by haplotype 5 and then haplotype 9, haplotype 9 was the most common haplotype in the African subsample.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Summary of inferred haplotype data.

Our results indicate that mutations in the <italic>OAZ3 </italic>gene are not strongly associated with human male infertility, though they may contribute to infertility in isolated instances. It is also possible that mutations in <italic>OAZ3 </italic>result in a phenotype different than the one we selected for. If that is the case, information from the OAZ3 knockout mouse, currently in progress, may provide a clue as to which human phenotype should be screened. One patient had a heterozygous change of a single, nonpolar proline residue to a charged, polar serine residue in exon five, Pro164Ser. It is not known if the proline residue is part of a functional domain or how its alteration might affect the function of the OAZ3 protein. It is conserved in all of the other OAZ3 sequences examined (Gorilla, chimpanzee, rat, mouse). We are aware of at least four proteins that interact with OAZ3 (unpublished data) and the proline residue may be important for correct protein interaction. The variation was not identified in any of the additional 191 infertile or 332 control individuals screened, indicating it is very rare. Currently, there is no direct evidence that the Pro164Ser mutation affects OAZ3 function. Additional studies will need to be conducted to determine how this mutation affects OAZ3 and spermatogenesis. Variant 1, a -239A&#x02192;G change in the 5' UTR of one infertile patient may also be of significance, as it was not identified in the fertile control group and might lead to reduced levels of OAZ3 being translated. The -239A&#x02192;G variant also occurs two basepairs downstream from a potential Inr transcription factor binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], which may possibly attenuate the transcription factor's interaction with the binding sequence.</p><p>Based on the NCBI SNPs database, at least 10 additional SNPs, which we did not identify, are located in the region we screened. Only one of these, rs 5777784, appears to have potential clinical significance. It shows the deletion of a guanidine in exon three, which would cause a frameshift mutation in <italic>OAZ3 </italic>and a truncated protein. As we did not detect this SNP in any of our samples, we cannot verify its existence.</p><p>The presence of two divergent haplotype clusters in our sample suggested that either balancing natural selection or population subdivision has been active in our study population. Both of these factors can maintain divergent alleles for extended periods of time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Balancing natural selection, for example, can maintain divergent alleles when heterozygotes have a fitness advantage, while population subdivision can maintain divergent alleles in different populations. However, the presence of the two divergent haplotypes at high frequencies in all three of our subsamples (infertile, control, and African) shows that subdivision cannot account for the presence of these divergent lineages. A better explanation is that balancing natural selection has historically been active in this region of the genome, or in some region in tight linkage disequilibrium with it.</p><p>To test whether balancing selection might be occurring in a region connected to <italic>OAZ3</italic>, we reviewed SNPs identified in <italic>OAZ3</italic>s nearest neighbors that might have functional implications for the protein. Only one SNP, an A&#x02192;G that converts a histidine residue to arginine in the final exon of the tudor and KH domain containing (<italic>TDRKH</italic>) gene, was identified. The 3' end of <italic>TDRKH</italic>, located on the opposite strand of <italic>OAZ3</italic>, overlaps with the 3' end of <italic>OAZ3</italic>, and the SNP in question lies in close proximity to the region from which the haplotypes were derived. The region containing the <italic>TDRKH </italic>SNP was amplified by PCR in 12 samples, six from each of the two major haplotypes and sequenced. While the SNP was identified in several of the patients, it appeared in both major haplotypes, indicating a different allele in the region is the one being maintained by balancing selection.</p><p>Evidence that balancing natural selection may have been active in the <italic>OAZ3 </italic>region is further supported by tests of Tajima's D statistic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Tajima's D compares estimates of diversity based on S and pi, which are affected differently by natural selection. Positive natural selection, for instance, which drives a new favored variant rapidly to high frequency, tends to reduce pi relative to S, causing negative values of D. In contrast, balancing natural selection tends to increase pi relative to S, causing positive values of D.</p><p>Initial tests of Tajima's D statistic showed that the D values observed in our sample, while positive, were not significantly different from neutral expectation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). However, these initial tests were performed under the assumption that human population sizes have been constant. This assumption is likely inappropriate, because archaeological and genetic evidence suggest that human populations expanded greatly &#x02013; more than 100-fold &#x02013; beginning roughly 100,000 years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. For this reason, we retested Tajima's D statistic under the conservative assumption that the human population increased 100-fold, from an initial effective population size of 10,000 (a typical estimate; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]), 100,000 years ago. Under this assumption, the observed values of D departed from expectation in every subsample, and in the sample as a whole. Thus, patterns of variation in this region are consistent with the hypothesis that balancing natural selection has been active.</p><p>One possible explanation for balancing selection is heterozygote advantage, which can result from increased homozygote mortality or increased heterozygote reproductive success. To test for this possibility we performed Chi-squared tests of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium on each SNP in our sample. Only two variants, variant 18 in the infertile group and variant 7 in the African group were significantly different than expected (p &#x0003c; .01). These tests show no evidence of a heterozygote excess and suggest that balancing selection in <italic>OAZ3 </italic>would be better explained by differences in pure reproductive success than by differences in survivorship. In the case of favored reproductive success, no excess of heterozygotes is expected, as random matings will return the population to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.</p><p>Signatures of natural selection can only arise when some sort of variation with phenotypic consequences, upon which selection can act, is present. Thus, evidence that balancing natural selection has been active in <italic>OAZ3 </italic>suggests that some kind of functional variation is present in or near this region. This variation is likely in linkage disequilibrium with the genetic variants that distinguish the two major haplotypes, which seem to have been maintained by selection. While the similar frequencies of these divergent haplotypes in our affected and control samples suggests that they are not likely associated with the phenotype examined here, they could be associated with other phenotypes related to OAZ3.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Polymorphisms in <italic>OAZ3 </italic>are not strongly associated with human male infertility, though some of the identified SNPs, like Pro164Ser in exon 5, may contribute to isolated cases of infertility. The presence of two divergent haplotype clusters in <italic>OAZ3</italic>, in all subsamples tested (infertile, control, African), implies the haplotypes are being maintained by balancing natural selection. Natural selection in this area indicates these haplotypes may be associated with a trait other than infertility. This trait may be related to either a different function of OAZ3 or a region in tight linkage disequilibrium to the <italic>OAZ3 </italic>gene.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>GC collected patient study samples, participated in experiments, collected and analyzed data, and drafted the manuscript.
