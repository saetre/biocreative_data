The hairpins are opened by the Artemis:DNA-PKcs complex, and then joined via the nonhomologous DNA end joining (NHEJ) process. Here we examine the opening of the hairpinned coding ends from all of the 39 functional human V<sub>H</sub> elements. We find that there is some sequence-dependent variation in the efficiency and even the position of hairpin opening by Artemis:DNA-PKcs. The hairpin opening efficiency varies over a 7-fold range. The hairpin opening position varies over the region from 1 to 4 nt 3&#x02032; of the hairpin tip, leading to a 2&#x02013;8 nt single-stranded 3&#x02032; overhang at each coding end. This information provides greater clarity on the extent to which the hairpin opening position contributes to junctional diversification in V(D)J recombination.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The enormous diversity of antigen receptor genes is generated through V(D)J recombination during B and T lymphocyte development. The exons encoding the antigen-binding variable domains of immunoglobulin and antigen receptors (TCR) are assembled by recombination of V (variable), D (diversity) and J (joining) elements or subexons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4">1&#x02013;4</xref>). The combinatorial diversity of numerous V, D and J elements, as well as nucleotide loss and addition at the recombination junctions (junctional diversification) combine to generate a potential repertoire of 10<sup>22</sup> murine antigen receptor molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>V(D)J recombination is directed by recombination signal sequences (RSS) flanking each coding element. There are two types of RSS: one with a 12 bp spacer between the heptamer and nonamer (12 RSS), and the other with a 23 bp spacer (23 RSS). RAG1/RAG2 proteins, together with HMG1 recognize the RSS and initiate V(D)J recombination by, creating a nick between the 3&#x02032; end of the coding segment and the 5&#x02032; end of the heptamer. Synapsis of two different RSSs (one 12 and one 23 RSS) results in completion of cleavage, where the 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl group at the coding end attacks the opposing strand to form a hairpin at the coding end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The two blunt signal ends are later joined directly with no nucleolytic processing of the ends. The coding end hairpins are opened by Artemis:DNA-PKcs, and then joined by nonhomologous DNA end joining (NHEJ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Due to the intrinsic error-prone nature of NHEJ, the resulting coding joints usually exhibit nucleotide loss and additions of up to &#x0223c;15 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Nucleotide additions include P (palindromic) nucleotides from asymmetric hairpin opening, as well as N nucleotides from TdT activity. These junctional regions between V, D and J subexons encode the most highly variable regions in the antigen receptor variable domain, called complementarity determining region 3 or CDR3.</p><p>The assembly of the antigen receptor repertoire relies on many factors. Coding end and signal sequences can markedly affect the recombination frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11">9&#x02013;11</xref>). The binding of the RAGs to various signal sequences and the varied cleavage efficiency by the RAG complex at different coding segments both contribute to this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Previous studies from our group analyzed the 39 functional human V<sub>H</sub> elements at the human immunoglobulin heavy chain locus for RAG cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). The preferred cleavage of the RAG complex at different coding segments corresponds well to the observed profile of unselected V<sub>H</sub> family usage in humans. However, the efficiency of the subsequent NHEJ steps has yet to be determined by direct experiments.</p><p>Recombination between the same two coding segments could yield different junctions due to nucleotide loss and addition during NHEJ. But the diversity at the junctions can be restricted when the coding ends bear short regions of homology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Homology may account for overrepresentation of certain combinations that are important in immune recognition of common pathogens. For example, the D<sub>FL</sub>16.1-J<sub>H</sub>1 maximum homology joint is present in most T15-positive antibodies, which are critical in protection against <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). The position of hairpin opening after RAG cleavage may greatly affect the homology between two coding ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Here we analyzed the 39 functional V<sub>H</sub> segments for hairpin opening by Artemis:DNA-PKcs in an <italic>in vitro</italic> system. The hairpin opening generates 3&#x02032; overhangs that vary from 2 to 8 nt, with the dominant length being 4 nt. These biochemical observations provide the essential basis for understanding the extent to which asymmetric hairpin opening contributes to V(D)J recombination junctions formed <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Oligonucleotides</title><p>The oligonucleotides (oligonts) used for the hairpin opening in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.

The 5&#x02032; ends of the oligonts were labeled with <sup>32</sup>P, as indicated by the asterisk. To assess the sequence effect on coding end hairpin opening efficiency, we first examined the time course of the endonuclease activity to make sure our assay conditions were in the linear range. Two of the coding end hairpin substrates (CE1 and CE9, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> for sequences) were assayed for hairpin opening by Artemis:DNA-PKcs as a function of time. We find that the primary product of hairpin opening is at 2 nt on the 3&#x02032; side of the hairpin tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). The endonucleolytic activity of Artemis remains constant throughout the 90-min incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B).</p><p>Various DNA structures containing single-/double-strand transitions can be opened by the Artemis:DNA-PKcs complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), and a 3&#x02032; DNA overhang substrate shows higher cleavage efficiency.

Cleavage by Artemis:DNA-PKcs occurs primarily at 4 and 5 nt 3&#x02032; of the single-/double-strand transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). The endonuclease activity also remained linear for over 1 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D).

As expected, with 75 mM KCl, the amount of overall phosphorylation is reduced by about 3-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, lanes 3 versus 4). The addition of Ku slightly reduces Artemis phosphorylation, while it increases DNA-PKcs autophosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, lanes 4 versus 5).

Despite the decreased phosphorylation at 75 mM KCl, the nuclease activity was not affected.

Artemis:DNA-PKcs recognizes the single-/double-strand transition region on different substrate structures. Therefore the sequences that would affect hairpin opening efficiency probably lie close to the hairpin tip. The terminal 15 bp of the coding end sequences from the 39 V<sub>H</sub> elements is highly homologous. Sequence alignment revealed 17 different sequences. Accordingly, we created 17 different coding end hairpin opening substrates (CE1 to CE17). To minimize breathing at the blunt end, we incorporated a 6 bp GC clamp to stabilize the hairpin structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>The hairpin opening pattern by Artemis:DNA-PKcs for the 17 different coding end hairpins derived from 39 human V<sub>H</sub> elements.

Because the substrates have hairpin structures, they cannot be fully denatured in the gel and often run as multiple bands. The substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, &#x02018;S&#x02019; lanes) were loaded next to the products to help identify the cleavage products. For every substrate, two different markers with sequences and lengths of the expected hairpin opening products were prepared and loaded onto the same gel adjacent to the product lanes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, &#x02018;M&#x02019; lanes). The exact position of hairpin opening was determined by comparing products with the markers. All of the hairpins were opened primarily at the +2 position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B), consistent with our previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). However, about two-thirds of the hairpin substrates (11 out of 17) were also opened at the +1 position, and three substrates were also opened at +3 and one substrate was opened at +4 position (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). The amount of major cleavage products (opened hairpin) at the +2 position varied over a 7-fold range among this set of natural human V<sub>H</sub> substrates, with 1&#x02013;4% of most hairpin opening substrates converted to product. We compared the sequences of the coding end hairpins and found no distinct pattern for preferred cleavage. It is surprising, however, that a one base-pair difference located 5 bp away from the hairpin tip can change the hairpin opening efficiency considerably (compare CE 1, 2 and 17). This study shows that the sequence differences between human V<sub>H</sub> coding ends must affect hairpin structure in a manner to which Artemis is highly sensitive.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>It has been known that asymmetric opening of hairpinned coding ends contributes to junctional addition. However, the variability in the position of hairpin opening and efficiency of opening has not been examined previously. The study here shows that different hairpin sequences are opened by the native DNA-PKcs and full-length Artemis in variable ways and with varying efficiency. The variation in position is important from the standpoint of immunologic diversity. The variation in efficiency of this hairpin opening step will be important in future considerations of the rate-limiting steps of V(D)J recombination.</p><sec><title>Correlation between hairpin opening by the Artemis:DNA-PKcs complex and the phosphorylation by DNA-PKcs</title><p>The endonucleolytic activity of Artemis:DNA-PKcs remains linear for at least 90 min <italic>in vitro</italic>, while the phosphorylation of Artemis and DNA-PKcs itself is relatively rapid, requiring &#x0003c;10 min. Phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs and Artemis is probably the &#x02018;priming&#x02019; stage of the cleavage reaction. The phosphorylated protein complex then changes conformation and cleaves DNA at the single-/double-strand transition of the DNA substrate. This is based on the fact that Artemis continues to cleave endonucleotically for over 1 h after the maximal phosphorylation of Artemis and DNA-PKcs. Autophosphorylation is known to facilitate the release of DNA-PKcs from DNA ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), but DNA-PKcs may retain the ability to bind DNA and assist the action of Artemis on other DNA molecules.</p><p>Despite a higher salt condition (75 mM KCl), which reduces the kinase activity of DNA-PKcs, this higher salt had no effect on the Artemis endonuclease activity. Different clusters of autophosphorylation sites exist in DNA-PKcs, and they are implicated in its various functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28 B29 B30">28&#x02013;30</xref>). Possibly the weaker phosphorylation observed at 75 mM KCl includes the activating cluster and is sufficient for kinase activation. Similar reasoning could be applied to the phosphorylation of Artemis. Fourteen phosphorylation sites have been identified on Artemis using an <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Among these 14 sites, certain fractions or combinations of residues may have more critical regulatory roles than the others.</p><p>The activity of Artemis:DNA-PKcs was not affected by Ku <italic>in vitro</italic>. A previous study by Goodarzi <italic>et al.</italic> suggested that Ku dependence is only detectable at higher salt conditions (75 mM KCl) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). However, in our <italic>in vitro</italic> assay, addition of Ku did not affect the kinase activity of the DNA-PKcs or the endonuclease activity of Artemis:DNA-PKcs at 75 mM relative to lower KCl concentrations. Ku increases the affinity of DNA-PKcs to DNA ends, thereby helping to activate the kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Possibly, <italic>in vivo</italic>, Ku is essential because the immediate repair of the DNA breaks is critical for cell survival, whereas <italic>in vitro</italic>, a high concentration of DNA ends in the test tube and long reaction times permit adequate binding of DNA-PKcs to the DNA ends.</p></sec><sec><title>Hairpin opening at the coding ends of the functional human V<sub>H</sub> segments</title><p>The coding ends were opened in a generally similar pattern despite substantial sequence differences. This further confirms that Artemis:DNA-PKcs is a structure-specific rather than a sequence-specific endonuclease and cleaves all single-/double-strand transitions. The hairpin opening positions all fall within 1&#x02013;4 nt to the 3&#x02032; side of the hairpin tip, with the 2 nt position (+2) being the primary hairpin opening site. The resulting coding ends contain 3&#x02032; overhangs of inverted repeats, 2&#x02013;8 nt in length, among which, 4 nt overhangs are the dominant species. Such inverted repeats, termed P (palindromic) nucleotides, were identified in V(D)J recombination junctions in all vertebrates. Statistical analysis on the human IgM sequences revealed potential P nucleotides of 1&#x02013;4 nt at the V&#x02013;D&#x02013;J junctions of the IgH gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), which coincides with our observation of hairpin opening at the +1 to +4 positions.</p><p>There are examples where the P nucleotides are a key determinant of antibody or T-cell receptor (TCR) specificity. First, T15 antibodies are optimally protective against <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> and other phosphocholine-bearing pathogens. The DJ junction in the T15 antibodies have a predominant, identical sequence, which is driven by alignment of microhomologies that include P nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Second, the nonclassical murine MHC class I molecules T10 and T22 have been found to be the natural ligands for a sizable population (0.2&#x02013;2%) of murine gamma-delta T cells. The specific recognition of T22 by the gamma-delta TCRs relies on the use of a 2 nt P-nucleotide during D&#x02013;J recombination, which encodes a leucine at a key position in this particular TCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Third, neonatal murine Ig VDJ segments lack N regions at their junctions. Their junctions are often directed by terminal microhomology, and P nucleotides are an important part of this terminal homology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>).</p><p>Most coding joints in V(D)J recombination do not retain P nucleotides at the coding ends, but rather show nucleolytic resection. Artemis has a 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; exonuclease activity but no 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Hence, it would not further process the 3&#x02032; overhang unless this end were to breath. Breathing of the ends may expose the 5&#x02032; end to the exonuclease activity of Artemis. The resulting longer 3&#x02032; overhang may then be cleaved by Artemis. The varying extent of nucleotide loss during coding joint formation observed at different loci may be a reflection of the level of microhomology inherent to the sequences.</p><p>The efficiency of hairpin opening at the 17 different coding end hairpins varies over a 7-fold range. We examined the differences in coding end sequence carefully and could not identify a preferred cutting sequence. Previous studies revealed marked differences between the nicking efficiencies by the RAG complex at the various human V<sub>H</sub> elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). The hairpin opening efficiency by Artemis:DNA-PKcs complex displays no correlation with the V<sub>H</sub> element utilization preferences <italic>in vivo</italic>. Given that the other NHEJ proteins (Ku, pol mu and lambda, and XLF:DNA ligase IV:XRCC4) are structure-specific enzymes or binding proteins, our results further support the dominating role of RAG nicking efficiencies for V<sub>H</sub> element utilization.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by NIH grants to M.R.L.
