Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling and its downstream Notch pathway play critical roles in arterial cell fate determination. We have recently shown that Foxc1 and Foxc2, two closely related Fox transcription factors, are essential for arterial cell specification during development by directly inducing the transcription of Delta-like 4 (Dll4), a ligand for Notch receptors. However, the basic mechanisms whereby the VEGF and Notch signaling pathways control transcriptional regulation of arterial-specific genes have yet to be elucidated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodologies/Principal Findings</title><p>In the current study, we examined whether and how Foxc transcription factors are involved in VEGF and Notch signaling in induction of Dll4 as well as the Notch target gene Hey2 in endothelial cells. We found that Foxc1 and Foxc2 directly activate the Hey2 promoter via Foxc binding elements. Significantly, Foxc2 physically and functionally interacts with a Notch transcriptional activation complex containing Su(H) and Notch intracellular domain to induce Hey2 promoter activity. Moreover, activation of the Dll4 and Hey2 promoters is induced by VEGF in conjunction with either Foxc1 or Foxc2 more than by either component alone. VEGF-activated PI3K and ERK intracellular pathways modulate the transcriptional activity of Foxc proteins in Dll4 and Hey2 induction.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Our new findings demonstrate that Foxc transcriptional factors interact with VEGF and Notch signaling to regulate arterial gene expression in multiple steps of the VEGF-Dll4-Notch-Hey2 signaling pathway.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Advances in understanding the basic mechanisms of the formation and remodeling of blood vessels have led to the identification of several signaling molecules that are critical for vascular development.

In this process, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling activates the Delta-Notch pathway, including Notch1 and its ligand, Delta like 4 (Dll4), in arterial endothelial progenitors. Notch signaling subsequently upregulates the expression of Hey transcription factors, thereby specifying an arterial cell fate. Whereas mutant mice for Hey2 (also known as CHF1, Herp1, Hrt2, Hesr2 or gridlock in zebrafish) show no obvious vascular abnormalities with multiple cardiac defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002401-Donovan1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002401-Sakata1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, compound Hey1; Hey2 mutant embryos have impaired arterial-venous specification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002401-Fischer1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002401-Kokubo1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, similar to those seen in mutant mice for Notch receptors and ligands, including Dll4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002401-Duarte1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002401-Krebs1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

Indeed, endothelial cells of compound <italic>Foxc1; Foxc2</italic> homozygotes fail to induce arterial-specific genes, including <italic>Dll4</italic> and <italic>Hey2,</italic> whereas venous markers such as COUP-TFII and EphB4 are normally expressed in these mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002401-Seo2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. These results suggest the lack of Foxc1 and Foxc2 results in a failure of arterial cell specification during development. On the other hand, overexpression of Foxc1 and Foxc2 upregulates the expression of arterial-specific genes in cultured endothelial cells. Most importantly, Foxc proteins directly activate the Dll4 promoter through a Fox-binding element (FBE) that is conserved between human and mouse. Taken together, Foxc transcription factors act upstream of Notch signaling in arterial specification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002401-Seo2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. However, it remains unknown whether VEGF signaling directly interacts with Foxc-mediated transcriptional control in arterial gene expression. Moreover, as we have recently demonstrated that Foxc1 and Foxc2 induce expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002401-Hayashi1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, Foxc proteins are likely to regulate multiple arterial-specific genes, including Hey2.</p><p>The aim of the present study is to define the molecular mechanisms by which Foxc transcription factors control arterial gene expression. We show here that Foxc1 and Foxc2 directly activate the Hey2 promoter via FBEs in endothelial cells. Remarkably, Foxc2 binds to a Notch transcriptional mediator, Suppressor of Hairless &#x0005b;Su(H)&#x0005d;, and directly contributes to Notch-dependent activation of the Hey2 promoter. Furthermore, we demonstrate that VEGF-mediated PI3K and ERK/MAPK pathways modulate the activity of Foxc proteins in the activation of the Dll4 and Hey2 promoters. Taken together, our new findings provide the mechanistic basis for transcriptional regulation of the arterial program in endothelial cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Reagents</title><p>Wortmannin was purchased from Invitrogen.

Similarly, Dll4 induction by Foxc1 was blocked by PI3K inhibition, whereas Hey2 induction by Foxc1 was augmented by ERK inhibition.

Our new findings in this paper demonstrate that Foxc1 and Foxc2 directly activate the Hey2 promoter through the FBEs and that Foxc2 cooperates with the Su(H)-NICD transcriptional complex in the induction of Hey2. Furthermore, Foxc1 and Foxc2 cooperate with the VEGF signaling pathway to activate the Dll4 and Hey2 promoters. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the basic mechanisms that control arterial gene expression in concert with the VEGF and Notch signaling pathways, and such novel regulatory mechanisms mediated by Foxc proteins provide new insight into the arterial program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002401-g005">Figure 5</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0002401-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002401.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Model for the involvement of Foxc proteins in arterial gene expression program.</title><p>Upon VEGF stimulation, the expression of Notch signaling genes, including the Dll4 ligand and the Notch1/4 receptors, as well as downstream targets of Notch signaling, including Hey2 and ephrinB2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002401-GregoBessa1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, is induced in endothelial cells.

Interestingly, it is noteworthy that MAPK activity stays much longer in the zebrafish embryo than in cultured endothelial cells. In any case, it should be emphasized that in both contexts, the two VEGF-mediated components, the PI3K and ERK pathways, appear to have opposing effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002401-Hong1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002401-Blum1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref> on arterial differentiation. One possibility to explain our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies is that PI3K-mediated inhibition of the ERK pathway leads to the activation of Foxc proteins. While we cannot exclude the possibility that Foxc function is, in part, independent of VEGF signaling, activity of Foxc proteins may be modulated by phosphorylation in response to VEGF. This idea is supported by evidence that human FOXC1 and FOXC2 are phosphorylated by EGF stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002401-Berry1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002401-Olsen1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref> and that human FOXC1 activity is elaborately modulated by phosphorylation levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002401-Berry1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002401-Berry2">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. In fact, both Foxc1 and Foxc2 have 10 potential phosphorylation sites for ERK that are conserved between human and mouse (data not shown). While there is no potential ERK1/2 phosphorylation site in the DNA binding-domains, the distribution of 10 potential sites in flanking N- and C-terminal regions are rather similar between the two proteins. It is conceivable that specific residues such as potential phosphorylation sites are commonly important for the function of Foxc1 and Foxc2. Further analysis is under way to define the amino acid residues in Foxc proteins that are phosphorylated in response to VEGF.</p><p>VEGF signaling induces the expression of Neuropilin 1 (Nrp1), as a positive-feedback loop to promote the arterial program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002401-Mukouyama1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>.
