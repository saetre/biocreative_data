This suggests they may be associated with disease aetiology and/or represents an attempt to remove abnormal protein aggregates. In this study the adenoviral mediated over-expression of HSP70 interacting protein (HIP) alone was shown to significantly reduce inclusion formation in both an <italic>in vitro</italic> model of Spinal Bulbar Muscular Atrophy and a primary neuronal model of polyglutamine disease. Experiments to determine the mechanism of action showed that: denatured luciferase activity (a measure of protein refolding) was not increased in the presence of HIP alone but was increased when HIP was co-expressed with HSP70 or Heat Shock cognate protein 70 (HSC70); the expression of polyglutamine inclusions in cortical neurons mediated an increase in the levels of HSC70 but not HSP70. Our data suggest that HIP may prevent inclusion formation by facilitating the constitutive HSC70 refolding cycle and possibly by preventing aggregation. HIP expression is not increased following stress and its over-expression may therefore reduce toxic polyglutamine aggregation events and contribute to an effective therapeutic strategy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>adenoviral</kwd><kwd>heat shock protein 70</kwd><kwd>HSC70</kwd><kwd>HSP70 interacting protein</kwd><kwd>Huntington&#x02019;s disease</kwd><kwd>polyglutamine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Polyglutamine (PolyQ) disorders such as Spinal and Bulbar Muscular Atrophy (SBMA) and Huntington&#x02019;s disease are caused by an expansion in the glutamine tri-nucleotide (CAG) repeat region of affected genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Fu <italic>et al.</italic> 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">La Spada and Taylor 2003</xref>). The expansion results in the production of mutant proteins which aggregate and form insoluble inclusions within affected neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Ordway <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>). The mechanism by which the mutant proteins mediate neuronal cell death remains uncertain. Insoluble nuclear or cytoplasmic disease protein inclusions were initially thought to activate apoptotic pathways and/or alter patterns of gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Lipinski and Yuan 2004</xref>). However, studies have suggested that small monomers of mutant protein are responsible for the observed neuronal toxicity and that insoluble inclusions are formed because of the sequestration of these monomeric mutant protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Watase <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Yu <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Arrasate <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>).</p><p>Molecular chaperones play a key role in protein synthesis and biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bukau <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>) and they are found bound to the insoluble protein inclusions that characterise neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease, Parkinson&#x02019;s Disease and many PolyQ diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Cummings <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Bailey <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Petrucelli <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>). Often the characteristic intracellular inclusions of each disease are associated with the small heat shock protein ubiquitin and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Muchowski and Wacker 2005</xref>). HSPs have therefore been hypothesised to be associated with the aetiology of these diseases and perhaps more likely that their up-regulation represents an attempt to refold or remove the abnormal protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Chai <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>). Consistent with the latter hypothesis are the observations that over-expression of HSP70 and proteins that facilitate targeting to the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) suppress aggregate formation in models of Huntington&#x02019;s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Howarth <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). The role small molecular co-chaperones play in facilitating the removal of protein inclusions has also recently been studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Jana and Nukina 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Jana <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). HSP70 interacting protein (HIP/p48) represents a unique class of co-chaperones that bind the ATPase domain of HSC70 and HSP70, stabilizing the complex formed with ADP and thus facilitates refolding of substrate proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Hohfeld <italic>et al.</italic> 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Bruce and Churchich 1997</xref>). In addition, HIP is reported to be a chaperone in its own right, binding to unfolded proteins and preventing their aggregation but not mediating refolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Bruce and Churchich 1997</xref>). Structural analysis of HIP demonstrated that this co-chaperone combines structural elements found in HSC70 and other HSC70/HSP90 associated co-chaperones, including tetracopeptide repeat regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Irmer and Hohfeld 1997</xref>) and several repeats of the tetrapeptide GGMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Hohfeld <italic>et al.</italic> 1995</xref>). Deletion studies revealed that the HSP70-binding domain and the homo-oligomerization domain of HIP are required for HSP70-mediated reactivation of denatured firefly luciferase. The evolutionary conservation of such domains suggests that HIP plays an important role in HSC70/HSP90 regulation, enabling the formation of multimeric chaperone complexes with their substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Irmer and Hohfeld 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bedard <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). However the role of HIP within a disease context has not yet been investigated.

In recent years strategies which may increase the removal of disease proteins (e.g. the stimulation of protein refolding and activation of proteasomal degradation pathways) have been examined. In this study we investigated for the first time the effect of expressing HIP, a positive regulator of HSP70 and HSC70, on the formation of inclusions containing PolyQ expansions. The results showed that viral-mediated over-expression of HIP alone significantly reduced inclusion formation in two polyglutamine disease models. Investigations into the mechanism of action showed that HIP could only facilitate luciferase refolding in the presence of HSP70 or HSC70. Interestingly, the expression of an expanded PolyQ tract in primary neurons increased the expression of HSC70 but not HSP70. Experiments using the SBMA model showed that the adenoviral mediated expression of HSC70 was more effective than HSP70 at reducing inclusion formation and that HIP facilitated HSC70/HSP70 mediated refolding activity. There was no evidence that the expression of HIP increased the ubiquitination of PolyQ substrates. Our data therefore suggest that HIP prevents inclusion formation by facilitating constitutive HSC70 chaperone activity and not by targeting to the ubiquitin proteosome system.</p><p>Prior work has shown that HIP prevented the aggregation of unfolded polypeptides but did not mediate refolding of denatured proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Hohfeld <italic>et al.</italic> 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Bruce and Churchich 1997</xref>). It was further hypothesised that HIP may contribute to the stabilisation of unfolded polypeptide substrates prior to interacting with HSC/HSP70 (ibid). HIP was originally reported to positively regulate HSC70 by binding and stabilising the ATPase domain when in the ADP-bound state. By performing this function, HIP is currently considered to antagonize the substrate discharging function of another co-chaperone molecule, BAG-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Nollen <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>). Thus HIP expression prevents the BAG-1 mediated slowing of the ATPase cycle of HSC70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Hohfeld and Jentsch 1997</xref>) and ensures optimal chaperoning of misfolded proteins. We found the expression of the co-chaperone molecules HSP40 and HIP led to a reduction in insoluble PolyQ proteins by enhancing the refolding of misfolded proteins. In the primary cortical neuron model, the expression of polyglutamine proteins resulted in a significant increase in HSC70 but this alone was not sufficient to reduce inclusions formation. This is likely to be because of the relatively weak ATPase activity of HSP70 family members. The introduction of co-chaperones enhances the efficiency of the HSC70 refolding cycle and HSP40 has been shown previously to decrease inclusion formation via this mechanism. The results of this study propose a similar role for HIP, which acts as a nucleotide exchange factor, enhancing substrate processing by HSC70 family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Hohfeld <italic>et al.</italic> 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Bruce and Churchich 1997</xref>).</p><p>In summary our data suggest that HIP suppresses the formation of insoluble PolyQ inclusions by: (i) facilitating the HSC70 refolding cycle, acting in concert with enhanced levels of endogenous HSC70 following PolyQ expression; (ii) binding to unfolded polyglutamine proteins and preventing their aggregation. Considering HSC70 levels may be elevated in the neurons expressing disease aggregates, increasing HIP/co-chaperone expression could prove to be a useful therapeutic strategy for the treatment of PolyQ diseases.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by grants from the Wellcome Trust.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Arrasate</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Mitra</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Schweitzer</surname><given-names>ES</given-names></name><name><surname>Segal</surname><given-names>MR</given-names></name><name><surname>Finkbeiner</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Inclusion body formation reduces levels of mutant huntingtin and the risk of neuronal death</article-title><source>Nature</source><year>2004</year><volume>431</volume><fpage>805</fpage><lpage>810</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15483602</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bailey</surname><given-names>CK</given-names></name><name><surname>Andriola</surname><given-names>IF</given-names></name><name><surname>Kampinga</surname><given-names>HH</given-names></name><name><surname>Merry</surname><given-names>DE</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Molecular chaperones enhance the degradation of expanded polyglutamine repeat androgen receptor in a cellular model of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy</article-title><source>Hum.
