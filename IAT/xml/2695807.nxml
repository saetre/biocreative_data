Many toxins are synthesized by plants as a defense mechanism against insect predation. One example of such a natural toxic molecule is <sc>l</sc>-canavanine, a nonprotein amino acid found in the seeds of many legumes. Whether and how insects are informed that some plants contain <sc>l</sc>-canavanine remains to be elucidated. In insects, the taste sense relies on gustatory receptors forming the gustatory receptor (Gr) family. Gr proteins display highly divergent sequences, suggesting that they could cover the entire range of tastants. However, one cannot exclude the possibility of evolutionarily independent taste receptors. Here, we show that <sc>l</sc>-canavanine is not only toxic, but is also a repellent for <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Using a pharmacogenetic approach, we find that flies sense food containing this poison by the DmX receptor. DmXR is an insect orphan G-protein&#x02013;coupled receptor that has partially diverged in its ligand binding pocket from the metabotropic glutamate receptor family. Blockade of DmXR function with an antagonist lowers the repulsive effect of <sc>l</sc>-canavanine. In addition, disruption of the DmXR encoding gene, called <italic>mangetout</italic> (<italic>mtt</italic>), suppresses the <sc>l</sc>-canavanine repellent effect. To avoid the ingestion of <sc>l</sc>-canavanine, DmXR expression is required in bitter-sensitive gustatory receptor neurons, where it triggers the premature retraction of the proboscis, thus leading to the end of food searching. These findings show that the DmX receptor, which does not belong to the Gr family, fulfills a gustatory function necessary to avoid eating a natural toxin.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Plants evolve to fend off the insects that attack them, often by synthesizing compounds toxic to insects.

To avoid eating toxins, animals are able to detect them by using a repertoire of taste receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000147-Scott1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Although it is recognized that a bitter taste sensation is critical to avoid toxic substances <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000147-Amrein1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000147-Behrens1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that have been established during evolution to detect a toxin are not well understood. In particular, how a receptor becomes tuned to a toxin is not well documented, mainly because the structure of its ligand binding pocket (LBP) and the evolutionary relationship with the ancestor receptor are not known.</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the family of gustatory receptors (Grs) is predicted to consist of 68 genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000147-Ishimoto1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000147-Robertson1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. This family of receptors, which consist of seven transmembrane domain proteins, is characterized by a very high level of amino acid divergence, showing as little as 8&#x00025;&#x02013;12&#x00025; amino acid identity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000147-Robertson1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Such diversity suggests that the Gr family could cover the entire range of taste-receptive capability of the fly. Nevertheless, the extreme divergence within this family does not exclude the possibility of evolutionarily independent insect taste receptors not belonging to the Gr family. To date, only few receptors of the Gr family have been associated with a specific taste molecule: for example, the receptor for the sugar trehalose, called Gr5a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000147-Dahanukar1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, and the bitter compound caffeine coreceptors, called Gr66a and Gr93a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000147-Lee1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000147-Moon1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Plants synthesize many toxic molecules as defense mechanisms against predation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000147-Wink1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000147-Wittstock1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

The best-characterized example of nonprotein amino acid that plays a defensive role is <sc>l</sc>-canavanine (2-amino-4-guanidinooxybutyric acid) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000147-Bell2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000147-Rosenthal1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, which is massively accumulated in the seeds of many legumes (up to 143 mM in <italic>Medicago sativa</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000147-Bell4">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>). <sc>l</sc>-Canavanine is a natural insecticide because it is structurally similar enough to <sc>l</sc>-arginine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000147.s001">Figure S1</xref>) to interfere with <sc>l</sc>-arginine metabolism and to be incorporated by arginyl-tRNA synthase in de novo proteins resulting in dysfunctional proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000147-Dahlman1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000147-Rosenthal3">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

To deal with this natural poison, some insects have generated several adaptive strategies. Indeed, the tobacco budworm <italic>Heliothis virescens</italic> uses detoxification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000147-Melangeli1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> and the beetle <italic>Caryedes brasiliensis</italic> feeds exclusively on <sc>l</sc>-canavanine&#x02013;containing seeds but catabolizes <sc>l</sc>-canavanine to <sc>l</sc>-canaline and urea <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000147-Rosenthal4">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. However, these two mechanisms to circumvent the toxic properties of <sc>l</sc>-canavanine are specific to few insect species. Thus, the evidence for a protective function against predation for such nonprotein amino acids, i.e., whether and how insects are informed that plants contain <sc>l</sc>-canavanine, remains to be shown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000147-Rosenthal1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Amino acids are known to be the ligands of G-protein&#x02013;coupled receptors (GPCRs) belonging to the family C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000147-Bockaert1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000147-BraunerOsborne1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.

This family includes metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). In mammals and in insects, mGluRs, which are activated by the neurotransmitter glutamate, play different roles in the central nervous system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000147-Conn1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000147-Parmentier1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. We have previously shown that one mGluR has diverged through evolution to give rise to the mX receptor, called DmXR in <italic>Drosophila</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000147-Mitri1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Orthologs of DmXR are so far only found in insects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000147-Mitri1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. DmXR differs from mGluRs in the distal part of the LBP, so that this receptor is an orphan receptor, which is not activated by glutamate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000147-Mitri1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.

To deorphanize the DmX receptor, we previously tested various molecules having such properties, including all the classical amino acids, and did not find any ligand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000147-Mitri1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Drosophilidae are saprophytic animals, and members of dipteran families such as Tephritidae or Scatophagidae are seed predators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000147-Crawley1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, so we asked whether <sc>l</sc>-canavanine could activate DmXR. Here, we show that <sc>l</sc>-canavanine is a ligand of DmXR in vitro. We then wondered whether insects could be informed that plants contain <sc>l</sc>-canavanine via the mX receptor. We have addressed this question by using <italic>Drosophila</italic> as an insect model. First, we confirmed that <sc>l</sc>-canavanine is highly toxic when ingested. We then tested whether <italic>Drosophila</italic> avoid eating food containing <sc>l</sc>-canavanine. We found that <sc>l</sc>-canavanine is recognized by flies and mediates a behavioral avoidance response via a chemosensory mechanism. Hence, <sc>l</sc>-canavanine is a repellent. We then analyzed the molecular and cellular bases of <sc>l</sc>-canavanine&#x02013;induced repulsive behavior, using gustatory behavior, pharmacology, and genetic approaches. We found that <sc>l</sc>-canavanine is detected in vivo by the DmX receptor. To control the <sc>l</sc>-canavanine avoidance behavior, the DmX receptor is expressed and required in bitter-sensitive gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs). These findings show that the gustatory detection of a natural toxin relies on DmXR, a divergent mGluR not belonging to the Gr family.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The Orphan Insect Receptor DmX Is Activated In Vitro by L-Canavanine</title><p>To test whether <sc>l</sc>-canavanine could activate DmXR, we transiently expressed this receptor in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells and assayed for <sc>l</sc>-canavanine&#x02013;induced DmXR activation.

In contrast, the close structural homolog <sc>l</sc>-arginine showed no agonist or antagonist effect on DmXR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000147-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). <sc>l</sc>-Canavanine did not activate HEK cells expressing the unique fly mGlu receptor, DmGluA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000147-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

Previous sequence analysis, mutagenesis, and 3-D modeling studies had shown that the LBP of the DmXR is very homologous to the LBP of mGluRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000147-Mitri1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. The residues contacting the amino acid moiety of glutamate (the &#x003b1;-COO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and NH3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> groups) are conserved in DmXR (e.g., Thr-176), whereas the residues interacting with the &#x003b3;-carboxylic group are not <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000147-Mitri1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.

This indicates that the plant amino acid binds into the LBP. Altogether our data show that DmXR is a <sc>l</sc>-canavanine receptor because of a partial modification of its LBP from the LBP of mGluRs.

Here, our results show that <sc>l</sc>-canavanine is detected as a repulsive molecule. With a pharmacogenetic approach, we have shown that <italic>Drosophila</italic> uses a taste detection mechanism mediated by the orphan GPCR, DmXR, which is activated by <sc>l</sc>-canavanine to trigger this avoidance behavior. This process occurs in bitter-sensitive GRNs where this receptor is expressed.</p><p>By using the two-choice feeding test, the repulsive effect of <sc>l</sc>-canavanine was clearly demonstrated. Contrary to the known repellents (caffeine, quinine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000147-Moon1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000147-Tompkins1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>), <sc>l</sc>-canavanine does not affect the PER. However, <sc>l</sc>-canavanine triggers the retraction of the proboscis following its initial extension impairing the food intake. Indeed, after the PER, WT flies usually sustain their proboscis extension to search for food when their legs are maintained in contact with the sugar solution. This sustained phase is strongly affected by <sc>l</sc>-canavanine, since significantly more flies prematurely retracted their proboscis at this stage. This inhibition of sustained proboscis extension is not specific for <sc>l</sc>-canavanine, but is also observed, with the same rate, in the presence of caffeine. Hence, caffeine induces a fast response, which is the PER inhibition, and a slow response, which is the PR, whereas <sc>l</sc>-canavanine only induces the slow response. One open question is to understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for such a difference between caffeine and <sc>l</sc>-canavanine in the response dynamics, knowing that both drugs act on the same cell type (Gr66a-GRNs). GPCR-induced signal transduction pathways rely on the activation of intracellular heterotrimeric G-proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000147-Kroeze1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000147-Neves1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>.

As we have shown in our cell transfection assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000147-Mitri1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> and this study), DmXR is a genuine GPCR. It is thought that the Gr66a receptor, like other Grs, is a putative GPCR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000147-Moon1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000147-Ebbs1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. However, we do not know to which type of G-protein these two receptors are coupled in vivo. A first explanation about the different dynamics induced by <sc>l</sc>-canavanine and caffeine could be that that DmXR and Gr66a are coupled to distinct G-proteins or that both receptors are coupled to the same G-protein, but with different efficiencies. A more speculative explanation may be due to the different structural features of the two receptors, taking into account that Grs are structurally related to the olfactory receptors in <italic>Drosophila</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000147-Scott2">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus, Gr66a receptor may also be a ligand-gated channel. Because of the absence of any intermediate, changes in membrane excitability would be more rapid in presence of caffeine compared to <sc>l</sc>-canavanine. This may explain the difference in the response dynamics between these two drugs.</p><p>This study shows that DmXR is expressed and required in bitter-sensitive leg GRNs. However, DmXR is also known to be expressed in the adult brain, in agreement with our observations that NP4288-GAL4 is expressed in this tissue (unpublished data). This suggests the existence of an unknown endogenous ligand, different from <sc>l</sc>-canavanine, triggering DmXR activation in the brain. To exclude any action of <sc>l</sc>-canavanine in the brain, we took care that flies avoided ingesting the drug solutions by applying them only on legs during the PER analysis. In addition, we used GRN-restricted drivers, allowing us to specifically analyze the peripheral function of DmXR. Finally, the absence of any defects in the caffeine-induced response of <italic>mtt</italic> mutants flies excludes a role of DmXR in second and higher order neurons involved in the control of the studied gustatory behavior. As we observed <italic>mtt</italic> expression in the labellum and in internal taste organs (LSO and VCSO), it is very likely that these taste sensilla also play a role in the <sc>l</sc>-canavanine&#x02013;induced aversive behavior. In agreement with this, we observed that flies did not drink a <sc>l</sc>-canavanine/sucrose&#x02013;containing solution when directly applied on the labellum (unpublished data), confirming the presence of <sc>l</sc>-canavanine&#x02013;sensitive GRNs. So, we assume that DmXR is a <sc>l</sc>-canavanine&#x02013;tuned gustatory receptor in all these taste organs.</p><p>Surprisingly, it is not a Gr member that has been selected to detect <sc>l</sc>-canavanine, despite the very high sequence diversity of this family. Indeed, DmXR belongs to the mGluR GPCR subfamily because of its close sequence relationship <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000147-Mitri1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. DmXR and mGluR LBP sequences and 3-D model comparisons have shown that DmXR has diverged only in the LBP part interacting with the &#x003b3;-carboxylic group of glutamate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000147-Mitri1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. These modifications have targeted and changed two residues that are conserved in all mGluRs and are crucial for glutamate-induced activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000147-Pin1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000147-Mitri1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Our study shows that these structural changes are correlated with the ligand selectivity of the receptor. Indeed, DmXR has a divergent LBP so that glutamate is no more an agonist but <sc>l</sc>-canavanine is. Conversely, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> mGlu ortholog receptor, DmGluA, is not activated by <sc>l</sc>-canavanine. This suggests that the original conformation of the mGluR LBP was more adapted to diverge and to recognize <sc>l</sc>-canavanine than the one of the Grs. In addition, to give rise to this new type of gustatory receptor, appropriate GRN expression has also been added during the evolution of the DmXR function since mGluR expression is mainly found in the central nervous system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000147-Conn1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, our study suggests that other GPCRs, different from Grs, may have evolved in insects to recognize specific tastants.</p><p>Finally, the insect-borne diseases are largely increasing, partly due to the development of insecticide resistance. Thus, it becomes urgent to identify insect-specific targets for the design of new drugs against insects. Our work illustrates that the pharmacological and functional characterization of the insect-specific GPCRs, which likely control insect-specific physiological processes, is a way to discover new protection or fighting strategies against harmful insects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Chemicals and Pharmacology</title><p><sc>l</sc>-glutamate, <sc>l</sc>-canavanine, <sc>l</sc>-arginine, and &#x003b3;-<italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>l</sc>-arginine (NMA) were from Sigma.

Soon after the sucrose stimulation, PER occurs, and flies usually sustain their proboscis extension to search for food. When the legs are in contact with the sucrose/canavanine solution, PER occurs normally, but the fly retracts its proboscis just after, leading to the end of food searching.
