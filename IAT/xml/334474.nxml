Mutation of this gene has been associated with dominant suppression of position-effect variegation. We have cloned and sequenced the gene encoding HP1 from Drosophila virilis, a distantly related species. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence with Drosophila melanogaster HP1 shows two regions of strong homology, one near the N-terminus (57/61 amino acids identical) and the other near the C-terminus (62/68 amino acids identical) of the protein. Little homology is seen in the 5' and 3' untranslated portions of the gene, as well as in the intronic sequences, although intron/exon boundaries are generally conserved. A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of HP1-like proteins from other species shows that the cores of the N-terminal and C-terminal domains have been conserved from insects to mammals. The high degree of conservation suggests that these N- and C-terminal domains could interact with other macromolecules in the formation of the condensed structure of heterochromatin.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00233-0185-a" xlink:role="6069"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00233-0183.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6067"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00233-0184.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6068"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00233-0185.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6069"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00233-0186.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6070"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00233-0187.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6071"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00233-0188.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6072"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00233-0189.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6073"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00233-0190.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6074"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
