Th1 cells produce the signature cytokine IFN-&#x003b3;, with the cytokine IL-12 produced by DCs being critical for their differentiation by inducing the activation of STAT-4 and up-regulation of T-bet transcription factor. In contrast, Th2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13, and their development is usually started by IL-4 signaling with the participation of the transcription factors STAT-6 and GATA-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). More recently, a third subset of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> effector T cells that produce IL-17, named Th17, has been described in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). These cells express a transcription factor different from those of Th1 and Th2 cells, the retinoic acid&#x02013;related orphan receptor &#x003b3;t (ROR&#x003b3;t) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Human Th17 cells were found to be different from mouse Th17 cells not only with regard to some phenotypic and functional features, but mainly because of their different mechanisms of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Several papers agree that mouse Th17 cells originate from naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in the presence of IL-6 and TGF-&#x003b2;, and their development is then stabilized and/or amplified by IL-23 and IL-21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). In contrast, human Th17 cells seem to originate in response to the combined activity of IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>), or the activity of IL-1&#x003b2; or IL-23 alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>), whereas the combined activity of IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-23 was not shown to have any additive or synergistic effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). Moreover, the addition of TGF-&#x003b2; to human naive or memory CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells was found to inhibit the development of Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). In another study, it was reported that IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-6 up-regulated ROR&#x003b3;t expression but did not induce Th17 differentiation in human adult naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, whereas IL-23 was a powerful up-regulator of its own receptor and was an important inducer of IL-17 and IL-22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). The discrepancy among results between humans and mice, and among different human studies, with regard to the development of Th17 cells has been attributed to the difficulty to ensure a truly naive cell population in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). More recently, the combined activity of IL-1&#x003b1; or IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-23 was found to be required for the enhancement of IL-17&#x02013;producing human memory T cells; however, in the same study, the differentiation of human naive T cells into Th17 cells could not be achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). In a previous paper, we showed that in addition to human memory T cells producing IL-17 alone (Th17), there are several T cells in both blood and tissues that coproduce IL-17 and IFN-&#x003b3; (Th17/Th1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). We also found that these two cell types express both ROR&#x003b3;t and T-bet and that Th17 cells could be shifted to Th1 by the addition of IL-12, an effect that was partially antagonized by IL-23, suggesting a flexibility of human Th17 cells and their possible common developmental origin with Th1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Furthermore, we and others identified IL-23R and CCR6 as surface molecules expressed by human Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>).</p><p>In this study, by using a microarray assay we found that <italic>CD161</italic> was one of the most up-regulated genes in human Th17 clones compared with Th1 or Th2 clones. Accordingly, T blasts from all Th17 clones expressed CD161 on their surface, whereas all Th1 or Th2 clones examined were CD161<sup>&#x02212;</sup>. All IL-17&#x02013;producing cells were found to be included within the CD161<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> fraction of adult circulating CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells; they were not CD1d-restricted natural killer T (NKT) cells, but NKT-like cells. When CD161<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> or CD161<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells were sorted from umbilical cord blood (UCB)&#x02013;naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells or from single-positive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> thymocytes and activated in the presence of IL-1&#x003b2; plus IL-23, Th17, Th17/Th1, or Th1, cells developed from the CD161<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> fraction, whereas CD161<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells could never been induced to differentiate into IL-17&#x02013;producing cells. In contrast, in the presence of IL-12, both CD161<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD161<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells only differentiated into Th1 cells. These findings indicate that CD161 is a novel surface marker for human IL-17&#x02013;producing cells and demonstrate that human Th17 and Th17/Th1 cells exclusively originate from an NKT-like CD161<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell precursor present in the UCB, in the presence of IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-23 as polarizing cytokines.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Human Th17, but neither Th1 nor Th2, clones express CD161 on their surface</title><p>In a previous study, we generated a series of Th1, Th2, and Th17 clones from human circulating CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). We performed a microarray analysis to identify possible differences in gene expression by Th17 clones compared with Th1 or Th2 clones. Among genes that fulfilled the criteria described in Materials and methods as up- or down-regulated genes in Th17 versus Th1 or Th2 clones, in addition to those expected on the basis of previous knowledge, such as <italic>IL-17</italic>, <italic>IL-26</italic>, <italic>IL-23R</italic>, <italic>ROR&#x003b3;t</italic>, and <italic>CCR6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>), there was also <italic>CD161</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). All genes showing a log<sub>2</sub> fold increase or decrease of &#x02265;2.5 in Th17 versus Th1 and Th2 clones are shown in Tables S1&#x02013;S4 (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080397/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080397/DC1</ext-link>). Therefore, CD161 expression was analyzed by either quantitative PCR or flow cytometry on a series of human Th1, Th2, or Th17 clones derived from healthy subjects and different from those used for the microarray assay. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>, Th17 clones expressed higher levels of CD161 mRNA than Th1 and Th2 clones, and virtually all of their T blasts expressed CD161, whereas T blasts from all Th1 and Th2 clones examined did not (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). CD161 expression by resting Th17 clones was not affected by anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 mAb stimulation in the presence of IL-2, and it was not induced on Th1 and Th2 clones (Fig. S1).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Human Th17 clones express the NKT cell marker CD161.</bold> (A) Volcano plot representation (log<sub>2</sub> fold change vs. <italic>t</italic> test p-value) between Th17 and Th1 (left) or Th2 (right) cell gene expression profiles.

To this end, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells purified from adult PBMCs of healthy subjects were sorted into CD161<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD161<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells, and the sorted populations were assessed by flow cytometry for their phenotypic features, as well as for their ability to produce IFN-&#x003b3; or IL-17 in response to PMA plus ionomycin stimulation. Virtually all CD161<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were contained within the CD45RA<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD45RO<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD31<sup>&#x02212;</sup> population (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080397/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080397/DC1</ext-link>), suggesting their nature as memory T cells. Moreover, the cells of the CD161<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> fraction produced IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-17, or both, whereas IL-17&#x02013;producing cells were virtually absent in the CD161<sup>&#x02212;</sup> fraction (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Using the same technique, the assessment of the production of IL-21 and IL-22 showed that both CD161<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and CD161<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were able to produce IL-21, whereas the ability to produce IL-22 was virtually restricted to CD161<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells (Fig. S3). The CD161<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD161<sup>&#x02212;</sup> fractions were also tested for ROR&#x003b3;t, IL-23R, and CCR6 mRNA expression. CD161<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells expressed higher levels of mRNA for ROR&#x003b3;t, IL-23R, and CCR6 than CD161<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Because human Th17 cells have been shown to express CCR6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>), the association between CCR6 and CD161 was assessed. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>, the majority of CD161<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells also expressed CCR6, and when CD161<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were sorted into CCR6<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and CCR6<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells, the great majority of IL-17&#x02013;producing cells appeared to be included in the CCR6<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> fraction.

Circulating CD161<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells containing IL-17&#x02013;producing cells were not type I (or classical) invariant NKT (iNKT) cells because they had a polyclonal V&#x003b1;24 TCR chain and exhibited a broad TCR V&#x003b2; repertoire, as shown by spectratyping analysis of both freshly isolated and 1-wk in vitro&#x02013;expanded cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>).

Moreover, the response of purified CD161<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> circulating T cells to allogeneic stimulation, as assessed by CD154 expression, was comparable to that of the CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD161<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cell fraction, and, more importantly it could be inhibited by the addition in culture of a blocking anti&#x02013;MHC class II mAb (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>).

These observations originated from the results of a microarray analysis performed on human CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell clones. This analysis showed that, in addition to up-regulated genes coding for molecules already known to be expressed by human Th17 cells, such as <italic>IL-17</italic>, <italic>IL-26</italic>, <italic>IL-23R</italic>, <italic>ROR&#x003b3;t</italic>, and <italic>CCR6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>), the <italic>CD161</italic> gene was also highly up-regulated on Th17 compared with either Th1 or Th2 clones. More importantly, all IL-17&#x02013;producing cells were contained within the CD161<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> fraction of adult circulating CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. Of note, virtually all CD161<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were contained in the CD45RA<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD45RO<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD31<sup>&#x02212;</sup> population, suggesting their nature as memory T cells. Moreover, among these cells there was a strict association between the expression of CD161 and CCR6, a chemokine receptor which has been found to be prevalently expressed by human Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>), such that virtually all IL-17&#x02013;producing cells appeared to be contained in the CCR6<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> fraction of the CD161<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> population. Accordingly, IL-23R and ROR&#x003b3;t mRNA expression was restricted to the CD161<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CCR6<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cell fraction. The ability to produce IL-22 after stimulation was virtually restricted to the CD161<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> circulating CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, whereas the production of IL-21 was shared by both CD161<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD161<sup>&#x02212;</sup> circulating CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. The latter findings are in keeping with previous observations showing that IL-21 production is not restricted to Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>), whereas IL-22 and IL-17 are coexpressed by Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>).</p><p>CD161 (or NKR-P1A) is the human homologue of the mouse NK1.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>), which is expressed not only on almost all NK cells but also by a subset of T cells that have been named NKT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). The classical, type I NKT cells are &#x003b1;-galactosylceramide reactive and CD1d restricted, and use an invariant TCR &#x003b1; chain consisting of V&#x003b1;14-J&#x003b1;18 and a limited &#x003b2; chain repertoire dominated by V&#x003b2; 8.2, V&#x003b2;7, or V&#x003b2;2 in mice, and of V&#x003b1;24-J&#x003b1;18 with V&#x003b2;11 in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>).

In addition to iNKT, NKT cells not bearing the V&#x003b1;24-J&#x003b1;18 (human) or the V&#x003b1;14-J&#x003b1;18 (mice) TCR, but still dependent on CD1d antigen presentation, have also been identified and named as nonclassical or type II NKT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). These cells can express diverse but few (V&#x003b1;3.2-J&#x003b1;9 and V&#x003b1;8) TCR &#x003b1; chains and can be identified by CD1d tetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>).

CD161<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were found to be a minority (about one out of five) among human circulating CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>), with the great majority of them expressing CD45RO, which suggests their nature as memory T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). In contrast, the percentage of iNKT cells among human circulating CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells is &#x0003c;1% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>), which is in contrast with the observations in mice, where the majority of circulating NK1.1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells are iNKT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). The IL-17&#x02013;producing CD161<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells described in this study were not CD1d-restricted NKT cells because they had a TCR V&#x003b1; and V&#x003b2; repertoire heterogeneity incompatible with CD1d restriction, and their response to allogeneic stimulation or stimulation with a soluble antigen, such as PPD, was inhibited by blocking MHC class II. Despite the fact that human IL-17&#x02013;producing cells are not iNKT but NKT-like cells, our findings may appear in disagreement with those reported in mice showing that a subset of iNKT cells produces IL-17, but curiously, whereas most mouse iNKT cells express NK1.1 (NKR-P1C), the IL-17&#x02013;producing iNKT cells are NK1.1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). However, by using the microarray assay on mouse NKT cells, production of IL-17 by both NK1.1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and NK1.1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells upon activation in vitro has also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>).</p><p>The most intriguing observation emerging from this study was the demonstration that not only do human Th17 cells express CD161 during their life, but they can also exclusively originate from a CD161<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell precursor. In agreement with the results previously reported by van Beelen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>), we were unable to induce the development of Th17 cells from the purified CD45RA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD45RO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> (naive) circulating CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells of adult subjects. Accordingly, virtually no CD161<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were found by us within the CD45RA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD45RO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> population of adult circulating CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. In contrast, in this study small numbers of Th17 cells originated from human UCB CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells after polyclonal stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 mAb in the presence of IL-1&#x003b2; plus IL-23. Notably, when UCB CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells were sorted into CD161<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and CD161<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells, constitutive expression of ROR&#x003b3;t, IL-23R, and CCR6 was found, but only in the CD161<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> fraction. More importantly, Th17 cells only developed from the CD161<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> fraction and their frequency could reach substantial levels (&#x0003e;20%) after a repeated 2-wk stimulation. Because UCB CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells consisted not only of CD45RA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD45RO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells but also of double-positive CD45RA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD45RO<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells, whose functional nature is difficult to define, the possibility that UCB CD161<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells give rise to IL-17&#x02013;producing cells, representing the expansion of a small population of contaminating memory T cells present in the UCB as a consequence of fetal immune system stimulation during pregnancy, could be hypothesized. However, this possibility can be reasonably excluded on the basis of three main observations. First, neither CD161<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> nor CD161<sup>&#x02212;</sup> UCB CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells produced any cytokine in response to stimulation with PMA plus ionomycin except IL-2, which is a functional property of naive T cells. Second, both CD161<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD161<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells showed comparable TREC levels, which were significantly higher than those of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD45RA<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD45RO<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (memory) adult circulating T cells. Third, when the CD161<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> fraction of UCB CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells was completely deprived of CD45RO<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells, including those coexpressing CD45RA, the remaining CD45RA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD45RO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> population maintained the ability to differentiate into IL-17&#x02013;producing cells in response to the stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 mAb in the presence of IL-1&#x003b2; plus IL-23. Finally, and more importantly, completely similar results were obtained when the small population of CD161<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells present among single-positive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> T cells of postnatal human thymuses was assessed. Obviously, why CD161<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> UCB or thymic naive T cells can differentiate into Th17 cells, whereas purified CD45RA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>RO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> circulating CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from adult subjects do not (see Results) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>), remains unclear. However, the latter finding is in keeping with the observation reported in this paper that CD161<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells are apparently not present in the CD45RA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD45RO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> fraction of circulating CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from adult subjects. Thus, if adult circulating CD45RA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD45RO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells contain some Th17 precursors, they are certainly present in much lower proportions than in UCB. One might speculate that Th17 responses are mainly mounted during the perinatal period. However, this would imply that for an effective Th17 response, all possible bacterial pathogens should present themselves during the perinatal period, which is very unlikely. Thus, a more likely possibility to explain why Th17 precursors are more numerous in UCB than in adult blood may be that they migrate very early into tissues, where they can differentiate into IL-17&#x02013;producing cells even later in life.</p><p>The results of this study also support our previous findings suggesting that human Th1 and Th17 cells may have a close developmental relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). We could indeed confirm that a substantial proportion of IL-17&#x02013;producing cells, even after their development from naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, also possess the ability to produce IFN-&#x003b3; (Th17/Th1), which may represent an intermediate phenotype between Th1 and Th17 cells. Moreover, we clearly showed that human naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells can give origin to either Th1 or Th17 cells in the presence of IL-1&#x003b2; plus IL-23, with the presence of IL-12 being determinant for the Th1 choice. Therefore, the origin of human Th17 cells seems to be more similar to that initially reported in mice, when it was thought to depend on the balance between IL-12 and IL-23 production and their interaction with IL-12R or IL-23R, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>).</p><p>The mechanisms linking together the expression of CD161 and the ability to develop into IL-17&#x02013;producing cells in the presence of the appropriate cytokines (IL-1&#x003b2; plus IL-23) are still unclear. Cross-linking of CD161 by a plate-bound anti-CD161 mAb did not exert any effect on the proliferation or cytokine production by CD161<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells (unpublished data), thus excluding that CD161 ligation may play some role in the expansion or effector functions of these cells. Another more likely explanation is that CD161, present on CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells as well as on TCR&#x003b3;&#x003b4;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells, is implicated in their transendothelial migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). Although CD161 is expressed on a minority of human circulating CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>), an abundance of CD161<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells represented the majority of T cells from the epithelial and lamina propria layers of the human colon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). Recently, it was found that high numbers of Th17 cells are constitutively present in different compartments of the mouse gut, and their numbers correlate with the bacterial load of the gut segments (thus being preeminent in the lamina propria of the colon), whereas low numbers were found in the spleen and liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). One physiological ligand for human CD161 has been identified as the lectin-like transcript 1, which belongs to the C-type lectin domain family 2 (CLEC2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). Another member of the CLEC2 family, CLEC2A, has been found to be selectively expressed in the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>), where Th17 cells migrate in the course of chronic inflammatory disorders, such as contact dermatitis, psoriasis, and atopic dermatitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). The results of our study show that several CD161<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells are present among T cells infiltrating the skin of psoriatic patients and that virtually all CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells able to produce IL-17 in the gut of subjects with CD, or in the skin of those suffering from psoriasis, were contained within the cell population expressing CD161. This finding supports the possibility that this molecule plays an important role in favoring transendothelial migration of Th17 effectors into tissues, where they are recruited in response to the CCR6-binding chemokine CCL20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). However, it cannot be excluded, as suggested previously in this paragraph, that this molecule is also critical for the transendothelial migration of Th17 precursors early in life. In conclusion, we have identified CD161 as one of the most important surface markers of human IL-17&#x02013;producing cells, and we have demonstrated that, at least in humans, IL-17&#x02013;producing cells can only originate from a naive CD161<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell precursor.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Subjects.</title><p>UCB samples were obtained from 23 donors.
