Analysis of in vitro replication products by two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis showed simple Y patterns for single ori sequence-containing clones, indicative of rolling circle replication. Double Y patterns were observed when a chloroplast DNA template containing both ori s (pKN9) was tested. Dpn I analysis and control assays with Escherichia coli DNA polymerase provide a clear method to distinguish between true replication and DNA repair synthesis. These controls also support the reliability of this in vitro chloroplast DNA replication system. EM analysis of in vitro replicated products showed rolling circle replication intermediates for single ori clones (ori A or ori B), whereas D loops were observed for a clone (pKN9) containing both ori s. The minimal ori regions contain sequences which are capable of forming stem-loop structures with relatively high free energy and other sequences which interact with specific protein(s) from the chloroplast replication fraction. Apparently the minimal ori sequences reported here contain all the necessary elements for support of chloroplast DNA replication in vitro.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
