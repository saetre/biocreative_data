The corneal epithelium is continually losing cells due to desquamation (primarily via the blink reflex) and thus must replace these cells to maintain homeostasis. Such continuously renewing epithelia are by definition governed by stem cells. The stem cells of the corneal epithelium are preferentially located in the limbal region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. Upon division, the slow cycling limbal epithelial stem cells give rise to daughter cells known as transient amplifying (TA) cells. The TA cells in turn undergo multiple cell divisions giving rise to more differentiated epithelial cells that migrate centrally and leave the basal layer toward the superficial corneal epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>]. This highly organized differentiation program is under the control of multiple regulatory mechanisms, which remain largely unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>].</p><p>The Notch signaling pathway plays a key role in the proliferation and differentiation of many tissues. It is a highly conserved network that orchestrates cell-fate decisions in the nervous, gastrointestinal, and the hematopoietic systems of many organisms ranging from insects to humans. Notch proteins are large transmembrane proteins. Four Notch genes have been identified in mammals (<italic>Notch1</italic>-<italic>Notch4</italic>), and their mutations cause severe abnormalities in organ development and adult homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. In addition, three Delta (Delta like 1, 3, and 4) and two Jagged (<italic>Jagged1</italic> and <italic>Jagged2</italic>) proteins have been identified as Notch ligands in mammals. Notch signaling is initiated by the interaction between the ligand on one cell and the receptor on a neighboring cell. This interaction triggers the proteolytic cleavage of the Notch receptor at the membrane proximal region by the &#x003b3;-secretase presenilin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. In the most well characterized &#x0201c;canonical&#x0201d; pathway in mammalian cells, the Notch intracellular domain (NotchIC) translocates to the nucleus where it mostly associates with the recombination signal binding protein for the immunoglobulin kappa J region (RBPJ&#x003ba;). The NotchIC/RBPJ&#x003ba; complex transactivates protein targets such as Hairy/Enhancer of Split (<italic>HES</italic>) and Hairy/Enhancer of Split-related with YRPW motif (<italic>HEY</italic>) genes, which in turn affect numerous pathways involving cell-fate determination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>].</p><p>The role of Notch signaling in the corneal epithelium has not been studied in detail. Its importance in corneal epithelial proliferation and differentiation was initially discovered while studying <italic>Notch1</italic> in the mouse epidermis. When <italic>Notch1</italic> was conditionally deleted in the epidermis and the corneal epithelium of postnatal mice, hyperproliferation and abnormal differentiation were noted in the epidermis and the corneal epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. In the present study, we confirm and extend further the role of Notch signaling in the adult corneal epithelium by demonstrating that Notch activity is down-regulated in the corneal epithelium during the early phase of proliferative conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Immunostaining</title><p>Three human corneas (obtained from the Illinois Eye Bank) or mouse whole eyes were embedded in OCT and then cut into 8&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m sections. The sections were fixed for 10 min in chilled acetone and blocked with 5% donkey serum for 1 h at room temperature. The sections were incubated for 90 min at room temperature with rat monoclonal anti-Notch1 antibody (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA), rabbit polyclonal anti-Notch 1 (1:100) or goat polyclonal anti-Jagged1 (1:100; both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or a rabbit polyclonal anti-cleaved Notch-1 (1:200; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA or Abcam, Cambridge, MA) or rabbit monoclonal anti-Ki67 (1:250; Labvision, Fremont, CA). For a negative control, the sections were incubated with an irrelevant (no epithelial expression of the antigen) rabbit or goat antibody. A fluorescein-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (1:200) or donkey anti-goat (1:200) was used for 1 h at room temperature. The slides were counterstained with DAPI or propidium iodide, visualized using a Zeiss Axiovert fluorescence microscope, and photographed with an AxioCam (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) camera. For immunohistochemistry, a similar protocol was followed except a biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:500) was used, and sections were incubated in streptavidin peroxidase complex before being developed in 3,3&#x02032; diaminobenzadine (all from Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA).</p></sec><sec><title>Relative quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction</title><p>Epithelial cells from the central corneal and limbal regions were separately removed from three fresh eye bank corneas (donor ages 41, 56, and 62). Specifically, a 7.5&#x000a0;mm trephine was used to excise the central cornea leaving a 1.5&#x000a0;mm area of limbal epithelium intact. The central button and the limbal rims were placed in dispase (5&#x000a0;mg/ml) for 1 h at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, and the epithelium was gently separated from the underlying stroma by blunt dissection and stored in RNAlater (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). For the animal experiments, corneas that were removed following euthanasia were similarly stored in RNAlater.</p><p>Total RNA was isolated from the human epithelial cells (limbal and central) or the mouse corneal epithelium per manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions (RNeasy Protect Mini Kit, Qiagen). Reverse transcription was performed with 0.5 &#x000b5;g total RNA using random hexamers and a cDNA synthesis kit (SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Relative quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions (QuantumRNA Universal kit; Ambion, Austin, TX) using primer sets for 18S rRNA as an internal standard and intron-spanning primers for human or mouse <italic>Notch1</italic>, <italic>Notch2</italic>, <italic>Delta1</italic>, <italic>Jagged1</italic>, <italic>Jagged2</italic>, <italic>Hes1</italic>, <italic>Hes5</italic>, <italic>DeltaN-p63</italic>, and <italic>ABCG2</italic>. The linear range of the PCR for each target gene was determined experimentally using cDNA from the control sample. The cycle number in the middle of the linear range of the PCR was chosen for each specific target gene. Following the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions, the primers for the 18S rRNA were mixed with varying ratios of competimers (ranging from 1:9 to 4:6) to find the optimal primer:competimer ratio, which provided near equal bands for 18S and the target gene. For each sample, a multiplex PCR for both the target gene and 18S internal standard was then performed and the products were visualized on 1.2% agarose gels after ethidium bromide staining. All samples were run in duplicates and repeated a minimum of three times. For every primer set, a sample with no reverse transcriptase was used as the negative control.</p><p>The band densities from each reaction were quantified (Digital Science Image Station, model 440CF; Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY) and subsequently normalized by dividing the band density of the target gene by the density of its corresponding 18S band. The normalized densities were converted into a ratio between the central cornea and the limbus and reported as means&#x000b1;standard deviation. Statistical comparison was performed using Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test and a p value less than 0.05 was considered significant.</p></sec><sec><title>In situ hybridization</title><p>In situ hybridization was performed on human corneal paraffin sections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. Both the sense (negative control) and anti-sense probes were digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes. The RNA probes were synthesized by in vitro transcription (Riboprobe In Vitro Transcription System, Promega, Madison, WI) using T7 RNA polymerase, digoxigenin labeled UTP (Roche, Nutley, NJ), and a template amplified from cDNA by PCR. The template was a 624-bp region in the UTR of <italic>Hes1</italic> and was amplified such that the sequence for the T7 bacteriophage promoter was built into the reverse primer sequence (Forward: 5&#x02032;-ATC AAT GCC ATG ACC TAC CC-3&#x02032;, Reverse: 5&#x02032;-CTA ATA CGA CTC ACT ATA GGG AGG CGC AAT CCA ATA TGA AC-3&#x02032;). The T7 promoter sequence was built into the forward primer for sense probe synthesis.</p><p>The sections were deparaffinized, digested with proteinase K (10 &#x000b5;g/&#x000b5;l), and post-fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde. After pre-hybridization, the sections were incubated with the pre-heated Hes1 probe (diluted in hybridization solution) overnight at 50&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and sequentially washed with serial dilutions of sodium chloride sodium citrate (SSC) buffer. The sections were incubated at room temperature with blocking solution for 1.5 h followed by incubation with 1:500 alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody at room temperature. The slides were washed and incubated further with nitroblue tetrazolium/ 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate chromogen (NBT/BCIP) for 30&#x02013;120 min at room temperature in the dark and then rinsed and mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Positive reaction products appeared purplish blue.</p></sec><sec><title>Mouse model of corneal epithelial wound healing</title><p>A mouse model of corneal epithelial wound healing was used to study the expression of Notch pathway components under proliferative conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>]. Six-month-old C57Bl/6 mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (100&#x000a0;mg/kg) and xylazine (5&#x000a0;mg/kg). After applying several drops of topical 0.5% proparacaine, a 1.5-mm area of the central epithelium was demarcated and removed by gentle scraping (excluding the limbal area). At 24-h, 48-h, and144-h post-wounding time points, the corneal epithelium was removed by scraping (different mice used for each time point). Between 8 and 10 corneal epithelial scrapings were pooled together for each time point. Total RNA was extracted from the samples and subjected to relative quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR with 18S rRNA as an internal standard (Ambion).</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacologic induction of corneal epithelial proliferation in vivo</title><p>To stimulate proliferation of the ocular surface epithelial cells, the tumor promoting agent phorbol myristate ester (TPA) was dissolved in pertolatum at a concentration of 0.5%. This concentration has been demonstrated to induce a hyperproliferative response that maximizes after 24 h with the absence of necrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. Six-month-old C57BL/6 mice received topical 0.5% TPA in petrolatum while the control mice received petrolatum alone. Corneas were harvested after 24 h and prepared for western blot analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot</title><p>Following homogenization, the mouse corneal proteins were extracted overnight with radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors. Equal amounts of each sample were mixed with sample buffer (Invitrogen), denatured by heating at 95&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 10&#x000a0;min, and subjected to electrophoresis on 10%&#x02013;20% Tricine gels (Invitrogen). The protein bands were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and equal loading was verified by Ponceau S staining. The membranes were incubated in 3% BSA in Tris-buffered saline for 1 h followed by an overnight incubation (4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) with rabbit anti-NotchIC antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling). The membranes were washed with Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with HRP-goat-anti rabbit IgG (1:5000) for 1 h at room temperature. Detection was performed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) and recorded on film (Kodak X-OMAT; Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY).</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Human corneal epithelial cultures were initiated from corneoscleral rims obtained from eye bank eyes. The rims were treated with dispase (10&#x000a0;mg/ml) at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C overnight to disrupt the basement membrane. The epithelial sheets were peeled off and digested in 0.25% trypsin-EDTA at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 5&#x02013;10 min. Cells were washed and resuspended in a keratinocyte serum-free medium (KSFM; Invitrogen) and plated in tissue culture plates. After the first passage, the cells were plated at either low density (20%&#x02013;30% confluence) where proliferation is induced or high density cultures (&#x0003e;90% confluence) where proliferation is inhibited. To induce differentiation, the low density cultures were exposed to 1.6&#x000a0;mM calcium. At 48 h, the cultured epithelial cells were trypsinized and subjected to relative quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR with normalization to 18S.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Expression of Notch pathway genes in the human limbal and central corneal epithelium</title><p>Human corneal epithelial cells isolated from fresh eye bank eyes were initially screened for the presence or absence of Notch pathway genes by RT&#x02013;PCR.

The expression of <italic>Notch3</italic>, <italic>Notch4</italic>, <italic>Delta3</italic>, and <italic>Hes3</italic> was not detected in the human corneal epithelium.</p><p>Using relative quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR, the expression of the Notch pathways genes was compared between the limbal and the central corneal epithelium. The limbal expression of Notch1 receptor and Jagged1 ligand was respectively 30%&#x000b1;14% and 19%&#x000b1;7% fold lower in the central cornea. On the other hand, the expression of the canonical Notch downstream targets, Hes1 and Hes5, were 42%&#x000b1;10% and 66%&#x000b1;22% higher, respectively, in the central cornea compared to the limbus (p&#x0003c;0.05). There was no statistical difference in the level of expression of <italic>Notch2</italic>, <italic>Delta1</italic>, and <italic>Jagged2</italic> between the limbal and central corneal epithelium.

Primary human corneal epithelial cells after the first passage were cultured at high or low densities and high or low (0.09&#x000a0;mM) calcium. The expression of Hes1 was 1.5 fold higher in high density compared to low density cultures (p&#x0003c;0.05). Increasing the calcium concentration to 1.6&#x000a0;mM, which induces differentiation of the corneal epithelial cells, likewise enhanced the expression by twofold (p&#x0003c;0.05). These results demonstrate that the level of Notch activity as measured by the expression of Hes1 is higher in conditions where there is less proliferation and a greater commitment toward differentiation.

In the epidermis, a structure which is morphologically similar to the corneal epithelium, Notch signaling functions as a commitment switch that signals the epithelial cells to leave the basal layer and begin terminal differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. In the murine epidermis, Notch signaling was shown to limit proliferation by inhibiting DeltaNp63&#x003b1;, a cell cycle regulator important for maintaining the proliferative capacity of epidermal progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. Inhibition of Notch signaling was found to suppress keratinocyte commitment to differentiation and expand populations with stem cell potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]. Clinically, Notch is demonstrated to be down-regulated in hyperproliferative conditions such as psoriasis and squamous and basal cell carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. Likewise, in animal models, Notch expression is reduced in the first 24 h after wounding of the skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>].</p><p>The importance of Notch signaling in the corneal epithelium was first noted in a study involving the conditional knockout of <italic>Notch1</italic> in the postnatal mouse epidermis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. When <italic>Notch1</italic> was conditionally deleted using the basal corneal epithelium-active keratin14 or keratin5 promoter, the mice developed hyperplastic, keratinized, skin-like epithelium in the cornea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. This phenotype was particularly manifested after repeated corneal epithelial scraping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. Mechanistically, <italic>Notch1</italic> was shown to regulate vitamin A metabolism in the corneal epithelium by regulating the expression of cellular retinol binding protein 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. These results are confirmed and further extended by our current study where we found Notch activity to be down-regulated during proliferative states in the corneal epithelium. We surmise that Notch signaling must first be down-regulated during the initial stages of wound healing to allow epithelial cells to revert to a more basal and undifferentiated &#x0201c;wound healing&#x0201d; phenotype. Later, when the epithelial defect has been covered by a provisional epithelium, Notch signaling must be restored for the proper differentiation of the corneal epithelial cells to take place. Thus, in the absence of Notch1, the epithelial cells remain in an undifferentiated basal phenotype, which by default follow an epidermal fate.</p><p>In this study, we found Notch to be more active in the central corneal epithelium than in the limbus. The level of Notch activation as judged by the expression of its downstream targets, Hes1 and <italic>Hes5</italic>, was 1.42 and 1.66 fold higher in the human central corneal epithelium compared to the limbal epithelium. The result for Hes1 is consistent with that from a previous study in which serial analysis of gene expression found <italic>Hes1</italic> expression in the rat central epithelium to be 1.33 fold higher than in the limbal epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]. Overall, this is consistent with the fact that the central corneal epithelium has less proliferative capacity and more commitment toward differentiation compared to the limbus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>].</p><p>The expression pattern of <italic>Notch1</italic>, <italic>Jagged1</italic>, and <italic>Hes1</italic> in the basal and immediate suprabasal cells further supports the involvement of Notch in the commitment of a cell to proliferate or differentiate. The expression of Notch1 receptor being primarily in the basal and early suprabasal cells of mouse and human corneal epithelium with a slightly higher expression in the limbal epithelium compared to the central cornea is consistent with other reports using fresh tissue or freshly isolated population of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>]. In contrast, <italic>Notch1</italic> expression has been shown to be limited to the corneal suprabasal cells with minimal expression in the corneal basal cells and the limbal epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>]. This difference is most likely due to the choice of primary antibodies. In the present study, we used a rat monoclonal antibody to detect the Notch1 receptor in a manner similar to that of Thomas et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>] while Ma et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>] used a polyclonal rabbit antibody. Using a different antibody against NotchIC, the active form of Notch, both our laboratory and Vauclair et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>] found Notch to be active in the basal and suprabasal cells of murine corneal epithelium. It is important to recognize that while Notch receptors and ligands are present both in the limbal and the central corneal epithelium, the actual level of Notch activity appears to be greater in the central corneal epithelium. This is evident by the higher expression of downstream Hes factors in the central cornea and by the phenotype of the <italic>Notch1</italic> conditional knockouts where the central cornea develops keratinization while the limbus is relatively spared [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>].</p><p>It is interesting to note that the expression pattern of Notch1 and Hes1 in the corneal epithelium is slightly different from the epidermis where their expression is primarily suprabasal. This may reflect inherent differences in the architecture of these tissues. In particular, as previous studies have suggested, the basal cells in the peripheral and central corneal epithelia behave more like the suprabasal cells in the epidermis while the basal layer of the epidermis, which contains the most undifferentiated cells, is more analogous to the basal epithelium of the limbus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>].</p><p>The down-regulation of Notch during proliferative states was further demonstrated in the developing mouse cornea as well as the mouse models of corneal wound healing and TPA-induced proliferation. In these latter models, the rate of proliferation peaks in the first 24 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>]. Our results indicate a clear down-regulation of Notch signaling at 24 h when the corneal epithelial cells are most actively proliferating and their differentiation program is temporarily suspended. After 24 h, the level of Notch is quickly restored as the demand for proliferation is reduced and the need arises to re-establish the differentiation program.</p><p>The in vitro studies further confirm the in vivo observations. Specifically, Notch activity as measured by the levels of <italic>Hes1</italic> is increased in culture conditions that limit proliferation and promote differentiation. Notch is suppressed during hyperproliferative states when growth and proliferation is more important than differentiation. These results are also consistent with the findings of Thomas et al. who found Notch expression to be absent in the actively dividing corneal epithelial cells in culture. On the other hand, exogenous Notch activation or inhibition in human corneal epithelial cells appears to have the opposite effect. A study by Ma et al. found that Notch inhibition by the &#x003b3;-secretase inhibitor, L-685458, reduced proliferation and promoted differentiation while Notch activation by soluble Jagged1 increased proliferation and inhibited differentiation in corneal epithelial cell cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>]. The reason for these seemingly contradictory results may due in part to the non-Notch mediated effects of &#x003b3;-secretase inhibitor as well as the dose dependant effects of Notch. In particular, previous studies in neuronal cell cultures have shown that high and low levels of Notch activation actually have the opposite effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>]. A similar phenomenon is seen in other signaling systems such as TGF-&#x003b2; where high and low levels of the cytokine have the opposite effect on cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>]. Current studies are underway to determine the in vivo effects of exogenous Notch activation and inhibition in the mouse corneal epithelium.</p><p>In summary, we have demonstrated that Notch signaling is active in the basal and suprabasal corneal epithelial cells. Notch activity is inversely proportional to the degree of proliferation, confirming its role in controlling proliferation and promoting differentiation. In the epidermis, studies have shown that it may be possible to modify the Notch activity to inhibit differentiation and expand the stem cell population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]. Based on the similarity of the corneal epithelium with the epidermis, Notch signaling may also provide a potential therapeutic pathway by which corneal epithelial proliferation and differentiation can be manipulated. This may be valuable for in vitro applications such as culturing epithelial cells for clinical use and for in vivo conditions such as partial limbal stem cell deficiency.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This research was supported by a Fight for Sight Grant-in-Aid, a career development grant K08EY017561-A1 to ARD, and a core grant EY01792 both from the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.
