Activation of IRF-5 results in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF&#x003b1;, IL6 and IL12p40, as well as type I interferons.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>In this study, we identify a G202C (position relative to translation start codon) missense-mutation transcript of IRF-5 in transformed B and T cell lines, which were either infected or non-infected by viruses, and peripheral blood from ATL or CLL patients. The mutated transcript encodes a novel protein in which the sixty-eighth amino acid, Alanine, is substituted by Proline (IRF-5P68) in the DNA binding domain of IRF-5. IRF-5P68 phenotype results in a complete loss of its DNA-binding activity and functions as a dominant negative molecule through interacting with wild type IRF-5. Co-expression of IRF-5P68 inhibits MyD88-mediated IRF-5 transactivation. Moreover, Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent IL6 and IL12P40 production induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), R837 or CpG ODN 1826 was reduced in IRF-5 (P68) expressing cells as compared to the control cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>IRF-5P68 acts as a dominant negative regulator that interferes with IRF-5-mediated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The functional characterization of the novel IRF-5 mutant in transformed B and T cell lines and in ATL and CLL patients may lead to a better understanding of the role of these transcriptional regulators in hematopoietic malignancies.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Biochemical, molecular biological and gene knockout studies have demonstrated that the members of the interferon regulatory factor family play important roles in pathogen response, cytokine signalling, hematopoietic differentiation, regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005500-Tamura1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005500-Hiscott1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Given that this structure resembles the winged helix-turn-helix (HTH)-containing DNA-binding motif and its mode of protein-DNA interaction is distinct from that of other HTH-containing proteins, the IRFs are therefore characterized as a novel HTH-containing super-family member <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005500-Taniguchi1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Both IRF-1 and IRF-2 use the third &#x003b1;-helix to contact the major groove of the GAAA DNA sequence, and other fragments including the three loops and the &#x003b1;&#x02013;helices to contact the adjacent DNA sequence. The secondary structure of IRF-5 DNA-binding domain is similar to that of IRF-1 and IRF-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005500-Fujii1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005500-Taniguchi1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005500-Escalante1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that IRF-5 may utilize a similar model to recognize the similar DNA sequences. In our study, the characterized mutation site of IRF-5 is positioned in the flanking site of the fourth tryptophan within the N-terminal DNA-binding domain, which is conserved among IRF family members and is harboured by the second &#x003b1;-helix. The functional analysis by EMSA and luciferase assay further shows that IRF-5P68 completely loses its DNA-binding and transactivating activities. Although the structural alteration derived from the missense point mutation eradicates the DNA binding activity of IRF-5P68, it does not remarkably alter other protein properties because this mutant like its wild type predominantly localizes in the cytosol and dynamically shuttles between cytoplasm and nucleus in resting cells.</p><p>Human genome analysis shows that the mutation site of IRF-5P68 is located within Exon 3 adjacent to its 5&#x02032; end in the region of chromosome 7q32.1. Based on this information, we consulted the NCBI database for Single Nucleotide Polymorphorisms (SNPs). Unexpectedly, no SNPs in relation to this mutation site are presented in the database. We then sequenced the Exon 3 of IRF-5 gene using the genomic DNA isolated from previously described cell lines and PBMCs obtained from CLL patients carrying the mutated transcripts. Intriguingly, the mutation is undetectable at the genomic DNA level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005500.s001"><bold>Table S1</bold></xref>), which suggests that the point mutation does not result from SNPs. To explore the molecular mechanism of this mutagenesis further, we employed the Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphorism (RFLP) method by southern-blot assay. By using Exon 3 DNA sequence as probe, a roughly 10 kb fragment was unexpectedly detected in the genomic DNA extracted from Jurkat cell line, which carries IRF-5 mutant transcripts, but not in MT4 cell line without IRF-5 mutant transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005500.s002"><bold>Figure S1</bold></xref>). In addition, the RFLP analysis by checking enzymatic cutting sites of IRF-5 pseudogene, located in chromosome 8q22.1 (pseudogene.org ID: 239282), was unable to give rise to a 10 kb fragment. These results indicate that the novel 10 kb fragment may not come from IRF-5 pseudogene but from IRF-5 gene amplification or chromosomal recombination. It will be of great interest to determine whether the IRF-5P68 mutation is associated with IRF-5 gene amplification or rearrangement. It has been demonstrated that RNA editing enzymes are also involved in mRNA point mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005500-Sharma1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. The RNA editing enzymes consists of the adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADAR) family and the apolipoprotein B editing catalytic polypeptide (APOBEC) family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005500-Scott1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005500-Mattick1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005500-Nishikura1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, but none of them is reported to participate in G to C mRNA editing, suggesting that the IRF-5 mutation we found is unlikely caused by RNA editing.</p><p>Mutagenesis resulting in functional ablation of tumor suppressor genes is a molecular mechanism common in malignant cells to circumvent tightly controlled proliferative and survival system of mammalians. It has been well documented that the frequent loses of copies of <italic>Rb</italic>, especially <italic>p53</italic> genes in CLL contribute to disease progression, poor response to chemotherapy and poor prognostic outcome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005500-Abbott1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>irf-5</italic> has been characterized as a tumor suppressor gene and the growth inhibition mediated by IRF-5 is underlined in a manner independent on <italic>p53</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005500-Barnes3">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. IRF-5 sensitizes <italic>p53</italic>-deficient tumors to DNA damage-induced apoptosis and cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005500-Hu1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, DNA damaging reagents can induce IRF-5 nuclear accumulation, and <italic>irf-5</italic> is also associated with the stimulation of multiple cell cycle regulatory and proapoptotic genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005500-Yanai1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. These observations indicate that mutation of <italic>irf-5</italic> might be a molecular mechanism employed by malignant cells to achieve the capacity of survival or proliferation, and protecting themselves from killing by chemotherapeutical treatment. On the other hand, the discovery of an IRF-5 mutation lacking transactivation activity in ATL and CLL may unveil a clue that the transactivation activity of IRF-5 might play an essential role in its function as a turmor suppressor.</p><p>Furthermore, weak immunogenicity of CLL cells may contribute to disease progression and inhibit the effectiveness of immunotherapies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005500-Ochsenbein1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005500-Spaner1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. It has been demonstrated that in response to TLR7 activation, CLL cells increase costimulatory molecular expression, produce inflammatory cytokines and become more sensitive to killing by cytotoxic effectors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005500-Spaner2">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, costimulation of CLL with TLR9-ligand CpG-ODN and CD40-ligand CD40LF strongly increases in inflammatory cytokine production and costimulatory molecular expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005500-Decker1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. IRF-5 is a key player of TLR7/TLR9 signalling and is involved in tumor cell growth and apoptosis. The important role of IRF-5 in cell growth control is also emphasized in na&#x000ef;ve primary B cells, in which the Epstein-Barr virus induces the negative regulators of IRF-5, the IRF-5v12 and IRF-4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005500-Negishi1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, to neutralize TLR7 ligand-induced cell growth inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005500-Martin1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the mutation of IRF-5 in CLL patients may affect disease progression and immunotherapies through compromising IRF-5 transactivation activity.</p><p>In addition, recent in vivo studies utilizing mice deficient in the <italic>Irf-5</italic> gene have also characterized IRF-5 as a key component of death-receptor-induced apoptosis in a cell-type-specific manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005500-Couzinet1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. IRF-5 is implicated in a stage of Fas (CD95/APO-1/TNFRSF6) signalling upstream of caspase 8 and c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). However, the activation of Fas receptor is not capable of inducing IRF-5 nuclear accumulation. These observations therefore raise an important issue of whether IRF-5 functions as an adaptor protein or a transcriptional activator in death-receptor-induced apoptotic signalling.</p><p>To summarize, although IRF-5P68 mutation is present in malignant hematopoietic diseases, ATL and CLL, the link between the novel IRF-5 point mutation to clinical implications, such as pathogenesis, drug resistance and prognosis, remains to be clarified. Future studies will focus on the effect of this mutation on immuno- and chemo-therapies to improve clinical diagnosis and treatment, and therefore predict the outcomes for patients suffering from hematopoietic malignant diseases such as ATL and CLL. In addition, understanding the molecular mechanism of this mutation may shed light on the development of novel tumor-suppression-gene mutation mechanisms in malignant diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0005500.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Detection of Ala to Pro mutation in residue 68 of IRF-5 genome.
