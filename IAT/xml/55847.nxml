Over the past years several &#x02018;orphan&#x02019; nuclear receptors have been isolated for which no ligand has yet been identified. Very little is known about how these &#x02018;orphan&#x02019; receptors regulate transcription. In this study we have analysed the biochemical and transcriptional properties of the neuronally expressed orphan nuclear receptor ROR&#x003b2; (NR1F2) and compared them with the retinoic acid receptor heterodimer RXR&#x003b1;&#x02013;RAR&#x003b1; (NR2B1&#x02013;NR1B1) and Gal&#x02013;VP16 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Although ROR&#x003b2; binds to its DNA-binding sites with comparatively low affinity, it efficiently directs transcription in nuclear extracts derived from a neuronal cell line, Neuro2A, but not in nuclear extracts from non-neuronal HeLa cells. In contrast, RXR&#x003b1;&#x02013;RAR&#x003b1; and the acidic transcription factor Gal&#x02013;VP16 support transcription in Neuro2A and HeLa nuclear extracts equally efficiently. These observations point to a different (co)factor requirement for transactivation by members of the NR1 subfamily of nuclear receptors.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The spatio-temporal regulation of gene expression is one of the key issues in differentiation and development. A central role in the control of gene expression is played by transcription factors that bind to specific enhancer&#x0002f;promoter elements and activate or repress transcription of a specific gene. The complex mechanism of transcriptional activation permits tight control at multiple levels, such as binding of the transcription factor to its response element, recruitment of co-activator&#x0002f;co-repressor complexes and the basal transcription machinery and facilitating reinitiation of transcription.</p><p> Among many model systems the nuclear receptors of the thyroid&#x0002f;steroid superfamily have been of particular importance in the continuing dissection of the mechanisms responsible for control of transcription. The nuclear receptor superfamily now comprises more than 50 distinct members which have been grouped into six different subfamilies based on sequence similarities in the two well-conserved regions of this family, the DNA-binding and the ligand-binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c1">1</xref>).</p><p> The &#x02018;classical&#x02019; nuclear receptor acts as a ligand-controlled transcription factor which responds either to steroid hormones, small lipophilic molecules or vitamins. The last few years have witnessed major breakthroughs in understanding the molecular mechanisms of transcription signal transmission by these receptors (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c3">3</xref> and references therein). In addition to these &#x02018;classical&#x02019; receptors, a rather large number of proteins have been identified that share the overall protein structure of nuclear receptor family members but for which no ligand has (yet) been found. These receptors are commonly referred to as &#x02018;orphan&#x02019; receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c4">4</xref>).</p><p> Some orphan receptors have DNA-binding and dimerisation properties very similar to those of &#x02018;classical&#x02019; receptors, including their ability to bind as homodimers or RXR heterodimers to half-sites arranged either as a palindrome or direct repeats. However, a subgroup of orphan receptors exists that bind as monomers to so-called extended half-sites. Nucleotides 5&#x02032; of the conserved receptor half-site (AGGTCA) are contacted by these orphan receptors increasing DNA binding affinity and providing specificity in the recognition of monomeric response elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c5">5</xref>). An intriguing question is how the transcriptional activity of orphan receptors is regulated in the absence of a ligand and of a heterodimerisation partner. It is possible that the transcriptional activity of orphan receptors is controlled by protein modifications. Alternatively, these receptors may display a constitutive ability to bind either co-repressor or co-activator complexes.</p><p> A good model system for studying transcriptional control by orphan receptors that bind to DNA as monomers is the subgroup of the ROR (NR1F) (also referred to as RZR) and the Rev-erb (NR1D) receptors. In transient transfections members of the ROR subgroup appear to act as constitutive activators, whereas members of the Rev-erb subgroup act as constitutive repressors.</p><p> Two members of the ROR subgroup, ROR&#x003b1; (NR1F1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c7">7</xref>) and ROR&#x003b2; (NR1F2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c8">8</xref>), are highly related but display very different expression patterns. While ROR&#x003b1; is ubiquitously expressed, ROR&#x003b2; expression is restricted to neuronal cells, in particular to areas in the central nervous system that are involved in the processing of sensory information (spinal cord, thalamus and sensory cerebellar cortices) and the major areas of circadian rhythm regulation (retina, pineal gland and suprachiasmatic nuclei) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c9">9</xref>). Despite the high degree of amino acid similarity, we recently demonstrated that these two receptors display different DNA-binding behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c10">10</xref>), suggesting that specific transcriptional regulation mechanisms may be in place for these transcription factors.</p><p> To unravel the mechanism underlying regulation of transcription by monomeric binding orphan receptors, we expressed ROR&#x003b2; using the vaccinia virus system and compared its DNA-binding and transcriptional properties with those of the RXR&#x003b1;&#x02013;RAR&#x003b1; (NR2B1&#x02013;NR1B1) heterodimer and the synthetic acidic activator Gal&#x02013;VP16 <italic>in vitro</italic>. In this report we show that although ROR&#x003b2; has a weak affinity for its response elements compared with the RXR&#x003b1;&#x02013;RAR&#x003b1; heterodimer, it potently drives transcription in Neuro2A but not in HeLa nuclear extracts. RXR&#x003b1;&#x02013;RAR&#x003b1; and Gal&#x02013;VP16 are able to efficiently activate transcription in both Neuro2A and HeLa nuclear extracts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Recombinant vaccinia viruses</title><p>Recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;ROR&#x003b2; and RXR&#x003b1;&#x02013;His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;RAR&#x003b1; were prepared according to the protocol described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c11">11</xref>).

The SDS&#x02013;PAGE polypeptide pattern of a typical His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;ROR&#x003b2; preparation revealed a polypeptide of &#x0223c;50 kDa which was not present in preparations from HeLa cells infected with wild-type vaccinia virus (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke462f1">1</xref>A and data not shown). Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antiserum raised against ROR&#x003b2; identified the 50&#x000a0;kDa polypeptide as ROR&#x003b2; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke462f1">1</xref>B). Apart from ROR&#x003b2;, other poly(His)-containing polypeptides present in vaccinia-infected as well as in non-infected HeLa cells bind to Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x02013;NTA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke462f1">1</xref>A, lanes 2&#x02013;5 and data not shown). The purity of His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;ROR&#x003b2; was estimated to be 5&#x02013;10&#x00025;.</p></sec><sec><title>ROR&#x003b2; has a weak affinity for its DNA site</title><p>Since DNA binding of a transcription factor is a prerequisite for transcriptional activation, the DNA-binding properties of His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;ROR&#x003b2; were analysed in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Several oligonucleotides were used containing either a single or two consensus half-sites (AGGTCA) in a direct or palindromic configuration (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke462f2">2</xref>A). Because DNA binding of ROR&#x003b1; and ROR&#x003b2; reportedly depends on sequences 5&#x02032; of the consensus half-site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c18">18</xref>), the ROR-responsive element (RORE) used throughout the experiments contained a thymine at position &#x02013;1 and an adenine at position &#x02013;4 preceeding the nuclear receptor half-site. His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;ROR&#x003b2; readily bound as a monomer to a single half-site (RE1) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke462f2">2</xref>B, left). Two complexes were obtained on POP, a binding site containing two half-sites in a palindromic configuration (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke462f2">2</xref>B, middle). In agreement with published results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c19">19</xref>), two distinct complexes were also detected using response elements consisting of two half-sites arranged as direct repeats with 7 or 8 spacing nucleotides (DR&#x0002b;7 and DR&#x0002b;8; data not shown). Both protein&#x02013;DNA complexes were supershifted with a ROR&#x003b2;-specific antiserum, whereas the preimmune serum did not alter the mobility of the complexes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke462f2">2</xref>C). Binding of His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;ROR&#x003b2; to TREpal, containing two palindromically arranged consensus binding sites without appropriate 5&#x02032;-extensions, was very inefficient; a weak protein&#x02013;DNA complex migrating at the position of a monomer was obtained only at high receptor concentrations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke462f2">2</xref>B, right).</p><p> Next, the relative affinity of His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;ROR&#x003b2; for the RORE was assessed. For this purpose, off-rate experiments were performed and compared with those of the related RXR&#x003b1;&#x02013;His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;RAR&#x003b1; heterodimer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke462f2">2</xref>D). In these assays vaccinia-expressed receptors were preincubated with labelled oligonucleotide probes to allow formation of protein&#x02013;DNA complexes. Dissociation of the pre-formed protein&#x02013;DNA complexes was measured as a function of time by loading aliquots onto a continuously running acrylamide gel at 0, 1, 4 and 16&#x000a0;min after addition of a 500-fold molar excess of specific cold competitor. While the RXR&#x003b1;&#x02013;His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;RAR&#x003b1; heterodimer complex bound to the RARE&#x003b2;2 element was not or only marginally affected by addition of excess competitor (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke462f2">2</xref>D, right; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c20">20</xref>), His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;ROR&#x003b2;&#x02013;DNA complexes formed on the POP element dissociated rapidly after addition of competitor (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke462f2">2</xref>D, left). Similar results were obtained using other ROREs (RE1, DR&#x0002b;8 and DR&#x0002b;7) (data not shown).</p><p> Taken together, these data show that His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;ROR&#x003b2; can bind to elements that contain either one or two extended binding sites. However, His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;ROR&#x003b2; has a low affinity for the response elements tested compared with the affinity of the related nuclear receptor heterodimer RXR&#x003b1;&#x02013;His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;RAR&#x003b1; for RARE&#x003b2;2.</p></sec><sec><title>Transcriptional activation in Neuro2A and HeLa nuclear extracts</title><p>To assess the transcriptional activity of His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;ROR&#x003b2;, we established an <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription system similar to that described for the RXR&#x003b1;&#x02013;His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;RAR&#x003b1; heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c11">11</xref>). The reporter construct contained a RORE in front of the TATA box of the <italic>tk</italic> promoter fused to a G-less cassette of 380 nt (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke462f3">3</xref>A). A template with the adenovirus major late TATA box initiator fused to a G-less cassette of 320 nt (TI) served as an internal control, monitoring the basal transcriptional activity of the extracts. Since ROR&#x003b2; is expressed predominantly in neuronal tissues, nuclear extracts from the neuroblastoma cell line Neuro2A were used in initial experiments as a source of basal transcription factors and putative cofactors. For quantitative analysis, transcription levels were measured using a Phosphorimager.</p><p> His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;ROR&#x003b2; preparations boosted the level of transcription up to 30-fold from the palindromic POP element-containing template in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas the levels of transcription from the internal control were not or only marginally affected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke462f3">3</xref>B, lanes 1&#x02013;4; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke462f3">3</xref>C, lanes 1 and 2; Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke462f3">3</xref>D, lanes 1&#x02013;4). The increase in levels of transcription is specific for His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;ROR&#x003b2; because control extracts derived from wild-type vaccinia virus-infected cells did not boost the level of transcription from the specific reporters (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke462f3">3</xref>B, lanes 5&#x02013;7). Furthermore, His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;ROR&#x003b2;-dependent transcription was very low to undetectable when a reporter was used containing the TREpal element that did not support binding of ROR&#x003b2; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke462f2">2</xref>B right and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke462f3">3</xref>B, lanes 8&#x02013;10). Maximal transactivation by His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;ROR&#x003b2; was observed with a template containing four extended binding sites (4RE1) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke462f3">3</xref>C and data not shown). Taken together, the ability of His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;ROR&#x003b2; to bind to the ROREs correlates with its ability to mediate transcription through these elements.</p><p> Next, we wanted to compare the transcriptional activities of ROR&#x003b2; and RXR&#x003b1;&#x02013;RAR&#x003b1;. We previously showed that RXR&#x003b1;&#x02013;His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;RAR&#x003b1; is a transcriptional activator in HeLa nuclear extracts when a transcription template was used that contained a fragment of the RAR&#x003b2;2 promoter with two natural DR5 elements (RARE&#x003b2;2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c11">11</xref>). Therefore, <italic>in vitro </italic>transcription reactions were performed with His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;ROR&#x003b2; and RXR&#x003b1;&#x02013;His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;RAR&#x003b1; in Neuro2A and HeLa nuclear extracts.</p><p> RXR&#x003b1;&#x02013;His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;RAR&#x003b1; strongly boosted transcription from the RAR&#x003b2;2 promoter-containing template in the neuronal extracts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke462f3">3</xref>C, lanes 7 and 8). In addition, RXR&#x003b1;&#x02013;His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;RAR&#x003b1; activated transcription very efficiently from a template containing a TREpal binding site in front of the minimal <italic>tk</italic> promoter, which is identical to the POP&#x02013;<italic>tk</italic> reporter except for the 4 bp flanking the palindromic element, the so-called 5&#x02032;-extension (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke462f3">3</xref>C, lanes 9 and 10). Loading the heterodimer with all-<italic>trans</italic> retinoic acid did not further enhance the level of transcription under the conditions used in these experiments (data not shown).

ROR&#x003b2; was also unable to activate transcription efficiently from templates containing two extended binding sites arranged as direct repeats (DR&#x0002b;7 and DR&#x0002b;8) or four extended binding sites (4RE1) (data not shown).

To define the optimal conditions in our experimental set-up (schematic presentation in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke462f4">4</xref>A), the transcriptional activity of ROR&#x003b2; was analysed at different Sarkosyl concentrations. Addition of Sarkosyl to a final concentration of up to 0.025&#x00025; during PIC assembly (a) or to a final concentration of up to 0.05&#x00025; prior to formation of the first phosphodiester bonds (b) prevented transcription (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke462f4">4</xref>B, lanes 1, 2, 7, 8, 13 and 14, and 3, 4, 9, 10, 15 and 16, respectively), indicating that these processes cannot take place under these conditions. Addition of 0.05&#x00025; (final concentration) Sarkosyl 30 s after addition of nucleotides (c), i.e. after the formation of the first phosphodiester bonds, resulted in a low but appreciable level of transcription, consistent with only one round of transcription (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke462f4">4</xref>B, lanes 17 and 18 and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke462f4">4</xref>D). Addition of higher concentrations of Sarkosyl (0.08&#x00025;) prevented transcription altogether (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke462f4">4</xref>B, lanes 19&#x02013;24). These results suggest that adding Sarkosyl to a final concentration of 0.05&#x00025; immediately following addition of nucleotides limits transcription to a single round (single round condition). The underlying assumption of this interpretation is that formation of PICs is saturated after 40 min.</p><p> To test this hypothesis, <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription reactions with ROR&#x003b2; were preincubated under single round conditions for different time periods (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke462f4">4</xref>C). In our experimental system 10&#x02013;15 min preincubation was necessary to detect the first ROR&#x003b2;-dependent transcripts. The level of transcription did not further increase after 40 min, indicating that saturation of PIC formation was reached.</p><p> To assess the ability of ROR&#x003b2; to support single round transcription in HeLa and Neuro2A nuclear extracts, <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription experiments under single and multiple round conditions were performed with ROR&#x003b2; and RXR&#x003b1;&#x02013;His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;RAR&#x003b1;. Experiments with the unrelated transcription factor Gal&#x02013;VP16 served as additional controls. <italic>In vitro</italic> transcription experiments with His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;ROR&#x003b2; were performed with templates containing either the 4RE1 or the POP binding site. His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;ROR&#x003b2; behaved in a similar fashion on both templates. In the experiments presented templates with the 4RE1 binding site were used. The transcriptional activity of RXR&#x003b1;&#x02013;His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;RAR&#x003b1; was analysed on templates containing a fragment of the RAR&#x003b2;2 promoter. In single round assays only transcription from the specific template was examined to avoid competition between the templates. To ensure reproducibility of the experiments, every experiment was repeated several times; the experiments presented are typical examples.</p><p> Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke462f5">5</xref> demonstrates that His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;ROR&#x003b2;, RXR&#x003b1;&#x02013;His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;RAR&#x003b1; and Gal&#x02013;VP16 were able to support low but consistent single round transcription in Neuro2A (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke462f5">5</xref>A) and HeLa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke462f5">5</xref>B) nuclear extracts (lanes 4, 8 and 12, respectively). Thus all three proteins, including ROR&#x003b2;, promoted preinitiation complex formation in Neuro2A and HeLa nuclear extracts.</p><p> Next, we determined the ratio of transcripts under multiple and single round conditions &#x0005b;indicated in Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke462f4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke462f6">6</xref> as the ratio (mr)&#x0002f;(sr)&#x0005d; for His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;ROR&#x003b2;, RXR&#x003b1;&#x02013;His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;RAR&#x003b1; and Gal&#x02013;VP16 in Neuro2A and HeLa nuclear extracts. In Neuro2A nuclear extracts, His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;ROR&#x003b2;, RXR&#x003b1;&#x02013;His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;RAR&#x003b1; and Gal&#x02013;VP16 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke462f5">5</xref>A, lanes 1&#x02013;4, 5&#x02013;8 and 9&#x02013;12, respectively) efficiently instigated transcription under multiple round conditions. In HeLa nuclear extracts, however, efficient transactivation under multiple round conditions could be observed for RXR&#x003b1;&#x02013;His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;RAR&#x003b1; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke462f5">5</xref>B, lanes 5&#x02013;8) and Gal&#x02013;VP16 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke462f5">5</xref>B, lanes 9&#x02013;12), but not for His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;ROR&#x003b2; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke462f5">5</xref>B, lanes 1&#x02013;4). The number of transcripts instigated by ROR&#x003b2; in HeLa nuclear extracts under multiple to single round conditions was approximately equal.</p><p> The observed difference in transcriptional behavior of His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;ROR&#x003b2; and RXR&#x003b1;&#x02013;His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;RAR&#x003b1; may have been caused by the differential requirements of the basal promoter used in these experiments, i.e. the minimal <italic>tk</italic> versus the RAR&#x003b2;2 promoter. To rule this out, the experiments were repeated for RXR&#x003b1;&#x02013;His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;RAR&#x003b1; using an artificial template that contained a TREpal binding site in front of the minimal <italic>tk</italic> promoter. RXR&#x003b1;&#x02013;His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;RAR&#x003b1; activated transcription efficiently from this template in Neuro2A as well as in HeLa nuclear extracts, indicating that the basal promoter composition of the templates did not influence the transcriptional behavior of the proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke462f5">5</xref>C). Taken together, these experiments suggest a different transcriptional behavior of the two nuclear receptors ROR&#x003b2; and RXR&#x003b1;&#x02013;RAR&#x003b1; in HeLa nuclear extracts<italic> in vitro</italic>.</p><p> The observation that His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;ROR&#x003b2; instigated significantly more transcripts in Neuro2A as compared with HeLa nuclear extracts prompted us to assess the rate at which His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;ROR&#x003b2; boosts formation of functional preinitiation complexes in Neuro2A and HeLa nuclear extracts. As already demonstrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke462f4">4</xref>C, the rate of PIC assembly can be measured by performing experiments under single round conditions at different preincubation times. In Neuro2A as well as HeLa nuclear extracts, transcripts were synthesised in the presence of ROR&#x003b2; proportional to the time of preincubation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke462f6">6</xref>A). These experiments suggest that His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;ROR&#x003b2; recruits PICs with equal efficiency in Neuro2A and HeLa nuclear extracts. Thus, the low amount of transcripts instigated by ROR&#x003b2; in HeLa nuclear extracts is not due to an extract-dependent insufficiency in the formation of functional PICs.</p><p> Next, we investigated the time required by His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;ROR&#x003b2;, RXR&#x003b1;&#x02013;His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;RAR&#x003b1; and Gal&#x02013;VP16 to synthesise the equivalent of a single round of transcription to assess the rate at which transcripts are synthesised in HeLa and Neuro2A nuclear extracts. <italic>In vitro</italic> transcription experiments were performed under multiple round conditions and stopped at different times after addition of nucleotides (reaction times). ROR&#x003b2;-induced transcripts reached the equivalent of a single round transcription within 5 min after addition of nucleotides in Neuro2A (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke462f6">6</xref>B, left) as well as in HeLa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke462f6">6</xref>B, right) nuclear extracts. This suggests that the rate of the synthesis of transcripts instigated by ROR&#x003b2; does not differ significantly in Neuro2A and HeLa nuclear extracts. Similar results were obtained for RXR&#x003b1;&#x02013;His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;RAR&#x003b1; and Gal&#x02013;VP16 (data not shown).</p><p> Similar experiments were performed with longer reaction times to assess the transcriptional efficiency of the proteins in the extracts. In Neuro2A nuclear extracts His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;ROR&#x003b2;-instigated transcription resulted in doubling of the amount of transcripts every &#x0223c;10&#x02013;13 min, whereas no further increase in the number of transcripts could be observed in HeLa nuclear extracts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke462f6">6</xref>C). In contrast, RXR&#x003b1;&#x02013;His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;RAR&#x003b1; and Gal&#x02013;VP16 continuously produced transcripts in Neuro2A as well as in HeLa nuclear extracts.</p><p> Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;ROR&#x003b2; is equally efficient in supporting single round transcription in Neuro2A and HeLa nuclear extracts. However, <italic>in vitro</italic> the ability of ROR&#x003b2; to instigate transcripts is impaired in HeLa nuclear extracts.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>ROR&#x003b2; is an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that belongs to subfamily 1, with T<sub>3</sub>R and RAR as the most prominent members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c1">1</xref>). Notwithstanding the extensive amino acid similarity between these receptors, our study suggests that the mechanism of transcriptional activation mediated by ROR&#x003b2; may differ from those of RAR and T<sub>3</sub>R. Firstly, ROR&#x003b2; binds DNA as a monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c19">19</xref>; this study), whereas T<sub>3</sub>R and RAR require heterodimerisation with RXR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c23">23</xref>). In agreement with these results, RAR is transcriptionaly active <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> only as an RXR heterodimer, while ROR&#x003b2; activates transcription as a monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c10">10</xref>).</p><p> In off-rate experiments the heterodimers RXR&#x003b1;&#x02013;RAR&#x003b1; and RXR&#x003b1;&#x02013;T<sub>3</sub>R&#x003b1; have high affinity for their cognate DNA-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c20">20</xref>), whereas the affinity of ROR&#x003b2; (this study) and ROR&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c24">24</xref>) for a single, as well as a double, extended half-site is comparatively weak. Although the artificial binding sites used in this study have been shown to be optimal for ROR&#x003b2; DNA binding <italic>in vitro</italic> and for transcriptional activation <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c19">19</xref>), the existence of natural ROREs with high(er) affinities cannot be ruled out. Despite the different affinities for their cognate binding sites, ROR&#x003b2; and RXR&#x003b1;&#x02013;RAR&#x003b1; are equally efficient in the recruitment of functional PICs to DNA. It is important to note that PIC formation is a rather slow process. Several studies have determined the half-time of complex recruitment (i.e. the preincubation time required to obtain 50&#x00025; of the final amount of transcripts generated under single round conditions) to be between 8 and 20 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c27">27</xref>). Saturation of PIC formation has been shown to require, as in our study, up to &#x0223c;40 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c27">27</xref>).</p><p> Comparing the number of transcripts instigated by ROR&#x003b2; and RXR&#x003b1;&#x02013;RAR&#x003b1; under single versus multiple round transcription conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke462f5">5</xref>), we observed an insufficiency of HeLa nuclear extracts to support ROR&#x003b2;-dependent <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription. Whereas in Neuro2A nuclear extracts transactivation by ROR&#x003b2; resulted in continuous production of transcripts, in HeLa nuclear extracts the accumulation of transcripts ceased after 5 min. In contrast, RXR&#x003b1;&#x02013;RAR&#x003b1; and the unrelated transcription factor Gal&#x02013;VP16 supported transcription in Neuro2A and HeLa nuclear extracts beyond the initial 5 min of incubation. This observation shows that HeLa nuclear extracts were in principle able to support efficient transactivation.</p><p> There are several explanations as to why transcription mediated by ROR&#x003b2; ceased after an initial short period of transcription in HeLa nuclear extracts. ROR&#x003b2;, in comparison with RXR&#x003b1;&#x02013;RAR&#x003b1; and Gal&#x02013;VP16, might depend more strongly on a general factor(s) that is required for subsequent rounds of transcription and is limited in HeLa nuclear extracts. Putative candidates could be factors required for promoter clearance, such as the general transcription factor TFIIH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c29">29</xref>), or for elongation of subsequent transcription rounds, such as the elongation factor SII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c30">30</xref>).</p><p> Another intriguing possibility is that ROR&#x003b2; facilitates cofactor-dependent reinitiation in Neuro2A but not in HeLa nuclear extracts. Several <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have shown that reinitiation of transcription is fast as compared to the slow first round of transcription. In the first round of transcription, a preinitiation complex has to be recruited to the promoter, which appears to be a very slow process <italic>in vitro</italic>. At some promoters a committed complex consisting of TFIID and other factors such as TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIH, TFIIE and Mediator has been detected after the initial polymerase escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c34">34</xref>). Such a committed complex might act as a scaffold for rapid formation of subsequent reinitiation complexes. Whether the continued presence of an activator is required to stabilise such a complex is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c35">35</xref>) and may depend on the transcription factor and template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c29">29</xref>). Several activators, such as the heat shock factor or estrogen receptor, have been shown to enhance not only PIC assembly but also the rate of reinitiation in cell-free systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c36">36</xref>). ROR&#x003b2; might instigate transcription efficiently in Neuro2A but not in HeLa nuclear extracts due to the presence of an extract-specific factor(s) in Neuro2A nuclear extracts that facilitates ROR&#x003b2;-dependent reinitiation of transcription. Such a factor might be a cell type-specific homologue of TBP, such as TRF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c37">37</xref>), or a cell type-specific cofactor involved in reinitiation. Alternatively, the impaired ability of ROR&#x003b2; to reinitiate transcription in HeLa nuclear extracts could be caused by the presence of an inhibitory factor in HeLa nuclear extracts that specifically blocks ROR&#x003b2;-dependent reinitiation.</p><p> The analysis of reinitiation mechanisms is difficult since it requires proof that initiation of the second and later rounds derive from the promoter already used in the first round of transcription, i.e. it has to be excluded that the transcripts synthesised at a later stage of incubation originate from previously untranscribed promoters. This is of particular importance since several studies have demonstrated that in cell-free transcription assays only a few per cent of the promoters are transcribed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c21">21</xref>). The experiments shown in this study do not address the reinitiation mechanism and further experiments are necessary to analyse whether the transcripts produced in the first and subsequent rounds of transcription are derived from the same promoters.</p><p> The presence of a cell type-specific transcription mechanism seems likely in the light of other studies. Transient transfection studies have shown that the ligand-binding domains of ROR&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c24">24</xref>) and ROR&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c19">19</xref>) display a neuronal-specific transcriptional activity when they are fused to a Gal4 DNA-binding domain. In addition, a neuronal-specific cofactor for ROR&#x003b2; has recently been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke462c38">38</xref>). This cofactor, called NIX1, does not activate but inhibits ROR&#x003b2;-dependent transactivation when overexpressed in transient transfection assays.</p><p> In summary, we have demonstrated that the orphan nuclear receptor ROR&#x003b2; is a comparatively strong transcriptional activator <italic>in vitro</italic> when considering its low affinity for ROREs. ROR&#x003b2; is as equally efficient as such strong DNA-binding factors as RXR&#x003b1;&#x02013;RAR&#x003b1; and Gal&#x02013;VP16 in PIC stabilisation and continuous transcriptional activation in Neuro2A nuclear extracts. We further showed that ROR&#x003b2;, in contrast to RXR&#x003b1;&#x02013;RAR&#x003b1; and Gal&#x02013;VP16, cannot instigate continuous transcription in HeLa nuclear extracts. This observation suggests a different (co)factor requirement for transactivation by members of the NR1 subfamily of nuclear receptors. Fractionation and further characterisation of nuclear extracts needs to be pursued to gain insight into the mechanism of transactivation by the orphan receptor ROR&#x003b2;.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gke462f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Analysis of the Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x02013;NTA purified His<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;ROR&#x003b2; preparation.
