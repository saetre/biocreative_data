Several molecular partners with distinct functions interacting specifically with selective modules of RanBP2 have been identified. Yet, the significance of these interactions with RanBP2 and the genetic and physiological role(s) of RanBP2 in a whole-animal model remain elusive. Here, we report the identification of two novel partners of RanBP2 and a novel physiological role of RanBP2 in a mouse model. RanBP2 associates in vitro and in vivo and colocalizes with the mitochondrial metallochaperone, Cox11, and the pacemaker of glycolysis, hexokinase type I (HKI) via its leucine-rich domain. The leucine-rich domain of RanBP2 also exhibits strong chaperone activity toward intermediate and mature folding species of Cox11 supporting a chaperone role of RanBP2 in the cytosol during Cox11 biogenesis. Cox11 partially colocalizes with HKI, thus supporting additional and distinct roles in cell function. Cox11 is a strong inhibitor of HKI, and RanBP2 suppresses the inhibitory activity of Cox11 over HKI. To probe the physiological role of RanBP2 and its role in HKI function, a mouse model harboring a genetically disrupted <italic>RanBP2</italic> locus was generated. <italic>RanBP2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> are embryonically lethal, and haploinsufficiency of <italic>RanBP2</italic> in an inbred strain causes a pronounced decrease of HKI and ATP levels selectively in the central nervous system. Inbred <italic>RanBP2<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice also exhibit deficits in growth rates and glucose catabolism without impairment of glucose uptake and gluconeogenesis. These phenotypes are accompanied by a decrease in the electrophysiological responses of photosensory and postreceptoral neurons. Hence, RanBP2 and its partners emerge as critical modulators of neuronal HKI, glucose catabolism, energy homeostasis, and targets for metabolic, aging disorders and allied neuropathies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>The Ran-binding protein 2 (RanBP2) is a large protein with several domains. Although several protein partners were found to interact with selective domains of RanBP2, none to this date were found toward its large leucine-rich domain (LD). Cell-based experiments support several roles of RanBP2 in cell function, such as the production of functional proteins, control of protein trafficking between the nuclear and cytosol compartments, and control of multiple facets underlying cell division. Still, the genetic and physiological implications of the interactions between RanBP2 and its partners and of the function of RanBP2 in a whole-animal model remain elusive. The authors report the identification of two novel mitochondrial partners of the LD of RanBP2, Cox11 and hexokinase type I (HKI); and with multidisciplinary approaches probe the role of RanBP2 and its LD on Cox11, HKI, and functions allied to these. The authors found that RanBP2 exhibits chaperone activity toward HKI and Cox11. RanBP2 and Cox11 profoundly modulate HKI activity. Moreover, partial loss-of-function of <italic>RanBP2</italic> in a mouse model induces deficits in growth rates and breakdown of glucose, promotes the down-regulation of HKI and ATP levels selectively in the central nervous system, and impairs visual function. These findings support a critical role of RanBP2 and its partners in metabolic processes and allied disease states.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Aslanukov A, Bhowmick R, Guruju M, Oswald J, Raz D, et al.

The data support that Cox1 and HKI are novel partners in vivo for the large LD of RanBP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020177-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020177-g002">2</xref>). The LD of RanBP2 exhibits chaperone activity toward folding intermediates of Cox11, and possibly, the mature HKI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020177-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Cox11 inhibits noncompetitively the activity of HKI with ~2&#x02013;3 molecules of Cox11 (assuming formation of Cox11 dimer) required to inhibit completely the activity of a molecule of HKI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020177-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020177-g002">2</xref>B). Cox11 sequesters HKI by binding to HKI at a site that is distinct from the active site and effectively reduces the availability of &#x0005b;HKI&#x0005d;<sub>tot</sub> for catalysis. This is reflected by a reduction of the <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> of HKI without significantly affecting the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> of the active site of HKI toward glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020177-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020177-g002">2</xref>B). The inhibitory property of Cox11 over HKI is suppressed by RanBP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020177-g002">Figure 2</xref>C), which by itself has a weak but significant inhibitory activity over HKI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020177-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). The sub-stochiometry effect of the LD of RanBP2 over the inhibition of HKI by Cox11 supports that a LD-dependent chaperonin-like mechanism underlies the suppression of Cox11-dependent inhibition of HKI by RanBP2, and that RanBP2 acts as a molecular &#x0201c;buffer&#x0201d; over HK1 and Cox11 activities. The partial loss of the RanBP2 chaperone activity in <italic>RanBP2<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice also leads to deficits in the sequestration of HKI in the ellipsoid compartment of photosensory neurons. This possibly underlies the mistargeting of HKI to the myoid compartment of these neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020177-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). The data support that the ultimate pathophysiological outcome in HKI, caused by a reduction in RanBP2 levels and its chaperone activity, is the selective degradation of HKI as reflected by the reduced levels of HKI (and ATP) but not of other mitochondrial and NPC components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020177-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Through this process, it is also possible that deficits in RanBP2 cause a disturbance in the equilibrium between Cox11, HK1, and RanBP2 by leading to an increase of the inhibitory activity of Cox11 over HKI that promotes the uncoupling of the interaction of HKI from RanBP2, ultimately causing HKI degradation. Regardless, lower levels of HKI likely contribute to the decreased levels in ATP, slower growth rates, and diminished ability to metabolize glucose of <italic>RanBP2<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020177-g005">Figures 5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020177-g007">7</xref>).

The data herein show that the multi-chaperone role of RanBP2 extends also to its LD in light of its ability to associate to distinct folding species of Cox11 and to prevent HKI from being degraded. This chaperone function is likely to be complemented by other partners of RanBP2 with similar and pleiotropic functions. For example, the combination of the CLD of RanBP2 with several subunits of the 19S cap of the proteasome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020177-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;, and of its neighboring internal repeat, W1W2/IR with the E3-ubiquitin ligase, parkin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020177-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;, and the E2 SUMO-1-conjugating protein, Ubc9 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020177-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d; may contribute to the down-regulation of HKI by 26S proteasome-mediated proteolysis and modulation of the molecular and subcellular partitioning of these partners. In this regard, it will be interesting to probe whether parkin also causes deficits in HKI in dopaminergic neurons, since parkin was reported to modulate RanBP2 turnover &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020177-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;, and parkin loss-of-function also causes energy and growth deficits &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020177-b026">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020177-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020177-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;.

Still, other bona fide RanBP2 partners previously identified and described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Introduction</xref> also become strong candidates to play a role in energy homeostasis.

Hence, RanBP2 and its partners emerge as key players and target genes in mediating neuropathophysiological mechanisms implicated in various genetic and environmental lesions to the CNS, as in patients with Parkinson, diabetes with insulin-resistance, and other neuropathies and neurodegenerative diseases, often linked to aging manifestations. To this effect, the RanBP2 mouse model will serve as a unique genetic tool to probe selective, multiple and novel pathways, which may have not been anticipated to be linked to metabolic processes and allied pathophysiological states.</p><fig id="pgen-0020177-g009" position="float"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><title>Model Depicting a Role of RanBP2 and Some of Its Partners in Metabolic and Neuronal Function</title><p>RanBP2 interacts with Cox11 and HKI and the triad is in equilibrium under normal physiological conditions. RanBP2 prevents the inhibition of HKI by Cox11 and its degradation. The ultimate effect of RanBP2 on its partners is the stimulation of the glycolytic pathway and production of ATP. The glycolytic pathway is critical to fuel the constitutive Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPase pump to maintain the dark current between the inner and outer segment compartments of photosensory neurons. A deficit (haploinsufficiency) in RanBP2 disturbs the equilibrium between RanBP2, HKI, and Cox11. This pathophysiological event promotes the destabilization and degradation of HKI and a decrease in ATP production required to maintain the depolarization state neurons, and, hence, a reduction in the response of receptoral and postreceptoral neurons. A reduction in ATP levels also negatively modulates HKI activity/level. Decreased levels of HKI promote intracellular hyperglycemia and activate stress kinases, which modulate negatively the Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPase pump by phosphorylation.

The reduced expression of these proteins in whole-animal models generates phenotypes that are tissue-restricted and more importantly, do not seem to recapitulate phenotypes observed with knockdown experiments in cell-based culture assays. For example, short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of RanBP2 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020177-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d; and members of the Nup107-Nup160 complex &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020177-b059">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020177-b061">61</xref>&#x0005d; have shown, respectively, to cause mitotic arrest and disruption of nuclear pore assembly and deficits in mRNA export in cell culture.

While these apparent outcome disparities among experimental systems remain unclear, they could potentially result from variations in redundancies and compensatory mechanisms inherent to each experimental system.

The two resulting and independent F1s lines, with 129P2/OlaHsd inbred and 129P2/OlaHsd/C57BL/6J mixed genetic backgrounds, were tested for germline transmission by PCR and Southern blot analysis of tail genomic DNA. &#x003b2;-gal and PLAP activities in whole mount embryos and retinal sections were detected, respectively, by incubation with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl &#x003b2;-D-galactopyranoside and AP staining buffer (0.1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, 1 mg/ml nitroblue tetrazolium in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.5), 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) as described elsewhere &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020177-b067">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020177-b068">68</xref>&#x0005d;.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Western blot and quantitation analysis of protein expression and ATP levels.</title><p>Homogenates and detergent solubilized extracts of tissues and immunoblots were prepared as described elsewhere &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020177-b069">69</xref>&#x0005d;. Quantitation of immunoblot bands calibrated against internal marker bands, such as mHsp70 and Nup153, was carried out with Gel Pro Analyzer (MediaCybernetics, San Diego, California, United States). For determination of ATP levels, freshly dissected and flash-frozen tissues were homogenized in 2.5&#x00025; trichloroacetic acid (TCA), neutralized, and diluted to a final concentration of 0.1&#x00025; with Tris-Acetate (pH 7.75). ATP measurements were carried out with the ENLITEN ATP Assay System Bioluminescence Detection Kit for ATP (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, United States) as per the manufacturer's instruction in SpectraMax-M5 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, California, United States). Protein concentration was measured by the BCA method (BioRad, Hercules, California, United States) using BSA as a standard.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Metabolic assays.</title><p>Two groups of male mice were kept under separate diet since gestation or birth. One group was fed with a normal chow diet (PicoLab Rodent Diet 20 &#x02212;5053; LabDiet, Richmond, Indiana, United States), while the other was placed on a higher energy and fat diet (PicoLab Mouse Diet 20 &#x02212;5058; LabDiet). Glucose tolerance test was performed on overnight-fasted mice injected intraperitoneally with 2 g of glucose per kg of body weight. Venous blood glucose values were determined at immediately before (0 min), and 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after the injection with an automatic glucose monitor instrument (One Touch Ultra, Lifescan). Insulin tolerance test was performed the same way as that described for the glucose tolerance test with the exception that human insulin (0.75 U/kg of body mass) was injected intraperitoneally in non-fasted mice. Pyruvate challenge test was performed the same way as that described for the glucose tolerance test with the exception that pyruvate dissolved in saline (2 g/kg of body mass) was injected intraperitoneally in overnight-fasted mice.</p></sec><sec id="s4j"><title>Electroretinography.</title><p>Five ~6-mo-old male <italic>RanBP2<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> and <italic>RanBP2<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice in <italic>129ola</italic> background were kept in dim cyclic light (10 lux) for 2 wk before electroretinographic responses were recorded. The mice were anesthetized intraperitoneally with ketamine (80 mg/kg) and xylazine (4 mg/kg). Body temperature was maintained with a heating pad at 37.5 &#x000b1; 1 &#x000b0;C throughout the recording. The pupils were fully dilated with 0.5&#x00025; tropicamide and 2.5&#x00025; phenylephrine HCl, and both eyes were recorded simultaneously. Corneal gold-wire loops were used as the active electrodes under 0.5&#x00025; proparacaine hydrochloride topical anesthesia. Gold-wire electrodes placed on the sclera near the limbus served as reference electrodes. A ground wire was attached to the ear. Scotopic responses were recorded from threshold to 9 log units of intensity above threshold, amplified, and filtered (5,000 gain, 0.1&#x02013;1,000 Hz). For photopic recordings background light at 34 cd/m<sup>2</sup> was used to suppress rod function.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen-0020177-sg001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>Western Blot Analysis of the Association of LD of RanBP2 with HKI and Cox11 across Tissues</title><p>GST-JX2 (2.2 &#x003bc;M) was incubated with different tissue extracts (~2.0 mg) and the GST-JX2 coprecipitates from seven different tissues were analyzed by Western blot with the antibodies against HKI and Cox11.
