Uveitis and its associated complications cause the progressive destruction of the eye and eventually result in blindness. Experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) is a well-established animal model for the human disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. T helper (Th)1 cell-mediated response was considered in the early years, to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of uveitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. However, recent studies have demonstrated that interferon (IFN)-&#x003b3; is not the only key cytokine responsible. Interleukin (IL)-12 has protective effects in the development of diseases in the EAU model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>], while IL-17-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (Th17 cells, distinct from classic Th1 and Th2 cells) exerts more pronounced functions in autoimmune diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. Upregulation of the IL-17&#x02013;IL-23 pathway has also been reported to play an important role in the pathogenesis of human autoimmune diseases, but its precise mechanisms in autoimmune uveitis remain unclear.</p><p>IL-21 is a novel pro-inflammatory cytokine that was recently found to contribute to immune responses in the Th17 pathways. It was first identified in 2000 as a new member of the type I four-&#x003b1;-helical-bundle cytokine family; its receptor shares the common &#x003b3; chain and signals via the Janus kinase (JAK)/ Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STAT) pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. In addition, IL-21 has been shown to be mainly produced by activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, but its receptor has been detected on several different cell types. Researchers have found that IL-21 has broad effects on both innate and adaptive immunity; it induces the proliferation and differentiation of T and B lymphoid cells and increases the activity of CD8<sup>+</sup> T and natural killer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. Recently IL-21 has been characterized as being closely related to Th17 cells; it promotes the differentiation of Th17 cells and augments IL-17 production in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. The pro-inflammatory functions of IL-21 are also associated with many autoimmune disease models, including experimental autoimmune encephalomayelitis, adjuvant-induced arthritis and experimental colitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. However, whether IL-21 is involved in the development of uveitis, a typical autoimmune disease, and whether it can regulate IL-17 production in EAU, are still unknown.</p><p>This study was, therefore, designed to investigate the alteration and possible function of IL-21 in the development of the EAU model. Our results showed that the expression of IL-21 was markedly increased in both splenocytes and draining lymph node (DLN) cells of EAU mice compared to that in the normal controls and the recovery phase. The expression of the IL-21 receptor (IL-21R) was also found significantly elevated in EAU mice in both mRNA and protein levels. Recombinant IL-21 could promote the increase in IL-17 production by splenocytes and DLN cells of EAU mice. in vitro These data suggest that upregulated IL-21 production may play an active role in the development of inflammation in EAU mice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p>B10.RIII mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were housed in a specific pathogen-free facility at the animal center.

Mice were immunized with a subcutaneous injection of human IRBP peptide 161&#x02013;180 (50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mouse), emulsified (1:1, vol/vol) with complete Freund&#x02019;s adjuvant (CFA; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Pertussis toxin (Sigma-Aldrich), 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g in 0.1&#x000a0;ml, was concurrently injected intraperitoneally. Mice were examined by slit lamp and direct funduscopy for clinical signs. For histopathologic evaluation, eyes were enuculated, fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered formaldehyde, dehydrated, and embedded in methacrylate. Then 5-&#x000b5;m sections were cut through the pupillary&#x02013;optic nerve plane and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E; Guangzhou, China). Disease scores were evaluated on the extent of inflammation and tissue damage by histopathology, as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. Briefly, retinal perivascular infiltration and monocytic infiltration in the vitreous were scored as 1; granuloma formation, the presence of occluded retinal vasculitis, photoreceptor folds, serous detachment and loss of photoreceptor were scored as 2; formation of Dalen-Fuchs nodules, and development of subretinal neovascularization were scored as 3 and 4, according to the number and the size of the lesions. Mice (Week 5-6 or more after immunization) showed no inflammation by clinic and histopathological observation were considered as mice of recovery phase.

In this study, we explored the involvement of IL-21 in the pathogenesis of EAU, given that IL-21 acts as an essential cytokine in immune responses and plays important roles in many autoimmune diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]. Our results showed that the expression of IL-21 and IL-21R were significantly higher in both splenocytes and DLN cells of EAU mice compared with those in recovery phase mice and controls. In vitro recombinant mouse IL-21 combined with or without TGF-&#x003b2; could induce markedly increased IL-17 secretion in cell cultures of splenocytes and DLN cells of EAU mice. These results suggest that IL-21 may be actively involved in promoting the development of EAU.</p><p>It has been demonstrated recently that IL-21 plays a pivotal role in either initial or acquired immunity and is closely associated with several autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowl disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. Administration of IL-21 promoted the inflammatory influx and increased the severity of disease, and IL-21-deficient mice showed markedly reduced disease score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. To further investigate its function, we analyzed the role of IL-21 in EAU, a typical T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease. First we examined the expression of IL-21 in EAU mice and controls. <italic>IL-21</italic> mRNA levels in the DLN cells of EAU mice were upregulated compared with recovery phase mice and controls. We found a similar augmentation in the splenocytes of EAU.

Therefore, we examined whether IL-21R expressions in DLN and spleen cells of EAU mice are also elevated. Results showed that IL-21R expressions are significantly increased in both DLN and spleen cells of EAU mice at the mRNA level compared to recovery phase mice and controls. Elevated IL-21R expression was also detected in EAU at the protein level by flow cytometry analysis. There was a markedly higher IL-21R expression in either CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> cells of EAU mice compared with controls, and we obtained similar results for both DLN and spleen cells. Other studies have shown that IL-21R is upregulated on T cells upon activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. Thus, the results that CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells express high levels of IL-21R suggest that these cells may be the potential target cells of IL-21 in EAU mice.</p><p>The mechanism of IL-21 function and its specific role in Th1/Th2/Th17 cell differentiation and related response remains to be clarified.

IL-17 was first found significantly increased in the DLN and spleen cells of EAU mice compared to controls without stimulation. This suggests that IL-17 plays an important role in the development of autoimmune uveitis. The effects of IL-21 on IL-17 production were observed using methods similar to those used by other authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. Our results showed that IL-21 would induce IL-17 secretion in the DLN and spleen cells of EAU mice. IL-21 combined with TGF-&#x003b2; stimulation promoted a significantly increased IL-21 production in the EAU cells.</p><p>The theories concerning the role of IL-21 in Th1, Th2, and Th17 responses are still controversial. Studies have demonstrated that IL-21 is essential for the differentiation of Th17 cells and plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. There is also a report that IL-21 is not essential for Th17 expansion in EAE models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>]. This discrepancy might be because of the different model and genetic backgrounds of the mouse lines used for the two studies. A recent study has also shown that IL-21 production is not restricted to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells; natural killer T cells are also potent producers of IL-21 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>]. Studies of the detailed mechanisms of IL-21 function in EAU, including the cellular source of IL-21, will be performed in the near future. Inhibition experiments using anti-IL-21 antibody or IL-21 knockout mice should also be done to further identify the effects of IL-21 in EAU.</p><p>In summary, our study showed that increased IL-21 production and elevated IL-21R expression may be associated with the development of autoimmune uveitis in mice. Our results showed that IL-21 or combined with TGF-&#x003b2; would induce increased IL-17 production. With the suggestion that the IL-21&#x02013;IL-21R pathway may be involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune uveitis, we propose a possible therapeutic approach for autoimmune uveitis through the manipulation of IL-21 secretion.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Hongyan Zhou and Xiaomin Lin for their technical
