Although interactions between extracellular matrix proteins and integrins are critical to some of these processes, the downstream signaling pathways they control are still poorly understood. Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a focal adhesion protein that associates with multiple binding partners to link integrins to the actin cytoskeleton and is thought to participate in integrin and growth factor&#x02013;mediated signaling. Using SC-specific gene ablation, we report essential functions for ILK in radial sorting of axon bundles and in remyelination in the peripheral nervous system. Our in vivo and in vitro experiments show that ILK negatively regulates Rho/Rho kinase signaling to promote SC process extension and to initiate radial sorting. ILK also facilitates axon remyelination, likely by promoting the activation of downstream molecules such as AKT/protein kinase B.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Myelination of axons promotes neuronal survival and greatly increases the conduction velocity of nerve impulses. The control of Schwann cell (SC) differentiation and myelination derives at least in part from instructive cues originating within the extracellular environment. These signals include growth factors and proteins of the ECM as essential components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Colognato et al., 2005</xref>). Integrins, a major group of cell adhesion receptors for the proteins of the ECM, are composed of two noncovalently associated transmembrane glycoprotein subunits, &#x003b1; and &#x003b2;, both of which participate in the binding of ECM proteins. Ligand binding recruits cytoskeleton and signaling molecules to cell matrix contact sites where they link the actin cytoskeleton to the ECM and mediate signal transduction between the extracellular and the intracellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hynes, 1992</xref>). In SCs, the genetic deletion of the &#x003b2;1-integrin gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feltri et al., 2002</xref>) causes defects in SC&#x02013;axon contact and impairs the capacity of SCs to extend cytoplasmic processes into embryonic axon bundles to establish 1:1 relationships with individual axons, a process referred to as radial sorting. SC-specific deletion of FAK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grove et al., 2007</xref>) or Rac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benninger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nodari et al., 2007</xref>), proteins involved in &#x003b2;1-integrin&#x02013;mediated signaling, also results in deficient radial sorting. However, distinct cellular defects can underlie a common radial sorting phenotype. In FAK mutant nerves, impairment in radial sorting is likely to be caused by reduced SC proliferation and not by defects in SC&#x02013;axon contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grove et al., 2007</xref>), similar to defects observed in SC-specific Cdc42 (cell division cycle 42)-deficient nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benninger et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Integrin-linked kinase (ILK), a 52-kD protein identified and cloned based on its interaction with the &#x003b2;1-integrin cytoplasmic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hannigan et al., 1996</xref>), is thought to be an essential regulator of integrin and growth factor&#x02013;mediated signaling, functioning both as an adaptor protein and as a putative serine/threonine kinase. It consists of three domains: four N-terminal ankyrin repeats, a putative pleckstrin homology domain, and a C-terminal kinase domain. As an adaptor protein, ILK binds to particularly interesting new Cys-His&#x02013;rich protein (PINCH) via its N-terminal domain and to parvins via its kinase domain to form a ternary complex that subsequently locates to cell&#x02013;ECM adhesions. There, ILK binds the cytoplasmic domains of activated &#x003b2;1- and &#x003b2;3-integrin subunits, and the ILK&#x02013;PINCH&#x02013;parvin (IPP) complex can function as a signaling platform downstream of integrins by interfacing with the actin cytoskeleton and several different signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Legate et al., 2006</xref>). The IPP complex can bind to filamentous actin via parvin and paxillin, which also binds directly to the ILK C-terminal kinase domain. Paxillin also binds to guanine nucleotide exchange factors, providing a connection between ILK and the GTPases of the Rho subfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rosenberger et al., 2003</xref>) of which at least Cdc42 and Rac1 regulate SC development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benninger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nodari et al., 2007</xref>). Via PINCH, the complex can bind to the receptor tyrosine kinase&#x02013;binding adaptor protein Nck-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tu et al., 1998</xref>), establishing a potential direct link between ILK and growth factor signaling. Via its kinase domain, ILK is also thought to phosphorylate glycogen synthase kinase 3&#x003b2; (GSK3&#x003b2;) and AKT/PKB, which are involved in signaling pathways regulating proliferation, survival, and differentiation of different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Legate et al., 2006</xref>), including SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Campana et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maurel and Salzer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ogata et al., 2004</xref>). However, the direct phosphorylation of AKT/PKB by ILK is controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Legate et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we used conditional transgenic approaches in the mouse to investigate the roles of ILK in SC development in combination with cell culture experiments. We show that ILK is essential for radial sorting and axon remyelination and that the regulation of these two events is likely to require the activation of different signaling pathways.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Conditional ablation of <italic>ILK</italic> in SCs</title><p>We conditionally ablated <italic>ILK</italic> by expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the desert hedgehog (<italic>Dhh</italic>) gene regulatory sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>).

SC proliferation is associated with radial sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Webster, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martin and Webster, 1973</xref>), and it is thought that a minimum threshold number of SCs is required to initiate this process.

In <italic>ILK</italic> mutant nerves, the numbers of SCs were normal and neither proliferation nor survival was affected. (Fig. S3, C&#x02013;E). Therefore, and similarly to what has been postulated for <italic>&#x003b2;1-integrin</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feltri et al., 2002</xref>) and <italic>Rac1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benninger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nodari et al., 2007</xref>) mutant nerves, we consider it likely that the radial sorting impairment in ILK mutant nerves is a direct consequence of deficits in SC process extension. Our data supporting this view include (a) the inability of immature ILK-deficient SCs to completely envelop axon bundles, (b) the formation of abnormal cytoplasmic protrusions projecting from the surface of ILK mutant SC&#x02013;axon units, (c) the presence of layers of empty BL surrounding axon bundles and SC&#x02013;axon units in <italic>ILK</italic> mutant nerves, suggesting failed attempts of mutant SCs to engage axon bundles and individual axons, (d) the finding that ILK mutant SCs plated on laminin-2, a component of SC BL, produced shorter processes compared with controls, and (e) the observation that the dynamics of process extension and retraction in mutant SCs was vastly increased as compared with controls.</p><p>The stability of the individual members of the IPP complex is dependent on the formation of the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Legate et al., 2006</xref>). In SCs, the loss of ILK resulted in reduced expression of other individual members of the IPP complex. Furthermore, the IPP complex can regulate the activity of Rho GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Legate et al., 2006</xref>). We show that in ILK mutant nerves, the activities of Rac1, Cdc42, and Rho were increased compared with controls. Given that Rac1 activity is regulated by &#x003b2;1-integrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benninger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nodari et al., 2007</xref>), the increase of activity of Rac1 in the absence of ILK was somewhat surprising. However, in addition to &#x003b2;1-integrin, ILK also binds directly to &#x003b2;3-integrin and indirectly to other receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Legate et al., 2006</xref>). This might explain why ILK regulation of Rac1 in particular, and Rho GTPases in general, does not mirror that of &#x003b2;1-integrin. In the PNS, the expression of RhoA, and of the two isoforms ROCK1 and ROCK2, is developmentally regulated, peaking at the onset of myelination and dropping afterward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Melendez-Vasquez et al., 2004</xref>). Other Rho proteins, i.e., RhoB and C, are also expressed in SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Terashima et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Melendez-Vasquez et al., 2004</xref>), but their pattern of expression and specific functions are not known. Inhibition of ROCK by either Y27632 or fasudil restored process extension to mutant SCs in culture, suggesting that in SCs, ILK controls process extension mainly through regulation of Rho/ROCK activity.</p><p>ILK is known to negatively regulate Rho/ROCK activity by different mechanisms, including integrin-dependent FAK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tahiliani et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wennerberg et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Parsons, 2003</xref>) and paxillin phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2005</xref>). Negative regulation of Rho/ROCK activation by FAK might be dependent on FAK/Src phosphorylation of p190Rho&#x02013;GTPase-activating protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schober et al., 2007</xref>) to promote Rho inactivation. In this study, we show that in ILK mutant nerve lysates, the activation of FAK, measured by a phospho-specific antibody recognizing the FAK autophosphorylation residue tyrosine 397, was significantly reduced as compared with controls. However, FAK appears to not regulate SC process extension, and SC-specific ablation of FAK mainly affects SC proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grove et al., 2007</xref>). Paxillin phosphorylation was also reduced in ILK mutant nerves. Paxillin is thought to participate in SC cytoskeletal reorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2000</xref>), but its direct role in SC process extension has not been investigated. We also show in this study that RhoE expression is dramatically reduced in <italic>ILK</italic> mutant SCs. RhoE belongs to the Rnd subfamily of the Rho GTPases and, like the other subfamily members, binds but does not hydrolyze GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Riento et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, it is not regulated by the classical GTP/GDP conformational switch of small Rho GTPases. RhoE exists in a GTP-bound state and antagonizes Rho/ROCK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Riento et al., 2005</xref>) by binding and preventing ROCK I from interacting with its downstream targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Riento et al., 2003</xref>). Our data, and the observation that short hairpin RNA&#x02013;mediated knockdown of RhoE dramatically reduces process extension in primary rat SCs (our unpublished results), suggest that ILK regulation of RhoE is important in controlling SC process extension.</p><p>Finally, fasudil injections in mutant mice were sufficient to stimulate and reestablish radial sorting in mutant nerves. Together with our in vitro results, this supports the conclusion that inhibition of Rho/ROCK activity is essential to promote SC process extension and to initiate radial sorting. Other pathways than those regulated by ILK might also contribute to the negative regulation of Rho/ROCK signaling. Supporting this hypothesis is the observation that the mean length of SC processes in control cultures treated with Y27632 or fasudil was increased in relation to nontreated controls, indicating that the ILK-mediated inhibition of Rho/ROCK signaling was not complete.</p></sec><sec><title>ILK regulates remyelination</title><p>Stimulation of radial sorting by ROCK inhibition in ILK mutant nerves did not result in an increase in the number of myelinated fibers. This suggests that ILK function might be required for myelination of axons and that the signaling mechanisms for radial sorting and myelination of axons are likely to be different. This hypothesis is further supported by experiments using myelinating dorsal root ganglia (DRG) explant cultures derived from E13.5 mutant and control mice. In contrast to control DRG explant cultures, ILK mutant cultures largely failed to myelinate even after 10 d of continuous treatment with fasudil or Y27632 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200809008/DC1">Fig. S5</ext-link>).</p><p>The radial sorting phenotype of the <italic>ILK</italic> mutant prevented us from directly investigating the role of ILK in axonal myelination. Therefore, to address the role of ILK in myelin sheath formation independently of radial sorting, we used an inducible gene ablation system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leone et al., 2003</xref>) followed by nerve crush. We demonstrate that after SN CI in adult mice, ILK-deficient SCs established 1:1 relations with axons, but a large proportion of axon&#x02013;SC units failed to form myelin sheaths even 4 mo after CI. These findings indicate that at least during remyelination, ILK is required for the production of myelin sheaths.</p></sec><sec><title>ILK regulates AKT/PKB activation during PNS development</title><p>Phosphorylation of AKT/PKB can be regulated by the amount of neuregulin-1 type III present on the axon surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nave and Salzer, 2006</xref>) and is thought to be critical for SC myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Campana et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maurel and Salzer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ogata et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nave and Salzer, 2006</xref>). Loss of ILK reduced the levels of AKT/PKB phosphorylation on Ser-473 but not on Thr-308 during PNS development. In fact, the levels of AKT/PKB phosphorylation on Thr-308 in mutant nerve lysates were even increased compared with controls. It is possible that increased phosphorylation on Thr-308 partially compensates for reduced AKT/PKB phosphorylation on Ser-473. However, if this is true, such compensation is likely to be ILK independent. In cancer cells, ILK specifically regulates the phosphorylation of Ser-473 but not of Thr-308 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McDonald et al., 2008</xref>), raising the interesting possibility that Ser-473 phosphorylation may regulate different downstream targets than phosphorylation on Thr-308 under certain conditions. After CI, the levels of AKT/PKB phosphorylation on Ser-473 in tamoxifen-induced mutant nerve lysates were also reduced compared with controls. These results are consistent with the idea that ILK directly or indirectly regulates the phosphorylation of AKT/PKB on Ser-473. Based on this view, ILK can either function as a direct AKT/PKB Ser-473 kinase or be involved in the cellular regulation of putative AKT/PKB Ser-473 kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hill et al., 2002</xref>). Although in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Troussard et al., 2003</xref>), oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chun et al., 2003</xref>), and primary skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2008</xref>) the phosphorylation of AKT/PKB is dependent on ILK function, this requirement appears to be cell type specific. Loss of ILK did not change AKT/PKB phosphorylation in chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grashoff et al., 2003</xref>), keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lorenz et al., 2007</xref>), or nestin-positive neural progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mills et al., 2006</xref>). In addition to differentiation, the phosphorylation of AKT/PKB has been implicated in the control of SC proliferation and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Campana et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Monje et al., 2006</xref>). However, in ILK mutant nerves, proliferation and survival was normal, indicating that the reduced levels of AKT/PKB phosphorylation were sufficient to promote SC proliferation and survival but not to support SC myelination.</p><p>In summary, we show that ILK and associated molecules of the IPP complex, functioning at the critical convergence of adhesion and growth factor signaling pathways, regulate radial sorting and remyelination of axons in the PNS. The multidimensional nature of this regulation is likely to rely on the activation of a multitude of different downstream pathways besides those controlling Rho/ROCK and AKT/PKB activation. To unveil these pathways in detail and to study their impact on PNS myelination and remyelination remains an important task for the future. This knowledge will be essential for our basic understanding of nerve biology in health and disease.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="Materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Generation of conditional knockout mice</title><p>The generation of conditional <italic>ILK</italic> mutant has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grashoff et al., 2003</xref>).
