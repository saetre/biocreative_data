Surprisingly, tests of learning and memory revealed that the ability to learn was not reduced in old NEP-deficient mice but instead had significantly improved, and sustained learning and memory in the aged mice was congruent with improved long-term potentiation (LTP) in brain slices of the hippocampus and lateral amygdala. Our data suggests a beneficial effect of pharmacological inhibition of cerebral NEP on learning and memory in mice due to the accumulation of peptides other than A&#x003b2; degradable by NEP.

In a two-way active avoidance task (shuttle box), mice had to learn to associate a sound (conditioned stimulus) delivered through rods on the floor of the shuttle box. They could avoid foot shock by moving to the opposite site of the chamber as soon as the conditioned stimulus was presented. The 6-month-old mice did not differ in any measured parameter (<bold>data not shown</bold>). We also found no significant differences in the training phase between the two groups of 21-month-old mice, but relearning performance was much better in NEP-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004590-g003"><bold>Figure 3d</bold></xref>). Thus, the age-dependent differences between the two genotypes further confirm the findings of the Morris water maze, and therefore two independent behavioral tests support the preserved learning in older mice deficient for the NEP gene. To test the emotional status of the knockout mice, both groups underwent the marble burying test. The data obtained suggests that knockout mice showed more anxious behavior towards novel objects than the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004590-g003"><bold>Figure 3e</bold></xref>).

It is even more remarkable that the age-dependent decline in learning ability as shown for our wild-type animals is eliminated in aged NEP knockouts. These findings are strengthened by our electrophysiological findings. Since considerable effort has gone into attempts to relate hippocampal LTP to learning and memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004590-Eichenbaum1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004590-Morris1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, we examined behavior and electrophysiology in the same subjects as an approach to link LTP with learning. Our data shows that sustained learning and memory in aged mice was paralleled by an improved LTP in horizontal brain slices of the hippocampal CA1 region and the lateral nucleus of the amygdala. The hippocampus is known to be involved in a variety of learning tasks, especially spatial learning in rodents. Long-term synaptic plasticity of glutamate-mediated transmission in the CA1 region of the hippocampus is believed to be an important process in learning and memory in vertebrates. In addition to the crucial role played by amino acid-mediated synaptic transmission, the hippocampus also receives a variety of non-amino acid-mediated synaptic input with the capacity to either promote or restrict the induction of long-term synaptic plasticity.</p><p>The underlying mechanisms leading to better learning and improved LTP are still speculative. However, this improved learning seems more likely to be an A&#x003b2;-independent effect in our mouse model. With respect to that conclusion, it is interesting to note that local A&#x003b2; accumulation following short-term inhibition of NEP by thiorphan infusion in either hippocampus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004590-Zou1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref> or the cortical ventricle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004590-Mouri1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref> led to impaired learning and memory. These authors pharmacologically inhibited NEP in young rats for 4 weeks. Thus, their elegant approach to demonstrate that increased A&#x003b2; amounts are linked to impaired learning does not reflect on the situation in the aged NEP-deficient brain where, regardless of accumulating A&#x003b2;, the concentration of other peptides is altered. Moreover, comparing the results of thiorphan-treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004590-Iwata3">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004590-Zou1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004590-Mouri1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref> with experiments in NEP-knockout mice, we have to consider that thiorphan inhibits further NEP-like peptidases whose activities are not impaired in NEP-deficient mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004590-Shirotani1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Nevertheless, further experiments should also prove a second possible explanation for the difference between genetically generated NEP deficiency and pharmacologically reduced NEP activity by thiorphan, namely that the unconditioned knockout of NEP results in several compensatory changes in the activities of peptidases discussed to be involved in A&#x003b2; degradation.</p><p>It has been shown that NEP targets a variety of peptides involved in learning and memory such as oxytocin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004590-Heinrichs1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, NPY <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004590-Carvajal1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref> or CCK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004590-Hadjiivanova1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, marked improvement in learning and memory in very old NEP-deficient mice if compared with their aged-matched controls appears to be explained best by these NEP-degradable neuropeptides. Nevertheless, the known catalytic properties of NEP - it preferentially hydrolyses oligopeptides by cleaving on the N-terminal side of hydrophobic amino acid residues - and the knowledge of further potential learning-associated peptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004590-HupeSodmann1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004590-Brewer1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref> motivated us to test several other neuropeptides for being potential NEP substrates. Consequently, we initiated our own studies on the postulated NEP-dependent metabolism of GLP-1 and galanin. First results underscore the likelihood of our assumption. We observed <italic>in vitro</italic> a significant GLP-1 degradation by rcNEP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004590-g005"><bold>Figure 5a</bold></xref>) and a reduced rate of GLP-1 degradation in brains lacking NEP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004590-g005"><bold>Figure 5b</bold></xref>) comparable to that in wild-type membranes pretreated with NEP inhibitor candoxatrilat (<bold>data not shown</bold>). This is in agreement with a study of Hupe-Sodmann <italic>et al.</italic> (1995) postulating NEP peptidolytic activity for GLP-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004590-HupeSodmann1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Our finding is all the more important, since GLP-1 has been found to improve associative and spatial learning if injected intracerebroventricularly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004590-During1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004590-g005"><bold>Figures 5a and b</bold></xref>, we also identified galanin as a NEP substrate. Since, as we showed, GLP-1 and galanin are substrates for NEP, NEP deficiency may lead to an elevation of both peptides, thus improving learning and memory. To also test this hypothesis, we measured the concentration of both peptides in the cortex of NEP-deficient mice and their wild-type controls, and checked for possible age-dependency. While differences did not occur for galanin or have been minor for GLP-1 in 6-month-old mice that could not be discriminated in their learning capacity, significantly higher levels of both peptides were measured in aged NEP knockouts that are characterized by sustained learning capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004590-g005"><bold>Figure 5c</bold></xref>).

However, NEP inhibition, although cardioprotective, could be a dangerous treatment strategy in humans, since the lack of central human NEP might lead to A&#x003b2; accumulation, plaque and fibril formation (in contrast to murine A&#x003b2; that does not aggregate to such macrostructures).

The antibody-evoked specificity of staining ensured the specificity of the method.</p></sec><sec id="s3h"><title>Behavioral tests</title><sec id="s3h1"><title>Morris water maze</title><p>Sets of neurological and behavioral examinations demonstrated no differences in sensorimotoric or motivational functions between NEP knockout and wild-type mice. Thus, the hidden-platform test was performed in this study.</p><p>The Morris water maze was a round pool (1 m in diameter, 46 cm high) filled with water (20&#x000b0;C) to a depth of 26 cm. Different patterns were assigned to each segment for navigation. The platform (10 cm in diameter) was submerged by 0.2 cm. Water was made opaque by adding SAKRET&#x000a9; (SAKRET Trockenbaustoffe Europa GmbH, Wiesbaden, Germany) dispersion color. For three consecutive days, each mouse was placed in the pool six times at different starting points with a 20-min interval between trials at different places (training). Mice were given 120 sec to swim. After locating the platform, mice were allowed to remain on it for 15 sec before being returned to their home cages. Mice that did not locate the platform were placed on it and scored as 120 sec. Escape latencies for individual mice were averaged from each daily trial and for the time the animals needed within the first trial per day to reach the platform. Age-dependent differences were statistically calculated by a Student's t test. Genotype-dependent differences over time were calculated by a two-way ANOVA test. In an independent experimental setting different swimming speed between the two genotypes was excluded (NEP knockout: 13.1&#x000b1;1.5 vs. wild-type: 14.4&#x000b1;1.2 m/min).</p></sec><sec id="s3h2"><title>Shuttle box experiments</title><p>The automatic shuttle box (0.35&#x000d7;0.13&#x000d7;0.15 m) was divided into two identical compartments separated by a 5 cm hurdle. The conditioned stimuli were light (40 W bulbs located on the central ceiling of each compartment) and a sound produced by a buzzer. The unconditioned stimulus was an electric stimulation of 0.2&#x02013;0.4 mA depending on the individual sensitiveness of the animal (discernible reaction of the animal to the stimulation) whilst remaining below the vocalization threshold, delivered through stainless steel rods covering the floor (50 Hz, impulse widths 10 ms, pulsatile direct current). The conditioned stimuli - unconditioned stimulus interval was 4 sec. The stimuli were switched off when the mouse had moved to the goal compartment. One trial was limited to 20 sec if the animal failed to react within this period. The mean interval between trials was 30 sec. Prior to the first session, the mice were allowed to explore the box for 5 min. The training session involved 80 light/foot shock combinations. The next day, a relearning session was performed under identical conditions after one minute of habituation. The number of conditioned reactions (reaction time &#x0003c;4 sec) and intertribal activity were recorded. In-time escape from the shock-prone compartment was evaluated as a positive trial.</p><p>In a second shuttle-box experiment, another group of animals was tested on 5 consecutive days in the shuttle box. The animals were given 30 light/foot shock combinations a day. Test conditions (current, stimuli, stimuli intervals, and habituation) were identical to those described above. Significant differences were calculated by a Student's t test.</p></sec><sec id="s3h3"><title>Marble burying test</title><p>The marble burying test is a validated model for object-related anxiety and compulsive-like behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004590-Njunge1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004590-Martin1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. This test was performed in Macrolon II cages. The floor of each cage was covered with 5 cm of commercial bedding material (Rettenmaier GmbH, Rosenberg, Germany) on which 12 glass marbles (diameter 1.2 cm) were spaced. The mice were placed individually in a cage and left undisturbed for 30 min. The room was illuminated with standard fluorescent strip lights. After the test, the number of buried marbles (more than 75&#x00025; of the marble volume) was counted and the bedding changed. The marbles were washed with 70&#x00025; ethanol and dried prior to the first test and after each test. Significant differences were calculated by a Student's t test.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3i"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Wild-type and knockout adult (9-month-old) or aged (24-month-old) mice were used in electrophysiological experiments. As described earlier in detail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004590-Drephal1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>, the mice were anesthetized and decapitated. Their brains were rapidly removed and placed in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) with the following composition: NaCl: 124 mM; KCl: 3 mM; NaHCO<sub>3</sub>: 26 mM; Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>: 1.25 mM; MgSO<sub>4</sub>: 1.8 mM; CaCl<sub>2</sub>: 1.6 mM; glucose: 10 mM. The slices were placed in an interface chamber and allowed to equilibrate for 120 min at 34&#x000b0;C. They were superfused continuously with ACSF (1.5 ml/min). The pH was maintained at 7.4 by equilibration of the solution with 95&#x00025; O<sub>2</sub> and 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub>. Extracellular recordings from the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA) and CA1 region were made in parallel in different slices. Although we obtained similar results in <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments investigating long-term depression of activity in the LA recorded either intracellularly or extracellularly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004590-Kaschel1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, it should be considered that the negative wave recorded extracellularly in the LA reflects a summation of both EPSPs and synchronized action potentials (population spike component; PS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004590-Watanabe1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004590-Doyere1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. Watanabe <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004590-Watanabe1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref> have carried out intracellular recordings of evoked potentials and confirmed that the latency of peak negative field potentials (5&#x02013;6 ms) corresponds well with that of intracellularly recorded action potentials, indicating that the extracellularly recorded sharp negativity seems to be a population spike. We therefore preferred to analyze the amplitude of field potentials in the present study. Additionally, the slope measure in the lateral amygdala is more sensitive to variability and noise in the signal, making it more difficult to analyze <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004590-Watanabe1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, we decided to record PS also in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, to get a better comparison of results between these two limbic structures.</p><p>The input/output (I/O) response curves were constructed by varying the intensity of single-pulse stimulation (interstimulus interval: 10 sec; pulse duration: 100 &#x000b5;sec) and averaging 6 responses to each intensity. To evaluate short-term synaptic interactions, paired-pulse stimuli were delivered with interstimulus intervals ranging from 10 to 500 ms. To induce LTP in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, we stimulated Schaffer collaterals with a bipolar electrode placed on the surface of the slice to record population spikes (PS) in the pyramidal layer of the CA1 area. The stimulus was adjusted to elicit a PS at 30&#x00025; of the maximal response, which was fixed at this level throughout the experiment. In different slices of the same mice, we recorded field potentials in the caudoventral part of the LA by stimulating fibers running through the external capsule. Since the LA does not have a clear architecture like the hippocampus and theta burst stimulation (TBS) was not able to induce stable LA-LTP in aged mice, we adjusted the stimulus to elicit a field potential at 50&#x00025; of the maximal response and used high frequency stimulation (HFS) to induce LA-LTP. To express and compare changes of the field potentials (LA) or PS amplitude (CA1) between the animal groups, we averaged responses from the 56&#x02013;60 min period after HFS and TBS. While HFS was induced by 2&#x000d7;100 Hz, duration 1 sec, 30 sec apart, TBS consisting of two sets of five theta bursts separated by 30 sec (2&#x000d7;5 TBS) was used with each burst involving four pulses at 100 Hz delivered at an interval of 200 ms. The significance of the changes was assessed by the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test using a commercial statistics package (Graph Pad prism 5.0).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. H.
