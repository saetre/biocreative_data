Here we have used site-directed mutagenesis to investigate further the role of conserved charged residues in transmembrane domains. Mutation of rabbit PepT1 arginine282 (R282, transmembrane domain 7) to a positive (R282K) or physiologically titratable residue (R282H), resulted in a transporter with wild-type characteristics when expressed in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes. Neutral (R282A, R282Q) or negatively charged (R282D, R282E) substitutions gave a transporter that was not stimulated by external acidification (reducing pH<sub>out</sub> from 7.4 to 5.5) but transported at the same rate as the wild-type maximal rate (pH<sub>out</sub> 5.5); however, only the R282E mutation was unable to concentrate substrate above the extracellular level. All of the R282 mutants showed <italic>trans-</italic>stimulation of efflux comparable to the wild-type, except R282E-PepT1 which was faster. A conserved negatively charged residue, aspartate341 (D341) in transmembrane domain 8 was implicated in forming a charge pair with R282, as R282E/D341R- and R282D/D341R-PepT1 had wild-type transporter characteristics. Despite their differences in ability to accumulate substrate, both R282E- and R282D-PepT1 showed an increased charge:peptide stoichiometry over the wild-type 1:1 ratio for the neutral dipeptide Gly-<sc>l</sc>-Gln, measured using two-electrode voltage clamp. This extra charge movement was linked to substrate transport, as 4-aminobenzoic acid, which binds but is not translocated, did not induce membrane potential depolarisation in R282E-expressing oocytes. A model is proposed for the substrate binding/translocation process in PepT1.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Epithelia</kwd><kwd>Membrane transport</kwd><kwd>SLC15a1</kwd><kwd>Nutrient absorption</kwd><kwd>Protein structure&#x02013;function</kwd><kwd>Site-directed mutagenesis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>The proton-coupled di- and tri-peptide transporter PepT1 (SLC15a1) is the major route of uptake of dietary nitrogen from the intestine, and is also important along with the higher affinity gene product PepT2 (SLC15a2) in the re-absorption of filtered peptides in the kidney (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Daniel &#x00026; Kottra, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Meredith &#x00026; Boyd, 2000</xref>). In addition, PepT1 is the route of entry of a wide class of orally bio-available pharmaceutically important compounds, including the &#x003b2;-lactam antibiotics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, antiviral and anticancer agents (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Terada &#x00026; Inui, 2004</xref>). Although these therapeutic compounds are not di- or tri-peptides, they are carried by virtue of their similar 3D shape to endogenous substrates, i.e. they are peptidomimetic, and modelling of the substrate-binding site from the features in common of this huge and diverse range of substrates has led to predictions concerning which parts of the PepT1 protein may be important. For example, a substrate template model has been developed by several groups (<xref rid="bib1 bib2 bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bailey et al., 2000; Bailey et al., 2006; Biegel et al., 2005</xref>) which allows prediction of binding affinity for a potential substrate.</p><p>The rabbit PepT1 is a 707 amino acid protein, with twelve transmembrane spanning domains (TMDs) as confirmed by epitope mapping (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Covitz, Amidon, &#x00026; Sadee, 1998</xref>). In the absence of a crystal structure, attempts have been made to computer model the PepT1 transporter itself (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bolger et al., 1998</xref>), with site-directed mutagenesis used to test hypotheses generated by these models. One potential complication for these kind of studies is our recent report that PepT1 may form multimers in the plasma membrane (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Panitsas, Boyd, &#x00026; Meredith, 2006</xref>) although it is not clear how the subunits interact.</p><p>Site-directed mutagenesis has been a useful tool to identify functionally important residues in PepT1. One such residue is arginine282 in the rabbit PepT1 sequence. The mutation of arginine282 to a glutamate produced a peptide transporter (R282E-PepT1) that was no longer driven by a proton-gradient but behaved more like a facilitated peptide transporter, whilst simultaneously exhibiting peptide-gated currents that were proposed to be through a non-specific cation channel activity (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Meredith, 2004</xref>). Residue 282 is located approximately halfway down the predicted transmembrane domain 7 (TMD7), and is either an arginine or a lysine in all cloned mammalian PepT1 sequences to date. The presence of a charged amino acid residue in a TMD, along with its conservation, suggested a functional role. Here, we have systematically investigated the role of arginine282 in rabbit PepT1 by making further mutations to determine the requirement for the charge and have identified an interacting residue, aspartate341, located in putative TMD8. Some of these data have been previously published in abstract form (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Pieri, Boyd, &#x00026; Meredith, 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Site-directed mutagenesis of the PepT1 gene</title><p>Oligonucleotides were custom synthesised (Sigma-Genosys, UK) for the following sequences (residues in bold are changed from wild-type PepT1):<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>-</label><p>R282-PepT1 mutants forward:<disp-formula><mml:math id="M1" altimg="si1.gif" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>5' CGCAGATCAAGATGGTTACG</mml:mtext><mml:mstyle mathvariant="bold-italic"><mml:mi>xxx</mml:mi></mml:mstyle><mml:mtext>GTGCTGTTCCTGTACATCC 3'</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic><bold>xxx</bold></italic> was <bold>CAA</bold> for R282Q, <bold>AAG</bold> for R282K, <bold>GAT</bold> for R282D, <bold>CAT</bold> for R282H, and <bold>GCG</bold> for R282A.</p></list-item><list-item><label>-</label><p>D341-PepT1 mutants forward:<disp-formula><mml:math id="M2" altimg="si2.gif" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>5' TCCTGGTCCCCATCATG</mml:mtext><mml:mstyle mathvariant="bold-italic"><mml:mi>xxx</mml:mi></mml:mstyle><mml:mtext>GCCGTGGTGTATCC 3'</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic><bold>xxx</bold></italic> was <bold>CGC</bold> for D341R.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Reverse primers for the PepT1 mutant PCR reactions were the reverse compliment of the forward primers.

As can be seen in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, these double mutants showed the same pH dependence of influx as the wild-type transporter, providing strong evidence to support the hypothesis. Both R282E/D341R- and R282D/D341R-PepT1 were also able to concentrate substrate like the wild-type (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><label>3.7</label><title>Diethylpyrocarbonate inhibition of PepT1 function</title><p>Preincubation of wild-type PepT1-expressing oocytes with 1&#x000a0;mM diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) for 15&#x000a0;min completely inhibited the PepT1 mediated dipeptide uptake measured over 1&#x000a0;h, as shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>. This inhibition by DEPC was largely prevented by the presence of the known PepT1 substrates Gly-<sc>l</sc>-Gln and <italic>N</italic>-Acetyl-Phe (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Meredith et al., 2000</xref>), but not by the amino acid non-substrate Tyr. Interestingly, despite being a good PepT1 substrate (<italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> approximately 0.1&#x000a0;mM, data not shown), a modified peptide lacking a carboxyl terminus (<sc>l</sc>-Ala-Tyramine) only partially prevented DEPC inhibition (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p>The R282K mutation of rabbit PepT1 is not only the most conservative one regarding the charge, but in a number of species, including dog, rat and mouse, lysine is the naturally occurring residue at this position. Therefore it was not surprising to find that this mutant behaves like the wild-type rabbit PepT1 (pig, sheep, rhesus and crab-eating monkeys and human also have R282). The finding that R282H also behaved like the wild-type was interesting, as histidine has a side-chain that can be titrated over the range used in the experiments (p<italic>K</italic> of &#x0223c;6 in free solution). Our findings could be interpreted in several ways, including the possibility that only at pH<sub>out</sub> 5.5 is there the formation of a positive charge by side-chain titration that gives a stimulation of uptake over that seen at pH<sub>out</sub> 7.4. A second possibility is that the protein environment surrounding H282 is such that its side chain p<italic>K</italic> is shifted away from 6 and it is therefore always protonated, and thus behaves more like an arginine or lysine. This effect has been shown for example in the enzyme protein tyrosine kinase (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Tishmack, Bashford, Harms, &#x00026; Van Etten, 1997</xref>), where histidine residues had a p<italic>K</italic> as high as 9.2 when analysed by NMR.</p><p>In the original study on R282E-PepT1, it was concluded that the uptake of peptide by the mutant transporter was uncoupled from the movement of protons, and that in addition to acting as a facilitated peptide transporter, R282E-PepT1 also displayed a peptide-gated non-specific cation conductance (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Meredith, 2004</xref>). However, it is possible that this conclusion needs updating in the light of the current findings that there are R282 mutants that, like R282E-PepT1, are not pH stimulated, yet are still able to accumulate substrate above equilibrium when an inwardly directed proton gradient is imposed. For a transporter to be able to accumulate substrate above equilibrium, an energy source must be involved, in this case the proton electrochemical gradient. Therefore, the mutant PepT1 proteins that can accumulate substrate but do not show pH stimulation (R282A and R282D) must still be coupled to the movement of protons down their electrochemical gradient. The lack of pH stimulation could be attributed to the fact that during the transport cycle these specific mutants have a different rate limiting step to the wild-type, and that for these mutants that step is not pH dependent. It has already been reported that R282E-PepT1 has a faster rate of efflux than wild-type, consistent with an uncoupling of peptide uptake from the proton driving force (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Meredith, 2004</xref>); the finding here that the rates of efflux for the other R282 mutants are not different from that of the wild-type is in agreement with the hypothesis that they are still proton-coupled, as shown by their ability to accumulate substrate above the extracellular concentration at pH<sub>out</sub> 5.5 but not 7.4.</p><p>The simplest hypothesis was that in R282E-PepT1, the extra inward charge movement associated with peptide uptake collapsed the membrane potential, which is known to be the major driving force for proton-coupled peptide uptake (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Temple &#x00026; Boyd, 1998</xref>), hence the apparent lack of substrate accumulation. Therefore by extension one would expect R282D- and R282A-PepT1 to have the same charge coupling as the wild-type, as they too accumulate substrate, but this was not the case: both R282E-, R282D- and R282A-PepT1 showed the same increased charge:peptide apparent stoichiometry, i.e. substantially larger than the wild-type. This stoichiometry itself showed pH dependence, with a lower value of around 2 for the mutants at pH 7.4, suggesting that the current is either carried by protons or is a pH-sensitive phenomenon. There was no difference in the uptake in the absence or presence of sodium, either for R282E-PepT1 (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Meredith, 2004</xref>) or R282D-PepT1 (data not shown).</p><p>The finding that the R282E/D341R- and R282D/D341R-PepT1 double mutants (the latter being a charge pair reversal of the naturally occurring residues in rabbit PepT1) had the same characteristics as the wild-type protein strongly suggests that these two residues do interact in the 3D protein (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Pieri et al., 2004</xref>) as previously proposed (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Meredith, 2004</xref>). During the preparation of this manuscript, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Kulkarni et al. (2007)</xref> reported findings consistent with R282 and D341 forming a charge pair in human PepT1. The initial hypothesis that in R282E-PepT1 repulsion between E282 and D341 allowed the movement of extra ions through the protein when a peptide is transported was not supported however by the finding that the single D341R mutant also behaved like the wild-type, as one might have thought that R282 and R341 would repel in much the same way as E282 and D341. That D341R-PepT1 behaved like wild-type suggests that although R282 and D341 seem to form a charge pair, in rabbit PepT1 residue 341 being negatively charged is not crucial to PepT1 function; interestingly, in human PepT1 the D341R single mutant had reduced function (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Kulkarni et al., 2007</xref>). The reason for this difference between rabbit and human PepT1 is not clear. The observation that the non-transported PepT1 substrate 4-AMBA did not induce a depolarisation in R282E-PepT1-expressing oocytes clearly shows that the charge movement is linked to substrate binding and translocation and not to binding alone. One explanation for the increase in proton&#x02013;peptide stoichiometry is that in wild-type PepT1 the presence of a positively charged residue deep in the binding pocket at position 282 repels proton movement through the transporter protein during the translocation step. The data in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> are consistent with this, as the apparent stoichiometry is lower at pH<sub>out</sub> 7.4 than it is at pH<sub>out</sub> 5.5, indicating that the proton electrochemical gradient is involved.</p><p>In the case of mutations where R282 was replaced with a non-positively charged amino acid, the rate-limiting step of the transport cycle must be insensitive to extracellular pH, hence the lack of stimulation when the pH<sub>out</sub> is dropped from 7.4 to 5.5. Kinetic analysis of peptide transport by PepT1 in rat renal brush border membrane vesicles (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Temple &#x00026; Boyd, 1998</xref>) showed that at pH<sub>out</sub>7.4/pH<sub>in</sub>7.4, it was the protonation of the carrier protein that was the rate-limiting step (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Temple, Bailey, Bronk, &#x00026; Boyd, 1996</xref>), whereas at pH<sub>out</sub>5.5/pH<sub>in</sub>7.4 it was the return of the unloaded carrier. The rate of peptide uptake by R282E-PepT1 (corrected for protein expression in the intact oocyte plasma membrane by luminometry, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Panitsas et al., 2006</xref>) is the same as for the wild-type at pH<sub>out</sub> 5.5 (data not shown), but, unlike for the wild-type, is not slower at pH<sub>out</sub> 7.4. This indicates that the mutations to arginine282 that abolish pH sensitivity (R to E, D, A, or Q) are affecting the rate limiting step, so when pH<sub>out</sub> is 7.4 the rate limiting step has the same magnitude as that at pH<sub>out</sub> 5.5, hence the lack of sensitivity to changing pH<sub>out</sub>. The rate limiting protonation of the outward-facing carrier protein at pH<sub>out</sub> 7.4, the first step in the transport cycle (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Temple et al., 1996</xref>), was proposed by us (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bailey et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Meredith &#x00026; Boyd, 1995</xref>) and others (e.g. <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Steel et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Uchiyama, Kulkarni, Davies, &#x00026; Lee, 2003</xref>) to be protonation of histidine57 (H57). In the R282-PepT1 mutants, except for R282K and R282H, the lack of a positively charged residue might result in a conformational change of the protein that changes the local environment and increases the p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> of H57, such that it is more easily protonated at a higher pH<sub>out</sub>. Thus at pH<sub>out</sub> 7.4 the rate limiting step is no longer the protonation of H57, but the return of the unloaded carrier, as it is at pH<sub>out</sub> 5.5, hence the similar transport rates at pH<sub>out</sub> 5.5 and 7.4.</p><p>A model for how proton&#x02013;peptide transport might occur is shown in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>: the empty PepT1 is primed by protonation of H57, followed by the binding of a zwitterionic peptide, with the N-terminal co-ordinated at E595 and the C-terminal at H57-H<sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Meredith et al., 2000</xref>). Although the binding of the substrate C-terminal to His57-H<sup>+</sup> is in disagreement with the conclusion of <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Terada et al. (1998)</xref>, it is supported by the finding that <italic>N</italic>-Acetyl-Phe, a known PepT1 substrate which does not have a free amino terminal (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Meredith et al., 2000</xref>), can protect PepT1 against inhibition by DEPC. Additionally, the finding that significant DEPC inhibition is still evident when oocytes were co-incubated with the PepT1 substrate <sc>l</sc>-Ala-Tyramine which lacks a carboxyl terminus further adds to the notion that H57-H<sup>+</sup> binds the carboxyl terminus of the substrate (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). H57-H<sup>+</sup> then donates its proton to the C-terminal carboxyl group, and the transporter undergoes a conformational change that leads to the breaking of the salt bridge between R282 and D341, re-orientating the binding site to be inward facing as simultaneously the protonated N-terminal of the substrate binds to D341, neutralising the charge, and the R282 charge is stabilised by Y167 (the chemical properties of this tyrosine have been shown to be essential, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Yeung et al., 1998</xref>). The peptide molecule is then released into the cytoplasm, whereby it returns to the zwitterionic state by releasing the proton from the carboxyl terminal. The transporter then undergoes the reverse conformational change to re-orientate the binding site to outward facing, and R282 reforms the salt bridge with D341.</p><p>As R282E-PepT1 cannot accumulate substrate, the implication must be that the movement of peptide is no longer coupled to the movement of the protons, whereas in all the other mutants coupling must be maintained. If for R282E-PepT1 the p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> of H57 was raised to the point that it was no longer favourable for it to donate its proton to the carboxyl terminus of the substrate, then peptide transport would no longer be proton-coupled, and this would explain the failure of R282E-PepT1 to accumulate substrate. Intriguingly, it can be seen in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> that both R282D- and R282A-PepT1 appear to carry approximately one more charge per substrate peptide than R282E-PepT1, which is consistent with the hypothesis that one of the charges carried is coupled with the substrate.</p><p>In conclusion, the arginine at position 282 in rabbit PepT1 plays an intriguing role in the function of the transporter, with mutations to different residues revealing that a positive residue is required for pH dependence, whilst only R282E-PepT1 cannot concentrate substrate above equilibrium; this is despite other mutations, most notably R282D-PepT1, having a similarly increased charge:peptide stoichiometry. As previously proposed, R282 (TMD7) forms a charge pair with D341 (TMD8), with R282E/D341R-PepT1 showing normal transport characteristics. Further biological testing or a crystal structure of PepT1 will be required to establish the validity of the model proposed.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are very grateful to Mirko Moroni from Professor Isabel Bermudez&#x02019; laboratory at Oxford Brookes University for assistance with the two-electrode voltage clamp experiments.
