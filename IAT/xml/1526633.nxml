Serum and synovial fluid levels of S100A8, S100A9, and S100A8/A9 were all higher in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) than in patients with osteoarthritis (OA), with the S100A8/A9 heterodimer being prevalent.

These proteins are also designated as migration inhibitory factor- or myeloid-related protein-8 (MRP8) and MRP14, or calgranulin A and B, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Most members of the S100 family exist in the form of homodimers or heterodimers within cells and interact with several effector proteins mostly in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner, thereby regulating enzyme activities, the dynamics of cytoskeleton constituents, cell growth and differentiation, and Ca<sup>2+ </sup>homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. S100A8 and S100A9 are predominantly expressed in cells of the myelomonocytic lineage; both proteins are present at high concentrations in the cytoplasm of neutrophils and monocytes, and the S100A8/A9 heterodimer is translocated to membrane and cytoskeletal structures upon activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Intracellular S100A8/A9 complexes play an important role in myeloid cell maturation, cell trafficking, and arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>S100A8 and S100A9 are secreted as complexes from neutrophils and monocytes after activation of protein kinase C in a novel pathway requiring an intact microtubule network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. High levels of the proteins have been found in the extracellular milieu during inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The S100A8/A9 heterodimer, originally identified as an antimicrobial protein, exhibits cytokine-like functions in the local environment, most notably enhancing leukocyte recruitment to inflammatory sites and AA transportation to its target cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, the nature of surface receptors for S100A8/A9 and its signaling pathways has not yet been fully elucidated. The soluble S100A8/A9 complex binds to the cell surface of endothelial cells by interacting with specific binding sites such as heparin sulfate proteoglycans and novel carboxylated glycans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In addition, CD36 and the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) are two other putative receptors for this complex. Interaction of exogeneous S100A8/A9 and AA complexes with the scavenger receptor CD36 facilitates AA uptake by endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. RAGE, a scavenger receptor belonging to the immunoglobulin (Ig) family that signals to the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&#x003ba;B) pathway, was identified as a functional receptor for the S100A12 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Structural similarities between S100A12 and other S100 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and the binding of S100B and S100A12 to RAGE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] suggest that RAGE may be a general receptor for the S100 family of proteins.</p><p>The inflamed synovial membrane in patients with RA is characterized by infiltration of inflammatory cells, primarily lymphocytes, and macrophages and proliferation of synovial fibroblasts, together with increased vascularity. Macrophages play a critical role in the perpetuation of synovial inflammation and joint destruction mainly by secreting proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;) and interleukin 1 (IL-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. These two cytokines, produced at high levels by macrophages localized in the lining layer and at the pannus lesion, induce the synthesis of numerous inflammatory mediators and matrix-degrading enzymes via the activation of the transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Many effector molecules are thought to be involved in the TNF-&#x003b1;- and IL-1-driven cascade of proinflammatory events in RA. Concentrations of the S100A8/A9 heterodimer in peripheral blood (PB) in patients with RA have been increased in association with the severity of arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. More importantly, the protein was more enriched in synovial fluid (SF) than in blood circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and it was expressed in synovial tissue (ST) macrophages localized in the lining layer adjacent to the cartilage-pannus junction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. These findings suggest an active role of S100A8/A9 protein in the progressive synovial inflammation, but their functions relevant to RA pathogenesis remain to be determined. In the present study, we confirmed the abundance of S100A8/A9 complexes in the joints of patients with RA and investigated the effects of recombinant S100A8/A9 proteins on monocyte/macrophage cytokine production and activation of NF-&#x003ba;B and MAPK signaling.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Patients and samples</title><p>Study patients with RA and control patients with osteoarthritis (OA) were diagnosed according to the revised 1987 criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (formerly, the American Rheumatism Association) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. All patients with RA were receiving prednisolone at no more than 5 mg/day and various disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Paired serum and SF samples were obtained from 17 patients with RA (14 women, 3 men; mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD) age, 63 &#x000b1; 9 years) and 17 patients with OA (12 women, 5 men; 65 &#x000b1; 6 years); SF samples were aspirated from the knee joint during therapeutic arthrocentesis. Most patients with RA were active; they had multiple joint tenderness and swelling, systemic inflammatory responses (mean &#x000b1; SD, serum C-reactive protein [CRP, 53 &#x000b1; 53 mg/liter] and erythrocyte sedimentation ratio [63 &#x000b1; 42 mm/hour]), and elevated serum IgM class rheumatoid factor titer (110 &#x000b1; 133 units/ml), whereas patients with OA did not show evidence of a systemic inflammatory response. ST samples were obtained from patients with RA and patients with OA at the time of total knee joint replacement. PB samples were collected from healthy volunteers. All patients and healthy individuals gave informed consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Isolation and culture of ST cells</title><p>Fresh ST samples were fragmented and digested with collagenase and DNase in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) for 1 hour at 37&#x000b0;C.

TNF-&#x003b1; concentrations in some experiments were measured using the ELISA kits (Becton, Dickinson and Company). The detection limits for cytokines were 20 pg/ml.</p></sec><sec><title>Two-color immunofluorescence labeling</title><p>Cryostat sections (4 &#x003bc;m) from ST samples were fixed in acetone and blocked with 10% donkey serum for 30 minutes. Double immunofluorescence was performed by serially incubating sections with 1 &#x003bc;g/ml of mouse IgG1 mAb against human S100A8 (8-5C2), S100A9 (S36.48), or S100A8/A9 (27E10, which exclusively recognizes the heterodimer but not the homodimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]; BMA Biomedicals AG) or isotype-matched control mAb (BMA Biomedicals AG) at 4&#x000b0;C over night, followed by incubation with rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG1 mAb (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA, USA) for 30 minutes at room temperature, and subsequently with 1 &#x003bc;g/ml of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-CD68 mAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) or control mAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 minutes at room temperature. The double immunofluorescence of sections was examined with an LSM510 inverted laser-scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) and illuminated with 488 and 568 nm of light. Images decorated with FITC and rhodamine were recorded simultaneously through separate optical detectors with a 530-nm band-pass filter and a 590-nm long-pass filter, respectively. Pairs of images were superimposed for colocalization analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of S100 proteins</title><p>Recombinant human S100A8 and S100A9 proteins were prepared as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Briefly, competent <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>strain BL21 (DE3) cells (Novagen, Madison, WI, USA) were transformed with the pET1120-MRP8wt and pET1120 S100A9wt vectors. The transformed cells were grown at 37&#x000b0;C in (2&#x000d7; YT) media supplemented with 100 &#x003bc;g/ml ampicillin for 24 hours; the cells produced the proteins as inclusion bodies. The harvested cells were solubilized with B-PER&#x02122; Bacterial Protein Extraction Reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). The inclusion bodies were solubilized with Inclusion Body Solubilization Reagent (Pierce), and the proteins were refolded according to the manufacturer's protocol. The proteins were purified by reverse-phase column chromatography (Resource&#x02122; RPC; Amersham Bioscience, Buckingamshire, UK) furnished in a BioLogic HR system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), followed by UNO-Q anion exchange chromatography (Bio-Rad). The buffer systems used were the same as those described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The purity of the S100A8 protein was found to be greater than 95% by SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electophoresis) and silver-staining, followed by densitometric analysis using the ImageJ program (Sun Microsystems, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Because the S100A9 showed weak silver-staining, its purity was estimated by Coomasie Brilliant Blue staining and densitometric analysis to be greater than 95%. The endotoxin content was measured using an endotoxin-specific assay kit (Endospecy; Seikagaku Kogyo, Tokyo, Japan), and the 10 &#x003bc;M solutions of recombinant S100A8 and S100A9 used in the present study contained endotoxin at 0.255 and 0.467 ng/ml, respectively. The mixture of equal amounts of S100A8 and S100A9 solutions was found by its specific ELISA to mostly form the heterodimer.</p></sec><sec><title>Stimulation of monocytes and <italic>in vitro</italic>-differentiated macrophages with S100 proteins</title><p>PB mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were prepared from heparinized PB samples of healthy individuals by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed using the Nushift NF-&#x003ba;B p65 kit (Active Motif) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nuclear extracts were incubated with [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P] dATP (Amersham, Little Chalfont, UK)-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe in binding buffer for 20 minutes. Samples and positive controls (nuclear proteins prepared from monocytes stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS) were electrophoresed on 5% polyacrylamide gel, followed by autoradiography. To verify the specificity of NF-&#x003ba;B protein binding, competition and supershift analysis was performed by adding an excess of unlabeled competitor or mutant oligonucleotides and rabbit polyclonal anti-NF-&#x003ba;B p65 Ab (Active Motif) to the incubation on ice for 20 minutes before the binding reaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Samples with values below the detection limit for the assay were regarded as negative and assigned a value of 0.

These results suggest that S100A8 and S100A9 proteins may be secreted mainly as the heterodimer from inflammatory cell infiltrates, such as neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages, in the joints of patients with active RA; however, these proteins are thought to be secreted also as the homodimer, because the expression pattern of S100A8 and S100A9 has been shown to differ <italic>in vivo</italic>, depending on cell types, cell differentiation, and inflammatory conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>High-level expression of S100A8/A9 by CD68<sup>+ </sup>macrophages in RA ST</title><p>S100A8/A9 proteins are expressed by infiltrating tissue macrophages during inflammation but not by resident tissue macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].

In the present study, we found that the S100A8/A9 heterodimer is expressed predominantly by CD68<sup>+ </sup>macrophages in the ST of patients with RA. In addition, using the recombinant proteins, we demonstrated that heterodimeric S100A8/A9, as well as homodimeric S100A9, stimulates monocytes and <italic>in vitro</italic>-differentiated macrophage to produce proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1;. S100A8/A9 stimulation is reduced significantly by p38 MAPK inhibitors and NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitors and induces the activation of the transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B. Therefore, S100A8/A9 is considered to amplify proinflammatoy cytokine responses through activation of NF-&#x003ba;B and p38 MAPK pathways in RA.</p><p>The S100A8/A9 heterodimer has been shown to be a reliable indicator of disease activity and joint inflammation in inflammatory rheumatic diseases, including RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], juvenile RA (JRA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], psoriatic arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and spondylarthropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Consistent with this finding, both serum and SF levels of S100A8/A9 were significantly higher in patients with RA than in patients with OA, with a positive correlation between serum S100A8/A9 and CRP levels. S100A8 and S100A9 are independently expressed in some pathological conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], but both proteins were increased predominantly in the form of a heterodimeric complex in the joints of patients with active RA. S100A8 and S100A9 molecules preferentially assemble to noncovalently associated complexes in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], and heterodimers are secreted extracellularly from neutrophils, monocytes, and tissue macrophages, but not from lymphocytes, under inflammatory conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>The concentration of S100A8/A9 in neutrophils constitutes up to 60% of total cytosolic protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], and an abundance of S100A8/A9 complexes can be thus readily released from neutrophils during activation and cell death. In RA, neutrophils are localized mainly to the SF, but not to the synovial membrane, and act as prominent effectors of inflammation and cartilage damage by releasing various enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The relationship of S100A8/A9 levels in SF to the degree of local neutrophil infiltration was demonstrated in inflammatory arthritides, including RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], suggesting the active secretion from infiltrating neutrophils. On the other hand, S100A8 and S100A9 are secreted from monocytes as heterodimeric complexes after activation of protein kinase, which is induced by different inflammatory stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. We found that S100A8/A9 was intensively expressed by CD68<sup>+ </sup>macrophages in RA ST and that isolated RA ST cells spontaneously secreted higher levels of the protein than did OA ST cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that infiltration and activation of neutrophils and macrophages may be responsible for the elevated concentration of S100A8/A9 in joints of patients with RA.</p><p>Our immunofluorescence studies showed the distribution of S100A8/A9-expressing macrophages in both the lining and sublining layer of RA ST, mostly corresponding with earlier studies of the expression pattern in the ST from RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], JRA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], and psoriatic arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Monocytes expressing cell surface S100A8/A9 represent a fast-migrating monocyte subpopulation across the endothelium barrier, and high levels of the S100A8/A9 protein are secreted after their interaction with inflammatory-activated endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. S100A8/A9 expression by sublining macrophages, particularly by perivascular macrophages thought to represent newly infiltrated macrophages, is attributable to selective infiltration of S100A8/A9<sup>+ </sup>monocytes and their endothelium-dependent induction of S100A8/A9 proteins, because the inflamed tissue of RA is characterized by increased vascularity and endothelial cell activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. On the other hand, S100A8 mRNA expression in macrophages has been shown to be stimulated by cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b3;, and IL-10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], which are relevant to RA pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Thus, cytokine stimulation may be responsible for S100A8/A9 expression by synovial lining macrophages (that is, the highly activated phenotype of tissue macrophages that are capable of producing high levels of cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. It is intriguing to note that there is a positive correlation between S100A8/A9 expression and TNF-&#x003b1; release in alveolar macrophages from patients with active sarcoidosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>The released S100A8/A9 heterodimer may play a role in the propagation of inflammation by recruiting neutrophils and monocytes to joints of patients with RA. Extracellular S100A8/A9 enhances the transendothelial migration of these inflammatory cells by enhancing CD11b expression and affinity for intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. We found that S100A8/A9 stimulated monocytes and <italic>in vitro</italic>-differentiated macrophages to produce proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1;. In addition, co-stimulation of S100A8/A9 with LPS and cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1-&#x003b2;, and IFN-&#x003b3; showed synergistic effects on monocyte cytokine production (data not shown). However, S100A8/A9 was less effective in terms of monocyte stimulation compared with cytokines; the protein of 10<sup>-7 </sup>to 10<sup>-5 </sup>M concentrations (2.4&#x02013;240 &#x003bc;g/ml) was required for significant cytokine induction, whereas cytokines are known to produce their actions in the range of 10<sup>-12 </sup>to 10<sup>-9 </sup>M concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Despite its lower efficacy, S100A8/A9 stimulation is believed to be effective in joints of patients with RA, where the protein is present at 54.8 &#x000b1; 28.6 &#x003bc;g/ml, because <italic>in vitro</italic>-differentiated macrophages, as well as freshly isolated monocytes (data not shown), when stimulated with 2 &#x003bc;M (50 &#x003bc;g/ml) S100A8/A9, could produce significant levels of TNF-&#x003b1;. Similarly, 15 &#x003bc;g/ml S100A8/A9 significantly induced IL-8 release from bronchial epithelial cells, and anti-S100A8/A9 Ab treatment reduced the IL-8-stimulating potential of bronchial secretions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. More recently, the study using microarray analysis demonstrated that S100A8/A9 proteins (100 &#x003bc;g/ml) directly activate endothelial cells to induce proinflammatory chemokines and adhesion molecules and to increase vascular permeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Taken together, these findings suggest the significance of S100A8/A9 as key effectors/amplifiers of inflammation with a wide range of activities, including cytokine induction.</p><p>Considering the potential inflammatory properties, there seems to be a discrepancy between high concentrations of serum S100A8/A9 and the lack of its peripheral effect in patients with RA. We speculate that the yet-unidentified, inhibitory molecules for S100A8/A9 activity might be present in the blood circulation, as is well recognized in the regulation of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1 activities by soluble TNF receptors and IL-1 receptor antagonist which bind to the protein or interfering with its cell interaction, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, it is also conceivable that an abundance of the protein might partially contribute to monocyte activation before entry into the joint, as evidenced by the increase of circulating CD16<sup>+ </sup>mature monocytes in patients with RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>The S100A9 homodimer, but not the S100A8 homodimer, stimulated the monocyte/macrophage cytokine response. Similarly, the S100A9 homodimer, as well as the S100A8/A9 complex, could enhance ICAM-1 binding to monocytes, whereas the S100A8 homodimer failed to do so [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The S100A9 subunit is thus likely to be critical in eliciting the inflammatory signaling pathway. Interestingly, values of cytokine production with S100A8/A9 tend to be lower than those with S100A9, which may indicate partial inhibition of S100A9 stimulation by its heterodimeric partner S100A8. However, we could not clearly detect inhibitory effects of S100A8 on S100A9-induced TNF-&#x003b1; production when titrating S100A8 concentrations (0.1&#x02013;10 &#x003bc;M) into the 1 &#x003bc;M S100A9 solution (data not shown), although the possibility still remains that much higher concentrations of S100A8 are required for its significant inhibition. The S100A9 protein stimulates the &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>integrin (CD11/CD18)-mediated neutrophil adhesion by inducing the high-affinity CD11b epitope, and this S100A9 activity is specifically inhibited by S100A8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. More importantly, recent studies have demonstrated that numbers of S100A8/A9-expressing macrophages increased in the ST of patients with RA after treatment with high dose of intravenous methylprednisolone and that high levels of S100A8 induced by glucocorticoids have anti-inflammatory properties independent of hetero-complex formation with S100A9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. These findings support the possible inhibition of the heterodimer-induced cytokine response by the S100A8 subunit.</p><p>RAGE, originally defined by its binding to advanced glycation endproducts, has been identified as a multiligand receptor that can bind inflammatory molecules such as HMGB1 (high mobility group box chromosomal protein 1), S100A12, and S100B1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Significant similarities in structure among S100A8, S100A9, and S100A12 suggest that RAGE may function as a signal-transducing receptor for these S100 proteins. In addition, the CD36 molecule, a member of the scavenger receptor family, has been shown to bind the complex of S100A8/A9 and AA and induce uptake of exogenous AA into the endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, S100A8/A9-mediated cytokine production was not inhibited by anti-RAGE Ab, esRAGE (an endogenous inhibitor of RAGE activity), or anti-CD36, excluding the possibility of RAGE or CD36 as a putative receptor for S100A8/A9. Thus, S100A8/A9 may induce cell activation after its nonspecific interaction with monocytes, because S100A8/A9 binds endothelial cells in conjunction with heparin sulfate proteoglycans and novel carboxylated glycans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The significance of NF-&#x003ba;B and MAPK pathways in the inflammatory gene activation in joints of patients with RA has been well established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].

NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitors could completely block the cytokine response. Therefore, we believe that the transcriptional activity of NF-&#x003ba;B may be most critical in S100A8/A9-induced cytokine expression in monocytes/macrophages and that p38 MAPK may regulate the synthesis of cytokines at the post-transcriptional and/or translational levels</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, the S100A8/A9 heterodimer, highly expressed by synovial lining macrophage, may play a role in amplifying proinflammatory cytokine responses via activation of NF-&#x003ba;B and p38 MAPK in RA.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AA = arachidonic acid; CBA = cytometric beads array; CRP = C-reactive protein; ELISA = enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; EMSA = electrophoretic mobility shift assay; esRAGE = endogenous secretory receptor for advanced glycation endproducts; FCS = fetal calf serum; FITC = fluorescein isothiocyanate; GM-CSF = granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; ICAM-1 = intracellular adhesion molecule-1; IFN-&#x003b3; = interferon gamma; Ig = immunoglobulin; IL = interleukin; JRA = juvenile rheumatoid arthritis; LPS = lipopolysaccharide; mAb = monoclonal antibody; MAPK = mitogen-activated protein kinase; MRP = myeloid-related protein, NF-&#x003ba;B = nuclear factor kappa B; OA = osteoarthritis; PB = peripheral blood; PBMC = peripheral blood mononuclear cell; PDTC = 1-pyrrolidinecarbodithioic acid; PE = phycoerythrin; RA = rheumatoid arthritis; RAGE = receptor for advanced glycation endproducts; SD = standard deviation; SF = synovial fluid; ST = synovial tissue; TNF-&#x003b1; = tumor necrosis factor alpha; TPCK = N<sup>&#x003b1;</sup>-tosyl-phenylalanylchloromethylketone.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>KS was responsible for the experiments and data analysis and wrote the report.
