In mammals, those movements are more subtle and appear to be regulated by the Rab27a GTPase and the unconventional myosin, Myosin VIIa (MyoVIIa). Here we address the hypothesis that a recently identified Rab27a- and MyoVIIa-interacting protein, Myrip, promotes the formation of a functional tripartite complex. In heterologous cultured cells, all three proteins co-immunoprecipitated following overexpression. Rab27a and Myrip localize to the peripheral membrane of RPE melanosomes as observed by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy. Melanosome dynamics were studied using live-cell imaging of mouse RPE primary cultures. Wild-type RPE melanosomes exhibited either stationary or slow movement interrupted by bursts of fast movement, with a peripheral directionality trend. Nocodazole treatment led to melanosome paralysis, suggesting that movement requires microtubule motors. Significant and similar alterations in melanosome dynamics were observed when any one of the three components of the complex was missing, as studied in <italic>ashen</italic>- (Rab27a defective) and <italic>shaker-1</italic> (MyoVIIa mutant)-derived RPE cells, and in wild-type RPE cells transduced with adenovirus carrying specific sequences to knockdown Myrip expression. We observed a significant increase in the number of motile melanosomes, exhibiting more frequent and prolonged bursts of fast movement, and inversion of directionality. Similar alterations were observed upon cytochalasin D treatment, suggesting that the Rab27a&#x02013;Myrip&#x02013;MyoVIIa complex regulates tethering of melanosomes onto actin filaments, a process that ensures melanosome movement towards the cell periphery.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>melanosome motility</kwd><kwd>Myrip</kwd><kwd>Rab27a</kwd><kwd>RPE</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is part of the blood/retina barrier and is composed of a pigmented monolayer of polarized cells performing multiple functions. These include absorption of light and protection against photo-oxidation, transepithelial transport of nutrients, spatial buffering of ions in the subretinal space, cycling of retinal, phagocytosis and secretion of a variety of growth factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">(1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2)</xref>. The apical membrane forms long processes that face and partially envelop the photoreceptor outer segments. This close interaction between RPE and photoreceptors is essential for visual function. The RPE phagocytoses the tips of shed photoreceptor outer segments and is necessary for recycling of retinal used by photoreceptor opsins. On its basolateral side, the RPE faces Bruch&#x02019;s membrane and the fenestrated endothelium of the choriocapillaris.</p><p>Melanin pigment is contained within the cytoplasm in melanosomes of skin and choroidal melanocytes, and RPE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">(1)</xref>. Pigment must play an important role in the development of the neural retina because albino mice, lacking the key melanogenic enzyme tyrosinase, present abnormal patterns of cell proliferation and reduced numbers of photoreceptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">(3)</xref>. In adults, melanosomes may be important in absorption of stray light and free radicals. Contrary to fish and amphibians where melanosomes of the RPE redistribute dramatically from the cell body into the apical processes upon onset of light in a reversible manner, mammalian melanosomes undergo only a modest light and/or circadian cycle-dependent redistribution into the apical processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>), and exhibit motility in isolated primary RPE cultures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">(1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5)</xref>.</p><p>The process of melanosome motility has been extensively studied in melanocytes of the skin. Once mature, melanosomes are first transported to the peripheral region of the cell by long-range, bidirectional, microtubule (MT)-dependent movements and are then transferred to actin filaments and carried by short-range, local movements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">(6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7)</xref>. The association with actin serves as a peripheral retention mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">(8)</xref>, after which they are translocated from the melanocyte dendrites to adjacent epidermal keratinocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">(9)</xref>. Translocation from MT-based to actin-based transport requires a tripartite complex, composed of Rab27a, Melanophilin (Mlph) and Myosin Va (MyoVa). Rab27a attached to the melanosome membrane binds Mlph, a linker protein that in turn binds to MyoVa, the actin-based motor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">(10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12)</xref>. Loss of any of the partners of the complex leads to clustering of the melanosomes in the perinuclear region, as shown in studies involving melanocytes from <italic>ashen</italic> (lacking functional Rab27a) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">(13)</xref>, <italic>leaden</italic> (mutant for Mlph) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">(14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15)</xref> and <italic>dilute</italic> (absence of MyoVa) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">(8)</xref>, resulting in coat colour dilution in mice and partial albinism in humans.</p><p>The movement along MTs has been extensively studied in melanophores, where pigment aggregation and dispersion can be easily manipulated by addition of melatonin and melanocyte-stimulating hormone, respectively, revealing the role of MTs and their associated motors, dynein and kinesin, in pigment distribution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">(16)</xref>. The mechanism by which two motors of opposite polarity act to control the bidirectional movement of melanosomes on MTs originally described by a tug-of-war model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">(17)</xref> was more recently suggested to occur via a MT-motor co-ordination model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">(18)</xref>. On the other hand, co-ordination between actin- and MT-based movement appears to be regulated by a tug-of-war mechanism, where both motors are present in the same cargo molecule at the same time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">(19)</xref>, and impairment of one component, such as actin in MyoVa-deficient cells, increases the contribution of the other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">(8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20)</xref>. These studies proposed that MyoVa acts by terminating a minus-end run and moving the melanosome away from the MT network, its action being regulated by the number of MyoVa molecules associated with cargo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">(17)</xref>.</p><p>Contrary to what is known for melanophores and melanocytes, the contribution of each cytoskeletal filament system in melanosome transport is not well understood in RPE cells. Studies in cultures of dissociated fish RPE cells, which undergo dramatic pigment granule movement as observed in melanophores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">(16)</xref>, using the MT-dissociating agent nocodazole suggested that MTs had no effect on aggregation or dispersion of pigment, while the actin-depolymerizing agent cytochalasin D inhibited both dispersion and aggregation, as well as impaired the maintenance of the fully aggregated and dispersed states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">(21)</xref>. In mammals, the molecular mechanisms involved in melanosome movement in the RPE are much less well characterized, but recent evidence points to a conserved mechanism with skin melanocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">(11)</xref>. Rab27a appears to recruit another unconventional myosin, Myosin VIIa (MyoVIIa), for the movement of melanosomes into the apical processes of the RPE. In <italic>ashen</italic> and <italic>shaker-1</italic> (lacking functional MyoVIIa) mice mutant strains, the distribution of RPE melanosomes is altered, with melanosomes found exclusively in the cell body of the RPE, failing to move beyond the level of the adherens junctions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">(4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22)</xref>. The RPE in <italic>leaden</italic> mice appears normal, indicating that Mlph does not act as the linker protein between Rab27a and MyoVIIa in RPE cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">(4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5)</xref>. A likely candidate for a Rab27a and MyoVIIa linker protein is Myrip [also called synaptotagmin-like protein lacking C2 domains (Slac2-c)]. Myrip is a 96-kDa protein, which was originally identified as a MyoVIIa tail-binding protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">(23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24)</xref>. Myrip contains a typical Rab27a-binding motif, is able to bind to MyoVIIa and Rab27a and is expressed in the RPE where it associates with melanosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">(23)</xref>. However, the direct involvement of Myrip in melanosome motility in the RPE remains to be demonstrated. This issue represents the focus of the present study.</p><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Formation of a tripartite complex between Rab27a, Myrip and MyoVIIa in the RPE</title><p>In order to establish a system to address the hypothesis that Myrip serves as a functional linker between Rab27a and MyoVIIa in RPE, we developed a mouse RPE primary cell culture based on Wollmann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">(25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26)</xref>. The RPE cultures were essentially clear of any other retinal cell type, and RPE primary cells maintained their characteristic physiological features, such as cuboidal shape and pigmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1A</xref>). Immunoblot of primary cell extracts showed the expression of the RPE-specific marker RPE65 and Rab27a at comparable levels to skin melanocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1B</xref>). We generated a specific antibody against Myrip and detected endogenous Myrip in RPE primary cultures but not in skin melanocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1B</xref>). We did not assay for MyoVIIa due to lack of a suitable antibody but its expression in RPE cells has been reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">(5)</xref>. We also attempted to detect expression of the melanocyte-specific isoform of MyoVa in the RPE cultures, but the results were negative despite loading twice the amount of protein compared to controls (wild-type melanocytes and HEK-293 cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Formation of a Rab27a&#x02013;Myrip&#x02013;MyoVIIa tripartite complex</title><p>A) Phase contrast image of cultured primary wild-type RPE cells at low magnification (&#x000d7; 40); Bar = 20 &#x003bc;m.

COS-7 cells were co-transfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Myrip, untagged Rab27a and V5-MyoVIIa tail [corresponding to amino acids (aa) 1671-stop]. Total extracts were assayed for the presence of the overexpressed proteins, and then incubated with anti-V5 antibody. V5-MyoVIIa tail immunoprecipitates also contained Rab27a and Myrip. Both full-length and a Myrip fragment containing aa 1&#x02013;414 were able to associate with both Rab27a and MyoVIIa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1C</xref>). In the absence of Rab27a input or when using a deletion Myrip (195&#x02013;414) construct, MyoVIIa tail was still able to pull-down Myrip, as expected from the proposed model where Myrip serves as a linker protein between Rab27a and MyoVIIa. Conversely, a fragment of Myrip encoding aa 407&#x02013;652 was unable to co-immunoprecipitate with MyoVIIa tail. Therefore, the fragment 1&#x02013;414 of Myrip appears necessary and sufficient to establish the link between MyoVIIa and Rab27a.</p><p>We then performed a similar experiment to demonstrate the formation of the complex under more physiological conditions. RPE primary cultures were transduced with adenoviruses (Ad) encoding full-length MyoVIIa fused with GFP. After 2 days, total cell extracts were incubated with anti-GFP antibody and anti-GFP immunoprecipitates were shown to contain Myrip (detected with anti-Myrip antibody) and Rab27a (detected with 4B12 antibody) (unpublished observations). Thus, the heterologous co-immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that a tripartite complex can indeed form, as previously suggested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">(27)</xref>.</p><p>We then analysed the localization of Myrip and Rab27a in primary cultures of the RPE from adult mice by immunofluorescence microscopy. Rab27a and Myrip were found predominantly on mature melanosomes, regardless of shape or location. Merged images of endogenous Myrip with false-coloured melanosomes revealed the presence of concentric rings surrounding melanosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2C,D,G,H</xref>). The similar pattern of staining suggests that Rab27a and Myrip co-localize in the outer melanosome membrane. It is noteworthy to mention that other non-pigmented structures are also specifically stained with both antibodies, especially in the case of Rab27a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2I</xref>). It is likely that Rab27a and its effectors associate with other cellular organelles, such as secretory granules. Conversely, approximately 20&#x02013;25% of melanosomes did not exhibit staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2J</xref>). Melanin is known to quench fluorescence, which may account for some melanized structures without apparent staining.</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Subcellular localization of Rab27a and Myrip in RPE</title><p>Wild-type murine RPE cells were fixed, permeabilized and labelled with antibodies to Myrip (A) or Rab27a (E), as indicated.

This high-resolution technique demonstrated that the majority of melanosomes are heavily labelled for Myrip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2K</xref>) and confirmed the co-localization of Myrip and Rab27a on the melanosomal membrane where they were frequently present in clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2L</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Functional requirement of the Rab27a&#x02013;Myrip&#x02013;MyoVIIa complex for RPE melanosome motility</title><p>The absence of an animal model where Myrip loss-of-function could be studied prompted us to attempt a short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) approach in cultured RPE primary cells. We designed specific oligonucleotide sequences and tested for their ability to reduce the levels of overexpressed epitope-tagged mouse Myrip in HEK-293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3A</xref>). Out of nine sequences tested, three (shRNA5, 7 and 8) led to a significant decrease in the level of expressed V5-Myrip and were selected for subsequent studies. One of the non-effective shRNA (shRNA4) was also selected to be used as a negative control. The sequences were used to construct adenoviruses expressing these specific shRNAs and the recombinant viruses were used to transduce RPE primary cultures. To confirm the knockdown (KD) of endogenous Myrip in RPE cells, transduced cells were analysed by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3B</xref>). We confirmed that no apparent Myrip labelling could be detected in cells expressing GFP-shRNA5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3B</xref>, panel E), -7 and -8 (unpublished observations), as opposed to non-transducing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3B</xref>, panel B) and cells expressing shRNA4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3B</xref>, panel H). There was no apparent phenotype in any of the mutant or transducing cells, such as changes in cell shape, pigment level or distribution of melanosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3</xref>). These observations contrast with the striking clustering of melanosomes in skin melanocytes upon Rab27a/Mlph/MyoVa depletion.</p><fig id="fig03" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Efficiency of shRNAs to KD Myrip expression</title><p>A) HEK-293FT cells were co-transfected with pENTR/CMV-V5-Myrip and pENTR/U6-shRNA.

In order to assess the specificity of the effects, we also performed rescue experiments by reintroducing the missing proteins (in the case of Myrip, an shRNA resistant clone from a different species) using recombinant adenoviruses. Movies depicting melanosome dynamics were obtained for 175 seconds, capturing a frame every 0.5 seconds (see Supplementary Movies) and were analysed using manual-tracking software.</p><p>Quantitative analysis of the trajectories of random selected melanosomes revealed significant differences between RPE cultures.

In an attempt to determine the cytoskeletal tracts involved, we treated cells with nocodazole (a MT-disrupting agent) and cytochalasin D (which caps actin filaments inducing reorganization of the actin filaments in short actin patches). The efficiency of the treatment was determined by immunofluorescence staining with anti-tubulin and phalloidin, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figure 4</xref>).

<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Quantitative analysis of our data revealed a 40&#x02013;60% increase in number of motile melanosomes (typically above 80%) in the absence of Rab27a, Myrip or MyoVIIa, compared to baseline numbers of 50&#x02013;60% for wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Cytochalasin D treatment resulted in motility rates between wild type and mutants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Consistently, nocodazole-treated cells exhibited less than 20% motile melanosomes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The number of reversal steps was also quantified. All three mutant and cytochalasin D-treated cells exhibited a twofold increase in reversal steps when compared to controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The reversal steps are probably the result of the movement along MTs, driven by kinesin and dynein in reverse directions.</p><p>It has been previously shown that <italic>shaker-1</italic> RPE primary cultures exhibit an increased average linear displacement profile <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">(5)</xref>. As confirmed in this study, RPE control cells exhibited several melanosome motility speeds, either stationary or slow movements (typically &#x02264;250 nm/second) interrupted by bursts of faster movement (&#x0003e;1000 nm/second) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figure 4</xref> and Supplementary Movies). Conversely, in mutant RPE cells the bursts of movement were more prolonged and frequent, resulting in a longer average linear displacement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). When Rab27a or Myrip were deficient, the average linear displacement increased approximately threefold when compared with control values (approximately 30 &#x003bc;m versus 10 &#x003bc;m) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). In <italic>shaker-1</italic> RPE cells, the increase was less pronounced (approximately 20 &#x003bc;m versus 10 &#x003bc;m). Kymograph profiles of live-cell imaging data show differences in velocity undergone by melanosomes from different mutant backgrounds. In controls, any movement is preceded and followed by an almost absence of movement. In mutant cells, the distance moved in one single step is larger, and melanosomes do not tend to remain stationary following movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5</xref>). To demonstrate the specificity of the effects, we performed rescue experiments by reintroducing the missing proteins. When transducing adenovirus-encoding GFP-Rab27a, <italic>ashen</italic> cells return to control movement kinetics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>), as observed above for other parameters. A similar effect was observed with <italic>shaker-1</italic> cells, when GFP-MyoVIIa was introduced (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). As for Myrip, control cells were KD with the relevant shRNA and simultaneously transduced an adenovirus-encoding rat Myrip, a cDNA resistant to the shRNA effect (unpublished observations). Reintroduction of Myrip restored wild-type melanosome dynamics as shown by all the quantitative methods used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>). Also in agreement with the other quantitative analysis, nocodazole treatment resulted in almost complete melanosome paralysis, while cytochalasin D induced increased average linear displacement comparable to <italic>shaker-1</italic> cells and lower than <italic>ashen</italic> and Myrip shRNA-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).</p><fig id="fig05" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Analysis of melanosome dynamics in RPE primary cultures</title><p>Representative kymograph tracings illustrating movement of individual melanosomes are shown for the indicated RPE cultures.

Despite our inability to detect MyoVa in RPE cultures by immunoblot, we analysed melanosome dynamics in MyoVa-deficient RPE primary cultures derived from <italic>dilute-lethal</italic> mice. Our analysis revealed motility characteristics similar to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>, see also Supplementary Movie 8). Furthermore, we observed that the alterations in melanosome dynamics in Myrip KD RPE cells were not rescued by transduction of Mlph, a Myrip-related protein and the critical linker of Rab27a and MyoVa in skin melanocytes. These results are consistent with normal melanosome distribution in RPE <italic>in vivo</italic> in <italic>dilute</italic> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">(4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5)</xref>.</p><p>Finally, we studied whether there is directionality of melanosome motility in cultured RPE cells. Melanosomes were followed for 30 seconds and the melanosome position relative to the nucleus was calculated for each frame. Our results suggest that melanosomes undergo a directed non-diffusive motion, as expected (unpublished observations). In wild-type and <italic>ashen</italic>-rescued cells, the majority of melanosomes exhibited predominantly motion towards the periphery of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6A</xref>). This centrifugal directionality was disrupted in the Rab27a, Myrip and to a lesser extent MyoVIIa mutant cells and cytochalasin D-treated RPE cells. We also calculated the relative ratio of centrifugal (towards the periphery) and centripetal (towards the nucleus) steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6B,C</xref>). The histogram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6B</xref> reflects the average velocity obtained for the ratio of anterograde/retrograde steps. Due to a smaller number of reversal steps, control cells have a higher velocity ratio towards the periphery. In the mutant cells analysed, the results suggest lower values and even reversal in directionality in Rab27a- and Myrip-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6B</xref>). In the graph depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6C</xref>, values &#x0003e;1 demonstrate a centrifugal tendency and &#x0003c;1 a centripetal tendency. The data confirmed that wild-type (and rescued) cells showed a peripheral directionality trend, reflected in the higher number of centrifugal steps while <italic>ashen</italic> and Myrip KD cells exhibited a trend towards reverse directionality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6</xref>). Cytochalasin D-treated and <italic>shaker-1</italic> cells also showed increased number of pauses and reversals but no clear tendency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6</xref>).

We show that the knockout or KD of any of the three proteins elicit the same melanosome dynamics phenotype in primary RPE cultures. Our results confirm previous suggestions that Rab27a is able to associate with different unconventional myosins (such as MyoVa and MyoVIIa) through a pair of related proteins, Mlph and Myrip <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">(11)</xref>. The evidence presented here also suggests that the Rab27a&#x02013;Myrip&#x02013;MyoVIIa complex is involved in anchoring melanosomes to the actin cytoskeleton, which in turn result in directional movement of melanosomes towards the periphery of the cell.</p><p>The Rab27a GTPase serves as a maturation sensor that is recruited onto mature secretory granules and lysosome-related organelles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">(28)</xref>. Once activated, Rab27a-GTP can potentially interact with at least 11 effector proteins (also called Exophilins). Among these, Myrip (or Slac2-c) and Mlph (or Slac2-a) form a unique family of Rab27- and Myosin-interacting proteins. They can be structurally divided into several domains. At the N-terminus, they contain two sequence homology domains (SHD), SHD1 and SHD2, representing the Rab27-binding domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">(29)</xref>. In the medial region of protein, Mlph contains a complex myosin-binding region, which includes a high-affinity site for a melanocyte-specific isoform of MyoVa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">(30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32)</xref> and a conserved coiled-coil region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">(33)</xref>, while the myosin-binding region of Myrip remains less well characterized. Previous studies showed that deletion of the Rab27-binding domain (aa 1&#x02013;146) did not affect the binding to MyoVIIa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">(23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24)</xref>, a finding confirmed in this study. A previous study suggested that the region containing aa 409&#x02013;602 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">(24)</xref> was necessary for binding to MyoVIIa, a finding not supported by our biochemical data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>. Instead, our data suggest that the myosin-binding region in Myrip maps to aa 195&#x02013;414. Interestingly, this MyoVIIa-binding region is not conserved between Myrip and Mlph, a finding consistent with the inability of Mlph to bind MyoVIIa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">(24)</xref>. We caution however that the interaction between Myrip and Myosins may be rather complex, as we have recently observed for Mlph&#x02013;MyoVa interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">(33)</xref>. Thus, more detailed studies will be necessary to unravel the molecular basis for these interactions.</p><p>MyoVIIa has been previously implicated in melanosome motility in RPE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">(5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22)</xref>. Our immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy studies confirmed the RPE melanosomal membrane localization of Rab27a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">(4)</xref> and Myrip <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">(23)</xref>. Interestingly, we often observed that Myrip-associated gold particles were found in small clusters, suggesting the presence of membrane microdomains, as suggested for Rab27a in secretory granules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">(34)</xref>, and Rabs 4, 5, 11 in endosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">(35)</xref>. The presence of other vesicular structures stained by Myrip and particularly Rab27a raises the possibility that these proteins may serve other roles in membrane-trafficking pathways in RPE cells. Consistently, MyoVIIa has been implicated in lysosomal movement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">(36)</xref> and phagocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">(37)</xref> in the RPE. Additionally, Rab8 was also implicated in actin-dependent movement of melanosomes in skin melanocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">(38)</xref> but the relevance of these observations to RPE cells remains unclear.</p><p>In intact retinas, the absence of MyoVIIa or Rab27a leads to redistribution of melanosomes from the F-actin-rich apical region and processes to the MT-rich cell body <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">(4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5)</xref>. The time-lapse microscopy studies and motility analysis described here are broadly consistent with results recently described for the MyoVIIa-deficient RPE cells derived from <italic>shaker-1</italic> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">(5)</xref>. Furthermore, the new data extend these previous studies in several significant ways. First, we demonstrate that nocodazole treatment lead to an almost complete loss of melanosome movement in mammalian RPE cells. Previous studies in isolated fish RPE cells suggested that MTs and MT-motors were not important for melanosome movements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">(21)</xref>. Our studies suggest instead that, at least in mammals, melanosome movements are executed primarily by kinesins and dyneins. Fast-moving melanosomes travel in one direction, pause and often reverse direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figures 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>; Supplementary Movies), as described in melanophores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">(17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39)</xref>. Second, our studies clearly implicate Myrip as the functional linker bridging Rab27a and MyoVIIa because the loss of any one of the three proteins examined resulted in similar phenotypes. We demonstrate that the loss of the Rab27a&#x02013;Myrip&#x02013;MyoVIIa complex leads to a significant (50%) increase in the number of motile melanosomes, a greater fluctuation in their orientation and a wider average displacement. Third, our results suggest that melanosomes do move preferentially towards the periphery of the cell in wild-type RPE cells. Furthermore, loss of the Rab27a&#x02013;Myrip&#x02013;MyoVIIa complex activity leads to a reversal (or neutrality) in this directionality. This is broadly consistent with extensive observations in skin melanocytes upon loss of Rab27a, Mlph or MyoVa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">(11)</xref>. Fourth, melanosome motility in RPE-cultured cells is also affected by cytochalasin D treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figures 4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>), whose cells exhibited melanosome dynamics similar to those observed in <italic>ashen</italic>, <italic>shaker-1</italic> and Myrip KD cells. The similarities between cytochalasin D treatment and disruption of any component of the Rab27a&#x02013;Myrip&#x02013;MyoVIIa complex suggest that the complex is involved in the tethering of melanosomes with the actin cytoskeleton.</p><p>We suggest that loss-of-function of the RPE Rab27a&#x02013;Myrip&#x02013;MyoVIIa complex leads to a reduced constraint on MT-based motility, as revealed by the melanosome dynamics alterations described above. Our data imply that this protein complex is involved in the switch from MT- to actin-based motility as proposed in skin melanocytes for the Rab27a&#x02013;Mlph&#x02013;MyoVa complex. We also suggest that these data provide further evidence for a tug-of-war mechanism operating between actin and MT transport systems in mammalian RPE cells, as suggested in frog melanophores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">(17)</xref>. When the association with actin is disrupted, MT-based movement takes over, and directionality is lost. The association with actin, possibly by disrupting MT minus-end runs of melanosomes, may be responsible for the directionality of movement towards the periphery, which <italic>in vivo</italic> would result in movement into the apical processes, where actin is localized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">(4)</xref>. Interestingly, the severity of the phenotypes observed varied, appearing more severe in <italic>ashen</italic> and Myrip KD as compared to <italic>shaker-1</italic> cells. These findings raise the possibility of some functional compensation, namely other possible connections of Rab27a&#x02013;Myrip with other myosin motor proteins. It is noteworthy that our investigations into a possible role of MyoVa in this process have so far yield only negative data. Furthermore, cytochalasin D-treated cells also showed a milder, intermediate phenotype. The simplest explanation in our view is that the cytochalasin D effect under the conditions used did not completely disrupt all Rab27a&#x02013;Myrip&#x02013;MyoVIIa complex activity.</p><p>Altogether, our results are consistent with a model whereby MT-based motility is hindered by myosin-driven actin tethering of melanosomes. Nevertheless, the importance of melanosome movements in retinal physiology remains an open question. Mislocalization of melanosomes is not a probable cause for the photoreceptor degeneration found in patients suffering from Usher 1B syndrome caused by MyoVIIa mutations, as this process may be triggered by photoreceptor-specific functions of MyoVIIa and/or a role in RPE phagocytosis leading to a delay in degradation of phagosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">(37)</xref>. Further work will be needed to clarify these issues.</p><p>In summary, mammalian cells seem to have developed a transport unit composed of a small GTPase, linker protein and motor protein enabling dissociation from MT-based motors and connection with the actin cytoskeleton. Using a single membrane marker, the system may use different combinations by varying a small number of linkers and motors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals and cell lines</title><p>All mice, including <italic>ashen</italic> (C57BL/6J; <italic>ash</italic>/<italic>ash</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">(40)</xref>, <italic>dilute-lethal</italic> (DLS/LeJ) and homozygous agouti <italic>shaker-1</italic> (C57BL/6J; Myo7a<sup><italic>4626SB/4626SB</italic></sup>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">(4)</xref> colonies were bred and maintained on 12-h light/dark cycle under UK project license PPL 70/6210 at the Central Biomedical Services of Imperial College London.

Human MyoVIIa tail was subcloned from two EST clones (GenBank acession number BE780659, IMAGE 3872258; GenBank accession number BI835786, IMAGE 5226439). In order to clone full-length hMyoVIIa-coding sequence into the mammalian expression vector pENTR286 with Gateway technology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">(33)</xref>, a <italic>Bsi</italic>WI and a <italic>Spe</italic>I restriction sites were inserted by PCR. The order of the cloning was as follows: MyoVIIa tail (aa 1111 stop) using <italic>Spe</italic>I/<italic>Not</italic>I, MyoVIIa tail (aa 633&#x02013;1110) using <italic>Bsi</italic>WI/<italic>Spe</italic>I and MyoVIIa head (aa 1&#x02013;632) using <italic>Eco</italic>RI/<italic>Bsi</italic>WI. In order to tag MyoVIIa with GFP at the N-terminus, GFP was removed from pcDNA3.1/V5/His GFP using <italic>Eco</italic>RI/<italic>Eco</italic>RI and inserted into pENTR286 MyoVIIa full length using the <italic>Eco</italic>RI restriction site. pcDNA3.1/V5/His GFP was previous generated by amplification of GFP with pEGFPC1 (Clontech) as a template and cloned into pcDNA3.1/V5/His TOPO (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers&#x02019; instructions. In order to generate Ad GFP-Rab27a, the mammalian expression cassette (CMV promoter/GFP/rRab27a/polyA) was amplified from pEGFP-rRab27a using Phusion, cut with <italic>Sal</italic>I/<italic>BamH</italic>I and cloned into pENTR286 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">(33)</xref> using the same restriction sites. Short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) -expressing vectors were constructed by inserting an inverted repeat of Myrip-specific 21-nucleotide sequences into pENTR/U6 plasmid harbouring PolIII U6 promoter obtained from Invitrogen. For shRNA targeting of mouse Myrip, the oligonucleotides were annealed and ligated into pENTR/U6 according to manufacturers&#x02019; instructions (underline indicates RNA interference target sequences). The following oligonucleotides were used: shRNA mMyrip 5 sense: CACCGCAGAGAGACTTCAATCTTCGCGAACGAAGATTGAAGTCTCTCTGC, antisense: AAAAGCAGAGAGACTTCAATCTTCGTTCGCGAAGATTGAAGTCTCTCTGC; shRNA mMyrip 7 sense: CACCGGAGGATTGTTTGAACCAAACTTCAAGAGAGTTTGGTTCAAACAATCCTCC, antisense: AAAAGGAGGATTGTTTGAACCAAACTCTCTTGAAGTTTGGTTCAAACAATCCTCC; shRNA mMyrip 8 sense: CACCGCTGAGAAATAGACTGTATGATTCAAGAGATCATACAGTCTATTTCTCAGC, antisense: AAAAGCTGAGAAATAGACTGTATGATCTCTTGAATCATACAGTCTATTTCTCAGC and shRNA mMyrip 4 sense: CACCGGACTTGATGGAGCCTGATCTTTCAAGAGAAGATCAGGCTCCATCAAGTCC. All plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. Myrip shRNA or cDNA encoding the proteins of interest were cloned according to manufacturers&#x02019; instructions into pAd adenoviral vector from Invitrogen using Gateway technology.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Melan-ink4a melanocytes were maintained in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FCS, 200 n<sc>m</sc> phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and 200 p<sc>m</sc> cholera toxin at 37&#x000b0;C with 10% CO<sub>2</sub>, as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">(33)</xref>. 293FT human embryo kidney cells obtained from Invitrogen were grown in DMEM in the presence of 10% FBS and antibiotics at 37&#x000b0;C and 10% CO<sub>2</sub>.

The total number of reversals steps was calculated in 25 moving melanosomes during a period of 30 seconds, and defined as a movement in the opposite direction the melanosome followed previously. Directionality analysis was performed for some of the cultured RPE cells. Melanosomes were followed during 30 seconds and their <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> co-ordinates recorded. Position of the melanosome relative to the nucleus was calculated for each frame. A positive value was considered centrifugal movement and a negative value as centripetal movement.</p></sec><sec><title>Electron microscopy</title><p>Mouse eyes were fixed in 4% PFA, 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 <sc>m</sc> phosphate buffer and embedded as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">(4)</xref>.
