Here we characterize a novel mRNP complex that is found in neuronal dendrites throughout the central nervous system and in some axonal processes of the spinal cord. The complex is characterized by the LSm1 protein, which so far has been implicated in mRNA degradation in nonneuronal cells. In brain, it associates with intact mRNAs. Interestingly, the LSm1-mRNPs contain the cap-binding protein CBP80 that associates with (pre)mRNAs in the nucleus, suggesting that the dendritic LSm1 complex has been assembled in the nucleus. In support of this notion, neuronal LSm1 is partially nuclear and inhibition of mRNA synthesis increases its nuclear localization. Importantly, CBP80 is also present in the dendrites and both LSm1 and CBP80 shift significantly into the spines upon stimulation of glutamergic receptors, suggesting that these mRNPs are translationally activated and contribute to the regulated local protein synthesis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Translational silencing can determine one of several pathways for the messenger RNP (mRNP): first, the mRNP can be kept silent until it is eventually reactivated for translation, mRNA storage. This pathway is particularly well studied in the early developmental stages of insect or amphibian oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Seydoux, 1996</xref>). In this case, mRNA silencing is achieved by shortening the poly(A) tail to a critical length that no longer supports translation initiation. Activation of the mRNA consequently involves lengthening of the poly(A) tail in a process that is referred to as &#x0201c;cytoplasmic polyadenylation.&#x0201d; In vertebrates, this process requires a characteristic, uridine-rich cytoplasmic polyadenylation element in vicinity to the 3&#x02032; end of the mRNA. Cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements are recognized by the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding (CPEB) protein, the binding of which causes an inhibition of cap-dependent translation. After a critical phosphorylation, CPEB recruits the cytoplasmic polyadenylation machinery to the mRNA and thereby activates translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mendez and Richter, 2001</xref>). Another example of mRNA storage is the evolutionarily conserved translational shutdown that occurs in response to cellular stress: the respective signaling cascades cause phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2&#x003b1;, which blocks translation initiation of most mRNAs at the 48S pretranslational complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Kedersha, 2002</xref>).</p><p>Second, the silenced mRNPs can be transported to subcellular compartments, to be translated there. Local protein synthesis is very important in polarized cells, as it is crucial for the maintenance of the specialized functions in the respective compartments. This is best exemplified by the neuronal axons and dendrites: in the growing axons, local translation plays a crucial role in pathfinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Piper and Holt, 2004</xref>) and is therefore indispensable for the establishing of the proper connections in the nervous system. In the dendrites, synaptic stimulation causes a shift of mRNP components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Steward and Schuman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martin and Zukin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferrari et al., 2007</xref>) and ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ostroff et al., 2002</xref>) into the dendritic spines, where translation is activated. The encoded proteins help to modulate the synaptic strength in response to the stimulation, which is the molecular basis of learning and memory. Several proteins have been associated with dendritic mRNAs and implicated in their transport, among them the zip-code binding protein ZBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>), the Fragile X mental retardation protein FMRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bagni and Greenough, 2005</xref>), and Staufen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">K&#x000f6;hrmann et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Villac&#x000e9; et al., 2004</xref>). Despite this knowledge, the process of selection of dendritic mRNAs and their transport into the dendrites remains largely enigmatic.</p><p>Finally, the silenced mRNA can be degraded. Regulated mRNA degradation frequently starts with deadenylation, either through consecutive shortening of the poly(A) tail or by an endonucleolytic cleavage in the 3&#x02032; UTR. Deadenylation at the 3&#x02032; terminus then causes decapping at the 5&#x02032; end and 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; exonucleolytic degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meyer et al., 2004</xref>). In addition to the decapping enzyme and the exonuclease, the process requires the activity of several auxiliary factors, such as the seven LSm proteins, LSm1&#x02013;7. The LSm proteins associate with the mRNAs that are targeted for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tharun and Parker, 2001</xref>) and are required for efficient decapping in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tharun et al., 2000</xref>). In mammals, the LSm proteins act upstream of the degrading enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cougot et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andrei et al., 2005</xref>) and are probably involved in translational silencing before degradation (the LSm1-associated factor Pat1p inhibits translation in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coller and Parker, 2005</xref>]). The LSm (&#x0201c;Like Sm&#x0201d;) proteins take their name from a sequence homology to the Sm proteins that constitute the core of the spliceosomal small nuclear RNP complexes: they are essential pre-mRNA splicing factors. Similarly, all characterized LSm proteins are involved in various steps of mRNA metabolism. The Sm/LSm proteins share a common domain that is responsible for the fact that seven family members form a circular complex. In vivo assembly of the Sm complex proper requires catalysis by the survival of motor neurons (SMN) protein and associated factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meister et al., 2002</xref>). Insufficient expression of SMN causes a selective degeneration of &#x003b1; motor neurons, a condition called spinal muscular atrophy. How insufficiency of a general splicing factor can have such a selective effect remains enigmatic; possibly SMN has a second function. LSm4 has been implicated because it contains the high affinity SMN-binding domain that is also found in the Sm proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brahms et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Friesen et al., 2001</xref>), but none of the processes that require LSm proteins is specific for neurons.</p><p>mRNA silencing by any of the aforementioned mechanisms can coincide with aggregation of the respective mRNPs into cytoplasmic granules: the polar granules in the case of maternally stored mRNAs in insects, the stress granules in case of stress-induced shutdown of translation, the transport granules in the case of mammalian dendritic transport, and the P bodies in the case of mRNAs that undergo degradation. The distinction between the various types of mRNA granules is not always clear: P bodies are on the one hand mRNA degradation centers, on the other hand they can also store stress-silenced mRNAs in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brengues et al., 2005</xref>) and microRNA-silenced mRNA in higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Filipowicz et al., 2008</xref>). In insects, there appears to be a huge overlap between P body markers and neuronal transport granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barbee et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that the auxiliary mRNA degradation factor LSm1 has a second function in neurons in that it forms stable dendritic mRNPs. The LSm1 mRNPs contain the CBP80 subunit of the nuclear cap-binding complex, indicating that the localized mRNP was assembled in the nucleus, thus linking mRNA transport to nuclear events. In support of this notion, the otherwise predominantly cytoplasmic protein LSm1 becomes partially nuclear upon inhibition of novel mRNA synthesis and hence export. Further, LSm1 mRNPs contain the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding factor CPEB. Finally, we show that both CBP80 and LSm1 migrate into the spines after mGluR stimulation, a typical sign of their regulated activation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>The LSm proteins localize in the dendrites in vitro and in vivo</title><p>As we were interested in the expression of the auxiliary mRNA degradation factors LSm1 to LSm7 in the neuronal system, we looked at the subcellular localization of the LSm proteins in primary neuronal cells. We used antibodies directed against LSm1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ingelfinger et al., 2002</xref>; Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807033/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807033/DC1</ext-link>). Primary neurons were prepared from two different rat tissues, namely the spinal cord and the cerebellum, and labeled with affinity-purified &#x003b1;-LSm1 antibodies. To identify the neurons and at the same time reveal the neurites, the slides were counterstained with a monoclonal &#x003b1;-MAP2 antibody. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>, neurons derived from the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A&#x02013;D</xref>) show a prominent, punctuated signal for LSm1 in the cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, arrow), probably the mRNA-degrading P bodies.1 In addition, LSm1 is also highly expressed in the dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, arrowhead), which is shown by the colocalization with the dendritic marker MAP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>, yellow), thus confirming and extending a recent observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vessey et al., 2006</xref>). As we used affinity-purified antibodies, we were able to determine the LSm1 distribution with high resolution: the dendritic LSm1 is present in apparently granular structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). The spinal cord neurons were not further separated, and motor neurons and interneurons as well as glia cells are present. All neurons have LSm1 present in the neurites (unpublished data). Moreover, when spinal cord neurons were grown in the presence of FBS, the neurons tended to cluster and send bundles of multiple neurites to nearby cell clusters. In these bundles, the granular structure of the LSm1 signal becomes very evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, E&#x02013;H</xref>, the MAP2-positive cell in the middle lies on top of the bundle and the MAP2-negative cell at the right is presumably a glial cell).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>LSm1 and LSm4 localize in the neurites of primary neurons.</bold> Rat spinal cord neurons were cultured in the presence of B27 supplement (A&#x02013;D and N&#x02013;Q) or of serum (E&#x02013;H) for 7 DIV; cerebellar Purkinje cells were cultured as described in Materials and methods for 7 DIV (I&#x02013;M and R&#x02013;U). Cells were stained with monoclonal &#x003b1;-MAP2 antibody (green) and polyclonal &#x003b1;-LSm1 (A&#x02013;M, red) or &#x003b1;-LSm4 antibodies (N&#x02013;U, red).

As for the spinal cord neurons, LSm1 is highly present in the dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 I</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether other components of the LSm complex are also present in the neurites, we stained primary neurons with affinity-purified &#x003b1;-LSm4 antibodies, again counterstaining with the &#x003b1;-MAP2 antibody. As expected, we observed a very prominent signal in the nucleus of the neurons, because LSm4 is not only part of the cytoplasmic LSm1-7 complex but also of the nuclear U6 small nuclear RNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achsel et al., 1999</xref>). In addition, LSm4 is clearly visible also in the neurites of both spinal cord neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 Q</xref>) and in Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 U</xref>). In conclusion, we found the LSm proteins in the cell body of various neurons where they presumably have the same roles as in immortalized cell lines: mRNA splicing in the nucleus and mRNA degradation in the cytoplasm. In addition, the LSm proteins are present in the neurites of the cells, the function of which is not immediately clear.</p><p>Next, we investigated the distribution of LSm1 proteins in the rat central nervous system in vivo. LSm1 is expressed throughout the central nervous system with positive cells of different size and shape present in virtually all areas. Exemplarily, sections from the cerebral cortex and the cerebellum are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>. In the cerebral and cerebellar cortices, all LSm1-positive cells are characterized by a granular distribution of the staining, which is often present also at considerable distances from the cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A, a, d, and g</xref>). Double labeling with LSm1 and different markers (neurofilament heavy chain [NF-H], SMI31, or SMI 32) capable to evidence both neuronal dendrites and axons show a significant localization of LSm1 in these neuronal processes (dendrites are shown by arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A, d</xref>). In the cerebral cortex as well as in the cerebellum, both large neurons, pyramidal and Purkinje cells, as well as small ones, possibly interneurons, are LSm1 positive. Furthermore, double labeling with the marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (unpublished data) suggests that glial cells also express LSm1. Expression of LSm1 in neuronal cell bodies and dendrites is present throughout the brain: double labeling of LSm1 with different specific markers demonstrates its presence in the cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A, g&#x02013;i</xref>), as well as in hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, and substantia nigra pars compacta (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807033/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807033/DC1</ext-link>). Interestingly, no expression of LSm1 is present in the presynaptic terminals, at least of the deep cerebellar nuclei. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B (a&#x02013;c)</xref>, LSm1 is well expressed in the cell bodies, but does not colocalize with the presynaptic marker synaptophysin that surrounds the neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>, green in the merged image and white arrows). In axons, LSm1 labeling is not consistent. This is exemplified by differences between the LSm1 labeling in the corpus callosum, one of the major fiber tracts of the brain, and in the spinal cord. In the corpus callosum, only interspersed cell bodies exhibit LSm1 signals next to the nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B, d and f</xref>, red arrows; the nuclei are highlighted by blue DAPI staining), whereas fibers, indicated by NF-H labeling of axons, do not colocalize with LSm1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B, f</xref>). In the spinal cord, the picture is different. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B (g&#x02013;i)</xref> shows an overview over a transversal section, with the gray matter outlined by a dashed line. Both cell bodies and dendritic structures in this area express LSm1 as well as NF-H. Zooming in on the ventral border of the gray matter, it becomes evident that axonal fibers in the white matter also express LSm1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B, k&#x02013;m</xref>, white arrows). As this is the region where axons leave toward the ventral root, these structures can be tentatively identified as the axons of &#x003b1; motoneurons. In conclusion, LSm1 is expressed in glial and in many neuronal cell types, and it is present, albeit to varying degrees, in dendrites. As regards to axons, in contrast, LSm1 has been clearly localized only in spinal cord fibers.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>LSm1 localizes in vivo in neuronal cell bodies and neurites.</bold> (A) LSm1 is found in dendrites.

To test this notion, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments with affinity-purified &#x003b1;-LSm1 antibodies, using total rat brain extracts. RNAs that coprecipitate with LSm1 were isolated, and the presence of specific mRNAs was revealed by RT-PCR. We tested four mRNAs that are known to be localized in neurites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Steward and Schuman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tsokas et al., 2005</xref>), namely the mRNAs coding for &#x003b2;-actin, MAP1B, CaMKII&#x003b1;, and eEF1&#x003b1;1. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>, all four mRNAs coprecipitate with LSm1 (lanes 3, 6, 9, and 12) but not in the precipitation with unspecific IgGs (lanes 2, 5, 8, and 11). We conclude that, in rat brain extracts, LSm1 stably associates with mRNPs that have been reported to localize in the dendrites. To test whether LSm1 directly binds to the mRNAs in the rat brain, we used a cross-linking/immunoprecipitation protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ule et al., 2003</xref>). Under the highly stringent conditions of the RIPA buffer, most protein&#x02013;protein and protein&#x02013;RNA interactions are broken, and mRNAs did not coprecipitate with LSm1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>, lane 2). When the tissue is UV irradiated before extract preparation, mRNAs that are in molecular contact are covalently linked to LSm1 and therefore coprecipitate even under stringent conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>, lanes 3 and 4). Therefore, the UV-dependent precipitation of the &#x003b2;-actin, MAP1B, and eEF1&#x003b1;1 mRNAs demonstrates that these molecules are in direct contact with LSm1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>, first three panels). We further checked for the coprecipitation of other dendritic mRNAs: the IP<sub>3</sub> receptor Iptr1/Pcp-1 and the Purkinje cell protein Pcp-2 are highly expressed in the Purkinje cells and their mRNA is also dendritic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Iijima et al., 2005</xref>). Both mRNAs cross-link to LSm1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>, fourth and fifth panels) in agreement with the notion that LSm1 in the dendrites associates with mRNAs. Arc/Arg3.1, finally, is an mRNA that localizes in hippocampal dendrites and that is regulated by nonsense-mediated mRNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Giorgi et al., 2007</xref>). Because LSm1 is an auxiliary mRNA degradation factor, even though it is not implicated in nonsense-mediated decay, we checked for association with this mRNA. Arc mRNA is not detected in the immunoprecipitate, showing the specificity of the method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>, sixth panel); only a longer fragment is detected, the length of which corresponds to the Arc/Arg3.1 pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>, asterisk).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>LSm1 binds stably and directly to mRNAs.</bold> (A) Immunoprecipitations were performed from rat brain extracts with affinity-purified &#x003b1;-LSm1 antibodies (lanes 3, 6, 9, and 12) or with an equal amount of nonspecific IgGs (lanes 2, 5, 8, and11).

Extract preparation and gradient conditions were established to give an optimal yield and spread of the LSm1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>, top). It was not intended to infer association with polysomes from the sedimentation velocity, and the distribution of ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>, bottom) was analyzed solely to estimate the size of complexes present in the various fractions (indicated at the top of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>).

Even-numbered fractions were immunoprecipitated under the stringent conditions used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref> to reveal the sedimentation of mRNPs where LSm1 is in molecular contact with the pre-mRNA. The strongest signal for both MAP1B and &#x003b2;-actin mRNA is obtained in the bottom half of the gradient, where LSm1 is underrepresented. In the top half, and especially in the top fraction where LSm1 is most abundant, the signal is much weaker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>).

The last two fractions were discarded, thus eliminating the major part of LSm1 that is not incorporated into complexes of meaningful size and that would only cause background in the following analysis. After &#x003b1;-LSm1 immunoprecipitation, copurifying &#x003b2;-actin mRNA was revealed by RT-PCR. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref> shows that the &#x003b2;-actin mRNA is present in all three regions of the gradient (lanes 1, 4, and 7) and strongly coprecipitates with LSm1 (lanes 3, 6, and 9).

(B) &#x003b2;-Actin and eEF1&#x003b1;1 mRNAs were amplified from a pool of the three fractions (lanes 2 and 3) or from total RNA isolated from the crude brain extract (lane 1) by the tag-addition poly(A) test (Fig. S2, available at http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807033/DC1). The lanes were scanned and the intensity is plotted on the right. The y axis gives the signal intensity relative to the peak of each lane. On the x axis, the position is plotted. Approximate poly(A) tail lengths were estimated from the molecular markers and the length of the amplicons without poly(A).

It was therefore interesting to detect the poly(A) tail and measure its length, which also gives some indication to the translational status. Available methods for poly(A) length measurement are all rather inefficient and require substantial amounts of RNA, more than can be obtained in immunoprecipitations. We therefore devised a new method that uses a Klenow fill-in reaction to tag the poly(A) tail with a specific sequence and that works with low amounts of RNA (the method is described in Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807033/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807033/DC1</ext-link>). Analysis of sucrose gradient/immunoprecipitation double-purified actin mRNAs shows that, similar to the input mRNAs, the poly(A) length shows a bipartite distribution, with the majority of the signal in a peak that corresponds to 50&#x02013;100 nucleotides of poly(A). A second peak corresponds to &#x0003e;200 nucleotides. A similar picture is observed for the eEF1&#x003b1;1 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>, bottom), and the mRNAs isolated from the bottom and middle fractions also show very similar distributions (not depicted). To quantify the result, the signal intensity along the respective lanes was plotted against the position on the gel. The corresponding poly(A) tail lengths were estimated from the molecular mass markers present on the same gel and are indicated on the x axis. As can be seen on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref> (right), the profile does not significantly change. All mRNAs have poly(A) tails that are long enough to exclude ongoing mRNA degradation.</p><p>CPEB1 is present on dendritic mRNPs, regulates translation, and also modulates poly(A) tail length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mendez and Richter, 2001</xref>). LSm1-associated proteins were purified by sucrose gradient/immunoprecipitation as above and analyzed by Western blotting. CPEB1 was specifically present in LSm1 complexes from all three regions of the sucrose gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>, top), indicating that LSm1 mRNPs indeed have the potential to be activated by cytoplasmic polyadenylation.</p><p>Further, functional mRNAs have an m<sup>7</sup>G cap structure at their 5&#x02032; terminus, which is bound by the translation initiation factor eIF4E. eIF4E is present mainly in the top fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>, second panel, lane 7), and only minor amounts are found in the middle part of the gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>, second panel, lane 4). In none of the fractions eIF4E precipitated with LSm1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>, lanes 3, 6, and 9). If eIF4E is not bound to the cap, the decapping enzyme that competes with eIF4E may be present on the mRNP. The Dcp1a subunit of the enzyme is found in all three fractions of the gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>, third panel, lanes 1, 4, and 7), but it does not coprecipitate with LSm1. Probably, the P bodies in the cell bodies that contain LSm1 and Dcp1a disintegrate during the purification scheme. That leaves only the nuclear cap-binding complex, which binds to the cap during maturation of the mRNA and its export from the nucleus. We verified the presence of the bigger subunit CBP80: it was detected in all three zones of the gradient and it coprecipitated with LSm1 in significant amounts in all three fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>, fourth panel). We conclude that the LSm1 mRNPs have CBP80 bound to the 5&#x02032; cap structure.</p><p>To further characterize the LSm1-associated mRNPs, we investigated association with translational markers. FMRP, an important neuronal and dendritic translational regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Napoli et al., 2008</xref>), does not coprecipitate with LSm1 and colocalizes only to a very small extent with dendritic LSm1 (unpublished data). The ribosomal protein S6 coprecipitated in all three regions of the gradient, indicating association with the small ribosomal subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>, fifth panel). The large ribosomal subunit protein L11, instead, is not significantly associated with LSm1 mRNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>, sixth panel), suggesting the presence of stalled 48S initiation complexes. Finally, the LSm complex interacts, at least in vitro, with SMN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Friesen and Dreyfuss, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brahms et al., 2001</xref>). The interaction is confirmed in the brain extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>, seventh panel). It should be noted, however, that the interaction is mostly restricted to the top fraction containing the lightest complexes, as if SMN is part only of a subset of LSm1 complexes.</p></sec><sec><title>Dendritic LSm1 colocalizes with CBP80, but not Dcp1a</title><p>So far, we have biochemically characterized a stable LSm1 complex that contains several mRNAs that are also found in the dendrites. To demonstrate that the complex actually is dendritic, we studied the subcellular localization of the involved proteins in primary neurons. We know that LSm1 resides in the dendritic compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>), and the same is true for CPEB and eIF4E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smart et al., 2003</xref>). We therefore looked at the cap-binding protein in our complex. In primary neurons, CBP80 is detected in the cell bodies and in particular in the nucleus, as expected. Significantly, it is clearly also present along the dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>). We expressed fluorescent versions of the LSm proteins (tagged with YPet; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nguyen and Daugherty, 2005</xref>) and coexpressed LSm1 and LSm4 because LSm subcomplexes give more specific localization signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ingelfinger et al., 2002</xref>). We further used a neuron-specific promoter to better control expression levels and better reveal cellular structures. The resulting pattern faithfully reproduces the localization of the endogenous LSm1 and LSm4 proteins (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). Significantly, several dendritic spots of LSm1/4 enrichment coincide with CBP80 foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 C</xref>, yellow arrows). Further, we transfected with YPet-Dcp1a and counterstained with &#x003b1;-LSm1 antibodies. YPet-Dcp1a is expressed in granular structures in the cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 E</xref>) that colocalize with LSm1 and therefore appear as bright yellow spots in the merged image. These structures presumably correspond to the mRNA-degrading P bodies that were observed in undifferentiated cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ingelfinger et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cougot et al., 2004</xref>). Note that P bodies are not homogenous macromolecular complexes and colocalization of LSm1 and Dcp1a in the cell body therefore does not contradict our finding that they do not interact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>). Outside the cell body, the two proteins segregate: Dcp1a granules contain little or no LSm1 and thus appear green in the merged image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 G</xref>). We conclude that LSm1 granules in the dendrite contain CBP80, but no Dcp1a. In the cell body, they mostly contain Dcp1a. The biochemically characterized LSm1 particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>) therefore most likely represent the dendritic fraction.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><bold>Dendritic LSm1 colocalizes with CBP80, but not with hDcp1a.</bold> Hippocampal neurons (10 DIV) were transfected simultaneously with YPet-LSm1 and YPet-LSm4 and counterstained with &#x003b1;-CBP80 antibodies (A&#x02013;C) or transfected with YPet-hDcp1a and counter-stained with &#x003b1;-LSm1 (D&#x02013;G).

LSm1 has so far been described as entirely cytoplasmic. Careful inspection of LSm1-stained primary neurons, however, revealed some nuclear staining with certain variability between cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref> and not depicted), indicating that LSm1 is not rigorously excluded from the nucleus. The predominantly cytoplasmic localization in the steady state could then be driven by the efficient transport of newly synthesized mRNAs into the cytoplasm. To test this hypothesis, we inhibited de novo synthesis of mRNAs, and hence mRNA export to the cytoplasm, by actinomycin D (ActD) treatment of primary hippocampal neurons for 3 h. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref> shows the projection of confocal slices that span the entire cell. A typical cell in the untreated sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>, top) shows only a faint LSm1 signal (red) that colocalizes with the nucleus (Hoechst staining shown as green); the projection even exaggerates the true amount of nuclear LSm1, as it includes a thin layer of cytoplasm underneath and above the nucleus (not depicted). ActD treatment, instead, significantly increases the amount of LSm1 in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>, bottom). Because of the variability between cells (see beginning of paragraph), we wanted to confirm the data by performing a statistical analysis. LSm1 signal that colocalized with the nucleus was quantified and normalized first to the area of the nuclear projection and then to the mean LSm1 nuclear staining in the control samples. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref>, ActD induces a twofold increase in the mean nuclear LSm1 signal (<italic>n</italic> = 6; P &#x0003c; 0.05 in Student's <italic>t</italic> test). We conclude that LSm1 clearly has a nuclear phase.

We therefore tested whether synaptic stimulation leads to a redistribution of LSm1. Indeed, a 5-min treatment with (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) causes a significant increase of both the LSm1 and CBP80 signal in the dendrites of primary hippocampal neurons. To verify that the dendrites carry functional synapses, we performed a triple staining with an &#x003b1;-synaptophysin antibody that marks presynaptic sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8, A and B</xref>, top rows), phalloidin that highlights points of F-actin enrichment and hence dendrites (second rows), and &#x003b1;-LSm1 or &#x003b1;-CBP80 antibodies (third rows). A mask was created using a dedicated algorithm (see Materials and methods), which marks all the points in the image that are within a 0.4-&#x000b5;m distance from both synaptophysin-positive foci and sites of F-actin enrichment, i.e., that are in close vicinity to a functional synapse. The mask is shown in green in the fourth row (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8, A and B</xref>). As is evident from the picture, some LSm1 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8, A and B</xref>, fourth row, red) is found in the vicinity of untreated synapses (left) and therefore appears yellow in the merged picture (arrows). After DHPG treatment, the signal within the mask increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8, A and B</xref>, right). Statistical evaluation of at least 30 neurons for each condition confirmed the data: the LSm1 signal in vicinity of the synapses increased by 44% (P &#x0003c; 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 C</xref>) and CBP80 by 30% (P &#x0003c; 0.01).

Three characteristics of this mRNP are remarkable. First, it contains the LSm proteins LSm1 and LSm4, and presumably five other LSm proteins as well, to complete the heptamer (see Introduction). LSm proteins are auxiliary factors of mRNA decapping in yeast and components of the P bodies in all eukaryotes (see Introduction). In neuronal dendrites, instead, LSm1 associates with stable mRNPs that can be isolated and characterized. The presence of an intact poly(A) tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>) and a m<sup>7</sup>G cap (as indicated by the presence of a cap-binding factor; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>) further support the notion that the respective mRNAs are not undergoing degradation. The presence of LSm1 in these neuronal mRNPs further underlines the overlap between the various types of RNA granules, P bodies and stress granules in cell lines, maternally stored mRNPs in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> oocytes, and neuronal transport mRNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson and Kedersha, 2006</xref>). The oskar mRNP in <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2006</xref>) and neuronal Staufen-containing transport mRNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barbee et al., 2006</xref>) contain the decapping enzyme Dcp1/Dcp1a even when their function does not involve mRNA degradation, indicating that the different functions of the P body&#x02013;type granules are not physically separated. The mammalian neuronal LSm1 protein, instead, coincides with the Dcp1a-decapping enzyme only in the cell body. In the dendrites, the two proteins segregate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>), indicating that mRNA degradation and LSm1-associated mRNP localization are separated in space. This notion is further supported by the absence of Dcp1a in purified LSm1 particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). Therefore the neuronal mRNP granules are heterogeneous, at least in mammalian neurons, in that dendritic LSm1-mRNPs and P bodies are distinct.</p><p>In the central nervous system, we observed LSm1 in neuronal dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>), but expression levels vary widely, with dendrites of pyramidal neurons and especially of Purkinje cells labeled most. The selectivity is even more pronounced when looking at axonal processes: in the brain, we could not detect LSm1 in axonal fibers or presynaptic structures. In the spinal cord, instead, fibers that can be anatomically defined as axonal projections, most likely of the &#x003b1;-motor neurons, are clearly LSm1 positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). LSm1 thus appears to have a function that is either specific for certain neuron subtypes or that requires more LSm1 in certain neurons than in others. This is remarkable with respect to the interaction of the LSm proteins with the SMN protein in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brahms et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Friesen et al., 2001</xref>) and in brain extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>): because of the selective effect of SMN depletion on &#x003b1;-motor neurons, it has been hypothesized that the protein may have a neuron-specific role in addition to its housekeeping function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sendtner, 2001</xref>). Further, the primary defect in the motor neurons is a failure to mature and/or maintain the axonal projection. The LSm complex might therefore be the missing link between SMN insufficiency and motor neuron degeneration.</p><p>LSm1 has been primarily described as an auxiliary mRNA degradation factor. Detailed analysis in yeast shows that Lsm1p regulates translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holmes et al., 2004</xref>) and the LSm1-associated factor Pat1p inhibits translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coller and Parker, 2005</xref>). Similarly, mammalian LSm acts upstream of the degrading enzymes hDcp1a and hXrn1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cougot et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andrei et al., 2005</xref>). We therefore believe that the neuronal LSm1 mRNPs will also be translationally silent. An indication of this is the size distribution of LSm1 on sucrose gradients does not follow a typical &#x0201c;polysome&#x0201d; profile, with a second peak of more than 80S. More importantly, the mRNP contains the nuclear cap-binding protein, strongly indicating that the mRNA has not yet undergone its pioneer round of translation (see next paragraph). LSm1 mRNPs associate with the small ribosomal subunit, whereas no significant amounts of the large subunit were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>), which might hint at the possibility that the LSm1 mRNPs represent stalled 48S preinitiation complexes. They may in this respect resemble transport mRNPs that form around the zip-code binding protein ZBP1, in which parts of the small, but not of the large ribosomal subunit have been detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">J&#x000f8;nson et al., 2007</xref>). Consistently, ZBP1 inhibits translation at the 48S stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">H&#x000fc;ttelmaier et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Remarkably, the LSm1 mRNPs contain the &#x0201c;nuclear&#x0201d; cap-binding protein CBP80 instead of the translation initiation factor eIF4E. This protein binds to mRNA precursors in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Izaurralde et al., 1994</xref>) and remains bound to the mRNA throughout its maturation and export from the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Visa et al., 1996</xref>). In the cytoplasm, CBP80 is removed in a pioneer round of translation and eIF4E takes its place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ishigaki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lejeune et al., 2002</xref>). CBP80 so far has not been implicated in neuronal mRNA transport. Here we show that CBP80 is present along the dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figs. 6</xref>). mGluR-mediated translational stimulation causes a significant shift of CBP80 toward the synapses, which is a hallmark of the activation of local protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>). These findings together strongly suggest that CBP80 has a role during dendritic mRNP transport.</p><p>First of all, this implies that the respective mRNAs have not yet undergone the pioneer round of translation when they are transported into the dendrites. Quite possibly, they were committed for dendritic transport already in the nucleus (see also below). While this study was under way, it was reported that components of the exon junction complex are also found in the dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Giorgi et al., 2007</xref>). The exon junction complex is deposited onto the mRNA in the nucleus and is likewise stripped off the mRNA by the pioneer round of translation, and this observation is therefore compatible with the idea of an early commitment to transport. A nuclear commitment to cytoplasmic transport has been shown before for the <italic>oskar</italic> mRNAs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hachet and Ephrussi, 2004</xref>) and may also play a role in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kress et al., 2004</xref>). The ZBP1 transport mRNP in HEK cells also contains CBP80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">J&#x000f8;nson et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting that the nuclear history of mRNA transport is a wide-spread phenomenon. LSm1 is regarded as a cytoplasmic protein. Contrary to this belief, primary neurons have a variable fraction of the protein in the nucleus, and inhibition of ex novo formation of mRNPs by transcription repression significantly increases the nuclear LSm1 fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). This gives a first indication that LSm1 can shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, with the nuclear export depending on mRNP export, and the LSm1/CBP80 mRNP could well assemble in the nucleus.</p><p>Finally, the LSm1 mRNPs associate with CPEB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). CPEB binds to the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element that is present on some mRNAs and can trigger, upon glutamergic stimulation, elongation of the poly(A) tails and hence translation activation of the respective mRNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wells et al., 2001</xref>). CPEB is present at the dendrites and enters into the spines upon synaptic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 2003</xref>), similar to what we observe for LSm1 and CBP80. Our poly(A) tail length measurement shows that LSm1-associated mRNAs are not deadenylated; only a subpopulation of the &#x003b2;-actin mRNA might be. There are two possible interpretations: CPEB might have a role in dendritic mRNA transport beyond poly(A) length control (e.g., CPEB is present on mRNPs during transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 2003</xref>]) and/or only a subset of the LSm1-associated mRNAs, whose identity we do not currently know, contain critically short poly(A) tails so that their translational activation requires cytoplasmic polyadenylation.</p><p>The model that emerges from our data is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>. LSm1 and CBP80 assemble in the nucleus onto mRNPs that are destined to be transported into the dendrites. Likely, the pioneer round of translation is initiated, but then blocked at the 48S pretranslation complex. It remains to be seen at what stage CPEB joins the complex; the fact that it is present during transport along the dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 2003</xref>) implies that it also enters at an early time point. All the key players in this mRNP have been shown previously or in this manuscript to be present at the dendrites, and it is therefore straightforward to assume that they are part of the migrating mRNP. Finally, at least LSm1 and CBP80 shift into the dendritic spines when the synapses are stimulated, which is causing translational activation. We cannot exclude the possibility that translation then takes place in the presence of both factors, e.g., by internal ribosomal entry site&#x02013;mediated translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pinkstaff et al., 2001</xref>), but we think it is more likely they are replaced in loco to give way for normal, eIF4E-dependent translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smart et al., 2003</xref>). This model sheds new light on the dendritic targeting and transport of mRNPs and will thus be an important stimulus for future studies.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p><bold>Model.</bold> mRNPs bound for dendritic transport associate with the LSm complex already in the nucleus, with the nuclear cap-binding protein still attached. Whether CPEB joins the complex also in the nucleus, or only after export, remains to be elucidated. The mRNP carrying these markers is then found in the dendrite and is shifted as such into stimulated dendritic spines. There, the mRNA is presumably liberated to allow eIF4E-dependent translation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB_200807033_RGB_Fig9"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All animal experiments in this study were performed using Wistar rats and C56/BL6 mice (Harlan or Charles River Laboratories) that were group-housed in standard cages and kept under a 12-h light/dark cycle with food and water ad libitum.
