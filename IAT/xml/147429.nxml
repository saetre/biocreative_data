However, the earliest phenotype of the introduced mutation can eclipse later effects. We show in mice that site-specific genomic recombination can be induced in a selected cell type, B lymphocytes, at a chosen time. This precision of somatic mutagenesis was accomplished by limiting expression of a Cre recombinase-estrogen receptor fusion protein to B lymphocytes by use of tissue-specific elements in the promoter of the transgene employed. The expressed fusion protein remained inactive until derepressed by systemic administration of an exogenous ligand for the estrogen receptor, 4-OH-tamoxifen. Upon derepression the Cre recombinase enzyme deleted specific DNA segments, flanked by loxP sites, in B lymphocytes only. The efficiency of recombination in cells expressing the fusion protein could be varied from low levels to &#x0003e;80%, depending on the dose of ligand administered. Our work presents a paradigm applicable to other uses of site-specific recombination in somatic mutagenesis where both temporal and spatial regulation are desired.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
