Activation is controlled by integrins' short cytoplasmic tails (CTs). It is widely accepted that the head domain of talin (talin-H) can mediate integrin activation by binding to two sites in integrin &#x003b2;'s CT; in integrin &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> this is an NPLY<sup>747</sup> motif and the membrane-proximal region. Here, we show that the C-terminal region of integrin &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> CT, composed of a conserved TS<sup>752</sup>T region and NITY<sup>759</sup> motif, supports integrin activation by binding to a cytosolic binding partner, kindlin-2, a widely distributed PTB domain protein. Co-transfection of kindlin-2 with talin-H results in a synergistic enhancement of integrin &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> activation. Furthermore, siRNA knockdown of endogenous kindlin-2 impairs talin-induced &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> activation in transfected CHO cells and blunts &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>-mediated adhesion and migration of endothelial cells. Our results thus identify kindlin-2 as a novel regulator of integrin activation; it functions as a coactivator.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: CT, cytoplasmic tail; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; talin-H, talin head domain.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Integrin activation, the rapid transition from a low to a high affinity state for ligand, regulates the numerous cellular responses consequent to integrin engagement by extracellular matrix proteins or counter-receptors on other cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hynes, 2002</xref>). This transformation is tightly controlled by the integrin cytoplasmic tails (CTs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Qin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ma et al., 2007</xref>). Mutational and structural analyses suggest that the &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> CT can be divided two regions, and both influence integrin activation. The membrane-proximal region of the &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> CT is primarily &#x003b1;-helix, which interacts with the membrane-proximal helix of the &#x003b1; subunit through several electrostatic and hydrophobic bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Vinogradova et al., 2002</xref>). Unclasping of the complex is a critical event in integrin activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hughes et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kim et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ma et al., 2006</xref>). The membrane-distal region of the &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> CT contains two NXXY turn motifs, NPLY<sup>747</sup> and NITY<sup>759</sup>, which are separated by a short helix containing a T/S cluster, the TS<sup>752</sup>T region (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). The head domain of talin (talin-H) docks at the NPLY<sup>747</sup> motif through its F<sub>3</sub> domain and also interacts with the membrane-proximal region, perturbing the membrane clasp and leading to at least partial integrin activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Vinogradova et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Tadokoro et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Wegener et al., 2007</xref>). The T/S cluster and the NITY motif are also critical for integrin activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">O'Toole et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Xi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ma et al., 2006</xref>). However, the mechanisms underlying their effects remain unresolved. In this study, we found that kindlin-2, a widely distributed PTB domain protein, interacts with the C terminus of &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> CT at the TS<sup>752</sup>T and NITY<sup>759</sup> motifs and markedly enhances talin-induced integrin activation. Thus, kindlin-2 is identified as a coactivator of integrins.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Sequences of the membrane-distal region of &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> CT have essential roles in integrin &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> activation.</bold> (A) Alignment of integrin &#x003b2; CT sequences, highlighting (red) the conserved regions, the two NXXY/F motifs and one T/S cluster.

A CHO cell line stably expressing &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> was transfected with cDNAs encoding for wild-type or mutated &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> CT based on the rationale that these expressed constructs would compete for integrin binding partners. A similar strategy had been used previously to screen the &#x003b2; CT binding partners essential for integrin activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fenczik et al., 1997</xref>). In our studies, these &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> CT were expressed as chimeric constructs containing the extracellular domain of PSGL-1 so that expression levels of the various &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> CT could be verified. As assessed by flow cytometry (FACS), PSGL-1 expression differed by less than 10%. The effects of the various &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> CT on &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>-mediated cell spreading on immobilized fibrinogen were evaluated. Compared with cells expressing PSGL-1 alone, expression of the wild-type &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>CT chimera totally abolished &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>-mediated cell spreading (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). As a specificity control, Y<sup>747</sup>A mutation, which would interfere with talin binding, resulted in a loss of inhibitory activity. Other mutations in the membrane-distal region in &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> CT chimera, S<sup>752</sup>P and Y<sup>759</sup>A, beyond the talin interactive sites and which perturb key structural features in this region, the short helix and the turn motif, respectively, also led to loss of competitive activity. This loss was not observed with Y<sup>747</sup>F, S<sup>752</sup>A, or Y<sup>759</sup>F substitutions, which would sustain the secondary structural features of the membrane-distal region.</p><p>Cell spreading is a complex response and we sought to confirm the role of membrane-distal residues in integrin activation more directly. &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> containing a point mutation of R<sup>995</sup>D in &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub> or D<sup>723</sup>R in &#x003b2;<sub>3,</sub> which disrupts a salt bridge formed by R<sup>995</sup> and D<sup>723</sup>, is a particularly sensitive reporter of talin-H&#x02013;induced activation in a CHO cell system as assessed with the ligand mimetic mAb, PAC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hughes et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Tadokoro et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ma et al., 2006</xref>). Disrupting either of the two NXXY turn motifs, NPLY<sup>747</sup> or NITY<sup>759</sup>, with a Y<sup>747</sup>A or a Y<sup>759</sup>A mutation dramatically impairs integrin activation caused by R<sup>995</sup>D (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). However, conservative substitutions that should be structurally silent, Y<sup>747</sup>F or Y<sup>759</sup>F, have no significant effect on integrin activation. Consistent with previous data, disruption of the short helix between two NXXY motifs with the naturally occurring S<sup>752</sup>P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chen et al., 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">1994</xref>) suppresses integrin activation whereas the S<sup>752</sup>A substitution, which maintains the helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ma et al., 2006</xref>), does not affect activation. Although the above description focuses on the &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> CT, most of the key sequences are shared by other integrin &#x003b2; subunits (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>), and the potential to be activated extends to multiple integrin subfamilies.</p><p>A reasonable synthesis of the data in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 (B and C)</xref> is that the membrane-distal region of the &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> CT regulates integrin activation and does so by interacting with a cytoplasmic binding partner that cooperates with talin but binds to distinct sites. Molecules reported to bind to the membrane-distal conservative regions of &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> CT include filamin, which binds to the T/S cluster, and &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>-endonexin, which binds to the NITY<sup>759</sup> motif. Both have been suggested as regulators of integrin activation (filamin, a negative regulator, and &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>-endonexin, a positive regulator) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Eigenthaler et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kiema et al., 2006</xref>). To assess their roles in integrin activation, filamin A Ig-like domain 21 (FLNa21, the &#x003b2; CT binding region) or &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>-endonexin was transfected or cotransfected together with talin-H into &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>-CHO cells. Neither modulated talin-induced integrin activation or directly mediated integrin activation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>; and Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200710196/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200710196/DC1</ext-link>), thus excluding them as the hypothetical coactivator of integrins. It should be noted that these data are not inconsistent with the proposed role of filamin A as a negative regulator of integrin activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kiema et al., 2006</xref>); suppressive effects of FLNa21 may not be evident in the presence of high talin-H levels.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Kindlin-2 enhances talin-induced integrin &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> activation.</bold> EGFP-fused &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> CT binding proteins were transiently transfected into &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>-CHO cells.

Kindlin-2 contributes to the maturation of focal adhesions during cell shape changes through recruitment of migfilin and filamin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Tu et al., 2003</xref>). Targeted disruption of the kindlin-2 gene results in embryonic lethality in mice and causes multiple, severe abnormalities in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dowling et al., 2008</xref>). Distinct from talin, its interaction site on &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> CT is not dependent on the NPLY<sup>747</sup> motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Shi et al., 2007</xref>). When expressed in &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>-CHO cells, kindlin-2 induces statistically significant but very weak integrin activation compared with talin-H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Shi et al., 2007</xref>). To consider the role of kindlin-2 a coactivator with talin-H, both were transfected into &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>-CHO cells. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 (C and D)</xref>, kindlin-2 dramatically enhanced talin-H&#x02013;mediated &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> activation. This enhancement was not simply additive but represented functional synergism. We assessed the expression levels in different transfectants by Western blots to exclude that coexpression of kindlin-2 enhanced talin-H expression or vise-versa; expression of talin-H in single and double transfectants was similar (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>).</p><p>To further assess the role of kindlin-2 as a coactivator, GST-fused &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> CT proteins were used to coprecipitate endogeneous kindlin-2 in lysates of CHO cells, platelets, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, wild-type &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> CT interacts with kindlin-2 but GST alone did not, ascribing specificity to the interactions. The Y<sup>747</sup>A mutation abrogates talin-H but not kindin-2 binding to &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> CT. In contrast, the S<sup>752</sup>P and Y<sup>759</sup>A mutations still support talin-H binding but dramatically reduce kindlin-2 association (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Thus, the binding requirements for talin-H and kindlin-2 on the &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> CT are distinct and both bind to sites known to regulate integrin activation. Consistent with our observations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref> and Fig. S1 A), overexpression of FLNa21 or &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>-endonexin, two C-terminal binding proteins of &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> CT, failed to suppress endogenous kindlin-2 binding to &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> CT in CHO cells (Fig. S1 B), indicating a privileged interaction of kindlin-2 with the &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> CT among these binding partners. As a point of emphasis, endogenous kindlin-2 coprecipitates with endogenous &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin subunit in both &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>-CHO cells and HUVECs (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200710196/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200710196/DC1</ext-link>).</p><p>Peptides corresponding to Y<sup>747</sup>-T<sup>762</sup> or a variant peptide containing the S<sup>752</sup>P and Y<sup>759</sup>A substitutions were synthesized (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). When added as competitors (200 &#x003bc;M), wild-type Y<sup>747</sup>-T<sup>762</sup> peptide inhibited kindlin-2 coprecipitation with the GST-&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> CT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>); the inhibition was &#x0223c;70% by densitometry. A lower concentration of peptide (100 &#x003bc;M) was still inhibitory but produced only 50% inhibition (unpublished data), suggesting a dose-dependent inhibitory effect. Introduction of S<sup>752</sup>P and Y<sup>759</sup>A mutations into the peptide totally abolished its competitive activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). As control, both peptides had no effect on talin-H association with the GST-&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> CT. It is noteworthy that introduction of similar peptides into endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Liu et al., 1996</xref>) and platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hers et al., 2000</xref>) significantly perturbed &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> and &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> mediated responses, respectively. Thus, our results may provide a molecular explanation for these prior observations.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Distinct binding sites for kindlin-2 and talin in &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> CT.</bold> (A) Lysates of CHO cells, HUVECs, or out-dated platelets were incubated with GST or GST-fused &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> CT bearing the indicated mutations in the presence of glutathione-Sepharose.

Our previous experiments had shown that a QW<sup>615</sup>/AA mutation in F<sub>3</sub>, a site predicted by molecular modeling to be involved in &#x003b2; CT engagement, did, in fact, disrupt its association with &#x003b2; CT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Shi et al., 2007</xref>). We segmented kindlin-2 into several fragments, and their &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> CT-binding capacities were evaluated by pull-down assays (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). Deletion of the N-terminal region of kindlin-2, at N217 or at E345, the border of the PH domain insertion, ablated interaction with the &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> CT. In addition, truncation of kindlin-2 to delete the second part of its F<sub>2</sub> and F<sub>3</sub> subdomains also disrupted &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> CT interaction (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). These deletions were more disruptive than the QW<sup>615</sup> mutation. However, with deletion of PH domain alone, the mutant kindlin-2 still retained its capacity to bind the &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> CT. The effects of these mutants on the coactivator activity of kindlin-2 were tested. When cotransfected with talin-H, deletion of either the N- or C-terminal region of kindlin-2 resulted in loss of coactivator activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>). The mutant with its PH domain deletion still retained some coactivator activity, although it was less potent than intact kindlin-2. Also, the QW<sup>615</sup> mutant lacked coactivator activity, verifying that this site is involved not only in binding but also in coactivator function. We cannot exclude that some of these mutations may affect global folding of kindlin-2. However, it should be noted that FERM subdomains tend to fold independently into functional units. Thus, coactivator activity appears to depend on binding of kindlin-2 through both its N- and C-terminal F<sub>3</sub> (PTB) domains. As to why the C-terminal F<sub>3</sub> (PTB) of kindlin-2 recognizes the NITY<sup>759</sup> rather than the NPLY<sup>747</sup> region of &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> CT will require high resolution structures.</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Both the N and C terminus of kindlin-2 are required for &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> CT association and support of talin-induced integrin activation.</bold> (A) Organization of predicated domains of kindlin-2 protein.

Small interfering RNAs targeting kindlin-2 (siKind-2) or irrelevant RNAs as control (siControl) were introduced into &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>-CHO cells, and kindlin-2 expression levels were analyzed by Western blot. Transfection of siKind-2 but not siControl effectively inhibited the expression of kindlin-2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). The decrease in kindlin-2 protein expression was 70% by densitometry. Neither the siKind-2 nor the siControl changed actin expression, establishing selectivity of the siKind-2 on kindlin-2 expression. Talin-H can induce &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> activation in transfected &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>-CHO cells as shown by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Tadokoro et al., 2003</xref>) and in this study. However, talin-H&#x02013;mediated integrin activation was significantly blunted when kindlin-2 levels were reduced with siKind-2 but not siControl (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>), indicating that endogenous kindlin-2 supports talin-H&#x02013;induced &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> activation in these cells.</p><p>We also tested the function of kindlin-2 knock-down in cells that express an integrin naturally. HUVECs express and use &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> to mediate cell adhesion and migration on fibrinogen or vitronectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Plow et al., 2000</xref>). Endogenous kindlin-2 could be knocked down in HUVEC using siRNA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>), and the deficiency of kindlin-2 dramatically suppressed HUVEC adhesion on the &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin ligands, fibrinogen or vitronectin (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 E</xref>). In addition, knockdown of kindlin-2 in HUVECs significantly inhibited VEGF-induced cell migration (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 F</xref>). Under the conditions used, VEGF induced HUVEC migration on fibrinogen or vitronectin is dependent on &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Byzova et al., 2000</xref>), and there is little cell proliferation (&#x0003c; 50% increase) in serum-free medium (unpublished data). Interestingly, we previously found that overexpression of kindlin-2 also inhibited migration for some cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Shi et al., 2007</xref>). These two distinct observations suggest that the supportive role of kindlin-2 in integrin activation might be cell type and/or integrin specific or depends on specific experimental conditions such as ligand concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Huttenlocher et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Palecek et al., 1997</xref>). Furthermore, knocking down kindlin-2 significantly suppressed PMA-induced HUVEC adhesion on fibrinogen (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 G</xref>), which is also an &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> activation-dependent process. In concert, these results suggest that kindlin-2 plays an important role in supporting &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin functions dependent on activation.</p><p>Nonetheless, kindlin-2 is unlikely to be a direct activator of integrin; overexpression of kindlin-2 alone only had a mild effect on integrin activation compared with talin-H (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Even though kindlin-2 also bears a FERM-like domain as does talin-H, the binding sites of kindlin-2 on &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> CT are solely localized at its C terminus beyond of the talin-H recognition sites (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), which allows kindlin-2 and talin to bind to the &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> CT together. This possibility has been established by the synergistic role of talin-H and kindlin-2 in integrin activation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, C and D</xref>) and further verified by the finding that knockdown of endogenous kindlin-2 significantly suppressed talin-H&#x02013;induced integrin activation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, B and C</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we found that kindlin-2 is a coactivator of talin in supporting &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin activation. As such, kindlin-2 is the first of the postulated coactivators of integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ma et al., 2007</xref>) to be identified. Our data support a model (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 H</xref>) in which kindlin-2 binds to the C terminus of &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> CT beyond of the talin-binding sites. Functionally, kindlin-2 synergistically enhances talin-induced integrin activation. Kindlin-2 may associate with membrane via its PH domain, an interaction commonly associated with these domains, and interacts with &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> CT via its N terminus and C-terminal PTB domain. Anchoring &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> CT by kindlin-2 could reduce the flexibility of &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> CT in the cytosol, positioning it more favorably for interaction with talin and might also displace other &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> CT binding partners. Due to the variable expression of kindlin-2 in different tissues and cells, e.g., its levels are quite low in human platelets versus HUVECs (Fig. S3 B), one must consider the possibilities that kindlin-2 may exert a &#x0201c;catalytic&#x0201d; effect on integrin activation, where one molecule coactivates multiple integrins, or whether this coactivator activity of kindlin-2 is shared or compensated by other kindlin family members or by other integrin binding partners.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plasmid construction and mutagenesis</title><p>The cDNA of human &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> subunits were inserted into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen).
