Recently the intracellular protein BAT3, which is involved in DNA damage induced apoptosis, was identified as a ligand for NKp30. However, the mechanisms underlying the exposure of the intracellular ligand BAT3 to surface NKp30 and its role in NK-DC cross talk remained elusive. Electron microscopy and flow cytometry demonstrate that exosomes released from 293T cells and iDCs express BAT3 on the surface and are recognized by NKp30-Ig. Overexpression and depletion of BAT3 in 293T cells directly correlates with the exosomal expression level and the activation of NK cell-mediated cytokine release. Furthermore, the NKp30-mediated NK/DC cross talk resulting either in iDC killing or maturation was BAT3-dependent. Taken together this puts forward a new model for the activation of NK cells through intracellular signals that are released via exosomes from accessory cells. The manipulation of the exosomal regulation may offer a novel strategy to induce tumor immunity or inhibit autoimmune diseases caused by NK cell-activation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>NK) cells are lymphocytes involved in innate and adaptive immunity. Unlike T and B lymphocytes, NK cells do not possess antigen specific receptors. NK cell recognition of target cells and communication with different immune modulatory cells are regulated by a set of integrated signals provided by corresponding inhibitory and activating receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003377-Bryceson1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003377-Bryceson2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The well known killer-inhibitory receptors (KIRs) recognize the MHC-class molecules on self-cells and protect them against cytotoxicity. Virus-infected and tumor transformed cells down-regulate the MHC molecules and instead express inducible ligands for the activating receptor, NKG2D and the natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003377-Smyth1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The knowledge on the ligands for NCRs is still limited.

However, it is still unclear how these intracellular proteins become exposed to the cell surface to activate NK cells. The contribution of such intracellular factors to the NK/DC cross talk is also not yet analyzed. This is of special interest for NKp30 and its tumor associated ligand BAT3, since NKp30 (NCR3, CD337) plays a crucial role in target-cell lysis as well as in the cross talk between NK cells and iDCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003377-Ferlazzo1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003377-Vitale1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Intracellular BAT3 has been reported to regulate apoptosis in a variety of settings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003377-Desmots1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003377-Wu1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

Reminiscent to BAT3, extra-cellular Hsp70 stimulates NK cell function and it is also involved in the activation of professional antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells. Recently it was shown that intracellular Hsp70 is released via exosomes from tumor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003377-Gastpar1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

BAT3 was detectable in lysates of monocyte-derived iDCs, and released into the extracellular compartment in response to non-lethal heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003377-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Moreover, a BAT3- specific ELISA demonstrated that extracellular BAT3 derived from iDCS was specifically recognized by NKp30-Ig, whereas no binding to NKp46-Ig was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003377-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). These data show that iDCs secrete BAT3, that specifically binds to NKp30 and support previous reports suggesting a role for NKp30 but not for NKp46 in the NK-DC cross-talk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003377-Ferlazzo1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Laser Scanner Microscopy revealed that intracellular BAT3 was predominantly detectable in the cell nuclei and also on the cell membrane of heat shocked iDCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003377-g001">Fig. 1C, merge</xref>).

However, subsequent blocking of MHC-class-I molecules on mature DCs with HLA-A, B, C specific mAb lead to efficient lysis by NK cells and this effect could be blocked by adding BAT3 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003377-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p><p>The NKp30-dependent NK-DC cross talk also results in iDC maturation (<italic>12</italic>). Thus, we explored the role of soluble protein on the maturation of iDCs in NK-DC-co-culture experiments and analyzed the expression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD86. As expected co-cultivation of monocyte-derived iDCs with NK cells induced enhanced expression of CD86 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003377-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). In this setting the up-regulation of CD86 was reduced in the presence of soluble recombinant BAT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003377-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>) indicating that BAT3 has a substantial impact on the NK cell-mediated iDC-maturation.</p><p>The effect of recombinant BAT3 on NK cell cytotoxicity has not been addressed so far. Therefore we performed europium release assays using NK cells either pre-stimulated with soluble or with immobilized recombinant BAT3. We observed that NK-dependent lysis of Raji cells was inhibited when NK cells were stimulated with purified soluble HisBAT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003377-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). Similar inhibition was achieved upon blocking the NKp30 receptor with a masking monoclonal antibody. The control protein (HisBB4) did not alter NK cell cytotoxicity.

On the other hand, we observed that immobilized BAT3 had an opposite effect enhancing the cytotoxicity of NK cells against the target cells compared to the control protein HisBB4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003377-g002">Fig. 2F</xref>). This data confirm previous results indicating that recombinant BAT3 in a soluble form inhibits cytokine secretion of NK cells, whereas immobilized BAT3 activates TNF-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b3; release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003377-PoggevonStrandmann1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Taken together, it was demonstrated that the NKp30-mediated DC-killing and DC maturation is at least partly dependent on BAT3.</p><p>To assess the underlying mechanisms of BAT3 on NK cell function as an inhibitor in soluble form and an activator when immobilized, we directly tested whether BAT3 is secreted in a complex structure such as exosomes.

A specific immunostaining for BAT3 was detectable indicating that the exosomes expressed BAT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003377-g003">Fig 3A, right panel</xref>). This was confirmed by Western blot analysis of exosomes secreted from tumor cells and from iDCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003377-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Moreover, sucrose gradient analysis was performed proving that BAT3 was associated with membrane vesicles (data not shown). The analysis of several control proteins revealed a differential expression for Hsp70, Lamp2 and CD9 between exosomes derived from tumor cells versus iDC-derived exosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003377-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0003377-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003377.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Bio-chemical characterization of the released BAT3.</title><p>(A) Detection of BAT3 expression on exosomes by electron microscopy {left panel: gold antibody control (140000&#x000d7;) and right panel: exosomes stained with anti-BAT3 antibody (140000&#x000d7;)}.

Positive staining for Hsp70 and Lamp-2 on 293T-derived exosomes revealed the purity of exosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003377-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). Ligands for the NKG2D receptor were not detectable using NKG2D-Ig staining (not shown), suggesting that NKG2D engagement is independent of exosomes derived from 293T cells.</p><p>We then used BAT3-overexpressing 293T cells to directly prove the binding of NKp30 to BAT3 on the exosomal surface. As determined by flow-cytometry, exosomes derived from BAT3-transfected 293T cells express high levels of BAT3 on their surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003377-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>). Purified exosomes were stained with Ig fusion proteins (human-Ig, CD30-Ig, NKp46-Ig and NKp30-Ig). The binding of NKp30-Ig to BAT3 on exosomes was specific and not observed for human-Ig and CD30-Ig (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003377-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>). These experiments suggest that exosomal BAT3 acts as a membrane associated molecule which is presented to NKp30. Interestingly, recognition of so far unknown ligands for NKp46 was detectable using NKp46-Ig. A coordinated expression of ligands for different NCRs on exosomes may explain the cross-stimulation of NCRs in response to selective activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003377-Bryceson2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003377-Augugliaro1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Staining of iDC-derived exosomes with human Ig constructs was not feasible since Fc-receptors are present on exosomes derived from human dendritic cells.</p><p>Next we analyzed whether extracellular BAT3 was detectable in a physical association with Hsp70. The interaction of BAT3 and Hsp70 was so far only analyzed with respect to the intracellular regulation of apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003377-Thress1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, although it is known that Hsp70 is involved in the regulation of immune cells in its extracellular, exosomal form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003377-Gastpar1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003377-Gehrmann1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Extracellular BAT3 was precipitated from tumor-cell-derived supernatant upon a non-lethal heat shock using antibodies either binding BAT3 or Hsp70 suggesting that there is a BAT3/Hsp70 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003377-g003">Fig. 3F</xref>). Thus, the association of BAT3 and Hsp70 suggests that both factors are associated with exosomes and may act in combination to activate NK cells. It is known that heat shock does not influence the exosomal secretory rate, but it significantly enhances the Hsp70 content of exosomes isolated from cell supernatant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003377-Lancaster1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Since the exosomal BAT3-expression is also induced in response to heat shock, both factors might act as intracellular danger sensors in a coordinative manner.</p><p>We subsequently investigated the biological role of BAT3 surface-positive exosomes for NK cell activation. Exosomes with different BAT3 expressions levels were obtained from wildtype 293T cells (wt), upon BAT3-overexpression (BAT3) or siRNA-mediated down regulation (si-B) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003377-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). NK cells were stimulated with these exosomes and the supernatant was collected for TNF-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b3; ELISA. Wild-type exosomes clearly stimulated the release of the inflammatory cytokines, and as expected, the cytokine release was even increased in response to BAT3- overexpressing exosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003377-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). Interestingly, NK cells treated with BAT3-depleted exosomes failed to produce TNF-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b3;, whereas a robust release was observed with control exosomes (si-c) derived from control si-RNA transfected cells. Analogous results were obtained with iDC-derived exosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003377-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). Exosomes were purified from untreated iDCs or from heat shock treated iDCs to increase the expression level of BAT3 in the supernatant. The release of TNF-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b3; was in fact stronger in response to heat shock treated exosomes and observed in both allogenic and autologous settings. Thus, the biological activity of exosomes correlated directly with the BAT3 expression level indicating that BAT3 is crucial for the exosomal-dependent activation of NK cells.</p><fig id="pone-0003377-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003377.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Exosomal BAT3 regulates NK cell-function.</title><p>(A) Western Blot to detect BAT3 in exosomal fractions upon over expression and depletion.

It was shown that BAT3 acts as a dendritic cell- associated ligand providing an explanation how and when BAT3 - a intracellular protein - is secreted and engages the NKp30 receptor on effector cells. This is based on the following findings: (i) iDCs and tumor cells release BAT3 surface-positive exosomes; (ii) exosomes release was induced by moderate heat shock and correlated with an increase of BAT3 mRNA level; (iii) iDC-derived BAT3 positive exosomes induce cytokine secretion and (iv) BAT3 is critically involved in NK cell-dependent maturation and killing of iDCs. The association of extracellular BAT3 with exosomes suggests that BAT3 activates NK cells in combination with &#x0201c;co-factors&#x0201d; engaging receptors distinct from NKp30. This is further supported by the observation that BAT3-mediated NK cell activation cannot be completely blocked using masking NKp30 antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003377-PoggevonStrandmann1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. It is also known that several triggering NK receptors are activated in a coordinative manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003377-Augugliaro1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Confirming this model it was shown recently that Hsp70 surface-positive exosomes and inducible NKG2D ligands expressed on tumor cells synergistically promote the activation of mouse NK cells resulting in a reduced in vivo tumor growth and progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003377-Elsner1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>One pathway that induces the expression of NKG2D ligands is the p53-mediated DNA damage response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003377-Gasser1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003377-Gasser2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.

Further experiments will elucidate whether BAT3 is the key component linking the nuclear DNA damage response to the immune system via the release of immune-stimulatory exosomes.</p><p>The exosomal release of danger signals that alert NK cells may be considered as a priming signal and is in favour with a two-step activation model of human NK cells involving a priming and a triggering event. The NK cell activation via extracellular factors may thus result in yet unappreciated bystander effects exerted by NK cells.
