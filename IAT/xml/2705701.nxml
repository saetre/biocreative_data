In situ hybridization analyses revealed that both mRNA species were highly concentrated in the geniculorecipient layers IVA and IVC, where they were coexpressed in the same neurons. Monocular inactivation by tetrodotoxin injection resulted in a strong and rapid (&#x0003c;3 h) downregulation of these mRNAs, suggesting the retinal activity dependency of their expression. Consistent with the high expression level in V1, clear modulatory effects of 5-HT1B and 5-HT2A receptor agonists on the responses of V1 neurons were observed in in vivo electrophysiological experiments. The modulatory effect of the 5-HT1B agonist was dependent on the firing rate of the recorded neurons: The effect tended to be facilitative for neurons with a high firing rate, and suppressive for those with a low firing rate. The 5-HT2A agonist showed opposite effects. These results suggest that this serotonergic system controls the visual response in V1 for optimization of information processing toward the incoming visual inputs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>5-HT</kwd><kwd>activity-dependent</kwd><kwd>area-specific</kwd><kwd>monocular deprivation</kwd><kwd>primate</kwd><kwd>visual cortex</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Primates have highly complex cerebral cortices compared with other mammals. One characteristic feature of the primate cortex is the highly developed visual system. For example, at least 32 visual areas have been distinguished in the neocortex of primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Felleman and Van Essen 1991</xref>). Among the visual areas, V1 (primary visual area) is considered to be one of the earliest functional subdivisions that existed in the cortex of the ancestral mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Northcutt and Kaas 1995</xref>). During the course of evolution, however, there appear to have emerged considerable differences in the functional architecture and intracortical connectivity of V1 across species (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zarrinpar and Callaway 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Van Hooser 2007</xref>). The monkey V1 also has come to exhibit a highly laminated structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lund 1988</xref>), which reflects the structural separation of the different types of visual information (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sincich and Horton 2005</xref>). In our previous study, we identified <italic>occ1/frp</italic> mRNA as a molecule that is highly enriched in the macaque V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tochitani et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yamamori and Rockland 2006</xref>). Interestingly, the area-specific expression patterns of the <italic>occ1</italic> mRNA were observed in macaques and marmosets but not in the other species examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takahata et al. 2006</xref>). On the basis of the existence of such a gene, we hypothesized that there may be a set of genes that contribute to the structural and functional specializations of the primate visual system. If such genes do exist, the identification and characterization of their functions in V1 will markedly contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms of primate vision.</p><p>To examine this possibility, we first carried out a new round of screening in search of genes with V1-enriched expression among macaque neocortical areas and found that the 5-HT (5-hydroxytryptamine, serotonin) 1B receptor mRNA is highly enriched in V1. In addition, we also found that the 5-HT2A receptor mRNA exhibits an area/lamina pattern very similar to that of the 5-HT1B receptor mRNA at the V1/V2 border, which is consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burnet et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lop&#x000e9;z-Gim&#x000e9;nez et al. 2001</xref>). 5-HT1B and 5-HT2A receptors belong to G-protein&#x02013;coupled receptors and activate a cascade of intracellular signaling events (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baumgarten and Gothert 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnes and Sharp 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sari 2004</xref>). They are involved in neuropsychiatric disorders, as well as in a wide variety of physiological functions in different systems. The 5-HT1B receptor, in particular, has been reported to modulate neurotransmission in various pathways, such as the retinocollicular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mooney et al. 1994</xref>), retino-suprachiasmic nuclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pickard et al. 1999</xref>), and thalamocortical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Laurent et al. 2002</xref>) pathways. The monkey V1 is densely innervated by serotonergic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Lima et al. 1988</xref>) and possesses abundant 5-HT radioligand binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rakic et al. 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Parkinson et al. 1989</xref>). Considering the enhanced expressions of 5-HT1B and 5-HT2A receptor genes in V1, it is likely that the two 5-HT receptors play important roles in modulating neurotransmission in V1.</p><p>The macaque V1 has been an excellent model system for studying the functional organization of the primate cortex, in which stimulus-evoked responses can be manipulated by controlling external stimuli. A wealth of information on the basic electrophysiological properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hubel and Wiesel 1977</xref>) and anatomical circuitry of V1 neurons is available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lund 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Callaway 1998</xref>) and accumulating to date. Supported by these previous studies, we wanted to understand the functional meaning of V1-specific expression of the two 5-HT receptor genes. First, we wanted to determine what anatomical structures are associated with the expressions of the 5-HT1B and 5-HT2A receptor mRNAs. Results of the in situ hybridization (ISH) study showed that these mRNAs are highly enriched in the excitatory neurons in geniculorecipient layers IVA and IVC. Interestingly, we found that activity-driven regulation plays a key role in this lamina specificity, as is found for cytochrome oxidase (CO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wong-Riley 1994</xref>) or <italic>occ1</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tochitani et al. 2001</xref>) expressions. Second, we wanted to determine the functional significance of this enriched expression using electrophysiological and pharmacological techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sato et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ozeki et al. 2004</xref>). Here, we provide evidence that 5-HT1B and 5-HT2A receptor agonists modulate neuronal responses in V1. Altogether, our results suggest the importance of the serotonergic system in modulating the behavior of V1 neurons, and that the V1-enriched expression of the two 5-HT receptor genes should provide a basis for the functional specialization of the primate V1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Anatomy</title><sec><title>Experimental Animals</title><p>For restriction landmark cDNA scanning (RLCS) and semiquantitative reverse transcription&#x02013;PCR (RT-PCR) analysis, postmortem brain tissues of African green monkeys (<italic>Cercopithecus aethiops</italic>) were obtained from the Japan Poliomyelitis Research Institute, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tochitani et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Watakabe et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Komatsu et al. 2005</xref>). For ISH experiments, the brains of 8 adult macaques, 7 Japanese monkeys (<italic>Macaca fuscata</italic>) and 1 crab-eating monkey (<italic>Macaca fascicularis</italic>), were used. These monkeys were perfused through the hearts with 4% paraformaldehyde under anesthesia, and thus considered to be a minimum postmortem period before tissue fixation. Monocular inactivation for 21 days was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tochitani et al. 2001</xref>). Four nontreated monkeys were used for ISH experiments and 4 monkeys were used for tetrodotoxin injection; 1 monkey for each experiment of 21 days, 1 day, 6 and 3 h monocular inactivation. Part of sections from the same monkey brains (2 nontreated monkeys and one with tetrodotoxin injection for 21 days) used in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tochitani et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takahata et al. 2006</xref>) was used.

The 4 cDNA samples were electrophoresed simultaneously in a single run and the patterns of spots were compared visually by 3 independent persons. Five candidates were chosen for gene identification and RT-PCR analyses. One spot, which we identified as the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region (UTR) of 5-HT1B receptor gene (see below for detail), showed the largest area differences among the 5 spots and used for subsequent analyses. Detailed description of the method and the genes obtained by this screening will be published elsewhere (Y. K. and T. Y., unpublished data).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Identification and confirmation of 5-HT1B receptor as V1-specific gene.

All the positive clones obtained by this screening matched the human genome sequence downstream of the 5-HT1B receptor gene locus. The longest clone, RC15i, contained the sequence spanning position 2764&#x02013;4260 (coding sequence [CDS] = pos. 1&#x02013;1173). Because 5-HT1B receptor mRNA is longer than 28S ribosomal RNA (4.7 kb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jin et al. 1992</xref>), it was likely that the RLCS spot corresponds to the 5-HT1B receptor. Therefore, we conducted semiquantitative RT-PCR using the primer sets within the cDNA retrieved from the RLCS gel (data not shown) and within the coding sequence for the 5-HT1B receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>). RT-PCR with both primers showed the same visual area&#x02013;specific pattern. Furthermore, ISH was carried out using 3 nonoverlapping probes: RC15i, containing the putative 3&#x02032;-UTR region (pos. 2764&#x02013;4260), the coding sequence of the 5-HT1B receptor gene (pos. 150&#x02013;571), and a different region of the coding sequence with 3&#x02032;-UTR (pos. 616&#x02013;1599). All 3 probes showed the same ISH patterns (data not shown). From these results, we concluded that this spot identified by the RLCS analysis is the product of the 5-HT1B receptor gene.</p></sec><sec><title>Monocular Inactivation</title><p>Monocular inactivation for shorter time periods (3&#x02013;24 h) was performed with slight modification in anesthesia as follows. Briefly, monkeys were anesthetized with ketamine (6 mg/kg) and medetomidine (0.25 mg/kg) by intramuscular injection (i.m.). Tetrodotoxin (15 &#x003bc;g dissolved in 10 &#x003bc;L of saline) was injected manually into the vitreous cavity of the left eye using a Hamilton syringe over 5 min and the syringe was left in position for further 15 min. After injection, the loss of the pupillary reflex in the injected eye was confirmed. The effect of medetomidine was then reversed by intramuscular injection of atipamezole (1.25 mg/kg). The reversal effect was very quick and the monkey was almost fully recovered after 10 min of atipamezole injection, suggesting that the effect of ketamine had been already gone at that time point. After 2.5 h of atipamezole injection (approximately 3 h after tetrodotoxin injection), the monkey was administered with ketamine (6 mg/kg, i.m.) followed by an overdose of Nembutal (at least 100 mg/kg body weight) and perfused intracardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4).</p></sec><sec><title>In Situ Hybridization</title><p>The probes used in the ISH experiments were cloned by RT-PCR using RNA from a rhesus monkey (Supporting <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bhn219/DC1">Table S1</ext-link>). For the 5-HT1B receptor, we prepared the 3 different probes described above and used either mixed or separately. We also conducted ISH for the sense probes of each gene to confirm the specificity of hybridization (data not shown).</p><p>The tissue sections were made on freezing microtome (15-&#x003bc;m thickness for double ISH, and 35- to 40-&#x003bc;m thickness for single ISH and histochemical staining). CO staining was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wong-Riley 1994</xref>). ISH was carried out as described previously with minor modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tochitani et al. 2001</xref>). Free-floating sections were treated with 10 &#x003bc;g/mL proteinase K for 30 min at 37 &#x000b0;C. After acetylation, the sections were incubated in a hybridization buffer containing 0.5&#x02013;1.0 &#x003bc;g/mL digoxigenin (DIG)&#x02013;labeled probes at 60 &#x000b0;C. Hybridized sections were first washed in 2&#x000d7; SSC/50% formamide/0.1% <italic>N</italic>-lauroylsarcosine at 50 &#x000b0;C and treated with RNase A.

The animals were anesthetized with ketamine (10 mg/kg, i.m.) followed by a mixture of isoflurane (2.5&#x02013;3.5%) and N<sub>2</sub>O&#x02013;O<sub>2</sub> (2:1). The trachea of each animal was intubated and a catheter was placed in the femoral vein. The animals were then placed in a stereotaxic head holder, continuously paralyzed with pancuronium bromide (0.1 mg/kg/h, i.v.) to minimize eye movements, and maintained under artificial ventilation. During the recording of neuronal activity, isoflurane dose was reduced to 0.3&#x02013;0.7% in N<sub>2</sub>O:O<sub>2</sub> (2:1), and fentanyl citrate (Fentanest, Sankyo, Tokyo, Japan; 10 &#x003bc;g/kg/h, i.v.) and droperidol (Droleptan, Sankyo, Tokyo, Japan; 125 &#x003bc;g/kg/h, i.v.) were continuously infused. This treatment induced a state of neuroleptoanalgesia in the animals. It enabled us to record visual responses of nearly normal cortical activity and minimized the effect on mRNA expression which is regulated in an activity-dependent manner. Only when the heart rate of the animals exceeded more than 200 beats per min, sodium pentobarbital (2&#x02013;5 mg/kg/h, i.v.) was also added to the infusion solution. A local anesthetic, lidocaine, was administered at pressure points and around surgical incisions. Rectal temperature and the end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> level were adjusted to 37&#x02013;38 &#x000b0;C and 3.5&#x02013;4%, respectively. All electrophysiological procedures were carried out in accordance with the guidelines for animal experiments of the Osaka University School of Medicine, Japan and the National Institute of Health, USA.</p></sec><sec><title>Microiontophoresis</title><p>Drugs were administered iontophoretically via multibarreled glass electrodes attached to a recording pipette.

No cells showed changes in spike size and firing frequency during the iontophoretic administration of the Ringer's solution. We recorded neuronal responses to stimulation with sinusoidal-grating patch with optimal stimulus parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akasaki et al. 2002</xref>). Peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) of spike responses were constructed during 6&#x02013;10 times of stimulus presentations before (control condition), during (drug condition) and after (recovery condition) the drug administration. Only neurons whose response level was recovered to the control level after cessation of drug administration (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05, Mann&#x02013;Whitney's <italic>U</italic> test) were included in our results. In further analysis, the responses in the control and recovery conditions were averaged and, then, the average was compared with the responses during drug administration by Mann&#x02013;Whitney's <italic>U</italic> test. Statistically significant increment and decrement of responses were classified as response facilitation and suppression, respectively. The recording pipette was filled with 0.5 M sodium acetate containing 4% Pontamine Sky Blue. At the end of each penetration, dye marks were produced by passing tip-negative DC current (intensity: 8&#x02013;10 &#x003bc;A, duration: 1 s at 0.5 Hz, 100 pulses) and recovered in histological sections (see below). After recording, the animals were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, i.v.) and perfused transcardially with buffered saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in saline. Thin cortical sections were sliced at 60-&#x003bc;m thickness in the parasagittal plane and stained with cresyl violet, and the locations of the recorded sites were identified by microscopic observations. In 1 case, the cortical sections obtained from 1 of the experimental monkeys were used to perform ISH of 5-HT1B and 5-HT2A genes, which showed that their mRNAs were not significantly downregulated during the recording periods.</p></sec><sec><title>Visual Stimulation</title><p>When a neuron was encountered to respond to visual stimuli, the positions and sizes of the receptive fields of the recorded cells were manually plotted using a hand-held projector on a tangent screen placed 57 cm in front of the eyes of the animal. Subsequently, the receptive field properties, such as dominant eye, optimal orientation and direction of stimulus, spatial frequency, ON/OFF characteristics with respect to a stationary flashed bar, and tuning to stimulus length and velocity were assessed with the hand-held projector. Then a computer-generated visual stimulus was presented on a CRT monitor (CPD-G500J, SONY; Tokyo, Japan; mean luminance 40 cd/m<sup>2</sup>; screen size, 40 &#x000d7; 30 cm<sup>2</sup>; resolution, 1024 &#x000d7; 768 pixels; and refresh rate, 100 Hz), which was placed 57 cm from the animal. The visual stimuli were generated by a visual stimulation system VSG 2/3 (Cambridge Research System, Rochester, UK) and controlled by an IBM-PC/AT compatible computer using custom-made software. The visual stimulus consisted of a drifting circular grating patch with optimal orientation, spatial frequency, and velocity, which covered a cell's receptive field. The effects of drugs were tested for either the visual responses or spontaneous firings. Each stimulus was drifted for 2 s and interleaved for 1 s with a blank screen of the same mean luminance (40 cd/m<sup>2</sup>) as that of the gratings. Either complex or simple cell was classified according to the ratio of the first harmonic (F1) to the mean (F0) of the response to a drifting grating stimulus (F1/F0 &#x0003e; 1, simple cell; F1/F0 &#x0003c; 1, complex cell) (Skottun et al. 1991).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of 5-HT1B Receptor as V1-Specific Gene</title><p>To screen area-specific molecules systematically in the monkey neocortex, we carried out a new round of screening by the RLCS method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Suzuki et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shintani et al. 2004</xref>). In this analysis, mRNAs were purified from 4 distinct cortical areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>), converted to cDNA by reverse transcription and digested with a pair of restriction enzymes for 2-dimensional analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>). Among the spots that showed area difference, we cloned a gene that is specifically expressed in the visual area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>), which turned out to be the 5-HT1B receptor gene (see Materials and Methods). Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis using primers for the coding sequence of the 5-HT1B receptor gene confirmed its specific expression in the visual area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>C</italic>).</p><p>To examine the distribution of 5-HT1B receptor mRNA in the monkey brain in more detail, we carried out ISH analyses. The expression was strikingly high in V1 and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>C</italic>,<italic>E</italic>). Because the mRNA expression was low in the extrastriate cortex, the abrupt change in the intensity of mRNA staining was observed at the border between V1 and V2 (Fig. <italic>2F</italic>). Within V1, the expression of 5-HT1B receptor mRNA was mostly confined to layers IVA and IVC, the major geniculocortical input layers, and was particularly strong in the lower part of layer IVCbeta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>H</italic>). In addition, the expression was also observed at lower intensity in layers II/III and VI of V1, which also receive geniculocortical inputs to a lesser extent. In the LGN, the strong mRNA expression was observed in all 6 layers, and there was no significant difference in staining intensity between the magnocellular and parvocellular layers (Supporting <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bhn219/DC1">Figs S1 and S3</ext-link>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>ISH analysis of 5-HT1B receptor mRNA.

There were also expressions at lower levels throughout the neocortex. The expression was generally restricted to the upper layers. In addition, in the motor and insular cortices, layer 5 pyramidal neurons also expressed 5-HT1B receptor mRNA at a low level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>, M1 and IPro).

reported to be nonfunctional in humans, are shown. Although we also tested the 5-HT5A receptor gene, we observed a high background and did not obtain specific hybridization signals. For 5-HT2B and 5-HT3B receptor genes, no specific hybridization signals were observed in the sections tested. For the other receptors, we observed specific hybridization signals in certain brain regions. The intensities described here were rated from the relative intensity of the signals and were determined on the basis of the following criteria: &#x02212;, not detected at more than the background level; +/&#x02212;, expression was observed but close to detection limit; +, ++, and +++; distinct expression with different intensities. We often observed ISH signals in sparsely scattered cells (denoted as S). For 5-HT1B and 5-HT2A receptor mRNAs, to represent their very high specificity for layer IVCbeta, ++++ was used.

To check this point directly, we performed fluorescence double ISH of 5-HT1B and 5-HT2A receptor genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). This experiment revealed that these genes are strongly expressed in geniculorecipient layers IVA and IVC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>B</italic>). 5-HT1B receptor mRNA was mostly confined to these layers, whereas 5-HT2A receptor mRNA was more widely distributed across layers.

We found that the vast majority of the neurons that expressed 5-HT1B or 5-HT2A receptor mRNAs were the VGluT1 mRNA-positive excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>, supporting <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bhn219/DC1">Table S2</ext-link>), whereas a small population of 5-HT mRNA-positive neurons were VGluT1-negative inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>, white arrows).</p><p>Next, we examined the percentages of VGluT1-positive neurons that coexpress 5-HT1B or 5-HT2A receptor mRNAs for each layer.

In layers II, III, V, and VI, 5-HT1B receptor mRNA was expressed in less than 5% of the excitatory neurons.</p><p>Compared with the 5-HT1B receptor mRNA, the 5-HT2A receptor mRNA was more widely expressed across layers. In layer IVC, the 5-HT2A receptor mRNA was expressed in approximately 80% of the excitatory neurons, which ratio is similar to the 5-HT1B mRNA.

The mRNA level per cell also appeared to be decreased in these layers. Thus, the layer IVC&#x02013;enriched expression of the 5-HT2A receptor mRNA is considered to be due to the higher proportion of positive cells and the high level of mRNA expression within each cell. 5-HT2A receptor ISH signals were barely detectable in the excitatory neurons in layer VI.</p><p>5HT1B and 5HT2A receptor mRNAs were also detected in GAD67 mRNA-positive inhibitory neurons (Supporting <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bhn219/DC1">Fig. S2</ext-link>).

To directly test this, we injected tetrodotoxin into 1 eye of a monkey to deprive retinal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wong-Riley 1994</xref>) and examined whether the mRNA expressions of the two 5-HT receptors are affected. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> shows, monocular inactivation caused a marked change in the expression of the two 5-HT receptor mRNAs. After 21 days of monocular inactivation, the expressions of both 5-HT1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>C</italic>) and 5-HT2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>D</italic>) receptor mRNAs were strongly downregulated in the column in layer IV that corresponded to the inactivated eye in a similar manner to that observed in CO staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wong-Riley 1994</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>A</italic>) or in the <italic>occ1</italic> mRNA distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>B</italic>).

Eight neurons showed suppressive effect of CP93129, whereas the remaining 12 neurons, no effect. To confirm that the effect of CP93129 is receptor-mediated, we coadministered the 5-HT1B receptor-specific antagonist SB216641. SB216641 antagonized the effects of CP93129 in all the 5 neurons tested, including both facilitated and suppressed neurons (data not shown).</p><p>Although CP93129 showed both facilitative and suppressive effects, we noted that all the neurons, except for 1 that were suppressed by the 5-HT1B agonist had small response magnitude. The part of the graph corresponding to the response magnitude less than 50 spikes/s (shown with a dotted line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>A</italic>) was enlarged in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref><italic>B</italic>. In this graph, all the neurons suppressed by CP93129 exhibited firing rates lower than 13 spikes/s. To examine whether the incidence of each type of response modulation depends on the difference of firing rate of neurons, we classified neurons showing significant response modulation into 2 groups according to firing rate, either higher or lower than 13 spikes/s, and performed Fisher's exact test. However, the difference was not at statistically significant level (<italic>P</italic> = 0.098) in spite of the high incidence of suppressed neurons in low firing group, which was owing to 1 neuron that showed high firing rates (an average of 82.5 spikes/s) at control but it showed suppressive modulation. Thus, we speculate that CP93129 mainly facilitated the visual responses of V1 neurons but tended to suppress a population of neurons with low firing rates.</p><p>This raised a possibility that the sign of the modulatory effects of CP93129 is dependent on the neuron's response level. To test this hypothesis, we changed the response magnitude of the recorded neuron by changing contrast of stimuli presented and examined whether CP93129 has differential effects on single neurons with different activity levels. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref><italic>C</italic> depicts the PSTHs that show visual responses of a V1 neuron to a drifting sinusoidal-grating patch at 2 stimulus contrasts of 20% (right) and 100% (left) in 3 drug conditions; control, during iontophoresis of CP93129, and recovery from the drug effect. In this example, CP93129 clearly facilitated the responses at high grating contrast (100%) but suppressed them at low grating contrast (20%). The effects of CP93129 on the stimulus contrast-response relationship was tested for the same neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>D</italic>). This example demonstrates that the activation of 5-HT1B receptors facilitates the responses to high-contrast (&#x02265;30%) stimulation, but is suppressive or ineffective for responses to low-contrast stimulation (&#x02264;20%). Similar response-dependent effects of CP93129 were observed for all the 3 neurons tested, including the one shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref><italic>C</italic>,<italic>D</italic>.</p><p>The firing-rate&#x02013;dependent effects of CP93129 may improve the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N ratio) of activity of V1 neurons. To test this point, we calculated the S/N ratio as the ratio of the number of spikes in the visual response to spontaneous discharge which was added by 1 [S/N = (visual response)/(spontaneous discharge + 1)] because our sample included neurons without spontaneous discharge (0 spikes/s). The S/N ratio was calculated for the 24 neurons which were facilitated by CP93129, and was significantly larger during drug administration than control (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). Thus, our results suggest that the effect of the 5-HT1B receptor agonist is dependent on the response level of each neuron, and that it improves S/N ratio of visual input from the LGN to the cortex.</p><p>Next, we examined the effects of the 5-HT2A agonist, DOI, on visual responses. Results were very intriguing because DOI also exerted bidirectional modulatory effects on the neuron's firing rate, but the sign of response modulation was opposite that of the 5-HT1B receptor agonist CP93129. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref><italic>A</italic>,<italic>B</italic> shows a summary of the modulatory effects of DOI on 44 neurons. Most of the facilitative effects (12/44 cells) were concentrated in neurons that exhibited firing rates lower than 25 spikes/s. On the other hand, suppressive effects (9/44 cells) were more often observed in neurons with firing rates higher than 25 spikes/s. Therefore, to examine the relationship between the incidence of the type of response modulation by DOI and the class of firing rate demarcated at 25 spikes/s, we performed Fisher's exact test and found statistically significant difference among those factors (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). This analysis showed that DOI facilitates visual responses of neurons with a low firing rate but suppresses those of neurons with a high firing rate.</p><p>However, DOI shows an affinity not only for 5-HT2A but also for 5-HT2B/2C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnes and Sharp 1999</xref>). To confirm that the modulatory effect by DOI is mediated by 5-HT2A receptors, we tested the effect of ketanserin, a highly selective antagonist of the 5-HT2A receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnes and Sharp 1999</xref>), on endogenous serotonin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref><italic>C</italic>,<italic>D</italic>). On the basis of the results of DOI, we expected that ketanserin would block the facilitative effect of the endogenous serotonin on neurons with low firing rates. Indeed, the suppressive effect of ketanserin was mostly observed in neurons with firing rates lower than 25 spikes/s. Ketanserin also showed a facilitative effect on 1 neuron with a high firing rate. Thus, we conclude that 5-HT2A receptors show response-dependent modulatory effects, but that its effects are opposite those of 5-HT1B receptors.</p><p>Finally, we show the laminar distributions of the effects of CP93129, DOI and kentanserin (summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). In contrast to the highly layer-specific distribution of 5-HT1B and 5-HT2A receptor mRNAs, we found no difference in drug effect between layer IVC and other layers (Fisher's exact test, CP93129, <italic>P</italic> = 0.60; DOI, <italic>P</italic> = 0.47; ketanserin, <italic>P</italic> = 1.00). Although the numbers of sampled cells are relatively small, the facilitative and suppressive effects of CP93129 and DOI were evenly distributed across layers.</p><table-wrap id="tbl2"

Consistent with this observation, previous radioligand binding studies demonstrate wide-spread distribution of the 5-HT binding sites within the monkey V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rakic et al. 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Parkinson et al. 1989</xref>). Although we do not have our own experimental data, many reports suggest presynaptic localization of 5-HT1B receptor protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mooney et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ghavami et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Riad et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Laurent et al. 2002</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sari 2004</xref> for a review). Especially, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Varn&#x000e4;s et al. (2005)</xref> found a high level mRNA expression of 5-HT1B receptor gene, but very low level receptor binding sites in the LGN of humans, suggesting that the 5-HT1B receptor protein produced in the LGN may be transported to the presynaptic sites in the visual cortex. Similarly, 5-HT1B receptor proteins produced in layers IVA and IVC may well be distributed widely across layers, because the neurons in these layers participate in interlaminar processing, both supra- and infragranular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lund 1988</xref>). However, it is also possible that the accumulation of mRNA is not proportional to that of the protein because additional regulation at the level of translation and turnover rates may be present.</p><p>Compared with the 5-HT1B receptor, 5-HT2A receptor mRNA was detected more widely across layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>B</italic>), which is consistent with the electrophysiological result (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Regarding this point, previous reports suggest postsynaptic localization of the 5-HT2A receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rakic et al. 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">L&#x000f3;p&#x000e9;z-Gim&#x000e9;nez et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miner et al. 2003</xref>). The subcellular localizations of the 5-HT1B and 5-HT2A receptor proteins have an important implication on the differential roles of these receptors in modulating visual processing in the early visual system. Further study is needed to understand the subcellular localization of 5-HT1B receptor proteins and their physiological effects in V1.</p></sec><sec><title>Activity-Dependent and V1-Specific Expression of 5-HT Receptor Genes in Primates</title><p>Although activity-dependency clearly plays an important role in determining the distribution patterns of the 5-HT1B and 5-HT2A receptor mRNAs, &#x0201c;activity&#x0201d; alone is not sufficient to account for their high area/lamina specificity. Many genes under activity-dependent regulation have been reported (e.g.,, GAD67, Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, CAMKs, NRF, zif268; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jones 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benson et al. 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huntsman et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chaudhuri et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tighilet et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nie and Wong-Riley 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al. 2000</xref>). Nevertheless, the expression of these genes is neither lamina nor area specific (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Okuno et al. 1997</xref>). The expression patterns of <italic>occ1</italic>, 5-HT1B, and 5-HT2A receptor genes could be explained if their transcriptions are upregulated only by retinal inputs but not by other factors. We found that both the 5-HT1B and 5-HT2A receptor mRNAs exhibit a very rapid response to the loss of retinal activity, comparable to that of immediate-early genes such as c-<italic>fos</italic> and <italic>zif268</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Knapska and Kaczmarek 2004</xref>). The high turnover rate of the two 5-HT receptors may be appropriate for adjusting the visual cortical functions to change of environment, for example, diurnal rhythm. In addition, however, there may exist cell-type specific gene regulation to achieve such a specific expression in V1.</p><p>The expression patterns of 5-HT1B receptor mRNA reported in this study are quite different from those reported for nonprimate mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boschert et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bruinvels et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonaventure et al. 1998</xref>). We also examined the expressions of 5-HT1B and 5-HT2A receptor mRNAs in marmosets (a New World monkey), ferrets and cats, in addition to rats and mice, and found similar V1 specificity in only marmosets (data not shown). In postmortem human brains, 5-HT1B receptor mRNA is enriched in the middle layers of the occipital cortex (putative visual area) and the upper layers of most other areas, the lamina pattern of which is reminiscent of that in monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Varn&#x000e4;s et al. 2005</xref>). Although the reported area difference in humans does not appear to be so conspicuous compared with that in monkeys, this may be due to a long postmortem period before fixation (&#x0003e;29 h) or to age difference, whereas the processing of monkey samples by trans-cardiac perfusion fixation is very rapid. From these observations, we consider that the activity-dependent expressions of 5-HT1B and 5-HT2A receptor mRNAs in adult geniculorecipient layers may be a characteristic feature of the primate cortex. Further comparative studies would prove this.</p><p>It is intriguing that a set of molecules, <italic>occ1</italic>, 5-HT1B, and 5-HT2A receptor mRNAs show V1-enriched expression and are under similar activity-dependent regulation. It is quite possible that these molecules work cooperatively in the monkey V1 in response to incoming inputs. Although the specific function of the occ1 molecule is yet unknown, this gene belongs to a family of extracellular matrix proteins, some of which are known to affect ocular dominance plasticity in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berardi et al. 2003</xref>). 5-HT1B and 5-HT2A receptors affect synaptic transmission, as we have shown in this paper. In addition, they may also affect synaptic plasticity by regulating downstream signal transduction pathways. For example, 5-HT1B receptors are considered to be negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sari 2004</xref>), whereas 5-HT2A receptors recruit phospholipase C, pertussis toxin&#x02013;sensitive heterotrimeric G(i/o) proteins, and Src signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gonzalez-Maeso et al. 2007</xref>). The enriched expressions of these molecules in response to visual inputs could cause or modulate plasticity in the primate V1.</p></sec><sec><title>Firing-Rate&#x02013;Dependent Effect of 5-HT1B/2A Agonists In Vivo</title><p>The electrophysiological study revealed the complexity of the in vivo effects mediated by the 5-HT1B and 5-HT2A receptors. We found that each receptor can exert both suppressive and facilitative effects, depending on the firing rate of the recorded neurons. Regarding the 5-HT1B receptor, an analogous context-dependent bidirectional modulation has been reported in in vitro preparations of brain slices containing the optic tract and the LGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Seeburg et al. 2004</xref>) or the ventral posteriomedial nucleus of thalamus and the somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Laurent et al. 2002</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Seeburg et al. (2004)</xref> reported that 5-HT1B receptor&#x02013;mediated serotonergic modulation of responses in LGN neurons to stimulation of optic tract is dependent on the temporal frequency of the stimulus. The net effect of the 5-HT1 receptor agonist on retinogeniculate transmission is suppressive for low-frequency inputs, but rather ineffective or facilitative for high-frequency inputs. They suggested that the alleviation of synaptic depression caused by high-frequency stimulation may underlie such effects of the 5-HT1B receptors.</p><p>The effects of the 5-HT2A receptors, on the other hand, should be explained by a different mechanism, because 5-HT2A receptor activation is considered to cause phospholipase C&#x02013;mediated synaptic facilitation by reducing outward potassium current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnes and Sharp 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lambe and Aghajanian 2001</xref>). An activation of 5-HT2A receptor has been known to exert direct facilitative actions on not only pyramidal neurons but also interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araneda and Andrade 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tanaka and North 1993</xref>), by which neighboring pyramidal neurons are indirectly inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sheldon and Aghajanian 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marek and Aghajanian 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhou and Hablitz 1999</xref>). Therefore, serotonin probably has complex influences by controlling the relative activity of excitatory and inhibitory neurons within local circuitry via 5-HT1B and 5-HT2A receptors.</p></sec><sec><title>Physiological Significance of Serotonergic Modulation in Visual System</title><p>Serotonergic fibers that arise from the dorsal and median raphe nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schofield and Everitt 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sladek et al. 1982</xref>) innervate the neocortex including the visual cortex of the primate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morrison et al. 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doty 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Foote and Morrison 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Lima et al. 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wilson and Molliver 1991</xref>) and the cat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jonsson and Kasamatsu 1983</xref>). Raphe nuclei in cats or rats have been shown to change their activity pattern according to the level of behavioral arousal across the sleep&#x02013;wake&#x02013;arousal cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McGinty and Harper 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lydic et al. 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guzman-Marin et al. 2000</xref>). In addition, the 5-HT release in V1 could be regulated locally by 5-HT1B autoreceptors on the presynaptic terminals of the raphe nucleus that innervate V1 (for a review, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sari 2004</xref>) or potentially by the activity from the prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Celada et al. 2001</xref>). The effect of serotonin in the cortex should, thus, depend on the dynamic regulation of the level of serotonin and the receptors.</p><p>Although the enhanced expression of 5-HT1B receptor mRNA in the LGN and V1 suggests its primary role in the visual system, it was also expressed widely in the thalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>, supporting <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bhn219/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>). Weak but significant cortical expression was concentrated in the thalamocortical input layers of the primary sensory (auditory and somatosensory) areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figs 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, supporting <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bhn219/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>). The roles of serotonin in V1 might thus be regarded as an enhancement of a general role of serotonin in the modulation of thalamocortical transmission.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate that the activation of 5-HT1B receptors in V1 generally facilitates visual responses but tends to suppress weak responses. This suggests that, in geniculocortical transmission, nonsychronized spontaneous activity (noise) from the LGN neurons would be reduced by the suppressive effect of 5-HT1B receptors, but the visually evoked synchronized signals would be preserved or efficiently transferred to V1, thus, enhancing the S/N ratio in input&#x02013;output relationship. On the other hand, neurons in the input layers of V1, which abundantly express the 5-HT2A receptor may act as a gain controller by enhancing weak signal response and suppressing excessive response. We therefore suggest that, serotonin release in V1 exerts coordinated modulatory effects through 5-HT1B and 5-HT2A receptors on the V1 neurons. It is therefore possible that the serotonin system has contributed to the evolution of the elaborated function of the primate visual system.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bhn219/DC1">Supplementary material</ext-link> can be found at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cercor.oxfordjournals.org/">http://www.cercor.oxfordjournals.org/</ext-link></p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="bhn219_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="bhn219_cercor-2008-00260-File010_bhn219.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p><funding-source>Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (A) on Priority Areas (A)</funding-source> and (<award-id>17024055</award-id>) to T.Y. and on Priority Areas (17022026) to H.S.; and <funding-source>JSPS grant</funding-source> (<award-id>KAKENHI19500304</award-id> and <award-id>KAKENHI19530656</award-id>) to A.W. and S.
