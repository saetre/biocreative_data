A recombinant plasmid containing human immune interferon (IFN-gamma) cDNA was identified by hybridization of plasmid inserted DNA bound onto nitrocellulose filters with mRNA derived from SEA-induced splenocytes, translation of the eluted RNA in Xenopus laevis oocytes and assaying for IFN activity. Plasmids containing the entire human IFN-gamma cDNA sequence were identified by colony hybridization and were sequenced. A unique coding region was identified which predicted a protein of 166 amino acids, the 20 N-terminal amino acids of which presumably represent a signal peptide. After transfection of monkey cells with plasmid DNA isolated from one of the recombinant clones (pHIIF-SV-gamma 1), IFN was excreted into the culture medium. This IFN was not distinguishable from human IFN-gamma by serological criteria or by cell target species specificity.</p><sec sec-type="scanned-figures"><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00377-0011-a" xlink:role="2491"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00377-0007.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2487"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00377-0008.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2488"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00377-0009.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2489"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00377-0010.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2490"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00377-0011.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2491"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00377-0012.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2492"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00377-0013.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2493"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00377-0014.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2494"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00377-0015.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2495"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00377-0016.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2496"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00377-0017.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2497"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00377-0018.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2498"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00377-0019.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2499"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00377-0020.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2500"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00377-0021.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2501"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
