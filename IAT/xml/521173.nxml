For <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> cells confronting these realities, there appears to be a link between oxidative stress, methionine availability, and the enzyme that catalyzes the final step of methionine biosynthesis, cobalamin-independent methionine synthase (MetE). We found that <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> cells subjected to transient oxidative stress during growth in minimal medium develop a methionine auxotrophy, which can be traced to an effect on MetE. Further experiments demonstrated that the purified enzyme is inactivated by oxidized glutathione (GSSG) at a rate that correlates with protein oxidation. The unique site of oxidation was identified by selectively cleaving N-terminally to each reduced cysteine and analyzing the results by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Stoichiometric glutathionylation of MetE by GSSG occurs at cysteine 645, which is strategically located at the entrance to the active site. Direct evidence of MetE oxidation in vivo was obtained from thiol-trapping experiments in two different <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> strains that contain highly oxidizing cytoplasmic environments. Moreover, MetE is completely oxidized in wild-type <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> treated with the thiol-oxidizing agent diamide; reduced enzyme reappears just prior to the cells resuming normal growth. We argue that for <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> experiencing oxidizing conditions in minimal medium, MetE is readily inactivated, resulting in cellular methionine limitation. Glutathionylation of the protein provides a strategy to modulate in vivo activity of the enzyme while protecting the active site from further damage, in an easily reversible manner. While glutathionylation of proteins is a fairly common mode of redox regulation in eukaryotes, very few proteins in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> are known to be modified in this manner. Our results are complementary to the independent findings of Leichert and Jakob presented in the accompanying paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-Leichert1">Leichert and Jakob 2004</xref>), which provide evidence that MetE is one of the proteins in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> most susceptible to oxidation. In eukaryotes, glutathionylation of key proteins involved in protein synthesis leads to inhibition of translation. Our studies suggest a simpler mechanism is employed by <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> to achieve the same effect.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Under conditions of oxidative stress, methionine auxotrophy in <italic>E. coli</italic> is a result of glutathionylation of the enzyme that catalyzes the final step of methionine biosynthesis (MetE)</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>As a consequence of living in an aerobic world, organisms face the challenge of maintaining a favorable cellular redox status. Oxidative stress is caused by imbalances between the production and disposal of reactive oxygen species, which can damage proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Bacteria encounter reactive oxygen intermediates that are generated as byproducts of aerobic metabolism or during challenge by the immune systems of hosts. Thus, understanding the effects of oxidative stress on the cell, as well as elucidating cellular defense mechanisms, is of considerable interest.</p><p>Over the past several decades, multiple observations in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content> have been reported that collectively suggest a link between oxidative stress, methionine limitation, and the enzyme that catalyzes the final step in methionine biosynthesis, cobalamin-independent methionine synthase (MetE). In <italic>E. coli,</italic> the sulfur of methionine comes from cysteine, which in turn obtains the sulfur group from sulfate via the sulfate assimilation pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020336-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In catalyzing the formation of methionine, MetE lies at the intersection between the methyl cycle and the one-carbon pathway. Several studies involving cellular adaptations to stress conditions have reported unusual expression of MetE under stress conditions. Following the transition from anaerobic to aerobic growth in minimal medium, wild-type <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> cells were found to rapidly induce MetE to a level comprising almost 5&#x00025; of the total cellular protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-Smith1">Smith and Neidhardt 1983</xref>). Similarly, MetE was massively overexpressed in a temperature-sensitive mutant of <italic>groEL</italic>. GroEL is a heat-shock protein that is instrumental in helping to correctly fold cellular proteins. When the <italic>groEL</italic> strain growing in rich medium was shifted to the nonpermissive temperature, MetE was the major soluble protein synthesized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-Horwich1">Horwich et al. 1993</xref>). The additional inability of this strain to grow on minimal medium suggests that MetE may not be correctly functioning in these cells. Furthermore, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Candida albicans</named-content> MetE has been found to be heat and estrogen inducible, and is believed to play an important role in the yeast stress response and virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-Burt1">Burt et al. 1999</xref>). The basis for the overproduction of MetE in all of these experiments has been unclear.</p><p>In addition, several independent researchers have reported an association between stress conditions and methionine limitation in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content>. Early studies found that strains lacking the genes coding for the manganese and iron superoxide dismutases (<italic>sodA</italic> and <italic>sodB,</italic> respectively) were sensitive to oxidative challenge and had an oxygen-dependent growth requirement for the sulfur-containing amino acids cysteine and methionine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-Carlioz1">Carlioz and Touati 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-Benov2">Benov et al. 1996</xref>), which was attributed to leakage of sulfite from the cell. In <italic>trxA grxA</italic> (thioredoxin 1 and glutaredoxin 1) and <italic>grxA grxB grxC gor</italic> (glutaredoxins 1, 2, and 3 and glutathione reductase) strains of <italic>E. coli,</italic> cells required cysteine or methionine for growth, presumably because of oxidative inactivation of 3&#x02032;-phosphoadenylylsulfate (PAPS) reductase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-Russel1">Russel et al. 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-Vlamis-Gardikas1">Vlamis-Gardikas et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-Lillig1">Lillig et al. 2003</xref>). Similarly, the growth of <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> was dramatically slowed following a shift to higher temperature, unless the medium was supplemented with methionine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-Ron1">Ron and Davis 1971</xref>). This heat-induced methionine auxotrophy was traced to temperature sensitivity of homoserine transsuccinylase (MetA), the enzyme that catalyzes the first step in methionine biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-Ron1">Ron and Davis 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-Ron2">Ron and Shani 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-Gur1">Gur et al. 2002</xref>); however, MetE has also been subsequently identified as a thermolabile protein in heat-treated <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-Mogk1">Mogk et al. 1999</xref>). It is intriguing that MetE was a major aggregation-prone protein at a temperature (45 &#x000b0;C) well below the melting temperature of the purified protein (55 &#x000b0;C) (E. Hondorp and R. Matthews, unpublished data). Aerobic heat shock appears to be associated with oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-Benov1">Benov and Fridovich 1995</xref>), suggesting that the aggregation of MetE might relate to oxidative stress, rather than heat per se. Though oxidative stress undoubtedly has multiple effects, taken together, these observations suggest that MetE may be inactivated by biological oxidants, thereby decreasing the production of methionine within the cell.</p><p>Methionine biosynthesis involves several enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020336-g001">Figure 1</xref>); the final step is catalyzed by either cobalamin (B<sub>12</sub>)-independent methionine synthase (the <italic>metE</italic> gene product) or B<sub>12</sub>-dependent methionine synthase (the <italic>metH</italic> gene product). Both enzymes employ a catalytic zinc to transfer a methyl group from methyltetrahydrofolate to <sc>L</sc>-homocysteine to form methionine (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pbio-0020336-e001">equation 1</xref>).</p><p><disp-formula id="pbio-0020336-e001"><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0020336.e001.jpg" position="float" mimetype="image"/></disp-formula></p><p>While mammals have only the MetH homolog, organisms that do not synthesize or transport vitamin B<sub>12</sub> (e.g., yeast, fungi, and plants) use only the B<sub>12</sub>-independent isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-Matthews1">Matthews 1984</xref>). The <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> genome contains both <italic>metE</italic> and <italic>metH</italic> but they are differentially expressed: functional MetH is only expressed in the presence of B<sub>12</sub>, which also serves to repress MetE expression. In the absence of exogenously supplied B<sub>12</sub>, MetE is the sole source of de novo methionine synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-Greene1">Greene 1996</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we investigated the effects of oxidative stress on MetE and methionine availability within the cell. Transient oxidative stress conditions induced by diamide were found to elicit a methionine auxotrophy in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> growing in minimal medium, which was traced to an effect on MetE. In vitro experiments demonstrated that oxidized glutathione (GSSG) reversibly oxidizes MetE at a rate that correlates with enzyme inactivation. GSSG was found to specifically glutathionylate MetE and induce a conformational change. In vivo thiol-trapping experiments provide direct evidence that MetE is readily oxidized in cells experiencing a variety of oxidative stress conditions. Moreover, oxidation of MetE is associated with a cellular dependence upon methionine for growth, suggesting that oxidant-mediated inactivation of MetE may have a profound impact on the stressed cell.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Methionine Becomes Limiting for Growth in Cells Subjected to Oxidative Stress</title><p>Previous observations have suggested a link between oxidative stress and a growth requirement for methionine in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content>. We investigated the duration of growth lags induced by oxidative stress in cells growing in glucose-minimal medium containing or lacking methionine. In the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020336-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020336-g002">2</xref>B, oxidative stress was induced by addition of the thiol oxidant diamide, which rapidly penetrates cells and oxidizes intracellular thiols. Diamide treatment does not kill cells, but results in an abrupt arrest of growth for a length of time that is dependent on the initial concentration of diamide. Cells resume normal growth once the thiol status is restored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-Kosower2">Kosower and Kosower 1995</xref>). <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> cultures logarithmically growing in glucose-minimal medium with and without methionine experienced a lag in growth upon challenge with diamide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020336-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). However, cells grown in medium containing methionine resumed growth significantly faster than those needing to synthesize methionine. Higher diamide concentrations increased the duration of the growth lag and augmented the effect of methionine on resumption of growth.</p><p>The biosynthesis of methionine involves several reactions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020336-g001">Figure 1</xref>). If a step upstream of the reaction catalyzed by MetE were responsible for methionine limitation during diamide treatment, addition of homocysteine to the medium should decrease the growth lag imposed by diamide. No effect of homocysteine addition was seen on the duration of the growth lag in diamide-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020336-g002">Figure 2</xref>B), even though homocysteine can support the growth of cells that lack enzymes upstream of MetE in the biosynthetic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-Urbanowski1">Urbanowski and Stauffer 1989</xref>).</p><p>Similar results were obtained when hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) was used to induce oxidative stress. Addition of methionine to the medium significantly decreased the growth lag produced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020336-g002">Figure 2</xref>C), while homocysteine was ineffective and even amplified the lag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020336-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). The mechanism by which homocysteine appears to have potentiated the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> stress is not known; however, it was clearly not protective. Taken together, the growth experiments suggest that methionine becomes limiting under oxidative stress, and that the bottleneck to de novo biosynthesis of methionine lies in the terminal step catalyzed by MetE.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Inactivation of MetE In Vitro Is Correlated with Cysteine Oxidation</title><p>The methionine auxotrophy observed under oxidative stress conditions could reflect an increased demand for methionine or a decreased rate of de novo synthesis due to inactivation of MetE. To distinguish between these possibilities, we assayed the activity of the purified enzyme upon challenge with GSSG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020336-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Nearly complete loss of methionine synthase activity was observed following addition of GSSG. This process was readily reversible upon incubation with a reductant such as dithiothreitol (DTT) or reduced glutathione (GSH) (data not shown). Activity loss was correlated with thiol oxidation, as assessed by dithio-1,4-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) titration of the trichloroacetic acid (TCA)&#x02013;precipitated protein. GSSG treatment led to thiol oxidation, which proceeded with approximately the same rate constant (0.06 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) as loss of activity (0.07 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>).</p><p>While the rate of thiol oxidation could be measured with DTNB, the absolute number of cysteines oxidized was ambiguous. MetE contains seven cysteines, yet DTNB titration of the fully reduced enzyme gave values between 7.2 and 9.0 cysteines for different protein preparations, and oxidation of MetE led to an average decrease of 1.8 cysteines per mol. Thus it was important to use independent means to determine the number of cysteines oxidized by GSSG.</p><p>Oxidation of MetE by GSSG would be expected to proceed by initial formation of a mixed disulfide between MetE and glutathione (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pbio-0020336-e002">equation 2</xref>).</p><p><disp-formula id="pbio-0020336-e002"><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0020336.e002.jpg" position="float" mimetype="image"/></disp-formula></p><p>An inter- or intramolecular disulfide bond could then be generated by attack on the mixed disulfide by a second cysteine residue. These two possibilities can be distinguished by using mass spectrometry to determine the molecular mass of the oxidized protein. The reduced protein was found to be 84,530 &#x000b1; 6 Da (expected mass, 84,542, &#x02212;0.01&#x00025; deviation), whereas the mass of the protein oxidized by GSSG was 84,835 &#x000b1; 8 Da. The mass difference of 305 &#x000b1; 10 Da between oxidized and reduced MetE is consistent with the addition of a single glutathione adduct (expected mass, 306 Da). Formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond would only decrease the mass by 2 Da, which would not be detected by mass spectrometry in such a large protein.</p><p>To obtain evidence for stoichiometric glutathionylation of MetE, the oxidized protein was reduced with DTT to release the glutathione adduct. The DTT and GSH were separated from the protein using a Microcon concentrator. The filtrate was assayed for GSH using fluorescamine, which reacts with primary amines to form a fluorescent product. The reduced protein did not release GSH (0.0 mol GSH per mol protein) while oxidized protein released 0.9 mol GSH per mol of protein. Thus both mass spectrometry and the fluorescamine assay were consistent with glutathionylation of MetE by GSSG.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>MetE Is Glutathionylated at Cysteine 645</title><p>In order to determine the site of oxidation and verify that an intramolecular disulfide was not being formed concomitant with oxidation, we performed disulfide mapping experiments based on the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-Wu1">Wu and Watson (1997)</xref>. MetE was cyanylated with 1-cyano-4-dimethylamino-pyridinium tetrafluoroborate (CDAP) under denaturing conditions at pH 3, and then cleaved immediately N-terminally to the cyanylated cysteines in 1 N ammonia, resulting in the formation of 2-iminothiazolidine-4-carboxyl (itz) peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020336-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Cleavage will not occur at cysteines that have been protected from cyanylation by oxidation. Following cleavage, any disulfide bonds were reduced with DTT and the resulting peptide fingerprint analyzed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS).</p><p>This approach allows for relatively straightforward mapping of disulfide bonds. The acidic pH employed minimizes the possibility of disulfide bond scrambling. Furthermore, the ability to cleave N-terminally to each cyanylated cysteine allows cleavage between closely spaced, even adjacent, cysteines. These factors provide a significant advantage over traditional methods of peptide mapping, particularly for MetE, which contains cysteines spaced only two residues apart at the active site (cysteines 643 and 645). Moreover, for large proteins, most proteolytic and chemical cleavage methods have the potential to generate numerous peptides, whereas this approach produces a more limited number.</p><p>LC-MS analysis of the cyanylated and cleaved reduced MetE allowed for identification of all but one of the expected peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020336-g005">Figure 5</xref>A; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020336-t001">Table 1</xref>). High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) peaks with masses corresponding to each of the expected peptides were observed, except for the dipeptide itz643&#x02013;644, which is too small to be detected. Cyanylated cysteines can also undergo a &#x003b2;-elimination side reaction instead of cleavage. Susceptibility of cyanylated cysteines to &#x003b2;-elimination depends on the neighboring residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-Wu2">Wu and Watson 1998</xref>). In MetE, cysteine 726 readily formed the &#x003b2;-elimination product <italic>I,</italic> and &#x003b2;-elimination at cysteine 560 produced a small amount of product <italic>H</italic>. Identification of these side products provides additional evidence that cysteines 560 and 726 were reduced and available for cyanylation. Disulfide mapping of a mutant MetE, MetEC&#x0003e;A1&#x02013;4, in which cysteines 323, 353, 516, and 560 were changed to alanines, further confirmed the mass assignments. Only peaks corresponding to cleavage next to the three remaining cysteines (643, 645, and 726) were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020336-g005">Figure 5</xref>B; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020336-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Disulfide mapping data for the oxidized protein following cyanylation, cleavage, and reduction with DTT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020336-g006">Figure 6</xref>A; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020336-t001">Table 1</xref>), were similar to results for the reduced protein, suggesting that most of the cysteines in MetE remained reduced. Peptides <italic>A, B, C, D, E,</italic> and <italic>H</italic> provide evidence that cysteines 323, 353, 516, 560, and 643 were reduced. Peptides <italic>G</italic> and <italic>J</italic> indicate that cysteine 726 was reduced. The pattern is consistent with the initial oxidation occurring at cysteine 645 alone. Peptide <italic>J</italic> is the expected product obtained when MetE is initially oxidized at cysteine 645, with &#x003b2;-elimination at cysteine 726, and is then reduced.</p><p>LC-MS analysis of the oxidized protein fragments prior to DTT reduction yielded an almost identical pattern to that obtained after reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020336-g006">Figure 6</xref>B; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020336-t001">Table 1</xref>). However, a peptide, <italic>K,</italic> corresponding to itz643&#x02013;753 with a glutathione adduct and &#x003b2;-elimination, was observed instead of <italic>J</italic>. It is not possible to distinguish which cysteine, 645 or 726, is glutathionylated and which has undergone &#x003b2;-elimination based simply on the masses of peptides <italic>J</italic> and <italic>K</italic>. However, the presence of peptide <italic>G</italic> in all traces at a level similar to that of reduced MetE indicates that cysteine 726 must be reduced. Moreover, the high susceptibility of cysteine 726 to undergo &#x003b2;-elimination (as evidenced by peak <italic>I</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020336-g005">Figure 5</xref>A)&#x02014;contrasted with the complete lack of a &#x003b2;-elimination product at cysteine 645&#x02014;argues that &#x003b2;-elimination occurs at cysteine 726 in the oxidized enzyme and glutathionylation occurs at cysteine 645.</p><p>In order to confirm that cysteine 645 is the only site of oxidation, the inactivation of various MetE mutants was analyzed. MetEC&#x0003e;A1&#x02013;4 contains only cysteine 645 and the zinc-binding ligands, cysteines 643 and 726; the latter ligands are required for catalytic activity. This mutant has approximately 90&#x00025; of the activity of the native protein, and the kinetics of inactivation by GSSG are nearly identical to that of the wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020336-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). However, mutation of cysteine 645 to alanine (MetEC&#x0003e;A5) dramatically altered the course of inactivation by GSSG. The slow partial loss of activity seen with MetEC&#x0003e;A5 may reflect weakening of zinc binding for the mutant enzyme, allowing glutathione to compete with MetE for zinc.</p><p>Further evidence implicating cysteine 645 as the site of sensitivity to oxidation was obtained by monitoring the oxidation of MetE by diamide. The reaction of diamide with thiols can be followed at 325 nm, where diamide absorbs strongly, but the reduced product does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-Kosower2">Kosower and Kosower 1995</xref>). Addition of MetE to diamide results in a rapid decrease in absorbance at 325 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020336-g007">Figure 7</xref>B). However, MetEC&#x0003e;A5 does not appear to be oxidized by diamide. This observation suggests that diamide oxidation of MetE in vitro involves an initial attack of cysteine 645 on diamide to form an inactive covalent complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020336-g007">Figure 7</xref>C). In the presence of accessible thiols, such as the millimolar concentrations of GSH present in vivo, this complex can then readily react to form glutathionylated MetE and reduced diamide. Thus, although diamide oxidation does not result in glutathionylation of MetE in the absence of glutathione, this experiment demonstrates the extreme reactivity of cysteine 645 to oxidizing agents.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Glutathionylation of MetE Induces a Conformational Change</title><p>In order to further characterize the effects of GSSG oxidation on MetE, the reduced and oxidized forms of the protein were subjected to gel filtration. The elution of glutathionylated MetE was markedly shifted in comparison to that for the reduced protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020336-g008">Figure 8</xref>A). The change in hydrodynamic radius seen upon oxidation suggested that GSSG oxidation had altered the conformation of MetE. Therefore, to confirm a conformational difference between reduced and oxidized MetE, we analyzed the two forms of the protein by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and limited tryptic digestion. The similarity between the CD spectra of oxidized and reduced MetE suggests that the oxidized protein has not undergone a gross structural rearrangement and is still largely intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020336-g008">Figure 8</xref>B). However, the deviation in the two spectra between 210 and 230 nm is consistent with a conformational change upon glutathionylation. Tryptic digestion of oxidized MetE appeared to occur with different kinetics compared to that of the reduced protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020336-g008">Figure 8</xref>C). The oxidized protein was more stable against tryptic digestion than the reduced form, again consistent with a conformational change upon MetE oxidation.</p><p>MetE has previously been shown to be an in vivo substrate of the chaperone GroEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-Houry1">Houry et al. 1999</xref>). Since oxidation of MetE was found to induce a conformational change, we tested whether GroEL bound preferentially to either form of MetE. GroEL and reduced MetE were incubated together and then injected onto a gel filtration column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020336-g008">Figure 8</xref>D). Separate peaks corresponding to GroEL and reduced MetE were observed, indicating that reduced MetE did not associate with GroEL. However, when the glutathionylated protein was incubated with GroEL, only the GroEL peak was observed. The GroEL complex is large enough (approximately 800 kDa) that binding of MetE would not be expected to shift the elution time significantly. Thus, the disappearance of the peak corresponding to oxidized MetE strongly suggests that GroEL specifically binds glutathionylated MetE, leading to coelution.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>The Equilibrium Constant for Glutathionylation of MetE Is Consistent with MetE Oxidation In Vivo</title><p>To gain a better understanding of the thermodynamic sensitivity of MetE to oxidation, we measured the equilibrium constant for formation of the inactive mixed disulfide.

However, in a severely oxidizing environment (greater than &#x02013;150 mV), inactive MetE may accumulate to an appreciable level.

Although GSSG activates Hsp33 via formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond and inactivates MetE by glutathionylation, this suggests that both proteins may have similar sensitivities to oxidation.</p><p>However, these calculations assume that the oxidation state of MetE is in equilibrium with GSH and GSSG. Deviations from theoretical values could occur if MetE were oxidized or reduced in vivo by a mechanism other than simple thiol-disulfide exchange. Comparison of the actual amount of oxidized MetE to measurements of the physiological concentrations of GSH and GSSG could therefore provide an indication of the in vivo mechanism of oxidation. Nevertheless, while MetE inactivation by GSSG may be energetically favorable under oxidizing conditions, the apparently slow kinetics make it difficult to conclude whether or not oxidation actually occurs in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>MetE Is Oxidized In Vivo during Oxidative Stress</title><p>Thus, to determine whether our observations are physiologically relevant, we needed to develop a method whereby the oxidation of MetE could be directly observed in vivo. To this end, thiol-trapping experiments were performed as outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020336-g010">Figure 10</xref>A. Cells growing under normal or oxidative conditions were briefly incubated with iodoacetamide, which is able to quickly penetrate the cell membrane and efficiently alkylate all available reactive thiols. The proteins were precipitated with TCA, and oxidized cysteines were reduced with DTT. The sulfhydryls exposed under these conditions were trapped with iodoacetic acid, which adds a negative charge to the protein for each cysteine trapped. Differently charged forms of the protein were separated by vertical slab isoelectric focusing, and MetE was visualized by immunoblotting. This method of analysis should readily distinguish between glutathionylated MetE (one additional negative charge as compared to reduced MetE) and MetE with an intramolecular disulfide bond (two additional negative charges as compared to reduced MetE). Glutathionylated MetE prepared in vitro is more acidic than fully reduced MetE, as indicated by comparing lanes 4 and 3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020336-g010">Figure 10</xref>B.</p><p>In vivo thiol-trapping experiments were performed with logarithmically growing wild-type and <italic>trxA gor</italic> strains of <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content>.

Cells require the presence of DTT in the medium to grow at rates comparable to wild-type strains; growth rapidly halts when DTT is removed. This strain cannot be grown in minimal medium, where wild-type MetE is expressed, so a <italic>trxB gor</italic> strain containing a plasmid specifying MetE (which expresses MetE independently of the cellular methionine concentration) was grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium containing DTT. Oxidized MetE was observed within 90 min of DTT removal, while MetE was fully reduced in the presence of DTT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020336-g011">Figure 11</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020336-g011">11</xref>B). Again, the shift in the isoelectric point of MetE oxidized in vivo was indistinguishable from that of glutathionylated MetE prepared in vitro.

Identical levels of reduced MetE reappeared within 60 min of the challenge, just prior to the resumption of normal cellular growth. Thus oxidation of MetE is associated with the cellular methionine limitation (described earlier) that is imposed by addition of diamide.

Moreover, oxidation of MetE was directly observed in vivo concomitant with a methionine auxotrophy induced by oxidative stress.</p><p>In general, protein glutathionylation may occur by two different mechanisms. Proteins can undergo thiol-disulfide exchange with GSSG to generate the glutathionylated product (K<sub>mix</sub> equilibrium in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pbio-0020336-e002">equation 2</xref>). Alternatively, either cysteine residues on the protein or the GSH sulfhydryl may be oxidized to a more reactive intermediate, such as a sulfenic acid, followed by formation of the mixed disulfide. In vivo glutathionylation of proteins via thiol-disulfide exchange is dependent on changes in the &#x0005b;GSH&#x0005d;/&#x0005b;GSSG&#x0005d; ratio, while formation of a reactive intermediate would result in glutathionylation independent of the &#x0005b;GSH&#x0005d;/&#x0005b;GSSG&#x0005d; ratio. Alterations in &#x0005b;GSH&#x0005d;/&#x0005b;GSSG&#x0005d; ratios have been associated with increased protein-glutathione mixed disulfides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-Chai1">Chai et al. 1994a</xref>); however, there are also reports of extensive glutathionylation occurring in vivo without a measurable change in GSSG concentration or total glutathione levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-Chai1">Chai et al. 1994a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-Chai2">1994b</xref>). This has been taken as evidence to support a mechanism involving a reactive sulfhydryl intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-Thomas1">Thomas et al. 1995</xref>).</p><p>The ratios of &#x0005b;GSH&#x0005d; to &#x0005b;GSSG&#x0005d; in wild-type (DHB4) and <italic>trxA gor</italic> strains (F&#x000c5;378) growing in LB medium were previously reported to be 223 &#x000b1; 35 and 18 &#x000b1; 7, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-Aslund1">&#x000c5;slund et al. 1999</xref>). Though our experiments were performed with <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> growing in minimal medium, assuming that the &#x0005b;GSH&#x0005d;/&#x0005b;GSSG&#x0005d; ratios are comparable, more than 99&#x00025; of the MetE in the wild-type strain (DHB4) should be reduced. Similarly, based on the equilibrium constant for thiol-disulfide exchange with MetE, only approximately 7&#x00025; of the MetE is expected to be oxidized in the <italic>trxA gor</italic> strain (WP843). Yet 50&#x00025;&#x02013;60&#x00025; of the MetE was found to be oxidized in this strain by thiol-trapping experiments. A &#x0005b;GSH&#x0005d;/&#x0005b;GSSG&#x0005d; ratio of less than 1.4 would be required to accumulate that much oxidized MetE (which corresponds to a redox potential above &#x02013;174 for 5 mM glutathione and above &#x02013;152 mV for 1 mM glutathione). Moreover, in vitro oxidation of MetE by GSSG is rather slow, further suggesting that glutathionylation of MetE via thiol-disulfide exchange is not the primary mechanism functioning in vivo. Rather, the in vitro and in vivo data for MetE are consistent with initial formation of a reactive intermediate followed by glutathionylation of cysteine 645, resulting in enzyme inactivation.</p><p>Our results are complementary to the observations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-Leichert1">Leichert and Jakob (2004)</xref> that MetE is one of the proteins most susceptible to oxidation in a <italic>trxA</italic> strain. Since <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> lacking <italic>trxA</italic> do not experience a substantial amount of cytosolic disulfide bond formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-Prinz1">Prinz et al. 1997</xref>), the appearance of oxidized MetE within this environment delineates the extreme sensitivity of the protein to oxidation. The concurrent presence of oxidized peroxide-detoxifying enzymes (alkylhydroperoxide reductase &#x0005b;AhpC&#x0005d; and thioredoxin-linked thiolperoxidase &#x0005b;Tpx&#x0005d;) suggests that endogenously produced reactive oxygen species (e.g., H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) accumulate in the <italic>trxA</italic> strain, since thioredoxin appears to be required to regenerate the reduced thiol status of these proteins. Our preliminary in vitro experiments indicate that glutathionylated MetE is inefficiently reduced by thioredoxin (data not shown), which is not unexpected since glutaredoxins are generally more specific for glutathione-protein adducts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-Potamitou1">Potamitou Fernandes and Holmgren 2004</xref>). Thus, taken together, our study and that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-Leichert1">Leichert and Jakob (2004)</xref> suggest that the oxidation of MetE observed in <italic>trxA</italic> strains is mediated by elevated reactive oxygen species, perhaps due to an overwhelmed glutaredoxin system. Leichert and Jakob also observed significant oxidation of MetE in wild-type cells treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, further supporting the premise that MetE is acutely vulnerable to reactive oxygen species.</p><p>Protein glutathionylation has been suggested to play a protective role in oxidative stress. Studies with purified eukaryotic proteins have shown that incubation with oxidants (e.g., H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) results in irreversible modification, whereas oxidation in the presence of GSH (as would be expected in vivo) yielded reversible glutathionylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-Klatt1">Klatt and Lamas 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-Hamann1">Hamann et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-Mallis1">Mallis et al. 2002</xref>). Similarly, we found that addition of an excess of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to purified MetE appeared to cause irreversible oxidation, presumably because of the formation of sulfinic (&#x02013;SO<sub>2</sub>) or sulfonic (&#x02013;SO<sub>3</sub>) acid adducts (data not shown). Thus, glutathionylation of MetE following the formation of a reactive intermediate may serve the dual purpose of modulating enzyme activity while protecting the active site from more extensive damage. Reduction by cellular thioreductases could then readily reactivate the enzyme.</p><p>Our data strongly suggest that glutathionylation is reversible in vivo as well as in vitro. Upon the addition of diamide to cells growing in medium lacking methionine, growth is abruptly halted and cells become limited for methionine. In the experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020336-g011">Figure 11</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020336-g011">11</xref>D, all of the MetE in the cell is oxidized at the 15- and 30-min time points, whereas it is completely reduced after 60 min, just prior to the resumption of growth. Within this time period, the concentration of MetE within the cell does not appear to change, based on the intensity of the band on the immunoblot. In particular, there is no decrease in intensity of the band corresponding to oxidized enzyme between 15 and 30 min, suggesting that MetE is not being degraded. While a lack of change could indicate a balance between new protein synthesis and degradation, we argue that cells that are not growing and are limited for methionine should have a decreased rate of protein synthesis. If new synthesis of MetE were responsible for the reappearance of reduced MetE, all of the oxidized MetE (estimated at 1&#x00025; of the total protein or 60 &#x003bc;M MetE) must be degraded and new protein synthesized to the same level between 30 and 60 min. Thus, although we cannot definitively rule out the possibility that the reappearance of reduced MetE is due to new protein synthesis, we feel that it is far more likely that MetE is re-reduced once the diamide in the cell is dissipated.</p><p>Proteins containing mixed disulfides with glutathione are typically reduced by one of the three glutaredoxin isoforms. The glutaredoxins Grx1 <italic>(grxA)</italic> and Grx3 <italic>(grxC)</italic> are structurally distinct from Grx2 <italic>(grxB),</italic> yet all three proteins are capable of reducing glutathionylated PAPS reductase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-Lillig1">Lillig et al. 2003</xref>). The levels of Grx2 and Grx3 in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> are considerably higher than that of Grx1; however, the three proteins employ different modes of regulation. Grx3 concentrations are relatively constant, whereas OxyR induces Grx1, and levels of Grx2 are growth phase dependent. Grx2 has the highest catalytic activity of the isoforms and has been estimated to contribute up to 80&#x00025; of the total glutaredoxin activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-Potamitou1">Potamitou Fernandes and Holmgren 2004</xref>). Since glutaredoxins catalyze the reduction of proteins with high efficiency and specificity, it will be of interest to determine the precise protein or proteins that are responsible for reduction and reactivation of oxidized MetE in vivo.</p><p>Based on a recent crystal structure of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Thermatoga maritima</named-content> MetE homolog, cysteine 645 is located at the entrance to the active site (R. Pejchal and M. Ludwig, personal communication). This places the sulfhydryl in direct contact with the solvent, where it is accessible to oxidation and reduction. Glutathionylation of cysteine 645 at the entrance to the active site may sterically prevent substrate binding, leading to the observed inactivation of the enzyme. Addition of the glutathione adduct also appears to correlate with a weakened binding of the catalytic zinc to the enzyme (data not shown). The active site of MetE is located in a cleft formed between two domains (R. Pejchal and M. Ludwig, personal communication). Addition of the glutathione tripeptide to cysteine 645 may provide enough bulk to push the two domains apart, giving rise to the observed conformational change and increased hydrodynamic radius. CD spectroscopy indicates that oxidation does not result in gross unfolding of MetE (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020336-g008">Figure 8</xref>B), yet GroEL was found to bind only to the glutathionylated protein, and not to reduced MetE. Separation of the domains upon addition of glutathione could expose hydrophobic surfaces that allow GroEL to recognize and bind to one of the domains, since the holoenzyme (84.5 kDa) is too large to be accommodated within the cavity formed by the GroEL&#x02013;GroES complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-Xu1">Xu et al. 1997</xref>). Earlier observations identified MetE as an in vivo substrate for GroEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-Houry1">Houry et al. 1999</xref>); here, we showed that GroEL specifically binds to the glutathionylated protein. GroEL binding may be required to present the enzyme for reduction, as well as to prevent oxidized enzyme from aggregating. Alternatively, binding to GroEL could target the inactive enzyme for eventual degradation.</p><p>Oxidant-mediated inactivation of MetE may have broad implications for the cell. Initiation of translation in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> requires formylated methionine, and it has been suggested that depletion of methionine and one-carbon pools could block protein translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-Gold1">Gold 1988</xref>). We postulate that the development of methionine auxotrophy via inactivation of MetE may therefore protect stressed cells by slowing the initiation of protein translation. This could safeguard cells from rapid synthesis of peptides under adverse conditions, allowing cellular processes to attend to managing and detoxifying the stress. Interestingly, the conditions that induce a heat shock response in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> also affect the translational capacity of the cell, implicating the rate of protein synthesis in triggering of this stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-VanBogelen1">VanBogelen and Neidhardt 1990</xref>). Studies with rat hepatocytes provide support for a role of protein glutathionylation in the control of protein synthesis under oxidative stress conditions. Upon the addition of <italic>t</italic>-butyl hydroperoxide, rapid inhibition of protein translation was observed, accompanied by an increase in the levels of protein mixed disulfides. It was hypothesized that glutathionylation of key proteins involved in protein synthesis was responsible for the inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-Latour1">Latour et al. 1999</xref>). Furthermore, peroxide stress has been found to result in reversible inhibition of protein synthesis in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-Shenton1">Shenton and Grant 2003</xref>). This effect was irreversible in cells that lack glutathione, suggesting that protein glutathionylation may protect the cellular translational capacity from irreversible damage. Thus, mechanisms for downregulating the rate of protein translation may be employed by a wide spectrum of organisms experiencing oxidative stress.</p><p>The methionine limitation imposed by oxidative stresses could also play a significant role in bacterial quorum sensing. <italic>S</italic>-adenosylmethionine, which is directly formed from methionine, is the precursor to autoinducer AI-2 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020336-g001">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-Chen1">Chen et al. 2002</xref>).

Moreover, a shift in the metabolic activity of the cell is postulated to be responsible for modulation of AI-2 signaling in response to a host of environmental stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-DeLisa2">DeLisa et al. 2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-DeLisa3">2001b</xref>). Aerobiosis, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment, and heat shock were all found to result in decreased AI-2 levels, while addition of DTT or glucose served to increase the accumulation of AI-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020336-DeLisa3">DeLisa et al. 2001b</xref>). Oxidant-mediated inactivation of MetE imposes a methionine limitation, which would then lower the availability of substrate for AI-2 production. Decreased levels of AI-2 in response to methionine-limiting conditions could provide a simple means of communicating the cellular metabolic potential under stress conditions, thereby helping cells to adapt to a non-ideal or even hostile environment.</p><p>In conclusion, we have established that MetE, a highly expressed protein in <italic>E. coli,</italic> is inactivated by glutathionylation of cysteine 645 in vitro.

Briefly, 6.0 g of urea was dissolved in 2.4 ml of 18 M&#x003a9; water, 2.4 ml of 50&#x00025; glycerol, and 1.56 ml of acrylamide solution (28.36&#x00025; acrylamide/1.62&#x00025; bis-acrylamide). 600 &#x003bc;l of ampholytes (pH 4&#x02013;8) and 780 &#x003bc;l of 20&#x00025; Chaps were added, and the resulting solution was degassed for approximately 10 min. 25 &#x003bc;l of 10&#x00025; APS and 20 &#x003bc;l of TEMED were added, and 8 cm &#x000d7; 8 cm &#x000d7; 1.0 cm gels were poured.

Care was taken not to increase the solution temperature above 30 &#x000b0;C to avoid breaking down urea, which could then carbamylate proteins. Aliquots of the sample buffer were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x02013;20 &#x000b0;C.</p><p>An Xcell Surelock Mini-cell gel apparatus from Invitrogen was assembled with the freshly prepared gel, and degassed cathode (upper, 0.1 M sodium hydroxide) and anode (lower, 10 mM phosphoric acid) solutions were added. Samples were diluted at least 10-fold into sample buffer and loaded. Power was applied for 1 h at 100 V followed by 1 h at 200 V and finally 30 min at 500 V.
