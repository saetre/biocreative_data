This is the foundation of the evolutionary theory of senescence. Because of this decrease in negative selection with age, and because of the absence of reproduction after menopause, alleles involved in women's late-onset diseases are generally considered evolutionarily neutral. Recently, genetic and epidemiological data on alleles involved in late onset-diseases have become available. It is therefore timely to estimate selection on these alleles. Here, we estimate selection on <italic>BRCA1</italic> alleles leading to susceptibility to late-onset breast and ovarian cancer. For this, we integrate estimates of the risk of developing a cancer for <italic>BRCA1</italic>-carriers into population genetics frameworks, and calculate selection coefficients on <italic>BRCA1</italic> alleles for different demographic scenarios varying across the extent of human demography. We then explore the magnitude of negative selection on alleles leading to a diverse range of risk patterns, to capture a variety of late-onset diseases. We show that <italic>BRCA1</italic> alleles may have been under significant negative selection during human history. Although the mean age of onset of the disease is long after menopause, variance in age of onset means that there are always enough cases occurring before the end of reproductive life to compromise the selective value of women carrying a susceptibility allele in <italic>BRCA1</italic>. This seems to be the case for an extended range of risk of onset functions varying both in mean and variance. This finding may explain the distribution of <italic>BRCA1</italic> alleles' frequency, and also why alleles for many late-onset diseases, like certain familial forms of cancer, coronary artery diseases and Alzheimer dementia, are typically recent and rare. Finally, we discuss why the two most popular evolutionary theories of aging, mutation accumulation and antagonistic pleiotropy, may underestimate the effect of selection on survival at old ages.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Evolutionary theories of senescence (i.e. the increasing risk of death at older ages) are based on the fact that selection pressures on mortality diminish with age. This is because genes expressed at a specific age only affect individuals which survive to this age, who account for a decreasing proportion of the population as age increases. These theories assume therefore that mutations increasing mortality late in life are either subject: 1) to very small negative selection and can therefore accumulate (mutation accumulation) or 2) to small enough negative selection to be traded-off against higher fertility or survival at young ages (antagonistic pleiotropy). In both cases, deleterious mutations acting at older ages will persist and their cumulative effects on mortality will be responsible for senescence. Theoretical models of these alternatives calculate selection pressures on mortality as a change in fitness relative to a change in mortality at a specific age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001206-Hamilton1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, or over a specific range of ages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001206-Abrams1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001206-Charlesworth1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001206-Charlesworth2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Allele frequency distributions that would result if selection and mutation were in balance for age-specific alleles have also been provided <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001206-Charlesworth1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001206-Steinsaltz1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Genetic research has identified few alleles involved in decreasing human mortality at old ages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001206-Christensen1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> but thousands of deleterious alleles are linked to susceptibility to late-onset diseases. For example, the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man Database (OMIM, see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</ext-link>) records dozens of late-onset diseases linked to genetic susceptibility; sometimes involving a single gene (e.g. Huntington's disease) but often numerous genes (e.g. Alzheimer's). Epidemiological data on the age of onset of such genetic diseases are now available. Surprisingly, no study has used these data to estimate selection against late-acting deleterious mutations. However, this would be informative because, although theoretical models assume a constant change in mortality at a given age or across a window of ages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001206-Hamilton1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001206-Abrams1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001206-Charlesworth2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, genetic diseases show complex patterns of variability in age of onset. Additionally, assessing whether a mutation has been selected against in past human history requires that selection be estimated in realistic demographic scenarios: human demography varies considerably between populations which can affect both the strength of selection and genetic drift.</p><p>Genetic susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer in women arising from a mutation in the <italic>BRCA1</italic> gene is one of the most widespread genetic diseases. Such mutations occur in 1 out of 3000 women in the USA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001206-Claus1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, although frequencies vary considerably among populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001206-Szabo1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Women with a mutation have a 65&#x00025; risk of developing breast cancer before age 70 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001206-Antoniou1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Breast and ovarian cancers linked to mutations in <italic>BRCA1</italic> are therefore likely to have been one of the main genetically-related causes of death in middle-aged women in past populations. <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutations can be therefore regarded as important deleterious mutations involved in old age mortality. It is consequently of interest to estimate selection on <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutations in relevant demographic scenarios for the light it can shed on senescence.</p><p>From the perspective of epidemiological genetics, <italic>BRCA1</italic> is remarkable being highly polymorphic with both rare and frequent alleles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001206-Szabo1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. In 2006, the Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC, see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nhgri.nih.gov/Intramural_">www.nhgri.nih.gov/Intramural_</ext-link> research/Lab_transfer/Bic) recorded more than 1000 alleles involved in a significantly higher susceptibility of carriers to develop a breast or ovarian cancer. Moreover, the frequency distribution of these alleles is highly heterogeneous <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001206-Szabo1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Because the mean age of onset of breast and ovarian cancer is long after menopause <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001206-Antoniou1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, when selection is considered nonexistent, <italic>BRCA1</italic> alleles are generally thought to be selectively neutral. Mutation frequencies have therefore been explained by founder effects and population history <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001206-Szabo1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Some mutations accord well with this explanation: for example the allele 185delAG is found in more than 1&#x00025; of Ashkenazi Jewish women <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001206-Struewing1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. However, prevalence of breast cancer is not only associated with a few frequent mutations resulting from a founder effect, but also with many rare mutations. For example in Italy, most <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutations are at low frequencies and even in most cases recorded in only one family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001206-Szabo1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. More generally, Wright et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001206-Wright1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> highlighted that most alleles involved in genetic diseases including familial forms of cancer (such as breast cancer linked to <italic>BRCA1</italic>), coronary artery diseases and Alzheimer dementia, are recent and rare. These are characteristics of alleles involved in early onset diseases and subject to selection. Despite the fact that these diseases generally act after menopause, we would therefore expect these alleles to show direct or indirect effects on fitness.</p><p>In this paper we aim to determine whether <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutations have been neutral or under negative selection in recent human history. To do this, we incorporate estimates of age of onset of cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001206-Antoniou1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> into a population genetic framework under different demographic scenarios. This is important because selection will depend on the proportion of women surviving at ages at which they are susceptible to develop the disease and the number of offspring produced by these women. To generalize our conclusions to diseases characterized by different patterns of age of onset we also explore the effect of changes in the mean and variance of age of onset on selection. This required that we 1) obtain parameters for the hazard of developing cancers for <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutation carriers; 2) obtain demographic parameters of fertility and survival for the populations considered; 3) determine the mortality hazard of mutation carriers and non-carriers in these populations; and 4) integrate these hazards into a population genetics framework to estimate the magnitude of selection on mutations in <italic>BRCA1</italic>. We outline these steps below (the code in &#x02018;R&#x02019; allowing calculations for steps 1,3 and 4 is provided in the supplementary material entitled <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001206.s001">Code S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Hazard of Developing Cancers for BRCA1 Mutation Carriers</title><p>We described the distribution of the age of onset of cancer for women carrying a <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutation by a cumulative distribution function <italic>F</italic>(<italic>x</italic>), (i.e. the cumulative risk of developing a cancer before age <italic>x</italic>, <italic>p</italic>(<italic>X</italic>&#x02264;<italic>x</italic>)). We used data from a recent meta-analysis of 22 studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001206-Antoniou1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> to obtain the cumulative risk with age <italic>x</italic> of developing breast cancer, <italic>F<sub>b</sub></italic>(<italic>x</italic>), and ovarian cancer <italic>F<sub>o</sub></italic>(<italic>x</italic>), for individuals carrying a <italic>BRCA1</italic>-mutation in a population free of any other causes of death. This risk is an average over all <italic>BRCA1</italic> susceptibility alleles. As the risk of developing a breast or an ovarian cancer increases between age 20 and 49 and then decreases up to age 69 (no data are available after this age, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001206-Antoniou1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>), we modeled the cumulative risks <italic>F<sub>b</sub></italic>(<italic>x</italic>) and <italic>F<sub>o</sub></italic>(<italic>x</italic>) by a 2-parameter cumulative gamma distribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0001206.e001.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> fitted using a non-linear least squares approach from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001206-Antoniou1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. The corresponding hazards over ages <italic>h<sub>b</sub></italic>(<italic>x</italic>) and <italic>h<sub>o</sub></italic>(<italic>x</italic>) were estimated using the identity <italic>h</italic>(<italic>x</italic>)&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;<italic>F</italic>&#x02032;(<italic>x</italic>)/(1&#x02212;<italic>F</italic>(<italic>x</italic>)), where <italic>F</italic>&#x02032;(<italic>x</italic>) is the probability density function obtained as the derivative of the cumulative risk function <italic>F</italic>(<italic>x</italic>). Under the assumption that both risks of developing a breast or an ovarian cancer are independent for mutation carriers, we estimated the hazard <italic>h<sub>bo</sub></italic>(<italic>x</italic>) of developing either breast or ovarian cancer using the competing risks equation <italic>h<sub>bo</sub></italic>(<italic>x</italic>)&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;<italic>h<sub>b</sub></italic>(<italic>x</italic>)&#x0002b;<italic>h<sub>o</sub></italic>(<italic>x</italic>). The corresponding cumulative risk <italic>F<sub>bo</sub></italic>(<italic>x</italic>) is given by the identity and was also fitted by a 2-parameter gamma function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001206-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

As the hazard <italic>h<sub>bo</sub></italic>(<italic>x</italic>) is considerably higher for individuals carrying a mutation than for individuals without a mutation (up to 61 times higher), the risk for carriers of developing a sporadic cancer (i.e. not associated with a mutation) can be considered negligible.

We therefore used females' mortality and fertility estimates for different populations representing relevant demographic scenarios: 1) the population of early Quebec, 17th to 18th century French Canadians &#x0005b;12, pp. 131 and 88&#x0005d;; 2) the Ache, a population of hunter-gatherers from the Amazonian forests of Latin America &#x0005b;13, pp. 196 and 261&#x0005d; and 3) a theoretical stationary population with low life-expectancy and low fertility intended to capture human demography under extremely harsh conditions (Population type West, mortality level 1 and mean age at maternity in absence of death equals 27 years from &#x0005b;14, pp. 8 and 30&#x0005d;). These three demographic scenarios cover a wide range of demographic parameter space for adult survival and fertility. Their attributes can be summarized by two variables: remaining life-expectancy at age 10 of survivors at this age, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0001206.e002.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>; and mean number of daughters born to a woman surviving at age 50, Gross Replacement Rate (<italic>GRR</italic>).

Violation of the assumptions may change the mean and variance of the risk for carriers, but the magnitude of change is unlikely to extend beyond the range explored in our analysis (i.e. 15 years around the mean and a variance spanning from 100 to 800), which is predominantly in the area where selection overcomes drift (i.e. <italic>Ne<sub>min</sub></italic>&#x0003c;1000).</p><p>The Ache population and the modeled population show very similar selective patterns to those presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001206-g003">Figure 3C</xref> (presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001206-g004">Figure 4</xref> for information).

Alternatively, it is known that different mutations lead to different risks of developing cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001206-Risch1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Old alleles, still present at relatively high frequencies, might be characterized by a higher mean age of onset and/or a lower variance and consequently be less negatively selected, facilitating their persistence through drift and migration. Another possibility is that the risk profile associated with alleles may have changed over the course of human history. Epidemiological studies have shown that women's reproductive trajectories (age at menarche and menopause, nulliparity, etc.) and nutrition are associated with variation in breast cancer risk. The interaction between BRCA1 susceptibility alleles and the environment or cultural behavior is still poorly understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001206-Rahman1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> and empirically difficult to access <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001206-Goldstein1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, but inconsistencies between breast and ovarian cancer rates and mutation frequencies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001206-LevyLahad1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>) provide some support for Eaton et al. 's notion that risks of cancer due to genetic susceptibility were lower in pre-industrial populations than in current populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001206-Eaton1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Some susceptibility alleles may have therefore been under lower levels of negative selection in particular past environments, allowing them to reach higher frequencies. Our results are based on an estimation of the cumulative risk of developing cancers, averaged over all <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutations, and we therefore cannot differentiate the magnitude of selection acting on different alleles. Further study could assess if, among these alleles, alleles' frequencies are correlated with a higher mean and/or a lower variance in age of onset. If this prediction proved true, the frequency distribution of alleles could be used (with knowledge of population demographic history) to make predictions about the associated variation in risk of onset (between alleles and/or between environments); and vice versa.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Aging theory</title><sec id="s4b1"><title>What do our results contribute to theories of aging?</title><p>Theoretical models consider that selection pressures on survival at old ages is small (and even null after menopause for women) because survival at these ages no longer affects fitness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001206-Hamilton1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001206-Abrams1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001206-Charlesworth1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001206-Charlesworth2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. We explored a range of parameter space corresponding to a large range of mean and variance in age of onset that might correspond to a variety of late onset diseases. Throughout this range, alleles were subject to considerable negative selection. This is firstly because age of onset of genetic diseases may be very variable, so that young individuals may die of the disease even for diseases with a late average age of onset. It is likely that very few genetic diseases affecting women late in life fail to affect at least some pre-menopausal individuals leading to selection where one might otherwise anticipate none. Secondly, a selection pressure does not indicate whether an allele is significantly selected against within a particular population. For a high enough effective population size, even small negative selection can be sufficient to eliminate an allele. For both reasons, the effect of selection on alleles involved in late onset diseases is likely to be generally under-estimated. Alleles considered neutral or nearly neutral (for mutation accumulation), or under negative selection small enough to be traded-off for a positive effect at younger ages (for antagonistic pleiotropy) may be more strongly negatively selected than thought. For antagonistic pleiotropy (for which there is the most empirical support, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001206-Charmantier1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>), this implies that positive selection on alleles associated with increases of survival or fertility at young ages must be large enough to compensate for non-negligible negative selection on survival at old ages, highlighting the role of trade-offs in the evolution of senescence. For mutation accumulation, purging of the genetic burden may be more effective than hitherto suspected, suggesting a diminished role of mutation accumulation in determining mortality late in life.</p><p>Although our results suggest diminished importance of mutation accumulation in determining late-age mortality, they also provide a strong counter-argument to one of its major criticisms. Detractors of the theory of mutation accumulation argue that it is unrealistic as an explanation of senescence because hazard rates should go to infinity when the force of selection reaches zero (i.e. after menopause), resulting in a wall of death (i.e. an age beyond which there is no survival). Models incorporating intergenerational transfers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001206-Lee1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> or models considering the genetic inter-dependence of males and females despite their demographic differences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001206-Tuljapurkar1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> produce a more gradual decrease in the force of selection after menopause, eliminating the possibility of this &#x0201c;wall of death&#x0201d; outcome. Additionally, here we show that simply considering genetically associated variance in the age of onset of late-onset diseases has a similar effect. In this respect, our results therefore provide support for the theory of mutation accumulation. Moreover, if our results prove true for a large number of diseases affecting women at old ages, variance in the age of onset for these diseases may explain extended post-reproductive life from a genetic, rather then behavioral or cultural basis.</p></sec><sec id="s4b2"><title>Future directions</title><p>Initially, <italic>BRCA1</italic> appears a good candidate gene for testing the theory of mutation accumulation because 1) when all <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutations are taken together, the prevalence of breast and ovarian cancer linked to the <italic>BRCA1</italic> locus is one of the highest among late-onset diseases and 2) in the absence of modern medicine, the disease leads to rapid and certain death (as opposed to slowly degenerative diseases, like Alzheimer dementia, whose effects on fitness are unclear). However, we show that <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutations are subject to strong negative selection. <italic>BRCA1</italic> is therefore not a good candidate for mutation accumulation. This is also likely to be the case for other genetic susceptibilities where allele frequencies are characterized by a large number of recent and rare alleles, e.g. certain familial forms of coronary artery diseases and Alzheimer dementia. Further tests of the hypothesis of mutation accumulation might more fruitfully focus on diseases 1) epidemiologically characterized by a very late and/or less variable age of onset and/or 2) with an abundance of common and ancient alleles. We hope that our study will encourage further research using epidemiological data in a population genetics framework to test evolutionary theories of aging.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec
