While the pathogenesis of endogenous uveitis is considered to be related to autoimmunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>], the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Previous reports have suggested the involvement of several autoantigens in the pathogenesis of endogenous uveitis. For example, autoimmunity against ocular-specific antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>], heat-shock protein (HSP) family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>], and ubiquitously expressed proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>] were reported in BD, and autoimmunity against the melanocyte-associated antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>] were reported in VKH. However, some of these antigens show autoantigenicity in more than one endogenous uveitis, suggesting the existence of autoantigens that are not disease-specific. For example, autoimmunity to HSP70 was reported in both BD and sarcoidosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>], and autoimmunity to S-antigen was reported in BD, sarcoidosis, and VKH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>]. Although VKH is regarded as a melanocyte specific autoimmune disease, there are reports of autoantigens besides melanocyte specific proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. Therefore, it is considerable that a number of autoantigens are involved in patients with endogenous uveitis.</p><p>To explain the phenomena that common antigens are targeted in several endogenous uveitis, we hypothesized that uveitis-mediated destruction of ocular tissue leads to the exposure of ocular antigens to the immune system, which in turn induces the production of antibodies against some of these antigens secondary to the ocular damage. Even though such secondary induced antigens may not participate in the disease-specific pathogenesis in endogenous uveitis, they may modulate different endogenous uveitis in the same manner. Thus, identifying the profile of secondary autoantigens will be of primary importance to understand the pathogenesis of endogenous uveitis. For that purpose, we applied a proteomic approach using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and western blotting (2D-WB). Both procedures have been shown by us and others to be useful in identifying circulating autoantibodies in autoimmune diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we first used the interphotoreceptor retinoid protein (IRBP)-induced murine model of autoimmune uveitis (experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis, EAU) for detecting autoantigens exposed as a result of uveitis-mediated tissue destruction. We screened circulating autoantibodies in mice with EAU against the retinal proteins using 2D-WB and subsequently identified the proteins targeted by the autoantibodies using mass spectrometry (MS). We then evaluated the autoantigenicity of these identified retinal proteins in patients with endogenous uveitis (BD, VKH, and sarcoidosis).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Serum samples were obtained from 36 BD patients with uveitis (31 men, 5 women; average age 36.9&#x000b1;10.5 years), 16 patients with VKH (12 men, 4 women; average age 39.2&#x000b1;12.6 years), and 17 patients with sarcoidosis (4 men, 13 women; average age 59.6&#x000b1;17.6 years). All patients were followed up by the outpatient clinic of the Department of Ophthalmology in Tokyo Medical University Hospital, Tokyo, Japan. Participants were considered to have BD if their symptoms fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of the Bechet&#x02019;s Disease Research Committee of Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. At the time of sample collection, BD patients were determined to be in the active phase of the disease if they presented with one of the following indicators: iridocyclitis with hypopyon, dense vitreous opacity, obscure fundi observation, and retinal exudates with hemorrhages. All VKH patients showed typical exudative retinal detachment confirmed by fluorescein angiography. Sera were collected in these patients before aggressive systemic corticosteroid therapy was begun. Three of the VKH patients were examined when they were experiencing a recurrent phase of ocular inflammation. Ocular sarcoidosis was diagnosed based on the criteria established by the Japanese Committee for Diffuse Lung Disease for the systemic sarcoidosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. In total, 64 healthy volunteers (35 men, 29 women), who were age- and sex-matched for each uveitis group, were recruited as healthy controls (HC). The investigation was conducted in accordance to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec><title>Animals and reagents</title><p>C57BL/6 female mice, aged 6 to 9 weeks, were obtained from Sankyo Laboratory Service Corp (Tokyo, Japan). Animals were handled in accordance with the Association for the Vision and Ophthalmology statement for the use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision research. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated rabbit antimouse IgG and goat antihuman IgG were obtained from Zymed Laboratories (San Francisco, CA). Human IRBP peptide 1&#x02013;20 (hIRBP-p) was synthesized by conventional solid-phase techniques on a peptide synthesizer (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan). Complete Freund&#x02019;s adjuvant (CFA) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra were purchased from Difco (Detroit, MI), Bordetella pertussis (PTX) was from Sigma-Aldrich Corp (St. Louis, MO), purified human &#x003b2;-actin (bAct) was from Cytoskeleton (Denver, CO), recombinant human esterase D (EsteD) was from GenWay Biotech (San Diego, CA), brain-type creatine phosphokinase (BB-CK) was from Biogenesis (Poole, England), and pETBlue-2 and Turner (DE3) pLacIcompetent cell were from Novagen (Darmstadt, Germany).</p></sec><sec><title>Induction and scoring of experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis</title><p>Induction of EAU in C57BL/6 mice and scoring of ocular inflammation were performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>].

Next, 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g PTX was given intraperitoneally as an additional adjuvant. On day 18 after immunization, ocular inflammation was clinically evaluated on a scale of 0 to 4 according to the previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. Briefly, minimal vasculitis with few very small lesions were scored as 0.5; mild vasculitis with 5 or less small focal chorioretinal lesions as 1; multiple (more than 5) chorioretinal lesions or severe vasculitis as 2; pattern of linear choreioretinal lesions, subretinal neovascularization, and haemorrhages as 3; and large retinal detachment and retinal atrophy as 4. The sera of the mice scoring over 1.5 were collected six weeks after immunization and used as the primary antibody in 2D-WB. Control mice were immunized with only CFA and PTX and then processed in the same way as the EAU mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Protein extract preparation</title><p>Mice were killed by cervical vertebra dislocation, and then retina from ten normal C57BL/6 female mice were separated immediately after enucleation and whole-tissue lysates were prepared by the freeze&#x02013;thaw method using a lysis buffer that contained 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, and 4% CHAPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>].

Isoelectric focusing (IEF) was performed using Ettan IPGphorII (GE Healthcare Bio-Science Corp.) for 12 h. After IEF, the strips were equilibrated for 30 min in a denaturation buffer that contained 6 M urea, 2<italic>%</italic> sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 50&#x000a0;mM Tris-HCl, 30% glycerol, and 100&#x000a0;mg/10&#x000a0;ml dithiothreitol (DTT). Strips were then embedded onto 12.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels, and gels were run for 2.5 h. After electrophoresis, the separated proteins on the gels were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. For 2D-WB, membranes were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween20 (PBST) containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 min and washed three times with PBST (10 min each time). Membranes were incubated for 1 h in 1:500 times diluted murine serum samples in 0.5% BSA-PBST. Next, membranes were washed with PBST before they were incubated for 1 h with 1:2000 diluted HRP rabbit antimouse IgG. Bound antibodies were visualized using diaminobenzidine (DAB; Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan).</p></sec><sec><title>Protein identification</title><p>Protein spots, which corresponded to the EAU-positive spots on the 2D-WB, were recovered from a 2D gel stained with SYPRO Ruby (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and digested in gel with trypsin. The digested peptides were extracted from the gel pieces using trifluroacetic acid and acetonitrile. After centrifugation, the supernatant was recovered. After three more cycles of this extraction, the supernatant was filtered and concentrated down to 10 &#x003bc;l in an evaporator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]. Masses of the digested peptides were determined using a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF MS; Ultraflex, Bruker Daltonics, Germany). A list of the determined peptide masses were subjected to mass fingerprinting by using the MASCOT software program version 2.1.0 (Matrix, Science, London UK), in which the National Center for Biotechnology Information (Bethesda, MD) protein data base was searched [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>]. Only those proteins with a Mowse score above statistical significant identity (p&#x0003c;0.05) were accepted as identified ones.</p></sec><sec><title>Recombinant protein</title><p>Based on the nucleotide sequence of the human tubulin-&#x003b2; (Tub-b) cDNA, the entire protein-coding region of the Tub-b cDNA from the murine retina was amplified using specific pairs of oligonucleotide primers.

Thereby, recombinant Tub-b with a tag of six histidines in its COOH-terminal was produced. The purification of Tub-b was performed as follows by brief modification of the previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>]. The bacteria was harvested from a 500 ml culture by centrifugation, lysed in 10 ml of lysozyme solution (0.2 mg/ml lysozyme, 1% NP-40 in PBS), and then sonicated to fragment the bacterial DNA. 0.1 mg DNase and 10 mmol MgCl<sub>2</sub> were added to the sonicated sample. 25 min after, 20 ml of denaturation buffer was added to make final concentration of 8 M urea, 12 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mM imidazol. After centrifugation, the sample was filtered, and then the protein was purified using a histidine-Ni+ affinity column (His Trap HP; GE Healthcare Bioscience Corp.) The sample was applied to the column and eluted with an elution buffer (10 mM-500 mM imidazol, 8 M Urea in PBS, pH 7.6).</p></sec><sec><title>One-dimensional western blotting</title><p>One-dimensional (1D)-WB was performed as follows.

We selected bAct, EsteD, and Tub-b because their p values were low (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>), and BB-CK because it was a relatively retina- and brain-specific protein. To confirm the aforedescribed results of the 2D-WB, we evaluated autoantibody titers against recombinant bAct, EsteD, Tub-b, and BB-CK in the EAU mice by using 1D-WB and ELISA. 1D-WB analysis showed that 8/10, 6/10, and 4/10 EAU mice were positive for autoantibodies against the antigens of bAct, EsteD, and BB-CK, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A,B,C</xref>); in contrast, none of the control mice reacted positively with any of these three antigens. Similarly, ELISA analysis showed that 4/10, 7/10, and 4/10 EAU mice were positive for autoantibodies against the antigens of bAct, EsteD, and BB-CK, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D,E,F</xref>). The results of the 2D-WB, 1D-WB, and ELISA corresponded closely to one another. Similar ELISA results were obtained using another set of control and EAU sera collected six weeks after immunization (data not shown). In addition, when we compared the antibody level against bAct, EsteD, and BB-CK using the murine sera collected three, six, and ten weeks after the immunization, we found that the sera collected six weeks after the immunization had the highest levels of antibodies against these three antigens (data not shown). As Tub-b did not react with the EAU sera in either 1D-WB or ELISA (data not shown), it was not used for any further experiments.</p><fig id="f2" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>The presence of antibodies to bAct, EsteD, and BB-CK in EAU mice was confirmed by 1D-WB and ELISA. <bold>A-C</bold>: Protein (2 &#x003bc;g) was subjected to 12.5% SDS&#x02013;PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, then incubated with 1:200 sera from experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) or control mice and 1:2000 horse radish peroxide (HRP) antimouse IgG as described in Methods.

EsteD (EC 3.1.1.1) is a 282 amino acid cytoplasmic protein (31.4 kDa) that is ubiquitously expressed and functions as a nonspecific esterase. Our study showed that the murine retina expressed EsteD, and a previous work reported the presence of EsteD in human retinal pigment epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>]. Considering that EsteD is expressed abundantly in other tissues such as liver, kidney, and intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>], there is a possibility that the anti-EsteD antibody would be found in other autoimmune diseases. However, our present study is the first to show EsteD is a target of autoimmunity in uveitis. In this study, three out of four anti-EsteD antibody-positive VKH patients were examined when they were experiencing their first episode of ocular inflammation, and one patient was examined when experiencing a recurrent phase. Our results suggest that even though VKH is a melanocyte-specific autoimmune disease, autoimmunity to antigens other than melanocyte-specific proteins are induced from the early period of uveitis, and these autoantibodies may modulate the disease. Several reports about the melanocyte-unrelated antigens in VKH support this idea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. In the VKH group, all of the anti-EsteD positive patients were female, and the result was statistically significant. However, a larger number of patients are needed to determine that female VKH patients are commonly positive for anti-EsteD antibody.</p><p>Another retinal autoantigen detected both in EAU and human uveitis was BB-CK (EC 2.7.3.2). This is a 381 amino acid cytoplasmic enzyme (42.6 kDa) that is abundantly expressed in brain and retina, and its expression in retina has been mentioned in several reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>]. Autoantibody production against BB-CK was also reported in patients with paraneoplastic sensory-dominant neuropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>]. Interestingly, autoantigens common to both the paraneoplastic syndrome and endogenous uveitis were reported previously. For example, it was shown that the anti-&#x003b1;-enolase antibody was present both in BD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>] and cancer-associated retinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>], a paraneoplastic syndrome that affects visual function. Considering BB-CK is relatively abundant in the retina, the anti-BB-CK antibody may modulate vision-related functions in anti-BB-CK antibody-positive patients, although statistical differences in the clinical parameters were not observed in the present study.</p><p>BD, sarcoidosis, and VKH exhibit clinically distinguishable ocular manifestations, and their etiologies and pathogenesis are also different. We did not observe any statistical correlation between the patients positive for these antibodies and the disease parameters. The only distinguishing feature in this study was all anti-EsteD antibody positive patients were female. We suggest that production of anti-EsteD antibody or anti-BB-CK antibody might be unrelated to the type of uveitis&#x02014;that is, regardless of the classification of uveitis, some of the patients would be positive for these antibodies. It would be worthwhile to examine a greater number of patients to further understand the roles of these autoantibodies in endogenous uveitis.</p><p>Some proteins are secondary exposed to immune system in a process of autoimmune disease. Some of such proteins could be autoantigenic and become one of the factors that extend inflammation. Several mechanisms, such as epitope spreading, molecular mimicry, and bystander activation, have been reported in various animal models of autoimmune disease and in some human autoimmune diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>]. In the present study, the anti-EsteD and anti-BB-CK antibodies were mainly of the IgG1 subclass, production of which is promoted by Th2-type cytokine. However, EAU is considered to be a Th1 disease. Therefore, it is possible that anti-EsteD and anti-BB-CK antibodies were produced as a result of Th2 immune responses promoted in the process of downregulating EAU. However, we can not define immune responses against EsteD or BB-CK in the development of endogenous uveitis with the results described in this study. We plan to study the immunogenicity including antigenicity of these proteins. In this regard, although it is a preliminary experiment, it is worth mentioning here that we have recently immunized C57BL/6 mice and Lewis rats with these two autoantigens; however, we did not observe uveitis in these animals until day 21 after immunization. This result tends to support the idea that any immune response against these two autoantigens is, indeed, a secondary reaction to tissue damage caused by the primary uveitogenic process.</p><p>Among the EAU-associated retinal autoantigens found in this study, all but BB-CK are ubiquitously and abundantly expressed proteins. These results suggest that in an underactivated immune system, even ubiquitously expressed antigens would become a target of organ-specific autoimmunity. Considering that none of the previously reported ocular-specific autoantigens in endogenous uveits (such as S-antigen, rhodopsin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>], and recoverin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>]) were detected as candidate retinal autoantigens in the present study, ubiquitously expressed proteins appear to be more immunogenic among antigens exposed to immune system secondarily under tissue-destructive severe uveitis.</p><p>In conclusion, our study demonstrated that autoantibodies were produced against several proteins in EAU induced by immunization with an IRBP-derived peptide. Of these, autoantibodies specific for EsteD and BB-CK were also detected in human endogenous uveitis. Therefore, we suggest that EsteD and BB-CK might be autoantigens secondarily generated as a result of uveitis-induced retinal destruction. Our approach of using an animal model of autoimmune disease to comprehensively detect autoantibodies was useful in identifying new autoantigens.
