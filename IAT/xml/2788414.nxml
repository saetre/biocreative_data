In the present work, we demonstrate that expression of Sox2 in Clara cells is required for the differentiation of ciliated, Clara, and goblet cells that line the bronchioles of the postnatal lung. The gene was selectively deleted in Clara cells utilizing <italic>Scgb1a1-Cre</italic>, causing the progressive loss of <italic>Sox2</italic> in the bronchioles during perinatal and postnatal development. The rate of bronchiolar cell proliferation was decreased and associated with the formation of an undifferentiated, cuboidal-squamous epithelium lacking the expression of markers of Clara cells (Scgb1a1), ciliated cells (FoxJ1 and &#x003b1;-tubulin), and goblet cells (Spdef and Muc5AC). By adulthood, bronchiolar cell numbers were decreased and Sox2 was absent in extensive regions of the bronchiolar epithelium, at which time residual Sox2 expression was primarily restricted to selective niches of CGRP staining neuroepithelial cells. Allergen-induced goblet cell differentiation and mucus production was absent in the respiratory epithelium lacking <italic>Sox2</italic>. <italic>In vitro</italic>, Sox2 activated promoter-luciferase reporter constructs for differentiation markers characteristic of Clara, ciliated, and goblet cells, <italic>Scgb1a1</italic>, <italic>FoxJ1</italic>, and <italic>Agr2</italic>, respectively.

Larger cartilaginous airways (e.g. trachea and bronchi) are lined by a pseudostratified epithelium consisting primarily of basal, ciliated, non-ciliated secretory cells (Clara cells), and goblet cells. Non-cartilaginous airways are lined primarily by a simple columnar epithelium consisting of Clara and ciliated cells. Together, the respiratory epithelium of conducting airways plays a critical role in pulmonary homeostasis, maintaining barrier function and sterility. The lung is continuously exposed to particles, toxicants, and microbial pathogens that are generally cleared from the airways by an extensive defense system, mediated in part by mucociliary clearance, secretion of fluids, and antimicrobial molecules, as well as by the activities of the innate and acquired host defense systems. Cellular composition of conducting airways varies during development, and is highly responsive to acute and chronic injury in the postnatal lung. Differences in cell differentiation of the conducting airways as compared to the peripheral alveolar regions of the lung are established early in fetal development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008248-Perl1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008248-Perl2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The diverse cell types lining the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli become highly differentiated in the perinatal and postnatal period, during which the respiratory epithelium is proliferative. While cell turnover and proliferation is relatively low in the mature lung, the respiratory epithelium is capable of extensive proliferation following injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008248-Evans1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008248-Evans2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008248-Hong1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008248-Schoch1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.

After severe bronchiolar injury, toxicant resistant Clara cells and bronchoalveolar stem cells (BASCs) residing in distinct cellular niches, also have been proposed as relatively specialized stem cells that play a role in repair and/or carcinogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008248-Giangreco1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008248-Kim1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Cellular hyperplasia and metaplasia of the airway epithelium are associated with common, chronic lung disorders, including those induced by smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, cystic fibrosis, lung cancer, and interstitial lung diseases. While goblet cells are not highly abundant in the normal airway, goblet cell numbers and mucus hyperproduction are commonly associated with both acute and chronic infection, allergy, and exposure to toxicants (for example, cigarette smoke) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008248-Hogg1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008248-Holgate1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008248-Rogers1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008248-Rose1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Proliferation and differentiation of the diverse cells lining the respiratory tract are influenced by complex signaling and transcriptional programs that are active during formation of the respiratory epithelium and during its repair. The roles of a number of transcription factors, including members of the NKX, FOX, TCF/LEF, SOX, ETS, RAR, p53/p63, Krupple-like factors, the Notch signaling pathway, and others play a role in formation and differentiation of the respiratory epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008248-Maeda1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008248-Costa1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008248-Warburton1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

Peroxidase treatment in methanol with 0.5&#x00025; hydrogen peroxide was followed by heat-assisted antigen retrieval in 0.01 M sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0). Blocking was performed for 2 hrs at room temperature using 4&#x00025; goat or 4&#x00025; donkey serum followed by overnight incubation with primary antibody at 4&#x000b0;C. Antibodies used were Sox2 (WRAB-Sox2, 1&#x02236;2000, Seven Hills Bioreagents, Cincinnati, OH), Scgb1a1 (WRAB-Ccsp, 1&#x02236;4000, Seven Hills Bioreagents), Nkx2.1 (WRAB-Ttf1, 1&#x02236;2000, Seven Hills Bioreagents), FoxA2 (WRAB-FoxA2, 1&#x02236;5000, Seven Hills Bioreagents), FoxJ1 (generated internally, 1&#x02236;6000), acetylated &#x003b1;-tubulin (catalog T7451 Clone6-11B-1, IgG2b, 1&#x02236;2000, Sigma, St Louis, MO), Keratin-14 (Clone LL002, IgG3, 1&#x02236;100, Neomarkers, Fremont, CA), p63 (sc-8344, 1&#x02236;200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), Ki-67 (m7249, 1&#x02236;500 Dako, Carpintera, CA), CGRP (catalog 8198, 1&#x02236;3000, Sigma), and cleaved Caspase 3 (1&#x02236;1000, rabbit polyclonal; R&#x00026;D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN). Rinsed sections were incubated with biotinylated secondary antibodies directed to primary antibody host IgGs (7.5 ug/ml; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame CA), visualized with the Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) using nickel-diaminobenzidine as a substrate, enhanced with Tris-cobalt, and counterstained with 0.1&#x00025; nuclear-fast red. Rabbit polyclonal antibody was generated against a fragment of synthetic mouse Sox2 protein (aa 111&#x02013;140) conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Peptide synthesis and conjugation were performed by AnaSpec Inc. (San Jose, CA). Immunohistofluorescence was performed on 5-&#x000b5;m-thick sections using antibodies generated to Sox2 (1&#x02236;200), CCSP (1&#x02236;2000, goat polyclonal, sc-9772), acetylated &#x003b1;-tubulin (1&#x02236;2000), Ki-67 (1&#x02236;100), and secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594, Alexa Fluor 488 fluorochromes (1&#x02236;200, Molecular Probes, Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA).
