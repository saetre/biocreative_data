Immuno-Western and -cytochemical analysis of HSF1 show that riluzole increased the amount of cytosolic HSF1 to afford a greater activation of HSF1 upon heat shock. The increased HSF1 contributed centrally to the cytoprotective activity of riluzole as hsf1 gene knockout negated the synergistic activity of riluzole and conditioning heat shock to confer cell survival under oxidative stress. Evidence of a post-transcriptional mechanism for the increase in HSF1 include: quantitation of mRNA<sup>hsf1</sup> by RT-PCR showed no effect of either heat shock or riluzole treatment; riluzole also increased the expression of HSF1 from a CMV-promoter; analysis of the turnover of HSF1 by pulse chase and immunoprecipitation show that riluzole slowed the decay of &#x0005b;<sup>35</sup>S&#x0005d;labeled-HSF1. The effect of riluzole on HSF1 was qualitatively different from that of MG132 and chloroquine, inhibitors of the proteasome and lysosome, respectively, and appeared to involve the chaperone-mediated autophagy pathway as RNAi-mediated knockdown of CMA negated its effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion/Significance</title><p>We show that riluzole increased the amount of HSF1 to amplify the HSR for cytoprotection.

A major obstacle in harnessing such cytoprotective activity for therapeutic purposes is that agents/conditions that induce the HSR are proteotoxic, and the induction of HSPs under such conditions represents a compensatory mechanism to rectify the perturbation of protein homeostasis. We used a cell-based, hsp70-luciferase reporter gene assay in a 96 well format to identify drugs/small molecules that are not by themselves robust inducers of the HSR but which can enhance/amplify the effects of HSR inducers. We show here that the FDA-approved ALS drug riluzole slows the turnover of HSF1 to effect a more robust HSR for cytoprotection. These effects of riluzole appear to be ubiquitous in a variety of cell types/lines that we studied including the human HeLa cells&#x02013;which we used as a model to evaluate the effects of riluzole on the regulation and function of HSF1, and spinal cord neurons&#x02013;which we used to validate the relevance of these effects of riluzole. Our result provides novel insight into the mechanism of turnover of HSF1, and identifies the degradation of HSF1 as a target for therapeutics intervention.</p><p>Studies on the effects of riluzole on hsp70-luciferase reporter gene show that riluzole increased both the basal (37&#x000b0;C) and the heat shock (42&#x000b0;C)-induced hsp70-reporter gene, such that the fold of heat shock induction (i.e. HS/control) remained relatively constant in the absence and presence of various concentrations of riluzole. Analysis of the effects of riluzole on HSF1 by immuno-Western blot and cytochemistry techniques showed that riluzole markedly increased the amount of latent, cytosolic HSF1 monomer; this increased reserve allowed for a greater mobilization of HSF1 upon heat shock. We further note that riluzole by itself had a smaller but reproducible effect in increasing the amount of nuclear localized, activated HSF1 trimer&#x02013;an effect likely secondary to the increased cytosolic HSF1. Indeed, spontaneous activation of HSF1 is often observed upon over expression of HSF1 in transfected mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002864-Rabindran1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002864-Fiorenza1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002864-Farkas1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002864-Sarge1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, and recombinant HSF1 expressed in E. coli is in a constitutively active oligomeric form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002864-Wu1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002864-Clos1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002864-Rabindran2">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. These considerations suggest that both the basal (37&#x000b0;C) and the heat shock-induced (42&#x000b0;C) hsp70-reporter gene activity is an accurate and valid assessment of the activity of HSF1-an activity which includes the trimerization and nuclear translocation of HSF1 and binding of the HSF1 trimer to the heat shock element to transactivate the hsp70 promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002864-Wu1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. The notion that the basal reporter gene activity is in fact HSF1-dependent is further support by the absence of a measurable activity when the hsp70-luciferase DNA is transfected into hsf&#x02212;/&#x02212;cells (data not shown).</p><p>Our conclusion that riluzole increased the amount of HSF1 to afford a more robust HSR for cytoprotection is supported by three lines of evidence reported in this study: (1) Riluzole and conditioning heat shock had synergistic effects in protecting cells against the cytotoxic effects of arsenite-induced oxidative stress. (2) Riluzole gave similar, if not identical, dose-response profiles in increasing the amount of HSF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002864-g002">Fig. 2</xref>), in enhancing hsp70-reporter gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002864-g001">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002864-g005">5</xref>), in promoting the expression of HSP70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002864-g005">Fig. 5</xref>), and in conferring cytoprotection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002864-g003">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002864-g005">5</xref>); such correlation is consistent with a cause-effect relationships of the increased HSF1, enhanced induction of HSPs, and improved cell survival. (3) Genetic deletion of hsf1 negated the cytoprotective effects of both riluzole treatment and of conditioning heat shock.</p><p>Riluzole slowed the turnover of HSF1 via the CMA pathway of protein degradation as RNAi-mediated knockdown of Lamp2A, an essential lysosomal membrane receptor protein involved in CMA, blunted the effect of riluzole. Most substrates for CMA contains a KFERQ-like sequence, a binding motif to the cytosolic HSC70 protein and targeting of the protein complex to the Lamp-2A receptor located on the cytosolic face of the lysosomal membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002864-Dice1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Analysis of both the human and mouse HSF1 failed to reveal an idealized KFERQ sequence, however, it is well known that HSF1 interacts with both the HSC and HSP70 proteins <italic>in vivo</italic> and such interaction modulates the activity and stability of HSF1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002864-Baler1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002864-Mosser1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002864-Nunes1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002864-Rabindran3">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002864-Shi1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. CMA is active in most cell types and is activated under conditions of nutrient deprivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002864-Dice1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistent with this, we note that the effect of riluzole is not cell type specific and is more pronounce in nutrient deprived post-confluent cells (unpublished observations). At this time, we do not know if riluzole targets a step in the CMA pathway or that it targets the HSF1 protein as a substrate for this pathway. If it is the former, one would expect riluzole to block the CMA-mediated degradation of known substrates such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and RNase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002864-Cuervo1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002864-Massey1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. If riluzole targets HSF1, perhaps by modulating a post-translation modification event of HSF1 necessary for its degradation via CMA, then the effect of riluzole is likely to be more specific and limited to HSF1 and perhaps other select CMA-substrates. Analysis of the effects of riluzole in an <italic>in vitro</italic> CMA-mediated protein degradation system should help to provide some answers to these questions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002864-Cuervo1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002864-Massey1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The effect of riluzole on HSF1 is qualitatively different from that of MG132 and chloroquine, inhibitors of the proteasome and lysosome, respectively; they promoted the hyperphosphorylation, nuclear translocation and activation of HSF1. Their mechanisms of action likely involve the blockage of bulk protein degradation, leading to the buildup of abnormal, mis-folded proteins and consequently activation of the HSR. It is well known that the accumulation of abnormal proteins in cells, either due to genetic mutation or by the artificial introduction of denatured proteins, will trigger the HSR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002864-Ananthan1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002864-Mifflin1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>.

(2) Riluzole, by mechanisms to be delineated, inhibits this degradation leading to an increased accumulation of HSF1. (3) The increased HSF1 reserve affords a greater mobilization of HSF1 under stress for a more robust induction of the HSP chaperones to confer cytoprotection.</p><p>Other drugs have been shown to modulate the HSR. In particular non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) are co-inducers of the HSR: they partially activate components of the HSR and often work in conjunction with a secondary stress signal for full induction of HSP70 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002864-Westerheide1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002864-Jurivich1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Several clinical stage hydroxylamine derivative compounds, arimoclomol, iroxanadine and bimoclomol, are also co-inducers of the HSR: they promote the hyperphosphorylation and prolong the activation of HSF1 to enhance the production of HSPs following heat shock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002864-Hargitai1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002864-Kieran1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002864-Lubbers1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002864-Polakowski1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002864-Vigh1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. Treatment of transgenic ALS mice with arimoclomol improves behavioral phenotypes, prevents neuronal loss and extends survival rates of the ALS mice by 22&#x00025;.</p><p>The effect of riluzole on the HSR is mechanistically distinct from the co-inducers: riluzole up-regulates HSF1 reserve to function as an amplifier of the HSR. We believe that riluzole may be a prototype of drugs that can amplify the HSR for cytoprotection, and we will continue to use our cell-based reporter gene assay to screen for and identify such compounds. We further note that the recommended dose for ALS is one 50-mg Rilutek&#x000ae; tablet (MW 234.2; Aventis Pharmaceuticals) every 12 hrs, and patients have continued on the treatment regimen for up to 5 years. Assuming an average body weight of 85 kg of the adult male, body water content of 60&#x00025; of weight, and average absolute oral bioavailability of about 60&#x00025; (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://products.sanofi-aventis.us/rilutek/rilutek.html">http://products.sanofi-aventis.us/rilutek/rilutek.html</ext-link>), this would translate to a circulating concentration of &#x0223c;5 &#x003bc;M riluzole.

The immunoprecipitate was collected by centrifugation and washed 3&#x000d7; each with 200 &#x003bc;l of RIPA buffer, and the amount of radioactivity determined by liquid scintillation counting.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>RT-PCR quantitation of mRNAhsf1</title><p>RNA was isolated from cells grown in 60 mm plates using the TRIzol reagent from Invitrogen Inc. RT-PCR was done using the 2-step procedure (cDNA synthesis with M-MLV reverse transcriptase, followed by PCR amplification with HSF1-specific primers). The forward and reverse primers of HSF1 were: <named-content content-type="gene">CATGAGAATGAGGCTCTGTG</named-content> and <named-content content-type="gene">CTACGCTGAGGCACTTTTCA</named-content>. The PCR reaction was for 30 cycles using Platinum PCR SuperMix from Invitrogen Inc. The amplied HSF1 product is 642bp.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Dr. Suzie Chen of the Department of Chemical Biology at the College of Pharmacy of Rutgers University for providing us with an initial riluzole stock solution.
