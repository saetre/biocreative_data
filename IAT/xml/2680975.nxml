In this study we sought to establish whether the TP&#x003b1; and TP&#x003b2; isoforms of the human prostanoid thromboxane (TX) A<sub>2</sub> receptor (TP) are palmitoylated and to assess the functional consequences thereof. Consistent with the presence of three cysteines within its unique carboxyl-terminal domain, metabolic labelling and site-directed mutagenesis confirmed that TP&#x003b2; is palmitoylated at Cys<sup>347</sup> and, to a lesser extent, at Cys<sup>373,377</sup> whereas TP&#x003b1; is not palmitoylated. Impairment of palmitoylation did not affect TP&#x003b2; expression or its ligand affinity. Conversely, agonist-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> mobilization by TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347S</sup> and the non-palmitoylated TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347,373,377S</sup>, but not by TP&#x003b2;<sup>C373S</sup> or TP&#x003b2;<sup>C373,377S</sup>, was significantly reduced relative to the wild type TP&#x003b2; suggesting that palmitoylation at Cys<sup>347</sup> is specifically required for efficient Gq/phospholipase C&#x003b2; effector coupling. Furthermore, palmitoylation at Cys<sup>373,377</sup> is critical for TP&#x003b2; internalization with TP&#x003b2;<sup>C373S</sup>, TP&#x003b2;<sup>C373,377S</sup> and TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347,373,377S</sup> failing to undergo either agonist-induced or temperature-dependent tonic internalization. On the other hand, whilst TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347S</sup> underwent reduced agonist-induced internalization, it underwent tonic internalization to a similar extent as TP&#x003b2;. The deficiency in agonist-induced internalization by TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347S</sup>, but not by TP&#x003b2;<sup>C373,377</sup> nor TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347,373,377S</sup>, was overcome by over-expression of either &#x003b2;-arrestin1 or &#x003b2;-arrestin2. Taken together, data herein suggest that whilst palmitoylation of TP&#x003b2; at Cys<sup>373,377</sup> is critical for both agonist- and tonic-induced internalization, palmitoylation at Cys<sup>347</sup> has a role in determining which pathway is followed, be it by the &#x003b2;-arrestin-dependent agonist-induced pathway or by the &#x003b2;-arrestin-independent tonic internalization pathway.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Abbreviations</title><kwd>AR, adrenergic receptor</kwd><kwd>C-tail, carboxyl-terminal tail</kwd><kwd>[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, intracellular calcium</kwd><kwd>eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide synthase</kwd><kwd>GFP, green fluorescent protein</kwd><kwd>GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor</kwd><kwd>HA, hemagglutinin</kwd><kwd>HEK, human embryonic kidney</kwd><kwd>5-hydroxytryptamine (4a) receptor, 5-HT<sub>4(a)</sub></kwd><kwd>IP, prostacyclin receptor</kwd><kwd>IP<sub>3</sub>, inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate</kwd><kwd>PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis</kwd><kwd>PK, protein kinase</kwd><kwd>PL, phospholipase</kwd><kwd>TP, TXA<sub>2</sub> receptor</kwd><kwd>TXA<sub>2</sub>, thromboxane A<sub>2</sub></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> receptor</kwd><kwd>Receptor internalization</kwd><kwd>Palmitoylation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>The covalent addition of lipid moieties to proteins is widely recognized as an important regulatory mechanism in eukaryotic cells contributing to protein:membrane and/or protein:protein interactions <xref rid="bib1 bib2" ref-type="bibr">[1,2]</xref>. Common lipidations include the co-translational attachment of myristate acid via a stable amide linkage to amino (N)-terminal glycine residues, post-translational attachment of farnesyl or geranylgeranyl isoprenoids to carboxy (C)-terminal cysteine(s) via thioether bond(s) and post-translational addition of palmitate or other fatty acyl group to cysteine(s) via labile thioester linkages <xref rid="bib1 bib2 bib3 bib4 bib5" ref-type="bibr">[1&#x02013;5]</xref>. The latter, generally referred to as palmitoylation but more accurately termed acyl thioesterification or S-acylation, is the least understood despite being the most common lipid modification <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Unlike myristoylation or isoprenylation, palmitoylation is a dynamic modification with proteins constantly undergoing enzymatic cycles of palmitoylation and depalmitoylation, events that are thought to regulate not only membrane/protein interactions but also protein function <xref rid="bib1 bib6" ref-type="bibr">[1,6]</xref>. This has been supported with the recent identification of candidate mammalian protein:S-acyl-transferases (PATs) and S-acylprotein thioesterases (APTs) that catalyze such palmitoylations and depalmitoylations, respectively <xref rid="bib5 bib6" ref-type="bibr">[5,6]</xref>.</p><p>A diverse range of palmitoylated proteins have been identified, most notably amongst proteins participating in intracellular signalling including H- and N-Ras, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, growth cone-associated protein 43, SRC and several other protein tyrosine kinases (<xref rid="bib4 bib5" ref-type="bibr">[4,5]</xref> and references therein). Palmitoylation is also a feature of heterotrimeric G&#x003b1; subunits and of their downstream effectors, including G&#x003b1;s, G&#x003b1;<sub>q</sub> and adenylyl cyclase <xref rid="bib1 bib4 bib5" ref-type="bibr">[1,4,5]</xref> and is a common modification of numerous G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). In fact, it is estimated that up to 80% of GPCRs contain at least one palmitoylable cysteine typically located some 10&#x02013;14 amino acid residues downstream from transmembrane (TM) 7 within their carboxyl-terminal (C)-tail domain <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Rhodopsin, the first GPCR to be confirmed to be palmitoylated, undergoes palmitoylation at Cys<sup>322</sup> and Cys<sup>323</sup> within its C-tail domain and it was proposed that interaction of the hydrophobic palmitoyl moieties with the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane may result in the formation of a fourth intracellular loop within its GPCR structure <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Numerous other GPCRs have since been shown to be palmitoylated within their C-tail domains including the &#x003b1;<sub>2A</sub>- and &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors <xref rid="bib9 bib10" ref-type="bibr">[9,10]</xref>, the dopamine D<sub>1</sub> receptor <xref rid="bib11 bib12" ref-type="bibr">[11,12]</xref>, the 5-hydroxytryptamine (4a) receptor <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, the prostacyclin receptor <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and the vasopressin V<sub>1A</sub> and V<sub>2</sub> receptors <xref rid="bib16 bib17" ref-type="bibr">[16,17]</xref>. Through these and many other specific examples, it is evident that while palmitoylation may potentially affect diverse aspects of GPCR function and regulation including processing and targeting, protein turnover, G protein coupling, phosphorylation and desensitization, sequestration and/or internalization <xref rid="bib1 bib2 bib3 bib4 bib5" ref-type="bibr">[1&#x02013;5]</xref>, it is also apparent that such effects are generally receptor specific, requiring investigation at the individual GPCR level.</p><p>The prostanoid thromboxane (TX)A<sub>2</sub> plays a critical role in vascular hemostasis regulating platelet activation status and vascular tone <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In humans, but not in non-primates, TXA<sub>2</sub> signals through two distinct isoforms of the TXA<sub>2</sub> receptor (TP) termed TP&#x003b1; and TP&#x003b2; <xref rid="bib18 bib19 bib20 bib21" ref-type="bibr">[18&#x02013;21]</xref>. As members of the GPCR superfamily, TP&#x003b1; and TP&#x003b2; are identical for their first N-terminal 328 amino acids and diverge exclusively within their carboxyl-terminal (C)-tail domains <xref rid="bib18 bib19 bib20 bib21 bib22" ref-type="bibr">[18&#x02013;22]</xref>. While TP&#x003b1; and TP&#x003b2; arise by differential splicing <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, they display distinct patterns of mRNA and protein expression <xref rid="bib23 bib24" ref-type="bibr">[23,24]</xref> and, more recently, it has been established that they are under the transcriptional regulation of distinct promoters within the single human TP gene <xref rid="bib25 bib26 bib27 bib28" ref-type="bibr">[25&#x02013;28]</xref>. Moreover, whilst both TP&#x003b1; and TP&#x003b2; exhibit identical ligand binding and Gq-dependent activation of phospholipase (PL) C&#x003b2;, their primary effector <xref rid="bib20 bib29 bib30 bib31" ref-type="bibr">[20,29&#x02013;31]</xref>, they oppositely regulate adenylyl cyclase through Gs and Gi, respectively <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> and TP&#x003b1;, but not TP&#x003b2;, can couple to Gh/tissue transglutaminase activation <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.</p><p>Hence, it is evident that TP&#x003b1; and TP&#x003b2; display differences in their patterns of expression and in their modes of intracellular signalling, suggesting that they may have distinct physiologic roles <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Consistent with this hypothesis, there is an abundance of emerging evidence suggesting that the greatest differences between TP&#x003b1; and TP&#x003b2; lies in their modes of desensitization/regulation post-receptor signalling, through events that are largely regulated through sequences or functional determinants within their respective unique C-tail domains. For example, while both TPs undergo agonist-induced phosphorylation <xref rid="bib24 bib29" ref-type="bibr">[24,29]</xref>, TP&#x003b2;, but not TP&#x003b1;, is subject to both agonist-induced and tonic internalization <xref rid="bib34 bib35" ref-type="bibr">[34,35]</xref>. Agonist-induced TP&#x003b2; internalization appears to be dynamin-, GRK2/3- and &#x003b2;-arrestin-dependent <xref rid="bib34 bib35" ref-type="bibr">[34,35]</xref>, requiring an active or dynamic actin cytoskeleton <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and may also involve direct interaction between Rab 11 and the C-tail domain of TP&#x003b2; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. On the other hand, tonic internalization of TP&#x003b2; is both GRK- and &#x003b2;-arrestin-independent but dynamin-dependent and is also dependent on the presence of an intact internalization motif within its C-tail domain <xref rid="bib34 bib35" ref-type="bibr">[34,35]</xref>. In studies investigating cross-talk between TXA<sub>2</sub> and other prostanoids, it was established that signalling by TP&#x003b1;, but not TP&#x003b2;, is subject to prostacyclin- and prostaglandin (PG)D<sub>2</sub>-mediated desensitization involving direct PKA phosphorylation of TP&#x003b1; at Ser<sup>329</sup> within its unique C-tail domain <xref rid="bib30 bib38" ref-type="bibr">[30,38]</xref>. Consistent with this, TP&#x003b1;, but not the TP&#x003b2;, is also a target for nitric oxide (NO)-induced desensitization that occurs through a mechanism involving its direct PKG phosphorylation at Ser<sup>331</sup> within its unique C-tail domain <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. These latter studies point to an essential role for TP&#x003b1; in prostacyclin- and NO-regulated vascular hemostasis and point to a redundant or an, as yet, unidentified role for TP&#x003b2; in this essential physiologic process <xref rid="bib22 bib30 bib38 bib39" ref-type="bibr">[22,30,38,39]</xref>. Moreover, collectively, these data also indicate that TP&#x003b1; and TP&#x003b2; are subject to distinct modes of regulation, intracellular signalling and expression and that such differences are largely determined by sequences within their unique C-tail domains.</p><p>Another notable difference between the TP isoforms, the significance of which has yet to be investigated, is the presence of multiple cysteine (Cys) residues within the unique C-tail of TP&#x003b2; at Cys<sup>347</sup>, Cys<sup>373</sup> and Cys<sup>377</sup>, while the C-tail domain of the TP&#x003b1; is entirely devoid of such residues. The presence of Cys residues within the unique C-tail domain of TP&#x003b2; raises the possibility that they may be palmitoylated and that such modification(s) may contribute to the functional differences between the two TP isoforms. Hence, the aim of the current study was to investigate whether TP&#x003b2; is subject to palmitoylation and to examine the functional consequences thereof. Our studies confirm that TP&#x003b2;, but not TP&#x003b1;, is palmitoylated at Cys<sup>347</sup> and, to a lesser extent, at Cys<sup>373/377</sup>, a modification that not only regulates agonist-induced second messenger signalling but also differentially influences agonist- and tonic-induced internalization of TP&#x003b2;.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials-methods"><label>2</label><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec sec-type="materials"><label>2.1</label><title>Materials</title><p>U46619 and SQ29,548 were obtained from Cayman Chemical Company.

Immunolocalizations were then captured under non-permeabilizing and permeabilizing conditions at 0, 2 and 4&#x000a0;h (2&#x000a0;h data not shown throughout). In the absence of agonist (0&#x000a0;h), there was a strong detection of HA-tagged TP&#x003b2;, TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347S</sup>, TP&#x003b2;<sup>C373,377S</sup> and TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347,373,377S</sup> at their respective cell surfaces under both non-permeabilizing and permeabilizing conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, Panels A&#x02013;D, 0&#x000a0;h). In the presence of U46619, cell surface expression of TP&#x003b2; decreased with time, as indicated by reduced immunodetection in HEK.TP&#x003b2; cells analysed in non-permeabilizing conditions, with a corresponding increase in TP&#x003b2; internalization detected following permeabilization (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A, 4&#x000a0;h). In permeabilized cells, TP&#x003b2; expression was observed intracellularly at 4&#x000a0;h confirming that the HA-tagged TP&#x003b2; had internalized from the cell surface into a cytoplasmic compartment. Indeed, there was a distinct punctuate staining within the perinuclear region, indicated by the arrow, appearing at the 4&#x000a0;h time point (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A, permeabilized, 4&#x000a0;h). However, in contrast, the level of agonist-induced internalization of TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347S</sup> was significantly impaired relative to that of the wild type TP&#x003b2; with no measurable decrease in surface expression and no increase in intracellular expression of TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347S</sup> detected under either non-permeabilizing or permeabilizing conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B). Moreover, U46619-stimulation did not result in a decrease in cell surface expression of TP&#x003b2;<sup>C373,377S</sup> and TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347,373,377S</sup> in cells analysed under non-pemeabilizing conditions, even following 4&#x000a0;h exposure to agonist (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>C and D, respectively) with no decrease in cell surface expression and no detection of internalized receptors when cells were analysed under permeabilizing conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>C and D, 4&#x000a0;h).

Hence, due to the reduced ability of the palmitoylation deficient TP&#x003b2; mutants to undergo agonist-induced internalization, we next sought to investigate the effect of palmitoylation on tonic internalization.

However, unlike that which occurred for its agonist-induced internalization, it was found that TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347S</sup> also underwent similar temperature-dependent tonic internalization to levels similar to that of the wild type TP&#x003b2;. Specifically, it was found that cell surface expression of TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347S</sup> was reduced by approx. 40% at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and to a level that was not significantly different from that of the wild type TP&#x003b2; (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.32).

In brief, HEK 293 cell lines stably over-expressing HA-tagged TP&#x003b2;, TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347S</sup>, TP&#x003b2;<sup>C373,377S</sup> or TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347,373,377S</sup> were pre-labelled with anti-HA 101R at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C; thereafter images were captured either directly (0&#x000a0;h), or following incubation for 2&#x000a0;h at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C or 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C under non-permeabilizing (data not shown) and permeabilizing conditions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). At time 0 and following 2&#x000a0;h incubation at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, there was no evidence of internalized receptor for TP&#x003b2;, TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347S</sup>, TP&#x003b2;<sup>C373,377S</sup> or TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347,373,377S</sup> with all of the immunolabelled receptors showing cell surface expression. Following 2&#x000a0;h incubation at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, much of the expression of TP&#x003b2; and TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347S</sup> was still found at the cell surface, albeit at a substantially reduced level, but in both cases a significant amount of the immunolabelled receptors was present intracellularly consistent with their temperature-dependent tonic internalization (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>A and B, 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, indicated by arrows). As with the agonist-induced internalization of TP&#x003b2;, the cytoplasmic staining of TP&#x003b2; and TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347S</sup> exhibited a punctuate pattern in the perinuclear region. However, in the case of TP&#x003b2;<sup>C373,377S</sup> or TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347,373,377S</sup>, there was little evidence of tonic internalization at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C with both receptors being predominantly located at the cell surface (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>A and B, 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C). These data, particularly when taken in consideration with our ELISA-derived data, clearly indicates that the ability of TP&#x003b2;<sup>C373,377S</sup> and TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347,373,377S</sup> to undergo tonic internalization is severely impaired. Moreover, consistent with the ELISA data herein, the level of tonic internalization of TP&#x003b2;<sup>C373S</sup> following 2&#x000a0;h, or even more prolonged, incubation at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C was severely impaired (data not shown).</p><p>Hence, in summary, whilst TP&#x003b2; undergoes agonist-induced and tonic internalization, disruption of palmitoylation by mutating Cys<sup>347</sup>, Cys<sup>373</sup> or Cys<sup>377</sup>, either singly or in combination, abolishes agonist-induced internalization. However, like TP&#x003b2;, TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347S</sup> actually retains the ability to undergo tonic internalization while that of TP&#x003b2;<sup>C373S</sup>, TP&#x003b2;<sup>C373,377S</sup> and TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347,373,377S</sup> is substantially impaired.</p></sec><sec><label>3.5</label><title>Effect of &#x003b2;-arrestin1 and -2 on TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347S</sup>, TP&#x003b2;<sup>C373,377S</sup> and TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347,373,377S</sup> internalization</title><p>As stated, it is widely reported that agonist-induced internalization of TP&#x003b2; shows a significant dependence on &#x003b2;-arrestin recruitment post-receptor activation and may, for example, be significantly reduced in the presence of dominant negative forms of either &#x003b2;-arrestin1 or &#x003b2;-arrestin2 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Therefore, to further investigate the role of palmitoylation on TP&#x003b2; internalization, we transiently transfected &#x003b2;-arrestin1 and &#x003b2;-arrestin2 into HEK 293 cells stably over-expressing TP&#x003b2; and its variant TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347S</sup>, TP&#x003b2;<sup>C373,377S</sup> and TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347,373,377S</sup> with the view to assessing their effect on agonist-mediated internalization.

However, whilst TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347S</sup> does not undergo significant agonist-induced internalization (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), over-expression of &#x003b2;-arrestin1 and &#x003b2;-arrestin2 appeared to compensate and resulted in a 30% loss of cell surface receptor following exposure of cells to U46619 for 4&#x000a0;h (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>A, compare the level of agonist-induced internalization in HEK.TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347S</sup> cells transiently co-transfected with cDNA encoding &#x003b2;-arrestin1 and &#x003b2;-arrestin2 relative to the empty vector; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.017 and <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.042, respectively).

HA-tagged cell surface receptors were initially immunolabelled prior to stimulation with U46619 for 30&#x000a0;min; thereafter, cells were permeabilized and HA-tagged receptor or GFP-tagged &#x003b2;-arrestin expression and co-localizations were captured by fluorescence microscopy (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>A and B). While TP&#x003b2;, TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347S</sup> and TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347,373,377S</sup> were each clearly expressed on the cell surface in vehicle-treated cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>A and B), TP&#x003b2; was significantly internalized even following exposure of cells to U46619 for 30&#x000a0;min in the presence of both GFP-tagged &#x003b2;-arrestin1 or &#x003b2;-arrestin2 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>Ai and Bi). Moreover in the presence of either GFP-tagged &#x003b2;-arrestin1 or &#x003b2;-arrestin2, TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347S</sup> also underwent significant U46619-induced internalization (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>Aii and Bii). On the other hand, neither TP&#x003b2;<sup>C373S</sup>, TP&#x003b2;<sup>C373,377S</sup> (data not shown) nor TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347,373,377S</sup> underwent internalization even in the presence of over-expressed &#x003b2;-arrestins (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>Aiii and Biii). Consistent with previous reports <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, in vehicle-treated cells, both &#x003b2;-arrestins exhibit diffuse uniform staining in the cytoplasm whilst &#x003b2;-arrestin1, but not &#x003b2;-arrestin2, also showed significant nuclear staining (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>A and B). Upon U46619-stimulation and in the presence of TP&#x003b2;, the GFP staining pattern associated with both &#x003b2;-arrestin1 and &#x003b2;-arrestin2 was significantly altered. Specifically, GFP fluorescence became punctuate with a translocation of both &#x003b2;-arrestin1 and &#x003b2;-arrestin2 from the cytoplasm to the periphery of the cell, consistent with their co-localization and interaction with agonist-activated TP&#x003b2; on the cell surface (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>Ai and Bi, respectively). Similarly, in the presence of TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347S</sup>, both &#x003b2;-arrestin1 and &#x003b2;-arrestin2 showed translocation and enhanced co-localization with TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347S</sup> at the cell surface in response to U46619-stimulation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>Aii and Bii). On the other hand, there was no evidence of &#x003b2;-arrestin1/2 translocation or receptor co-localization with TP&#x003b2;<sup>C373S</sup>, TP&#x003b2;<sup>C373,377S</sup> (data not shown) or TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347,373,377S</sup> (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>Aiii and Biii) in response to U46619-stimulation. Taken together, these data demonstrated that over-expression of &#x003b2;-arrestin1 or &#x003b2;-arrestin2 could compensate for the defect in agonist-induced internalization of TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347S</sup> and suggest that palmitoylation of TP&#x003b2;, in particular at Cys<sup>347</sup>, is specifically required to mediate &#x003b2;-arrestin1/2 translocation and receptor interaction in response to agonist-stimulation.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p>Palmitoylation is a prevalent feature of GPCRs with up to 80% of the superfamily estimated to contain at least one cysteine in their C-tail domain, typically but not exclusively proximal to transmembrane (TM) 7, which may potentially be palmitoylated <xref rid="bib5 bib7" ref-type="bibr">[5,7]</xref>. In this study, we sought to establish whether TP&#x003b1; and/or TP&#x003b2; are palmitoylated and to investigate the functional consequences thereof. Whilst TP&#x003b1; does not contain any cysteines within its unique C-tail domain, TP&#x003b2; possesses Cys<sup>347</sup> close to the TM7/C-tail boundary and the couplet Cys<sup>373</sup> and Cys<sup>377</sup> located some 30 amino acids from its C-terminus.

Whilst palmitoylation was confirmed to occur at Cys<sup>373</sup>, attempts to further ascertain whether Cys<sup>377</sup>, along with Cys<sup>373</sup>, is specifically palmitoylated were not possible as stable cell lines over-expressing TP&#x003b2;<sup>C377S</sup> could not be generated despite repeated attempts.</p><p>A typical feature of palmitoylation is that it is viewed as a reversible modification, with the propensity to regulate protein:membrane or protein:protein association, protein localization and/or function in a dynamic manner <xref rid="bib1 bib6" ref-type="bibr">[1,6]</xref>. Moreover, several GPCRs are known to undergo increased palmitoylation or depalmitoylation in an agonist-dependent manner, modulating receptor signalling potential in response to ligand engagement <xref rid="bib13 bib51 bib52" ref-type="bibr">[13,51,52]</xref>. In the current study, we found no evidence of altered palmitoylation status of TP&#x003b2; in response to agonist-stimulation under the conditions of metabolic labelling employed and, hence, data presented throughout are those generated in the absence of ligand activation. However, as the process of metabolic labelling and detection of palmitoylation is a relatively inefficient process, with poor-signal-to-noise ratio, we cannot exclude the possibility that TP&#x003b2; palmitoylation is also subject to dynamic modulation, such as in response to agonist-engagement.</p><p>Numerous studies have indicated that the consequences of palmitoylation of GPCRs are wide-ranging with many aspects of receptor function being potentially implicated including receptor processing, G protein/effector coupling, phosphorylation and desensitization, sequestration and internalization, trafficking and/or protein turnover <xref rid="bib1 bib2 bib3 bib4 bib5" ref-type="bibr">[1&#x02013;5]</xref>. In examining the functional consequences herein it was established that palmitoylation of TP&#x003b2; at Cys<sup>347</sup> is required for its efficient Gq-mediated PLC&#x003b2; activation, the primary effector of TP signalling. Specifically in the case in TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347S</sup> and TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347,373,377S</sup>, there was a 30% reduction in U46619-mediated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> mobilization compared to that of the wild type TP&#x003b2;. In contrast, U46619-mediated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> mobilization by TP&#x003b2;<sup>C373S</sup> and TP&#x003b2;<sup>C373,377S</sup> was not significantly different from TP&#x003b2;, indicating that palmitoylation at Cys<sup>373</sup> and/or Cys<sup>377</sup> does not influence Gq/PLC&#x003b2; effector signalling. The reduction in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> mobilization by TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347S</sup> or TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347,373,377S</sup> was not due differences in their ligand binding properties as each of the palmitoylation deficient mutants displayed similar affinities for the selective TP radioligand [<sup>3</sup>H]SQ29,548 and their overall level of expression was not significantly different to that of the wild type TP&#x003b2;. The specific requirement for palmitoylation at Cys<sup>347</sup> for TP&#x003b2;-mediated Gq/PLC&#x003b2; activation is somewhat similar to that previously reported for the hIP where it was established that palmitoylation at Cys<sup>308</sup>, but not at Cys<sup>311</sup>, is specifically required for its Gq/PLC&#x003b2; coupling <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>A number of studies have demonstrated that impairment of receptor palmitoylation, as exemplified by the CCR5 receptor, can result in the accumulation of GPCRs in intracellular stores and in the lowering of cell surface expression <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>.

It was established that mutation of Cys<sup>347</sup>, Cys<sup>373</sup> or Cys<sup>377</sup>, either alone or in combination, significantly impaired agonist-induced TP&#x003b2; internalization reducing the movement of the respective cell surface receptors (TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347S</sup>, TP&#x003b2;<sup>C373S</sup>, TP&#x003b2;<sup>C373,377S</sup> or TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347,373,377S</sup>) into intracellular compartment(s) relative to the wild type TP&#x003b2;.

Furthermore, over-expression of either &#x003b2;-arrestin1 or &#x003b2;-arrestin2 was able to overcome the inability of TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347S</sup> to undergo agonist-induced internalization, an effect not observed with the other palmitoylation deficient mutants including TP&#x003b2;<sup>C373S</sup>, TP&#x003b2;<sup>C373,377S</sup> and TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347,373,377S</sup>. These data indicated a critical role for palmitoylation of Cys<sup>373,377</sup> in both agonist-dependent and tonic internalization of TP&#x003b2;, while palmitoylation of TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347</sup> is also required for agonist-induced, but not tonic internalization.</p><p>Taken together, our results indicate that TP&#x003b2; is palmitoylated at 2 independent sites Cys<sup>347</sup> and Cys<sup>373,377</sup> separated by some 30 amino acid residues within its unique C-tail domain, to regulate G protein coupling and receptor internalization. One of the structural consequences of GPCR palmitoylation is that, by increasing local hydrophobicity, the palmitoyl moiety(s) is thought to become inserted into the membrane lipid bilayer resulting in the formation of a putative fourth intracellular loop within its C-tail domain, such as originally demonstrated for rhodopsin <xref rid="bib8 bib54 bib55" ref-type="bibr">[8,54,55]</xref>. Moreover, in certain cases, palmitoylation at multiple independent sites, either alone or in combination with other post-translational lipid modifications, has been proposed to result in the formation of loop structures within the C-tail domain of the given GPCR. For example, in the case of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)<sub>4(a)</sub> receptor, Ponimaskin et al. <xref rid="bib13 bib48" ref-type="bibr">[13,48]</xref> established that it undergoes palmitoylation at two adjacent Cys residues (Cys<sup>328</sup>/Cys<sup>329</sup>) located proximal to TM7 but is also palmitoylated at Cys<sup>386</sup>, located one amino acid residue from the C-terminus. They proposed that membrane insertion of the palmitates at the proximal Cys<sup>328</sup>/Cys<sup>329</sup> and distal Cys<sup>386</sup> residues resulted in the formation of a double loop structure within the C-tail of the 5-HT<sub>4(a)</sub> receptor. While palmitoylation deficient mutants of 5-HT<sub>4(a)</sub> receptor were indistinguishable from the wild type receptor in mediating G protein/effector signalling, mutation of the proximal and distal residues was shown not only to differentially modulate constitutive activation but also to modulate agonist-dependent phosphorylation, desensitization and &#x003b2;-arrestin internalization of the 5-HT<sub>4(a)</sub> receptor <xref rid="bib13 bib48 bib56" ref-type="bibr">[13,48,56]</xref>. Similarly, it has been proposed that the C-tail domain of the hIP also contains a double loop structure anchored by dynamically regulated proximal palmitoyl groups, at Cys<sup>308</sup>/Cys<sup>311</sup>, and by a distal farnesyl isoprenoid permanently attached to its C-terminus and that collectively these dual lipidations modulate G protein coupling and effector signalling <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>In order to rationalise the functional consequences of palmitoylation of TP&#x003b2; we present a model, as outlined in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>, whereby it is proposed that palmitoylation of TP&#x003b2; at Cys<sup>347</sup> and at Cys<sup>373,377</sup> also leads to the formation of a double loop structure within its C-tail domain. In our model, palmitoylation at Cys<sup>347</sup> and membrane insertion leads to the formation of Loop A which, though not obligatory for Gq coupling, leads to more efficient Gq/PLC&#x003b2; activation and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> mobilization. On the other hand, palmitoylation at the couplet Cys<sup>373,377</sup>, leads to the formation of Loop B or C, depending on whether Cys<sup>347</sup> is also palmitoylated or not, respectively (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). Whilst palmitoylation at Cys<sup>373,377</sup> is essential for tonic internalization, palmitoylation at both Cys<sup>347</sup> and Cys<sup>373,377</sup>, leading to the formation of Loops A and B, is required for agonist-induced internalization. In investigating the mechanism of agonist-induced internalization of TP&#x003b2;, Parent et al., established that amino acid residues between 355 and 366 within its unique C-tail are essential for such &#x003b2;-arrestin-dependent internalization <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Moreover, it has since been established that Ser<sup>357</sup> within the latter internalization domain is a specific target for agonist-dependent G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK)2/3 phosphorylation leading to &#x003b2;-arrestin recruitment and TP&#x003b2; desensitization and internalization <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. It is indeed noteworthy that both the latter agonist-dependent internalization motif and the GRK phospho-target are located between the palmitoylation sites at Cys<sup>347</sup> and Cys<sup>373,377</sup> within the C-tail of TP&#x003b2;. Hence in our model (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>) and as supported by our experimental findings, we propose that palmitoylation of TP&#x003b2; at both Cys<sup>347</sup> and Cys<sup>373,377</sup>, leading to the formation of Loops A and B, would expose the agonist-induced internalization motif and GRK phosphorylation site at Ser<sup>357</sup> thereby enabling &#x003b2;-arrestin recruitment. Whilst formation of Loop C by palmitoylation at Cys<sup>373,377</sup> alone, as observed in TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347S</sup>, may also expose the internalization motif and GRK site at Ser<sup>357</sup>, we propose that the C-tail is in an altered, less favorable conformation for &#x003b2;-arrestin interaction and with reduced affinity for &#x003b2;-arrestin binding. Hence, palmitoylation of Cys<sup>373,377</sup> alone, as in the case of TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347S</sup>, yields a receptor with impaired agonist-induced internalization owing to its reduced affinity for &#x003b2;-arrestin1/2. Consistent with this, through our experimental observations, over-expression of either &#x003b2;-arrestin1/2 overcame this reduced affinity by TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347S</sup> and facilitated its internalization in response to U46619-stimulation to levels that were indistinguishable from those of the wild type TP&#x003b2;. Moreover, our immunolocalization data supported the agonist-dependent recruitment of GFP-tagged forms of &#x003b2;-arrestin1 and &#x003b2;-arrestin2 to both the agonist-activated TP&#x003b2; and TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347S</sup> but not to TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347,373,377S</sup>, for example.</p><p>Our proposed model accounting for the role of palmitoylation in the regulation of &#x003b2;-arrestin-dependent agonist-induced internalization of TP&#x003b2; is consistent with a number of other studies. In the case of the V2 vasopressin receptor, for example, Charest and Bouvier established that palmitoylation enhances the &#x003b2;-arrestin recruitment to the activated V2R, facilitating internalization and other processes requiring the scaffolding action of &#x003b2;-arrestin including activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In contrast, other studies demonstrated that palmitoylation may actually inhibit &#x003b2;-arrestin interaction <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. For example, palmitoylation of the luteinizing hormone/human chorionic gonadotropin receptor physically hinders receptor:&#x003b2;-arrestin interaction such that the palmitoylation status of the receptor determines whether internalization actually proceeds through a &#x003b2;-arrestin-dependent or independent mechanism <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>.</p><p>Whilst TP&#x003b2; undergoes agonist-induced internalization via a dynamin-, GRK2/3- and &#x003b2;-arrestin-dependent mechanism, requiring an active or dynamic actin cytoskeleton <xref rid="bib34 bib35 bib36" ref-type="bibr">[34&#x02013;36]</xref>, tonic internalization is reported to occur, at least in part, through a dynamin-dependent mechanism with no requirement for either GRK phosphorylation or the &#x003b2;-arrestins <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. In studies investigating the determinants of tonic internalization, Parent et al., identified the presence of a tonic internalization motif Y<sup>339</sup>X<sub>3</sub>&#x003a6;<sup>343</sup>, where X is any residue and &#x003a6; is a bulky hydrophobic isoleucine, within the C-tail domain of TP&#x003b2;. Hence, the critical residues required for tonic internalization lie between residues 339 and 343 in close proximity to the Cys<sup>347</sup> within the proposed Loop A structure associated with TP&#x003b2; (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). Hence, it is tempting to speculate that palmitoylation at Cys<sup>347</sup> may modulate tonic internalization of TP&#x003b2;. Our experimental finding that TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347S</sup>, in addition to the wild type TP&#x003b2;, undergoes tonic internalization suggests that the conformation of Loop C is sufficient to present or orientate the latter motif for internalization to occur. However, the fact that TP&#x003b2;<sup>C373,377S</sup> which contains Loop A, but not Loop B, does not undergo tonic internalization leads us to propose that other unidentified sequence determinants within Loop B, associated with TP&#x003b2;, may also be required for efficient tonic internalization and that the conformation of Loop C may also orientate those sequences to facilitate that internalization. The identities of those additional sequences required for tonic internalization remain to be established.</p><p>In summary, various studies have indicated that many GPCRs are palmitoylated and that the functional consequences are diverse between receptors <xref rid="bib3 bib4 bib5" ref-type="bibr">[3&#x02013;5]</xref>. In this study we have established that TP&#x003b2;, but not TP&#x003b1;, is palmitoylated and that palmitoylation occurs at distinct 2 sites, Cys<sup>347</sup> and Cys<sup>373,377</sup>, within its unique C-tail domain. Whilst palmitoylation at Cys<sup>347</sup> is required for efficient Gq/PLC&#x003b2; effector coupling, palmitoylation at Cys<sup>373,377</sup> is essential for receptor internalization, with palmitoylation at Cys<sup>347</sup> acting as a structural determinant of the route by which the receptor is internalized, be it &#x003b2;-arrestin-dependent or independent internalization. Due to the importance of TXA<sub>2</sub> in vascular hemostasis, a clearer understanding of how the TP isoforms are differentially regulated is critical. Palmitoylation provides a dynamic and reversible post-translational modification that can regulate TP&#x003b2;, in terms of its signalling, receptor desensitization and internalization and, as such, acts as a major determinant of TP&#x003b2; function. Moreover, data presented herein provide a further rational explanation for the clear functional and mechanistic differences between the TP&#x003b1; and TP&#x003b2; isoforms.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was supported by grants to BTK from the Wellcome Trust and The Health Research Board (Ireland).

Thereafter, the HA-tagged receptors were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA 101R and resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by electroblotting onto PVDF membrane.

Palmitoylation of TP&#x003b2; occurs at 2 distinct sites through the attachment of palmitates at Cys<sup>347</sup> and Cys<sup>373/377</sup>. Following palmitoylation, it is proposed that membrane insertion of the palmitate moieties at Cys<sup>347</sup> and Cys<sup>373/377</sup> leads to the formation of a double loop structure within the C-tail domain of TP&#x003b2; referred to as Loop A and Loop B, respectively. A third conformation of the C-tail of TP&#x003b2; occurs when Cys<sup>373,377</sup>, but not Cys<sup>347</sup>, is palmitoylated resulting in the formation of Loop C, such as is found in TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347S</sup>. TP&#x003b2;<sup>C373,377S</sup> undergoes palmitoylation at Cys<sup>347</sup> resulting in the formation of Loop A only while TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347,373,377S</sup> does not contain Loops A, B or C. It was found that Loop A is required for efficient G&#x003b1;<sub>q</sub>/PLC&#x003b2; coupling as evidenced by the reduced agonist-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> mobilization by TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347S</sup> and TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347,373,377S</sup>. It is proposed that Loop B is required for agonist-induced GRK phosphorylation at Ser<sup>357</sup>, followed by &#x003b2;-arrestin recruitment and TP&#x003b2; internalization, as evidenced by the impaired U46619-induced &#x003b2;-arrestin1/2 recruitment and internalization by TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347S</sup>, TP&#x003b2;<sup>C373,377S</sup> and TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347,373,377S</sup>. Like the wild type TP&#x003b2;, TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347S</sup> (which contains Loop C only) retains the ability to undergo tonic internalization while TP&#x003b2;<sup>C373,377S</sup> (which contains Loop A only) or TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347,373,377S</sup> fails to undergo tonic or agonist-induced internalization. From these latter data, it is proposed that palmitoylation at Cys<sup>373</sup> and/or Cys<sup>377</sup>, resulting in the formation of Loop C only (in TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347S</sup>) or Loop A plus Loop B (in wild type TP&#x003b2;) is necessary to present a tonic internalization motif, such as the proposed Y<sup>339</sup>X<sub>3</sub>&#x003a6;<sup>343</sup><xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, in the correct orientation for interaction with the internalization machinery.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr9"/></fig><table-wrap position="float" id="tbl1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Radioligand binding assays</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2" valign="top">Cell lines</th><th valign="top"><italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub><hr/></th><th valign="top"><italic>B</italic><sub>max</sub><hr/></th></tr><tr><th valign="top">nM&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;S.E.M.</th><th valign="top">pmol/mg protein&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;S.E.M.</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">HEK.TP&#x003b2;</td><td align="char" valign="top">8.44&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.44</td><td align="char" valign="top">3.24&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.33</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">HEK.TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347S</sup></td><td align="char" valign="top">7.81&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;3.22</td><td align="char" valign="top">4.16&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.86</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">HEK.TP&#x003b2;<sup>C373S</sup></td><td align="char" valign="top">8.21&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;3.10</td><td align="char" valign="top">4.93&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.05</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">HEK.TP&#x003b2;<sup>C373,377S</sup></td><td align="char" valign="top">8.57&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.44</td><td align="char" valign="top">4.16&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.06</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">HEK.TP&#x003b2;<sup>C347,373,377S</sup></td><td align="char" valign="top">8.00&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.41</td><td align="char" valign="top">4.60&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.30</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Saturation radioligand binding isotherms were carried out on HEK 293 cells stably over-expressing HA epitope-tagged forms of TP&#x003b2; and its variants using the TP antagonist [<sup>3</sup>H] SQ29,548 (50.4&#x000a0;Ci/mmol, 0&#x02013;40&#x000a0;nM) and 75&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of whole cell protein/assay.
