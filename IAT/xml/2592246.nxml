As originally noted by Trimmer and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], the Kv2.1 delayed rectifier is expressed primarily in the somatic region of hippocampal neurons where it is found in cell surface clusters that can co-localize with ryanodine receptors and SR-like subsurface cisterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Interestingly, these clusters also co-localize with cholinergic synapses in spinal motor neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Kv2.1 represents the predominant delayed rectifier current in hippocampal neurons where its activity and localization are highly regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Glutamate or carbachol treatments induce both Kv2.1 dephosphorylation and declustering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Both treatments also result in a 20 mV hyperpolarizing shift in the activation curve for I<sub>K</sub>. Chemically-induced ischemia also induces declustering, dephosphorylation, and the hyperpolarizing shift in the activation midpoint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Similar regulation is observed in Kv2.1 transfected HEK cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. These data suggest a strong link between cluster formation, channel phosphorylation, and the voltage-dependence of activation. The increase in channel activity that is linked to declustering has been proposed to be a neuro-protective response to hypoxia/ischemic insult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, Kv2.1 trafficking to the cell surface is also implicated in cortical neuron apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], emphasizing that the trafficking and regulation of Kv2.1 must be under tight physiological control.</p><p>While it is commonly assumed that ion channel localization must involve static tethering to scaffolding proteins that in turn are linked directly to the cytoskeleton, our recent studies indicate that the Kv2.1 surface clusters are formed when mobile Kv2.1 channels are corralled behind a cortical actin-based fence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This sub-membrane fence is selective towards only the confined channels, with other membrane proteins being free to cross it. Thus, the Kv2.1-containing surface clusters represent a new mechanism for the stable localization of ion channel proteins to specific cell surface domains. Our previous studies also indicate that the surface clusters are specialized surface sites for the membrane insertion of Kv2.1 channels, functioning as intracellular trafficking vesicle targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. During the course of our studies we often observed GFP-Kv2.1 clusters forming in a single proximal neurite of a transfected hippocampal neuron. While the expression of Kv2.1 within the axon initial segment (AIS) of cultured hippocampal neurons has previously been referred to as a tissue culture artifact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], AIS localization was often the only cell surface expression observed in an individual cell. The study presented here was initiated by this apparent contradiction between the literature and our data obtained in hippocampal neurons transfected with GFP-Kv2.1.</p><p>We report here that both transfected and endogenous Kv2.1 often show a real preference for the AIS in cultured hippocampal neurons. The Kv2.1 clusters within the AIS are similar to those found on the cell body in that they consist of mobile channels trapped by a perimeter fence. However, perhaps due to the sub-membrane diffusion barriers in the AIS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], the clusters themselves appear to be more confined than their cell body counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Kv2.1 concentration within the AIS also occurs in both cortical and hippocampal neurons of adult brain, confirming that AIS localization is not a tissue culture artifact. AIS-localized Kv2.1 is predicted to regulate both the frequency and back propagation of the axonal action potential.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Exogenously expressed Kv2.1 targets to the axon initial segment in cultured hippocampal neurons before accumulating on the soma</title><p>Our initial imaging experiments involved expressing GFP and HA epitope-tagged Kv2.1 (EGFP-Kv2.1-HA) in rat hippocampal neurons grown in culture for 7&#x02013;9 days. The extracellular HA epitope allowed detection of surface channel via the binding of an anti-HA Alexa-594-conjugated antibody to living cells as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In contrast to the expected soma and proximal neurite expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], 85% of neurons expressing EGFP-Kv2.1-HA exhibited surface accumulation at only one of the proximal neurites at 6 h post transfection (see arrows in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, 6 h). This targeting of Kv2.1 to a single proximal neurite was observed with little or no clustering on the cell body. In neurons expressing Kv2.1 for 18 h, surface clusters within the soma (arrowheads) became more apparent relative to that observed at 6 h postransfection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, 18 h). By 24 h after transfection, the classic distribution of Kv2.1 into compact surface clusters was observed on the cell body along with expression in proximal neurites. However, Kv2.1 surface density remained the greatest in a single proximal neurite (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, 24 h). Note that the majority of the cell body GFP fluorescence at the 6 h and 18 h time points most likely represents ER-localized channel. These representative data, showing that expressed Kv2.1 is targeted to a single proximal neurite prior to clustering at other surface somato-dendritic sites, suggest that Kv2.1 may have a preference for the axon initial segment (AIS) and may be targeted to this region via a mechanism distinct from the one responsible for delivery to somatic sites.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Surface accumulation of transfected Kv2.1 in a single neurite</bold>. Hippocampal neurons transfected with EGFP-Kv2.1-HA for 6, 18 and 24 h were labeled with Alexa 594-conjugated anti-HA monoclonal antibody 30 min prior to live cell imaging. Shown are representative maximum projection images comprised of multiple 0.3 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m optical sections for total EGFP-Kv2.1-HA (green, GFP signal) and surface (red, Alexa 594 anti-HA antibody binding). Kv2.1 surface clusters were observed exclusively in single a proximal neurite as early as 6 hours after transfection (arrows). At 18 and 24 hours post-transfection, the appearance of surface somato-dendritic clustering became apparent (arrowheads).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2202-9-112-1"/></fig><p>A defining characteristic of the AIS in hippocampal neurons is the enrichment of ankyrinG (AnkG) in the first 20&#x02013;40 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m of the unmyelinated axon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In addition, MAP2 immuno-reactivity is greatly reduced within the axon but is maintained within dendrites and the cell body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Thus, MAP2 and AnkG expression were used to define the AIS in our culture system. Neurons transfected with EGFP-Kv2.1-HA were fixed approximately 18 h after transfection and immuno-stained for MAP2 or AnkG as illustrated in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. The clustering of Kv2.1 in the proximal segment of a neurite with reduced MAP2 labeling suggests this neurite is likely to develop into the axon and therefore the proximal AIS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). However, a stronger indication that the region of Kv2.1 accumulation is indeed the AIS is the AnkG staining shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>. Consistent with AIS formation in hippocampal cultures, Nav1.2 co-localized with AnkG and was enriched in areas devoid of MAP2 staining in parallel cultures (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>The single proximal neurite containing Kv2.1 corresponds to the axon initial segment</bold>.

To confirm that Kv2.1 is indeed a component of the AIS in hippocampal cultures, non-transfected cells were immuno-stained for endogenous Kv2.1 and MAP2. Kv2.1 localization in a single proximal neurite with diminished MAP2 staining, i.e. the AIS (marked by the arrow in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), was observed in 35% of 7 DIV neurons and 63% of 10 DIV neurons (200 neurons examined in each of three experiments). The remaining cells showed no AIS localization and a clustered distribution primarily on the cell soma (arrowhead, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Interestingly, as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, while all cells showed some Kv2.1 localization to the soma, the most intense staining in DIV 7 and 10 cultures was within the proximal axon. As the cells matured, i.e. in 14 and 21 DIV cultures, the cluster intensity within the cell soma became more equivalent to that in the AIS. We observed Kv2.1 expression on MAP2-positive neurites in only 10% of the 7 DIV neurons and 2% of the day 10 and 14 cells. Consistent with reports of multiple axon formation in this culture paradigm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], 5 and 25% of the 7 and 14 DIV cells, respectively, showed Kv2.1 accumulation in two AIS domains. By the 14 DIV time point, approximately 87% of the cells showed dense Kv2.1 expression in one or two AIS domains along with expression over the soma. These expression patterns, and the percentage of cells expressing each pattern, are illustrated in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>. To further establish that the endogenous Kv2.1 accumulates at the AIS, we used antibodies directed against AnkG in conjunction with endogenous Kv2.1 immuno-detection. Consistent with AIS localization of Kv2.1, the sites of clustering within a proximal neurite corresponded with sites of AnkG enrichment (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Endogenous Kv2.1 preferentially accumulates in a MAP2-negative neurite</bold>. Hippocampal cultures grown for 7, 10, 14 and 21 days were fixed and immunostained for endogenous Kv2.1 (green) and the dendritic marker MAP2 (red). At 7 DIV, the strongest labeling for Kv2.1 in these cultures appeared in the proximal portion of a MAP2-negative process (arrow) although many neurons exhibited faint clusters evenly dispersed over the cell body and proximal neurites (arrowhead). Shown in the right hand panels are maximum projection images corresponding to Kv2.1 staining from the boxed regions. In the majority of neurons, the neurite with intense Kv2.1 labeling corresponded to the process with the least intense MAP2 staining, indicating the preferential accumulation of Kv2.1 at the proximal axon.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2202-9-112-3"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Heterogeneity within the culture system</title><p>We did observe variability in the endogenous Kv2.1 expression pattern, for 12% of 14 DIV neurons showed no AIS localization. This heterogeneity is not surprising given that hippocampal cultures are heterotypic. Under culture conditions similar to ours, previous reports have placed the amount of pyramidal neurons between 80&#x02013;90% whereas glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)-positive inhibitory interneurons are present at approximately 10&#x02013;15% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Hippocampal cultures were stained with an anti-GAD6 antibody in conjunction with anti-Kv2.1 staining to characterize the distribution of Kv2.1 in interneurons as compared to pyramidal neurons. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, the GAD-positive neurons (white arrowhead) did not exhibit AIS localization of Kv2.1 while the GAD-negative neurons did (orange arrows). GAD-positive neurons did display large Kv2.1 clusters mainly within the cell body as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Together, these data suggest Kv2.1 preferentially targets to the proximal region of the pyramidal neuron axons (white arrows). Consistent with previous reports, 10% of the neurons in our culture were GAD-positive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>GAD-positive cells do not exhibit Kv2.1 expression in the AIS</bold>. DIV14 hippocampal neurons were fixed and stained for endogenous Kv2.1 and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) to identify inhibitory neurons. The orange arrows indicate the GAD-negative neurons while the white arrowhead points to a GAD-positive cell. The white arrows indicate the AIS-localized Kv2.1 associated with the GAD-negative neurons. These results are consistent with Kv2.1 localization to the AIS only in excitatory, GAD-negative pyramidal neurons.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2202-9-112-4"/></fig></sec><sec><title>AIS localized Kv2.1 clusters are stable structures containing mobile, but diffusion limited, channels</title><p>Our previous work with the Kv2.1 clusters on the soma shows that while these structures are stable, they are also highly dynamic, often fusing and fragmenting over several min (see Movie S7 from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]). To address the long term stability of the AIS localized Kv2.1 clusters, we utilized a photoactivatable form of GFP (PAGFP) fused to the N-terminus of Kv2.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. We co-transfected 7 DIV hippocampal neurons with equal amounts of mRFP-Kv2.1 and PAGFP-Kv2.1-HA and performed live cell image acquisition the following day. Taking advantage of the tetrameric nature of Kv channels, the mRFP-Kv2.1 construct was included solely to localize the AIS targeted channel for photoactivation. The AIS localized mRFP/PAGFP-Kv2.1 was selected for photoactivation under RFP optics (rectangle, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) and successive imaging was performed every two minutes thereafter. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, the photo-activated Kv2.1 within the AIS remained within the activation area and did not significantly re-distribute over the 42 min imaging period. There was no decrease in total AIS associated GFP fluorescence over the imaging period (8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>verses 9.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>arbitrary units for the Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> example). These results imply that the Kv2.1 AIS clusters show little lateral diffusion within the membrane and that the channels contained within the AIS have residence times that will be measured in hours as opposed to minutes.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Kv2.1 clusters within the AIS are stable</bold>. Shown is a hippocampal neuron co-transfected with a 1:1 ratio of mRFP-Kv2.1 and PAGFP-Kv2.1-HA plasmid DNA.

The middle row illustrates the PA-GFP signal immediately after photoactivation and at two representative time points (min:sec). The bottom row contains enlargements of the activated PA-GFP following photoactivation. Only small changes in cluster size and position occurred over the imaging period.

The imaging interval was 2 min.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2202-9-112-5"/></fig><p>Our previous studies demonstrated that the Kv2.1 surface clusters on the hippocampal cell body are formed not by the tethering of individual channels to sub-membrane scaffolding proteins but rather by the trapping of mobile channels behind a cytoskeletal-based corral [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Given the stable nature of the AIS clusters illustrated in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, we next sought to determine whether a similar localization mechanism existed within the AIS. As in our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], we used FRAP within the cluster to address Kv2.1 mobility within the cluster perimeter. As illustrated in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, when one half of an AIS cluster was photo-bleached, GFP fluorescence recovery occurred rapidly with a time constant of 11.1 sec in this representative example. Overall, the mean time constant was 10.4 &#x000b1; 4.8 sec, n = 7. These time constants are nearly identical to the 11.5 &#x000b1; 6.1 sec value observed within clusters on the neuronal cell body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. This recovery, along with the corresponding decrease in fluorescence in the unbleached cluster half, is indicative of channel mobility within the cluster perimeter and is most consistent with mobile channels being restrained behind a perimeter fence in the AIS just as they are on the cell body.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>FRAP analysis indicates Kv2.1 channels are mobile within the AIS cluster perimeter</bold>.

To demonstrate that the robust AIS localization observed in our culture system is physiologically relevant, we undertook immuno-localization studies in rat brain. While Kv2.1 immuno-localization within the rat brain had been previously undertaken by several investigators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], including ourselves (unpublished results), there was no previous suggestion that Kv2.1 exists within the AIS, probably due to the difficulty in identifying the relatively narrow AIS domains within the dense cell body layers of the hippocampus. However, as illustrated in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, the use of AnkG staining to identify the AIS (arrows) greatly simplifies matters. Within the hippocampal CA2 layer, Kv2.1 clusters localized over the neuronal cell body as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, panels A-D). However, a linear array of Kv2.1 clusters was also observed within the boundaries of the AnkG positive AIS (arrows), up to 20 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m from the cell body (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, panel C inset). Consistent with the localization observed in our cultures of hippocampal neurons, not all the ankyrinG-defined AIS domains contained Kv2.1 clusters (arrowhead, panel C). AIS localization was also observed within the CA1 layer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, panel CA1) and CA3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, panel CA3). Surprisingly, Kv2.1 immuno-localization was not detected in hippocampal sections prior to postnatal day 21. While channel might be diffusely expressed at these earlier developmental time points, the clustered localization typical of adult tissue was never observed. In adult tissue, the percentage of samples showing Kv2.1 positive AIS domains in the CA1, CA2, and CA3 hippocampal layers were 85 (n = 13), 64 (n = 11), and 100% (n = 17), respectively.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Localization of Kv2.1 clusters to the AIS of hippocampal neurons <italic>in situ</italic></bold>. Postnatal day 21 rat brains were formaldehyde-fixed, cryosectioned and immuno-stained with a polyclonal antibody against Kv2.1 and a monoclonal antibody against ankyrin G as described in Methods. The anti-Kv2.1 antibody was detected with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (green) while the anti-AnkG monoclonal antibody was detected with Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary (red).

Single optical sections of either Kv2.1 or ankyrinG immuno-staining are shown in panels A and B, respectively. Panel C shows the overlay of these two images with the arrowhead pointing to an AIS domain with little or no Kv2.1 immuno-reactivity. However, as the insert containing a magnification of the boxed region indicates, Kv2.1 was most often found in the ankyrinG-positive AIS.

However, the data presented above indicate that both transfected and endogenous Kv2.1 often preferentially target to the AIS prior to accumulating at somatic cluster sites. Most importantly, we routinely detected AIS localization of Kv2.1 in the hippocampus and cortex of adult rats, suggesting a role for Kv2.1 in regulating axon excitability <italic>in vivo</italic>. The AIS-localized Kv2.1 channels reside within clusters similar to those found on the soma in that mobile channels are corralled within a perimeter fence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, the clusters themselves appear to be more stable within the AIS as compared to their cell body counterparts, consistent with ideas that cytoskeletal structures restrict the diffusion of membrane components within the AIS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Our results indicate that transfected Kv2.1 accumulates at the AIS of hippocampal neurons prior to other cell surface sites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Endogenous channel also concentrates at the AIS in 7 and 10 DIV neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Given that the Kv2.1 surface clusters are sites where trafficking vesicles deliver channel to the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], it is possible that vesicles containing newly synthesized Kv2.1 are delivered first to the AIS. A fraction of the AIS localized channel could then be internalized and redistributed over the soma. Another possibility is that Kv2.1 is inserted into the soma membrane and then diffuses into the AIS clusters where it becomes trapped. Such a diffusion-trap mechanism has been proposed for voltage-gated Na<sup>+ </sup>channels that are AIS localized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Alternatively, perhaps delivery occurs equally at the AIS and soma sites but since the AIS is the only neurite receiving the nascent channel, and the newly inserted channel is diluted over all the soma sites, we are left with only the appearance of selective AIS insertion. Future experiments will distinguish between these possibilities.</p><p>More than 87% of 14 DIV neurons demonstrate endogenous Kv2.1 concentration at the AIS. Why this localization has not been observed by other investigators is unclear. Perhaps subtle differences in tissue culture conditions could account for the discrepancy. Previous Kv2.1 localizations in adult brain, as performed by other investigators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and ourselves (unpublished results), also failed to detect Kv2.1 expression in the AIS. It is possible that the AIS localization was missed because without simultaneous ankyrinG staining and high resolution confocal imaging, it is difficult to identify the AIS structure within the dense layers of neuronal cell bodies in the hippocampus. The finding that not all hippocampal neurons show Kv2.1 localization in the AIS agrees with the Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> data showing a lack of AIS localization in GAD-positive inhibitory neurons.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>While a high concentration of sodium channels at the AIS ensures axonal action potential generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], it is not clear what role Kv2.1 plays in this specialized cell surface domain. Kv2.1 has slow activation kinetics and is therefore unlikely to contribute significantly to repolarization during a single action potential. However, Kv2.1 could regulate axonal excitability following trains of action potentials, for studies by McBain and co-workers indicate that reduction of Kv2.1 in pyramidal neurons results in a broadening of the action potential waveform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Recently, the Kv2.2 channel, which cannot form heterotetrameric complexes with Kv2.1, has been localized to the AIS of neurons in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Kv2.2, which is functionally similar to Kv2.1, is proposed to enhance the recovery of AIS sodium channels from the inactive state by hyperpolarizing the membrane potential during repetitive action potential firing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Kv2.1 could be performing a similar function. In addition, concentration of Kv2.1 at the AIS could regulate the back-propagation of depolarization into the soma. Given that multiple phosphorylation sites within the Kv2.1 C-terminus influence the voltage-dependence of activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], the phosphorylation of AIS-localized Kv2.1 provides a mechanism to regulate axonal excitability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Primary hippocampal cell cultures</title><p>Neurons from embryonic day 18 rat pups were cultured as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].

For live cell acquisition, the objective and microscope stage were maintained at 37&#x000b0;C. Prior to imaging, media was replaced with pre-warmed Hepes-buffered (25 mM) Neurobasal medium containing B-27 supplement (Invitrogen). GFP was excited using the 488 nm line of an Ar laser set at 0.1 &#x02013; 0.5% transmission and emission collected using the variable bandpass filter set at 500&#x02013;550 nm. A 60&#x000d7;, 1.4 NA oil immersion objective was used for imaging and the pinhole diameter set for 1 Airy Unit. For each image, the detector voltage was adjusted as necessary to utilize the full 12-bit linear range. For the imaging of individual Kv2.1-containing clusters, an optical zoom of 8&#x02013;10 &#x000d7; was often used. Images were acquired every 0.5 &#x02013; 120 seconds as indicated at either 512 &#x000d7; 512 or 1024 &#x000d7; 1024 resolution. Cells were imaged for less than one hour on the microscope stage.</p><p>For FRAP analysis of GFP-Kv2.1 within the cluster perimeter, a circular region of interest (ROI) containing approximately half of the cluster area was photobleached using the SIM scanner of the Olympus FV1000 in tornado scan mode with a 405 nm diode laser at 12&#x02013;20% transmission for 0.5&#x02013;1 seconds as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].
