Although molecules that synergize with Wnt proteins have been uncovered, none act as agonists in the absence of Wnts. This characteristic appears to be unique to Wnts.

This may indeed only by accomplished by Wnt protein in the proper configuration and not by other molecules.

These data hint at an appealing hypothesis: liposomal packaging mimics the method by which Wnts are normally secreted from cells. Four lines of experimental evidence support this conclusion. First, liposomal packaging potentiates the activity of purified Wnt3a. Second, Wnt antagonists that are effective against purified protein and are ineffective against Wnt secreted from cells are also ineffective against liposomal Wnt. This selective antagonism is likely due to interactions between the antagonists and a region of the Wnt protein that is available in its purified state, but hidden when Wnt is secreted in a paracrine manner or if Wnt is associated with a liposome. Third, liposomal Wnt3a increases reporter activity <italic>in vivo</italic> but does not alter the distribution of Wnt responsive cells.
