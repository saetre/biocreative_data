The exact function of Neph3 in the kidney is not known but we have previously shown that the level of Neph3 mRNA is decreased in proteinuric diseases.

Podocytes surround the basement membrane of glomerular capillaries from the outside and present foot processes that are linked to each other with unique cell junction structures, the slit diaphragms (SD). According to the present view, SDs form the final barrier preventing leakage of plasma proteins from circulation to urine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Neph3, also known as filtrin, is a member of the Neph (nephrin-like proteins) family and shows sequence homology and structural similarity to two other Neph proteins, Neph1 and Neph2, and to nephrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. All these are transmembrane proteins that belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In podocytes, Neph3, like other Neph family proteins and nephrin, localizes at the slit diaphragm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Nephrin appears to be a key component of the SD and genetic nephrin deficiency results in the absence of SD and massive proteinuria in humans and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Similarly, in Neph1-deficient mice, the podocyte foot processes are effaced and the mice exhibit severe proteinuria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The function of Neph3 in the kidney is less well known but sequence homology and similar location with other Neph proteins and nephrin suggests that it has shared functions as a structural and signaling component of filtration barrier. In addition, the expression of Neph3 is down-regulated, similarly to nephrin mRNA, in human proteinuric diseases proposing it to have a role in maintaining normal SD structure and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, very little is known about the mechanisms that regulate human Neph genes and the mechanisms behind the transcriptional regulation of Neph3 gene have not been elucidated at all.</p><p>To better understand the role of Neph3 in the SD under normal and pathophysiological conditions, we investigated the transcriptional regulation of Neph3 and identified the key regulatory regions in the Neph3 5' promoter. Further, we show that transcription factors nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-&#x003ba;B) and specificity protein 1 (Sp1) bind to the promoter and are essential in controlling Neph3 expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Features of the upstream region of the human Neph3 gene</title><p>The human Neph3 gene (official HUGO gene name <italic>KIRREL2</italic>) consists of fifteen exons. It locates on chromosome 19q13.12, adjacent to nephrin, and encodes a 107 kDa protein. There are at least 5 different splicing variants of Neph3 that appear to have distinct tissue specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. All known variants have the same transcription start site. Mouse and rat have syntenic Neph3 gene regions in their chromosome locations 7qB1 and 1q21, respectively. We examined approximately 5000 bp 5' flanking region upstream from the Neph3 transcription start site [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AC002133">AC002133</ext-link>]. Neph3 proximal promoter near the transcription start site was noticed to lack a typical TATA and CAAT boxes, but instead found to contain a highly GC-rich area. A CpG island (percentage of C or G: 63.1% and ratio of observed to expected CpG: 0.70) was located around the proximal promoter from -765 to +292 using the Blat tool <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/"/>. CpG islands are generally found in the promoter regions of housekeeping genes and the cytosines within these regions are typically kept unmethylated to allow the expression of the correlated genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The CpG island also includes several GC boxes, detected by MatInspector software (Genomatix), that are important for the expression of many different ubiquitous as well as tissue-specific cellular and viral genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Two primate specific Alu-repetition sequences were identified in the region -3021 to -2795 and from -2544 to -2317 bp upstream from the transcription start site using Genomic repeats tool in Genomatix.</p></sec><sec><title>Location of the active promoter regions</title><p>To locate the minimal sequence responsible for the basal transcription of the human Neph3 gene, a series of luciferase reporter plasmids containing various lengths of the Neph3 5'-flanking region were constructed and transiently transfected into human embryonic kidney cells (A293 cell line) that express Neph3 mRNA endogenously (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, already the Neph3 5' -57 promoter region activated the reporter gene to some extent, but the highest luciferase activity was produced by the Neph3 5' -105 construct. This indicates that the essential regulatory elements necessary for the Neph3 basal level transcription are located within the region of -105 to -57. The constructs Neph3 5' -2260, Neph3 5' -1072, Neph3 5' -536, Neph3 5' -366, Neph3 5' -162 showed approximately the same luciferase activity. Neph3 5' -3877 construct and Neph3 5' -162 construct had significantly lower luciferase activities compared to luciferase activities of Neph3 5' -2260 construct and Neph3 5' -105 construct, respectively, suggesting the presence of repressing transcription factor binding elements in the regions -3877 to -2260 and -162 to -105. Both identified Alu repetition sequences locate in the region from -3021 to -2317 in the Neph3 5' -3877 construct and may also be the reason for the lower activity of this part of the promoter. The longest construct Neph3 5' -5070 produced higher luciferase activity than Neph3 5' -4543 or Neph3 5' -3877 implying that in addition to proximal promoter region from -105 to -57, there is possibly also another, weaker enhancer site in the distal 5' region from -5070 to -3877.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Neph3 mRNA is expressed endogenously in human A293 embryonic kidney cell line and in differentiated human podocytes</bold>.

NF-&#x003ba;B is a transcription factor family consisting of different subunits which function as homo- or heterodimers. Heterodimer consisting of p50 and p65 subunits and p65 homodimer are the well known dimers participating in gene transactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and both p50 and p65 have been shown to be expressed in podocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].

Furthermore, luciferase activity of Neph3 5' -105 construct containing mutated NF-&#x003ba;B binding site was not altered.

Besides the sequence homology of Neph3 with nephrin and other nephrin-like molecules, the known crucial components of the kidney filtration barrier, its structure, location, and down regulation in proteinuric diseases suggest that it plays an important role in maintaining the normal glomerular normal ultrafiltration. The aim of this study was to gain insight into the transcriptional regulation of Neph3 by identifying transcription factors that control Neph3 expression. Using reporter gene constructs, we identified the Neph3 5' promoter region that is essential for the basal level transcription. By computational analysis, the putative transcription factor binding elements for NF-&#x003ba;B and Sp1 in this region were identified within this region and shown to be functional by site-directed mutagenesis. Furthermore, over-expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies indicated that NF-&#x003ba;B and Sp1 indeed activate and bind to Neph3 promoter.</p><p>Sp1 is a member of Sp family of transcription factors which contain a conserved set of Cys<sub>2</sub>-His<sub>2 </sub>zinc-fingers representing a DNA-binding domain.

It can bind to and act through GC boxes to regulate gene expression of many housekeeping, tissue-specific, viral and inducible genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Previously, Sp1 has been shown to play a role in regulating basal level transcription of two other podocyte proteins, CD2-associated protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and podocalyxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Sp1 is a constitutively active transcription factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], and Sp1 binding motifs are shown to be involved in the maintenance of the methylation-free status of the CpG islands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Sp1 response element identified in this study also locates in the CpG island. Therefore, and similarly to the regulation of many other TATA-less genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], we propose that Sp1 functions as a key regulator of the Neph3 gene expression at the basal level.</p><p>NF-&#x003ba;B, a &#x003b2;-scaffold transcription factor family, plays an essential role in the regulation of many genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses, and in cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The subcellular location of NF-&#x003ba;B is controlled by interactions with inhibitory proteins of the I&#x003ba;B family which in response to a large variety of stimuli, such as stress and cytokines, are phosphorylated, ubiquitinated and degraded thereby freeing NF-&#x003ba;B to translocate to the nucleus and to bind DNA at a response element of the consensus sequence 5'-GGGRNNYYCC-3' (R = A or G, N = any nucleotide, Y = C or T) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. NF-&#x003ba;B transcription factors exist as hetero- or homodimers and are formed by different subunits called p50, p52, c-Rel, RelA/p65 and RelB. Heterodimer consisting of p50 and p65 subunits and p65 homodimer are the well known dimers and the most abundant ones in most cell types, including podocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] In our co-transfection experiments NF-&#x003ba;B p65 subunit together with Neph3 reporter gene construct resulted in a significant increase in Neph3 promoter activity. Similarly, the overexpression of p65 subunit increased endogenous Neph3 mRNA to some extend (p &#x0003c; 0.05). Interestingly, overexpression of p50 and p65 subunits together resulted in a high increase in the Neph3 mRNA level, but the results from the reporter gene assay did not show further increase in promoter activation by combination of p50 and p65. In addition, we could not detect p50 binding to the promoter in the ChIP assay. It might be that in the chromosomal context of the endogenous gene the p50 subunit binds the promoter and activates the Neph3 expression together with p65 although this is not seen with reporter gene constructs or fragmented chromosomes used in ChIP. However, based on these results it is difficult to conclude whether it is p65 homodimer or p50/p65 heterodimer that activates the transcription of the Neph3. Most likely, different NF-&#x003ba;B subunits may heterodimerize with p65 and regulate the expression of Neph3 in different ways under various (patho)physiological conditions.</p><p>We have previously shown that Neph3 mRNA is decreased in the kidneys of the diabetic nephropathy patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In line with this, nephrin mRNA has been shown to be downregulated in human diabetic nephropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and in addition, during the development of diabetic nephropathy in a rat model, nephrin mRNA is first transiently increased and later down-regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Interestingly, the activation and nuclear translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B subunits p50 and p65 have been demonstrated in human diabetic nephropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. This, together with our results showing that NF-&#x003ba;B regulates Neph3 expression at the basal level (this study), prompts for further studies investigating whether NF-&#x003ba;B plays a role in the regulation of Neph3 (and possibly also other Neph family members and nephrin) under diabetic conditions.</p><p>The studies with renal biopsies from patients with acquired human glomerular diseases show correlation, besides in the mRNA expression of Neph3 and nephrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], also in the mRNA expression of nephrin and other podocyte-expressed genes, including synaptopodin and &#x003b1;-actinin-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. This suggests that common regulatory mechanisms may be activated in proteinuric glomerular diseases. Neph3 locates on the same chromosome as nephrin, 19q13.12, where these genes are arranged in a head-to-head orientation separated by a 5-kb region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The genomic arrangement of Neph3 and nephrin together with their similar structure and location, in addition to the correlation in the mRNA expression of various podocyte-expressed genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] proposes that Neph3 and other podocyte genes may share key features in their regulation. However, whether NF-&#x003ba;B and Sp1 control the expression of nephrin or other podocyte genes is yet to be clarified.</p><p>Besides NF-&#x003ba;B and Sp1, additional transcription factors, both activating and inhibiting, are likely to participate in the regulation of Neph3. It has been shown that at least transcription factor Wilms tumor-1, Snail, retinoic acid receptors and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors regulate nephrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], and could be involved also in Neph3 regulation. Interestingly, Sp1 has been demonstrated to interact with NF-&#x003ba;B, and cooperative functional and physical interactions between Sp1 and NF-&#x003ba;B have been shown to be required for example, for HIV-1 enhancer activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Our co-trasfection assays with Sp1 and NF-&#x003ba;B in A293 cells didn't show any activation of the Neph3 promoter co-operatively between Sp1 and NF-&#x003ba;B (data not shown). However, Sp1 overexpression studies are not feasible in mammalian cell lines because of their high endogenous level of Sp1, which may be near saturating with regard to induction of reporter gene expression. Regardless, it is possible that NF-&#x003ba;B and Sp1 function cooperatively in the Neph3 gene regulation at the endogenous level. In addition to kidney, Neph3 is also expressed in other tissues including the &#x003b2;-cells of the pancreas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] and in the developing central nervous system in the brain where it is transiently expressed in early postmitotic neural precursor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. It is suggested that in pancreas and in brain Neph3 is involved in maintaining cell-cell contacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], but the exact function of Neph3 in these tissues has not yet been elucidated. Different splicing variants of Neph3 also appear to have distinct tissue specificity. Whether NF-&#x003ba;B and Sp1 also regulate Neph3 expression and the production of its different splicing variants in non-renal tissues remains to be elucidated.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, in this study we show that the main activating regulatory region of the Neph3 gene locates in its proximal promoter region between nucleotides -105 and -57. Further, we show that transcription factors Sp1 and NF-&#x003ba;B bind to this promoter region and are involved in the transcriptional regulation of the Neph3 gene at the basal level in podocytes, therefore providing new insight into the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the expression of Neph3 gene.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cloning of a DNA segment between NPHS1 and Neph3 genes</title><p>Human genomic DNA was isolated from blood using AquaPure Genomic DNA Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).
