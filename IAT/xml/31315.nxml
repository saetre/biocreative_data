One of the main DNA repair pathways is base excision repair (BER) which is initiated by DNA glycosylases that excise damaged bases, followed by incision of the generated abasic (AP) sites. We have studied human and rat methylpurine-DNA glycosylase (MPG), uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG), and the major AP endonuclease (HAP1&#x0002f;APEX) in male germ cells. Enzymatic activities and western analyses indicate that these enzymes are present in human and rat male germ cells in amounts that are at least as high as in somatic cells. Minor differences were observed between different cellular stages of rat spermatogenesis and spermiogenesis. Repair of methylated DNA was also studied at the cellular level using the Comet assay. The repair was highly efficient in both human and rat male germ cells, in primary spermatocytes as well as round spermatids, compared to rat mononuclear blood cells or hepatocytes. This efficient BER removes frequently occurring DNA lesions that arise spontaneously or via environmental agents, thereby minimising the number of potential mutations transferred to the next generation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Male germ cells pass their DNA on to the next generation and an efficient surveillance of the integrity of their genome is crucial for healthy offspring. DNA repair activity in male germ cells may be different from that in somatic cells, since meiosis and spermatogenesis are characterised by a number of changes affecting the structural and functional organisation of the genome. The expression of DNA repair enzymes in male germ cells is largely unknown, whereas in somatic cells expression of certain repair enzymes varies according to the cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c4">4</xref>). In another article in this issue we show that nucleotide excision repair (NER) appears to be suppressed or lacking in male germ cells from rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c6">6</xref>). There is reason to believe that other pathways of repair are functional in male germ cells based on the induced unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) following treatment with DNA damaging agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c8">8</xref>). Furthermore, DNA single-strand and double-strand breaks are efficiently repaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c11">11</xref>).</p><p> Base excision repair (BER) is a major pathway for removal of DNA lesions arising from endogenous processes as well as those induced by exposure to exogenous chemicals and irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c12">12</xref>). BER is initiated by DNA glycosylases that excise aberrant bases from DNA by cleavage of the <italic>N</italic>-glycosidic bond linking the base to its deoxyribose sugar. DNA glycosylases are specific with regard to their substrate; each enzyme removes only a particular set of DNA lesions. The generated apurinic&#x0002f;apyrimidinic (AP) sites are incised by specific endonucleases, inappropriate ends are removed, the missing bases are filled by DNA polymerases and nicks are ultimately sealed by DNA ligases. The BER pathway involves the replacement of one (short patch BER) or several nucleotides (long patch BER) at the site of the lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c13">13</xref>).</p><p> The DNA of human cells may be alkylated by endogenous methylating agents or by exposure to cigarette smoking, industrial chemicals or cancer chemotherapeutic agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c15">15</xref>). In human and rat somatic cells, methylpurine-DNA glycosylase (MPG) catalyses the excision of a variety of modified bases, including <italic>N</italic>-methylpurines, hypoxanthine (Hx) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c16">16</xref>), and 1,<italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-ethenoadenine (&#x0025b;A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c18">18</xref>). MPG has been detected in a wide variety of organisms including man (hMPG) and rat (rMPG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c20">20</xref>).</p><p> Uracil (U) represents an endogenous DNA lesion arising from deamination of cytosine or incorporation of U instead of T during DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c21">21</xref>). Deamination of cytosine leads to U:G mispairs at a frequency of 100&#x02013;500 events per cell per day, ultimately producing C:G&#x02192;T:A transitions if not repaired prior to replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c22">22</xref>). U residues may also be induced by methotrexate treatment or dietary folate deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c25">25</xref>). U is predominantly removed by uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c28">28</xref>). A number of other enzymes, such as the single-strand-selective monofunctional UNG (SMUG1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c29">29</xref>), also possess U-excising activities, but these seem to play a minor role, although they are important as back-up enzymes in UNG-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c31">31</xref>).</p><p> AP sites are formed in high numbers by the spontaneous hydrolysis of bases generating the loss of up to 10 000 purines per day per mammalian cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c32">32</xref>). In addition, AP sites arise by exposure of cells to DNA damaging agents or by removal of bases by DNA glycosylases. They are non-instructional to the DNA polymerases and are potentially pro-mutagenic. They can inhibit DNA synthesis and, as a consequence, induce cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c33">33</xref>).</p><p> We have studied BER in male germ cells from specific stages of spermatogenesis from rats and from human testis biopsies. Here we report on the activities of the DNA repair enzymes MPG, UNG&#x0002f;SMUG1 and AP-endonuclease I (HAP1&#x0002f;APEX) in cellular extracts using DNA substrates containing selected DNA lesions. Furthermore, repair proteins have been quantified by western analysis and repair of alkylation damage in single cells <italic>ex vivo</italic> was measured by means of the Comet assay. Enriched male germ cell populations and a ploidy-specific Comet assay were used to obtain information about cells of different stages of spermatogenesis. The data demonstrate that BER proteins are present and functional in pre- and post-meiotic germ cells from both humans and rats.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Chemicals</title><p>RPMI 1640 culture medium with 25 mM HEPES buffer, <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, and fetal calf serum (FCS) were from Gibco BRL (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK).

Tail moments (the percentage of DNA in the tail multiplied by the tail length, measured from the centre of the nucleus), were used as a quantitative measure of the DNA damage. The total fluorescence (proportional to the DNA content of each comet) was recorded to allow analysis of cells of different ploidy (1C &#x0223c;spermatids; 2C &#x0223c;Sertoli cells, Leydig cells, secondary spermatocytes, leukocytes; 4C &#x0223c;primary spermatocytes).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Enrichment and characterisation of cells</title><p>All human testis biopsies revealed normal spermatogenesis (1C &#x0003e; 2C &#x0003e; 4C) as determined by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c45">45</xref>). Enriched rat male germ cell populations were characterised by flow cytometry and microscopic analysis and contained 50&#x00025; spermatocytes (&#x000b1;15&#x00025;), 93&#x00025; round spermatids (&#x000b1;4&#x00025;) and 94&#x00025; elongating&#x0002f;elongated spermatids (&#x000b1;2&#x00025;).

The viability of cells was &#x0003e;90&#x00025;.</p></sec><sec><title>MPG</title><p>Substrates containing methylated bases, &#x0025b;A or Hx were used to study MPG activity. All extracts from human and rat male germ cells were able to excise methylated bases (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke282f1">1</xref>A). The excision activities were similar in all the enriched rat male germ cells, whereas rat hepatocytes showed 2&#x02013;3-fold lower activities. Human testicular cells exhibited &#x0223c;75&#x00025; higher activity compared to human MNCs. The excision of &#x0025b;A and Hx, both base-paired with T, was measured as cleavage of <sup>32</sup>P-labelled linear double-stranded oligonucleotides containing single DNA lesions (oligonucleotide nick assay) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke282f1">1</xref>). Rat male germ cells exhibited 3&#x02013;7-fold higher &#x0025b;A removal than hepatocytes per &#x000b5;g cellular extract, with primary spermatocytes showing the highest activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke282f1">1</xref>A and B). A similar pattern of incision activities was observed in the rat for Hx (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke282f1">1</xref>A and C). Human testicular cells exhibited very low activities for Hx-removal when enzymatic activity per &#x000b5;g extract was compared between human and rat testicular extracts, even when 5-fold more human than rat extracts were used. These differences were not related to cell viability. The removal of Hx base-paired with A, C or G was also measured in rat male germ cells, and was much lower than for Hx base-paired with T (data not shown).</p><p> A prerequisite for the detection of monofunctional DNA glycosylase activity in the oligonucleotide nick assay is the subsequent incision of AP sites. Since the assays are conducted in the presence of EDTA (no Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>), the only functional incision activities in the extracts are AP-lyase activities such as those of bifunctional DNA glycosylases, and their presence may thus be rate limiting in the oligonucleotide nick assay. Therefore, an excess amount of purified <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> endonuclease IV (Nfo) was added to each reaction (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke282tb1">1</xref>). With Nfo present, the amount of extract required for cleavage of Hx&#x02013;DNA decreased 2-fold for rat and 10-fold for human extracts when compared to reactions without Nfo (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke282tb1">1</xref>). The relative MPG activities were up to 5-fold higher in rats compared to humans. No major relative differences between the various rat male germ cells were observed except for somewhat higher Hx removal by round spermatids. With respect to somatic cells, the Hx removal of rat hepatocytes was similar to that of rat testicular cells. Furthermore, in the presence of Nfo both human testicular and MNC extracts exhibited removal of Hx (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke282tb1">1</xref>), in contrast to the non-detectable activity in the absence of Nfo (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke282f1">1</xref>A and B). The addition of Nfo resulted in increased cleavage of &#x0025b;A DNA. With excess Nfo it was apparent that the incision rates for &#x0025b;A among the various human and rat extracts resembled that for Hx, and also that for the excision of methylated bases.</p><p> Both human and rat male germ cell extracts exhibited MPG as detected by western analysis (Fig. 2). A strong single band at &#x0223c;39 kDa was detected in extracts from the enriched fractions of rat male germ cells, demonstrating high expression of MPG (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke282f2">2</xref>; upper panel). The results indicate that round spermatids express slightly higher amounts of MPG than the other cell types, which was also seen by enzymatic assays in the presence of Nfo (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke282tb1">1</xref>). Rat hepatocytes, on the other hand, expressed very low levels of MPG compared to rat male germ cells. Human extracts exhibited staining of two proteins of different molecular weight, at &#x0223c;32 and &#x0223c;40 kDa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke282f2">2</xref>; lower panel). Their expression varied among the six human testicular extracts, but the expression was, in all cases, substantially higher than in human MNCs. MPG is thus expressed in both human and rat male germ cells, and the expression is higher than in the somatic cell types tested. We note here that extended time periods between dissection of human testis biopsies and preparation of extracts did not lead to degradation of MPG, and that storage of cellular extracts at &#x02013;80&#x000b0;C for different time periods did not affect MPG activity.</p></sec><sec><title>U excision and the presence of UNG</title><p>Extracts from different rat male germ cell types, and also rat hepatocytes, showed similar incision rates for U from U:G in the oligonucleotide nick assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke282f3">3</xref>A). The extracts also incised substrates with U base-paired with A, T or C (data not shown). Three separate human testicular extracts cleaved 25&#x02013;52&#x00025; of a U:G-substrate, compared to 40&#x00025; by human MNCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke282f3">3</xref>B). In general, less human than rat extract was needed to cleave U:G. Furthermore, the addition of Nfo led to increased cleavage of U:G per &#x000b5;g extract, both for human and rat male germ cells (data not shown). Western analyses showed the presence of UNG in both human and rat male germ cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke282f3">3</xref>C). The different rat male germ cells exhibited approximately similar amounts of the mitochondrial UNG1, compared to lower amounts in rat hepatocytes. Rat hepatocytes exhibited staining of a protein of higher molecular weight (38 kDa), which probably represents the cytoplasmic pre-version of UNG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c46">46</xref>). The different human testicular extracts exhibited variable expression of the mitochondrial UNG1, yet they were higher than in human MNCs. Human extracts also expressed variable amounts of the nuclear UNG2, which was non-detectable in rat extracts.</p></sec><sec><title>AP endonuclease</title><p>AP sites are processed by AP endonucleases and the major enzymatic activities in humans and rats are HAP1 and APEX, respectively. The AP endonuclease activity was measured using the oligonucleotide nick assay in the presence of Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, utilising a substrate containing a single synthetic AP site, THF, which functions as a specific DNA substrate for detecting AP-endonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c47">47</xref>). The different rat male germ cell extracts exhibited similar levels of incision activity, whereas in rat hepatocytes they were 2-fold higher (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke282f4">4</xref>A). Human testicular extracts exhibited higher activities than rat extracts, although the activity varied between the different human extracts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke282f4">4</xref>A). Furthermore, human testicular cells showed similar levels of activity as human MNCs. The specific presence of the 37 kDa HAP1 or APEX in both human and rat male germ cells, respectively, were demonstrated by western analyses (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke282f4">4</xref>B). The expression of HAP1 in human testicular cells was variable but always higher than in human MNCs. Rat hepatocytes expressed very low amounts of APEX at the expected molecular weight, but there was an additional band at a higher molecular weight. This may represent an alternative version of APEX.</p></sec><sec><title>Cellular repair of MMS-induced DNA lesions</title><p>The enzymatic activities detected in extracts and western analysis consistently showed that human and rat male germ cells contain functional MPG, UNG&#x0002f;SMUG1 and HAP1&#x0002f;APEX. As a complementary approach we studied repair at the cellular level following treatment with MMS using the Comet assay. The cell types studied showed linear dose&#x02013;effect relationships (data not shown). Rat male germ cells exhibited markedly higher tail moments than the other cell types, when exposed to similar doses of MMS, with 5-fold higher tail moments than human testicular cells at 0.4 mM MMS. To obtain similar levels of initial DNA lesions, the various cell populations were treated with different concentrations of MMS. Efficient repair of methylated DNA was demonstrated in male germ cells from rats and three different humans, and the repair kinetics were broadly similar between the two species (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke282f5">5</xref>A). Within 2 h, these cells repaired 60&#x02013;80&#x00025; of the initial DNA damage. The energy level of rat male germ cells was monitored by measuring the cellular ATP level, and was sustained throughout the 2 h repair periods (data not shown). The repair rates of MNCs and hepatocytes from rats were markedly lower compared to rat male germ cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke282f5">5</xref>B). The Comet assay allows analysis of cells of different ploidy in heterogeneous male germ cell suspensions, thereby facilitating the investigation and comparison of repair capacity between distinct spermatogenic cell types. Grouping the results accordingly demonstrated rapid repair by both rat primary spermatocytes and round spermatids (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke282f5">5</xref>C). Efficient repair was also consistently observed in the two cell types from human testis biopsies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke282f5">5</xref>D). Round spermatids displayed somewhat higher initial tail moments than primary spermatocytes exposed to similar concentrations of MMS both in humans and in rats (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke282f5">5</xref>C and D). However, we have preliminary results showing that primary spermatocytes have apparently 25&#x00025; smaller tail moments than round spermatids at similar doses of X-rays, which induce DNA lesions uniformly (unpublished data).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Cellular repair</title><p>Both human and rat male germ cells efficiently repair MMS-induced DNA lesions with similar repair rates. Furthermore, different spermatogenic cell types, primary spermatocytes and round spermatids, repair MMS-induced DNA lesions. BER thus seems to be proficient throughout spermatogenesis and spermiogenesis. It cannot be excluded, however, that the Comet assay may show repair by other pathways besides BER. The functionality of BER is supported by the presence and activity of BER-related enzymes in human testicular extracts and extracts from the enriched rat male germ cells. UDS in MMS-exposed rat spermatocytes has been shown to be 4&#x02013;25-fold higher <italic>in situ</italic> in cultured seminiferous tubules, in which germ cells maintain their intimate relationship with Sertoli cells, than spermatocytes in suspension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c48">48</xref>), indicating that repair may be even more efficient <italic>in vivo</italic>. The repair rates of male germ cells were markedly higher compared to MNCs and hepatocytes. This is consistent with the lower excision activities and expression of MPG detected by western analysis in somatic compared with male germ cell extracts<italic>.</italic> More efficient BER in male germ cells compared to somatic cells corresponds to the lower spontaneous mutation frequencies of mouse meiotic cells compared to somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c49">49</xref>). Furthermore, it is consistent with the lack of increased mutation rates in male germ cells of Big Blue transgenic mice treated with MMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c50">50</xref>). </p><p> Methylated bases are thought to induce mutations indirectly via the generation of AP sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c51">51</xref>). MMS did not induce mutations in male germ cells of Big Blue transgenic mice even at doses that were lethal to the animal, suggesting efficient DNA repair of the methylated DNA or of the AP sites, although large deletions are not scored by this assay. Methylated bases are of nature labile and will be converted into pre-mutagenic AP sites, and prior to differentiation into spermatozoa, at which stage it is assumed that no repair occurs, efficient repair of such DNA lesions hence reduces the risk of inducing germline mutations. In accordance with the observed cellular repair, extracts of both human and rat male germ cells exhibit activities for the removal of all the DNA substrates tested in this study, and the activities were found to be similar in the different populations of enriched rat male germ cells. Furthermore, the results obtained by western analysis correspond well with the enzymatic activities detected within each species. The variable expression of BER enzymes observed in humans indicates inter-individual differences, which according to our results do not correlate with age, but may reflect genetic variation. Alternatively, such differences may in part be explained by lifestyle factors such as smoking, since MPG is induced to higher levels in smokers compared to non-smokers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c52">52</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>MPG</title><p>The two assays used in this study to measure MPG activity are functionally different; the release of methylated bases is measured directly whereas the excision of &#x0025b;A and Hx requires subsequent incision. The incision capacity (AP-lyase activity) of extracts may thus be rate-limiting when measuring the removal of &#x0025b;A and Hx. The changes in activity with or without Nfo present indicate that human male germ cells and rat hepatocytes contain less AP-lyase activity than rat male germ cells. The increased incision observed in the presence of Nfo may reflect a stimulated release of MPG from AP sites by an AP endonuclease. This has been shown previously for several other DNA glycosylases including UNG, thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG), SMUG1, mammalian adenine-DNA glycosylase (MYH), and human 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase (hOGG1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c53">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c56">56</xref>). The higher MPG activity of rat testicular compared to liver extracts was consistent with previous studies with mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c58">58</xref>). The observed differences in MPG activity between rat and human male germ cell extracts are in accordance with the mouse MPG having 2&#x02013;3-fold higher rates of removal of 3mA and 7mG compared to the human MPG <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c59">59</xref>). Alternatively, the presence of other BER-related proteins may influence the excision&#x0002f;incision rate. One such protein is the human homologue (hHR23) of Rad23, which stimulates the removal of Hx when associated with MPG, and therefore has been proposed as a general DNA damage recognition protein involved in both NER and BER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c60">60</xref>). A recent observation by Kartalou <italic>et al. </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c61">61</xref>) represents another interesting coupling of MPG with NER, in which MPG binds to cisplatin-adducts, representing lesions that are repaired via NER. The high amounts of MPG in male germ cells may thus interfere with a possible residual NER capacity in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c6">6</xref>), contributing to the highly efficient treatment of testicular cancer using cisplatin.</p></sec><sec><title>U excision and the presence of UNG</title><p>Human and rat male germ cells incised U from the U:G-substrate <italic>in vitro</italic>, and the activity may be ascribed to UNG and&#x0002f;or SMUG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c28">28</xref>). UNG plays an important role for the removal of U when base-paired with guanine since &#x0223c;50&#x00025; of the activity is lost in UNG-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c28">28</xref>). The residual activity of such UNG-deficient mice was not inhibited by the Ugi peptide inhibitor, suggesting that SMUG1 is responsible as back-up enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c28">28</xref>). Incision of U in male germ cells was similar to that of somatic cells. As with MPG, the increased cleavage observed in the presence of Nfo could be explained by stimulation of the DNA glycosylase activity in the presence of an AP endonuclease. Both UNG and SMUG1 have been shown to be stimulated by HAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c62">62</xref>). Western analyses confirmed the presence of UNG in human and rat male germ cells, and we propose that the mitochondrial UNG1 is the predominant version in male germ cells in both humans and rats. </p><p> The expression of mRNA for the mitochondrial UNG1 and the nuclear UNG2, both encoded by the same gene, has been measured in various tissues including the testis, which exhibited the highest levels for both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c63">63</xref>). The UNG activity has been reported to be high (per cell number) in DNA- synthesising mouse male germ cells (spermatogonia and preleptotene spermatocytes); meiotic and post-meiotic cells exhibit markedly lower levels of UNG activity with a relative maximum in pachytene spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c64">64</xref>). This is in accordance with our results, since the primary spermatocytes have a higher UNG protein content than the spermatids on a per cell basis, due to the larger size and the higher total DNA and protein content of spermatocytes. The nuclear UNG2, partly localised in replication factories, removes U as it is incorporated into the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c3">3</xref>). The enriched male germ cell populations are non-replicating and hence the need for the replication-associated repair by UNG2 is limited. Another function of UNG in male germ cells may be protection from cytotoxic AP sites, since UNG binds more tightly and rapidly to AP sites than to U in DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c53">53</xref>). It hence appears that male germ cells repair U. This conclusion relies on the observed repair of methylated DNA, combined with the presence of U excising activities in extracts, and UNG detected by western analysis. Additional support for this is the observation that a 180 kDa protein complex isolated from bovine testis is able to conduct the complete U-initiated BER reaction <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c65">65</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>HAP1&#x0002f;APEX</title><p>The AP-endonuclease activity was higher in human than in rat male germ cells, different from the results obtained with both MPG and UNG&#x0002f;SMUG1. Furthermore, rat male germ cells exhibit lower amounts of AP-endonuclease activity than rat hepatocytes. Since male germ cells were able to repair methylated DNA rapidly, the amount of HAP1&#x0002f;APEX seems sufficient for BER under the conditions employed. The level of APEX mRNA expression is reported to be highest in the testis and lowest in the liver of the various organs examined in the rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c66">66</xref>). APEX mRNA is present at modest levels in spermatogonia and spermatocytes, whereas the level in round spermatids is higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c67">67</xref>). HAP1 has a number of other enzymatic functions besides its AP-endonuclease activity. The expression of APEX mRNA is developmentally regulated in the rat testis indicating involvement in processes such as recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c66">66</xref>), and HAP1 is localised in the cytoplasm of spermatocytes unlike the nuclear localisation of most other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke282c69">69</xref>).</p><p> In summary, MPG, UNG and HAP1&#x0002f;APEX are expressed in human and rat male germ cells, and are highly functional towards selected substrates <italic>in vitro</italic>. Furthermore, male germ cells in suspension efficiently repair methylated DNA, indicating functional and efficient BER. Human and rat male germ cells thus appear to be well protected against some of the most common DNA lesions.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gke282f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> MPG activity in male germ cell extracts.
