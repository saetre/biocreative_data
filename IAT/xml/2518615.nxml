However, the mechanism(s) responsible for their appearance remain mostly speculative. Here, we show that in budding yeast, replication accidents, which are most likely transformed into broken forks, play a causal role in the formation of SDs. The Pol32 subunit of the major replicative polymerase Pol&#x003b4; is required for all SD formation, demonstrating that SDs result from untimely DNA synthesis rather than from unequal crossing-over. Although Pol32 is known to be required for classical (Rad52-dependant) break-induced replication, only half of the SDs can be attributed to this mechanism. The remaining SDs are generated through a Rad52-independent mechanism of template switching between microsatellites or microhomologous sequences. This new mechanism, named microhomology/microsatellite-induced replication (MMIR), differs from all known DNA double-strand break repair pathways, as MMIR-mediated duplications still occur in the combined absence of homologous recombination, microhomology-mediated, and nonhomologous end joining machineries. The interplay between these two replication-based pathways explains important features of higher eukaryotic genomes, such as the strong, but not strict, association between SDs and transposable elements, as well as the frequent formation of oncogenic fusion genes generating protein innovations at SD junctions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Duplications of long segments of chromosomes are frequently observed in multicellular organisms (&#x0223c;5&#x00025; of our genome, for instance). They appear as a fundamental trait of the recent genome evolution in great apes and are often associated with chromosomal instability, capable of increasing genetic polymorphism among individuals, but also having dramatic consequences as a source of diseases and cancer. Despite their importance, the molecular mechanisms of formation of segmental duplications remain unclear. Using a specifically designed experimental system in the baker's yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, hundreds of naturally occurring segmental duplications encompassing dozens of genes were selected. With the help of modern molecular methods coupled to detailed genetic analysis, we show that such duplication events are frequent and result from untimely DNA synthesis accidents produced by two distinct molecular mechanisms: the well-known break-induced replication and a novel mechanism of template switching between low-complexity or microhomologous sequences. These two mechanisms, rather than unequal recombination events, contribute in comparable proportions to duplication formation, the latter being prone to create novel gene fusions at chromosomal junctions. The mechanisms identified in yeast could explain the origin of a variety of genetic diseases in human, such as hemophilia A, Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, or some neurological disorders.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In humans, segmental duplications (SD) cover up to 5.2&#x00025; of the genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000175-Bailey1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> and are responsible for numerous gene-dosage imbalances <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000175-Sharp1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, gene fusions and disruption events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000175-Courseaux1">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000175-Courseaux2">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000175-Inoue1">5</xref>.

Although the size of this gene is relatively small (1.6 kb), no single gene duplication was ever found. Instead, only intra- and inter-chromosomal duplications of large DNA segments, encompassing dozens of neighboring genes, were recovered (88&#x00025; and 12&#x00025;, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000175-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000175-Koszul1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. These findings showed that spontaneous SDs can compensate for gene dosage imbalance by altering gene copy number in the yeast genome and that CNVs can encompass numerous genes. Approximately half of the SD junctions involved dispersed repeats such as Long Terminal Repeats (LTRs) from Ty retroposons, while the other half consisted of low complexity DNA sequences (poly A/T, trinucleotide repeats), as well as microhomologous sequences whose identity spans only over a few nucleotides in length. The location and the type of sequences found at the breakpoints suggested that SDs might result from replication accidents improperly repaired through both homologous and non-homologous recombination events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000175-Koszul1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. In order to explore the mechanisms of SD formation, we deciphered how perturbations of the replication process and of double strand break (DSB) repair pathways affect rates, types, sizes and breakpoint sequences of duplications. Providing the largest set of experimentally generated <italic>de novo</italic> duplications, the present study describes 338 independent SDs recovered in different mutant backgrounds and culture conditions. We show that replication-generated DNA ends are converted into large SDs through both homology-dependent and -independent replication-based mechanisms.</p><fig id="pgen-1000175-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000175.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Segmental duplication assays.</title><p>(A) Growth recovery assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000175-Koszul1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

this surprisingly high value, an independent estimation of the duplication rate was achieved by designing a new selection assay based on the recovery of uracil prototrophy instead of growth recovery. In this system, <italic>RPL20A</italic> is not deleted and therefore both parental and duplicated strains show the same growth rate. Two truncated copies of the <italic>URA3</italic> gene, overlapping by only 58 bp, were introduced in place of the two Ty3 LTRs, <italic>YORsigma3</italic> and <italic>YORsigma4</italic> located on either side of <italic>RPL20B</italic> and separated by 115 kb (YKFB614, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000175-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). In the original growth-assay, approximately half of all SDs (48&#x00025;, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000175-Koszul1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>), corresponds to an intra-chromosomal 115 kb direct tandem duplication between these two LTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000175-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The size of the <italic>URA3</italic> overlapping sequences (58 bp) is comparable to the largest identity region shared by the two LTRs (44 bp). Thus, recovery of a functional <italic>URA3</italic> gene at the duplication breakpoints is indicative of direct tandem <italic>ura3</italic>-mediated SDs, mimicking the 115 kb LTR-mediated SDs. In this system, the duplication rate was evaluated to 0.9&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup> event/cell/division (using the median method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000175-Lea1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000175-t001">Table 1</xref>).

Therefore, extrapolation to the whole genome would lead to a much higher rate, suggesting that spontaneous SD events must be extremely common in yeast populations. For instance, a very high rate of histone gene amplification, compensating for decreased level of histones, was shown to result from recombination events between two Ty1 retroelements leading to supernumerary circular chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000175-Libuda1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.

In this regard, the reported Rad9-dependent activation of the replication checkpoint key protein Rad53, by late S-phase, strongly suggests that a <italic>CLB5</italic> deletion results in the formation of replication-induced DNA breaks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000175-Gibson1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.

CPT stabilizes the covalent intermediate that forms during the catalytic DNA nicking-closing cycle of Top1, and CPT cytotoxicity results from the conversion of single strand nicks into double-stranded DNA ends when a moving replication fork collides with a CPT-Top1 complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000175-Hsiang1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.

This observation could be explained if the precursor lesions leading to SDs were indeed double-strand DNA ends that in standard conditions would result from replication accidents. Several other lines of evidence support this hypothesis. First, SD breakpoints often correspond to sequences known to interfere with the replication forks progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000175-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000175-Koszul1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>).

Besides preventing fork collapse and the subsequent formation of DNA breaks, the replication checkpoint also regulates a large variety of cellular events including repression of late-replicating origins, inhibition of mitosis and induction of DNA repair genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000175-Tourriere1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. This trans-acting branch of the replication checkpoint relies on the hyperphosphorylation of Rad53 that can be specifically abrogated with a <italic>mrc1<sup>AQ</sup></italic> allele <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000175-Osborn1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. To determine whether SDs result primarily from S-phase induced DSBs rather than being secondary byproducts of the checkpoint activation, we characterized SD formation in a <italic>mrc1<sup>AQ</sup></italic> mutant in presence of hydroxyurea (HU). By inhibiting the ribonucleotide reductase activity, HU slows down replication fork progression and promotes the formation of ssDNA at the forks, which is sufficient to activate the checkpoint in normal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000175-Tourriere1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000175-Alvino1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. In a <italic>mrc1<sup>AQ</sup></italic> strain and in the presence of HU (100 mM for 3 hours; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>), the integrity of stalled replication forks is maintained while the trans-acting branch of the replication checkpoint is suppressed. In these conditions we found no significant differences between HU-treated and untreated cultures in either checkpoint competent or deficient cells (2 to 5 fold increase, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000175-t001">Table 1</xref>). These results demonstrate that neither stalled replication forks nor the Rad53 hyperphosphorylation-mediated functions of the replication checkpoint are sufficient to stimulate SD formation. Altogether, the above findings strongly suggest that broken forks are the precursor lesions that are directly processed into SDs.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>SDs Are Generated through Replication-Based Mechanisms that Require Pol32</title><p>Free DNA ends generated at broken forks are thought to be repaired primarily by strand invasion of the sister-chromatid, followed by the assembly of a new fork and subsequent replication up to the chromosome end (or to the next replication fork). This break-induced replication (BIR) mechanism can occur through successive rounds of strand invasion and dissociation, and lead to chromosomal rearrangements if reinvasion occurs within ectopic repeated sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000175-Smith1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. We explored a potential role for BIR-related mechanisms by investigating SD formation in a <italic>pol32</italic>&#x00394; strain. Pol32 is a non-essential subunit of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> major replicative DNA polymerase Pol&#x003b4; and is required for the replication fork assembly that initiates the BIR reaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000175-Lydeard1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Absence of Pol32 completely abolishes the formation of SDs. No mutant carrying duplications of any type were isolated out of 184 independent <italic>pol32</italic>&#x00394; cultures. Thus, although the true duplication rate cannot be calculated, the occurrence of a single event, out of the 184 cultures, would have lead to a reversion rate of 6.9&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup>. Although this value is an overestimate of the true duplication rate, it represents a 14-fold reduction compared to the WT control (&#x0003c;0.07, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000175-t001">Table 1</xref>). These data reveal the crucial role played by Pol32 in the generation of all types of SDs. Given that Pol32 is not required for repair by gene conversion (GC) events, SDs must therefore result principally from replication-based mechanisms rather than from unequal crossing-overs (UCO) between sister-chromatids. In addition, since only half of SDs contain repeated homologous sequences at their junctions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000175-Koszul1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, classical BIR mechanism involving Rad52-mediated interactions between large sequences of homology could only account for half of all of the events: the other half might result from a Pol32-dependent replication-based mechanism involving microhomologous or low complexity sequences at the site of strand invasion (see below).</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>The Endonuclease Activity of the Rad1-Rad10 Complex Stimulates SD Formation</title><p>These two Pol32-dependant replication-based mechanisms must rely on an initial step of ectopic strand invasion.

Consistently, the proportion of small (&#x0003c;115 kb) intra-SDs is increased and reminiscent of the distribution of rad52-independent duplications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000175-g001">Figure 1C; below</xref>).</p><p>One SD breakpoint from a <italic>rad1</italic>&#x00394; mutant was sequenced, revealing an eight-nucleotide homology at the junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000175-g002">Figure 2</xref>) and implying that, despite its predominant role in MMEJ, Rad1 is not required for the generation of microhomology-mediated SDs.

The eight-nucleotide microhomology sequence could therefore represent the recurrent breaking site which initiates the formation of the common 115 kb LTR-mediated SD: in the presence of Rad1, the 3&#x02032; flap sequence between this break site and the LTR sequence would be excised so that a BIR-mediated SD could occur.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>HR-Mediated SDs Result from Rad51-Independent BIR</title><p>It is generally believed that most SDs must result from non-allelic recombination events between dispersed repeats, but so far no demonstration for the involvement of the homologous recombination (HR) pathway in SD formation has been clearly established.

This increase suggests that the lesions that were repaired in wild type through gene conversion or allelic BIR are channeled into non-allelic BIR in <italic>rad51</italic> mutants. In addition, the proportion of inter-chromosomal SDs increases up to 32&#x00025; (10 out of 31 events) as compared to 12&#x00025; in the WT (6 out of 48, P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.02).

It also shows that in the absence of mismatches between repeated sequences, not all SDs require Pol32. These Pol32-independent SDs likely result from UCOs between the repeated identical URA3 sequences. In the original assay, similar UCO events involving the flanking LTRs are probably suppressed due to divergence between the sequences.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Non HR-Mediated SDs Result from Microhomology/Microsatellite-Induced Replication (MMIR)</title><p>The rate of SD formation in a <italic>rad52&#x00394;</italic> strain is slightly higher than in WT (2.8-fold increase, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000175-t001">Table 1</xref>), revealing that duplications can form even when HR is abolished (as suggested previously in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000175-Schacherer1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, although using a very different system). The SDs recovered in a <italic>rad52&#x00394;</italic> background appear radically different from those obtained in the WT strain. First, there is a significant decrease in the proportion of inter-chromosomal events, since all 71 SDs but one correspond to intra-chromosomal duplications (<italic>versus</italic> 6 out of 48 events in the WT, P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.02, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000175-t001">Table 1</xref>). Second, the size distribution of intra-chromosomal SDs is significantly biased towards smaller segments as most of them (57 out of 71) are smaller than 115 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000175-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Third, sequencing of the breakpoints revealed that only microhomologous (between 8 and 9 nt) and low complexity sequences (polyT) are now used to generate SDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000175-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Interestingly, a recent report proposed that the large SDs in the human genome that cause the dysmyelinating PMD disease might result from replication fork stalling followed by homology-independent template switching, relying instead on the presence of microhomologies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000175-Lee1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Our sequenced breakpoints once again coincide with replication-related elements, such as ARS, termination sites and tRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000175-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Given the location and the nature of the initiating lesions, as well as the strict dependency to Pol32 (see above), we conclude that the non-HR mediated SDs result from a new mechanism that would rely on an initial Rad52-independent recombination event, occurring between 5 to 10 bp of microhomology or stretches of low-complexity DNA sequences such as microsatellites, followed by a Pol32-dependent fork assembly initiating DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000175-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).

It is noteworthy that in the GCR assay, developed by Kolodner and collaborators, the concomitant deletion of <italic>RAD52</italic> and <italic>DNL4</italic> completely abolished the formation of non-reciprocal translocations since all GCRs observed resulted from telomere additions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000175-Myung1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. This discrepancy underlines the differential genetic requirements between SD and other GCR mechanisms.

The type of SDs, the size distribution as well as the breakpoint sequences isolated in the progenies of these double and the triple mutants strains, are similar to the ones characterized in the <italic>rad52</italic> single mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000175-g001">Figures 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000175-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000175-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Therefore, when both HR and NHEJ are abolished and when MMEJ is, at least, severely compromised (as in <italic>rad52</italic>&#x00394; <italic>dnl4</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rad1</italic>&#x00394; strain<italic>)</italic>, SDs still occur at a WT rate. Since SDs would mainly result from the replicative-repair of a one-ended DSB generated at a broken fork, the concomitant mutations of the 3 major DSB repair pathways should severely reduce if not abolish SD formation. The maintenance of a rate of formation similar to WT and the physical characteristics of SDs in this background suggest that MMIR could represent a new DSB repair pathway. Alternatively, these SDs could be formed by template switching, in the absence of any DSB, as suggested for the formation of <italic>PLP1</italic>-encompassing SDs in the human genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000175-Lee1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Chimerical Genes Leading to Protein Innovations Are Produced at Microhomology-Mediated Breakpoints</title><p>Altogether, 26 SD breakpoints were sequenced (this work and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000175-Koszul1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000175-Koszul2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>) allowing the identification of 13 different chimerical Open Reading Frames (ORF) containing either microhomologies or trinucleotide repeats at their junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000175-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Microhomologies were found at breakpoint junctions in <italic>rad52</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>dnl4</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>rad1</italic>&#x00394; backgrounds, where HR, NHEJ and MMEJ are impaired, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000175-g002">Figure 2</xref>). This shows that these sequences can be used in the absence of all known DSB repair pathways. Because of their extremely high genomic density, the impact of microhomologies in SD formation, and more generally in genome dynamics, is likely to be important. For instance, the 8 to 10 nucleotide breakpoint sequences characterized in the <italic>rad52</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>dnl4</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>rad1</italic>&#x00394; backgrounds are found in the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome from 109 times for the less frequent (<named-content content-type="gene">TGACGCAAAT</named-content>), and up to 793 times for the most common (TAGAGGA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000175-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Chimerical genes arise either from in- or out-of-frame ORF fusions (3 occurrences each), from 3&#x02032; or 5&#x02032; ORF truncations (1 and 5 occurrences, respectively) or from the fusion between an ORF and a tRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000175-g002">Figure 2</xref>). These fusions can generate new proteins and thus represent a potential mechanism of protein evolution. Whereas chimerical ORFs resulting from translocation and inversion events are associated with the concomitant lost of the original gene integrity, SD-mediated chimerical genes formation leave intact the original copies of the genes involved at the breakpoint. For instance, in addition to the original full-length gene a truncated copy of <italic>SGS1</italic> (homolog of human BLM) has been found in the pathogen yeast species <italic>Candida glabrata</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000175-Richard1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. This powerful mechanism allows SD-mediated chimerical genes to explore new combinations that might be counter-selected for in the cases of classical translocation- or inversion-mediated events. In-frame ORF fusions (3 cases) might result in new protein architectures by combining previously existing domains. In addition, SD-mediated frameshift fusions and ORF truncations may result in true protein innovations at the junctions by promoting the transcription of otherwise non-coding sequences. The corresponding transcripts would encode entirely new amino acid combinations. For instance, the frameshift chimerical ORF generated in strain YKF1114 comprises a coding sequence whose last 47 amino acids (from the breakpoint to the stop codon) represent a truly new protein segment that shows no similarity to the rest of the yeast proteome. Such peptides were found in 5 out of the 13 chimerical ORFs characterized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000175-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Although relatively small (average size of 28 amino acids), these peptides are new genomic features and may generate new protein domains. Despite their known association with diseases and genome rearrangements, it has been proposed that SDs have been fixed in the human genome to increase copy number of fusion genes originating from initial duplications of gene-rich core regions, eventually leading to the emergence of new gene families that are either unique to hominoids or considerably diverged when compared with other mammalian species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000175-Jiang1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Given their close association with various genomic disorders and cancers and their broad evolutionary impact, SDs and CNVs represent one of the most important discoveries that stem from the human genome project.

In addition, the finding that all SD formation requires the nonessential Pol&#x003b4; subunit Pol32 shows that duplications results from replication-based mechanisms rather than from UCOs, which are suppressed by the natural DNA divergence between dispersed repeats such as LTRs. It also suggests that BIR, which also requires Pol32 to initiate new DNA synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000175-Lydeard1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> would be the mechanism by which SDs are formed. However, BIR is a homologous recombination process which implies an initial Rad52-dependent invasion step necessitating large sequences of homology between the recombining molecules (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000175-Llorente1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>). These requirements imply that BIR cannot be the unique pathway leading to SDs, because only half of the SDs are generated through a Rad52-dependent recombination event between homologous sequences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000175-t001">Table 1</xref>). The remaining SDs occur independently from both Rad52 and large homologous regions and are generated through recombination between short identical/low complexity sequences. A Rad52-independent half-crossover pathway was previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000175-Coic1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000175-Haber1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref> and unequal half-crossovers in G2 could also generate tandem duplications. However, the class of Rad52-independent SDs described here involves only microhomology/microsatellite sequences at breakpoints and requires Pol32, two characteristics that are hardly compatible with the half-crossover pathway. Given its unique substrate and genetic requirements, this new mechanism of SD formation has been called microhomology/microsatellite-induced replication, or MMIR, because it brings together characteristics from both MMEJ (<italic>ie.</italic> recombination between microhomologies in a Rad52-independent manner, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000175-Ma1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>) and BIR (<italic>ie.</italic> a Pol32-dependent DNA synthesis step, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000175-Lydeard1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>). In addition, we show that MMIR-mediated SDs still form in the absence of all known DSB repair pathways (HR, NHEJ and MMEJ) suggesting that MMIR could represent a new repair pathway. Alternatively, one cannot exclude that MMIR-mediated SDs would arise in the absence of any DSB as a result of template switching events as it has been suggested for the large <italic>PLP1</italic> duplications that cause the dysmyelinating PMD disease in human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000175-Lee1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Altogether, our results provide the first experimental deciphering of the molecular pathways leading to SDs, demonstrating that two alternative replication-based mechanisms, BIR and MMIR, are responsible for the spontaneous SD formation in the yeast genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000175-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). While these two pathways probably use similar precursor DNA lesions and share the Pol32 requirement, they differ from one another by their recombination substrate and their dependency to HR proteins (Rad52, Rad51 and Rad1).

However, in the culture conditions where the selection assay was performed (serial dilutions in 6 ml YPD in 24-wells plates), careful measurements revealed that the time needed for revertant cells to overtake slow growing populations was longer than predicted and was strain dependant: the doubling time of a duplicated strain is actually 1.3 to 1.4 times smaller than that of the slow growing parent, depending on the mutant background. This discrepancy resulted in a strong effect on the duplication rate estimation compared to our former studies (from 2&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup> to 1&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup> per cell per division in control strain).</p><p>In the strains used for the uracil-prototrophy recovery assay, the <italic>RPL20A</italic> gene is not deleted (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000175.s001">Table S1</xref>) and both parental and duplicated strains show the same growth rate. Two truncated copies of the <italic>URA3</italic> gene, covering either the 5&#x02032; or 3&#x02032; half of the gene and overlapping by either 58 bp or 401 bp, were introduced in place of <italic>YORWsigma3</italic> and <italic>YORWsigma4</italic> (strains YKFB614 and YKFB608, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000175-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The rate of appearance of uracil autotrophic colonies was determined by a fluctuation test analysis using the median method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000175-Lea1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Briefly, ten independent YPD cultures, inoculated with &#x0223c;200 cells, were grown at 30&#x000b0;C to &#x0223c;3&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup> cells/ml. Cells were plated on uracil lacking medium, incubated at 30&#x000b0;C for 2 days and &#x0005b;ura&#x0002b;&#x0005d; colonies were counted. The breakpoint junction indicative of a 115 kb <italic>ura3</italic>-mediated direct tandem duplication was sought through PCR amplification of the region. All &#x0005b;ura&#x0002b;&#x0005d; colonies analyzed carried such duplications, resulting from the fusion of the two URA3 overlapping sequences.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Chemical Treatments</title><p>Independent colonies (2&#x000d7;10<sup>7</sup> cells) from strains YKF120c and YBaG398 were inoculated in 24 wells plates containing 6ml YPD, and cultivated under agitation during 6 generations at 30&#x000b0;C. Approximately 2&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> cells from each well were then inoculated into either fresh YPD medium, YPD supplemented by 100 mM Hydroxyurea (HU, Sigma) or YPD supplemented by 10 &#x000b5;g/ml Camptothecin (CPT, Sigma), and incubated for 3 hours. After wash approximately 2&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> cells from each well were inoculated into fresh YPD medium. Every 10&#x02013;11 generations, similar aliquots from each well were re-inoculated into fresh YPD medium. Between every cycle, a sample of the culture was plated onto YPD plates at a density of &#x0223c;2&#x000d7;10<sup>2</sup> to 5&#x000d7;10<sup>3</sup> cells/plate and incubated at 30&#x000b0;C (above; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000175-Koszul1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Pulse-Field Gel Electrophoresis, Comparative Genomic Hybridizations, and Sequencing of the Junctions</title><p>Electrophoretic karyotypes of parental and revertant strains, as well as genomic DNA extraction and labelling, were performed as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000175-Koszul1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Labelled DNA was hybridized against either PCR product-based (Ecole Normale Superieure, Paris France and MWG Biotech) or oligo-based yeast whole-genome arrays (Affymetrix, YG-S98). Arrays were analyzed with the GenePix Pro5.0 or with the Affymetrix GeneChip software, respectively. A genomic ratio for each ORF was defined as the ratio between normalized spot intensity of the revertant and parental strains, from which the mean of all spot intensities ratios was subtracted. SD junctions were PCR amplified. Products were purified using gel extraction columns (NucleoSpin, Macherey Nagel) and sequenced by the Genome Express company (Cogenics).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000175.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Strains used in this work.</p><p>(0.04 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000175.s001.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the &#x0201c;G&#x000e9;nopole Alsace-Lorraine&#x0201d; and the &#x0201c;G&#x000e9;nopole Institut Pasteur&#x0201d; for microarray hybridizations.
