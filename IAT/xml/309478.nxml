In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the GAR1 gene is essential for cell viability. We have cloned and sequenced the GAR1 gene from the distantly related yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The SpGAR1 gene, which contains two small introns, codes for a 194 amino-acid protein of 20 kDa. A protein sequence comparison indicates that SpGAR1 is 65% identical to ScGAR1. Anti-ScGAR1 antibodies recognize SpGAR1, emphasizing the structural conservation of the protein. Immunostaining of S.pombe cells with these antibodies reveals that SpGAR1 is localized in the nucleolus, as is the case in S.cerevisiae. Moreover, SpGAR1 can substitute for GAR1 in S.cerevisiae, indicating that the two proteins are functionally equivalent. These results suggest a parallel evolutionary conservation of proteins and RNAs with which GAR1 interacts in mediating its pre-rRNA processing and viability functions. After fibrillarin, GAR1 is the second protein of the snoRNPs shown to have been conserved throughout evolution.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00058-0130-a" xlink:role="2151"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00058-0132-a" xlink:role="2153"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00058-0132-b" xlink:role="2153"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00058-0132-c" xlink:role="2153"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00058-0128.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2149"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00058-0129.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2150"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00058-0130.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2151"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00058-0131.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2152"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00058-0132.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2153"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00058-0133.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2154"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00058-0134.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2155"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
