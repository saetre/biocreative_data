We previously showed that methylation of the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter is necessary for its transcription and that CTCF can repress <italic>hTERT</italic> transcription by binding to the first exon. In this study, we used electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to show that CTCF does not bind the methylated first exon of <italic>hTERT</italic>. Treatment of telomerase-positive cells with 5-azadC led to a strong demethylation of <italic>hTERT</italic> 5&#x02032;-regulatory region, reactivation of CTCF binding and downregulation of <italic>hTERT</italic>. Although complete <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter methylation was associated with full transcriptional repression, detailed mapping showed that, in telomerase-positive cells, not all the CpG sites were methylated, especially in the promoter region. Using a methylation cassette assay, selective demethylation of 110&#x02009;bp within the core promoter significantly increased <italic>hTERT</italic> transcriptional activity. This study underlines the dual role of DNA methylation in <italic>hTERT</italic> transcriptional regulation. In our model, <italic>hTERT</italic> methylation prevents binding of the CTCF repressor, but partial hypomethylation of the core promoter is necessary for <italic>hTERT</italic> expression.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Telomeres are nucleoprotein complexes that &#x02018;cap&#x02019; and stabilize the termini of linear chromosomes. They are also involved in chromosome replication, maintenance of nuclear architecture, chromosome stability, gene expression, aging and cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). In normal cells, each division is associated with the loss of 50&#x02013;100 base pairs of telomere length. This shortening of the telomeres acts as a mitotic counter and limits life span. Telomerase, a complex consisting of a reverse transcriptase bound to its own RNA template, allows the maintenance of the telomere length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). In most somatic cells, telomerase activity is not detectable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). In contrast, telomerase is expressed in highly proliferative cells, such as germ cells and stem cells, and in the cells of about 85% of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic>, two components are absolutely essential for telomerase activity: the catalytic subunit, <italic>hTERT</italic>, containing the reverse transcriptase activity, and the RNA component, <italic>hTERC</italic>, containing a complementary template for the telomeric DNA sequence (TTAGGG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>Following the characterization of the genomic sequence of <italic>hTERT</italic> and the elucidation of the organization of the gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10 B11">8&#x02013;11</xref>), many studies have shown that expression of <italic>hTERT</italic> represents the limiting factor for telomerase activity, and that the regulation of <italic>hTERT</italic> expression occurs primarily at the transcriptional level. Transient transfection experiments have identified a minimal promoter encompassing the 283&#x02009;bp region upstream of the ATG initiation codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11">9&#x02013;11</xref>). The 5&#x02032;-<italic>hTERT</italic> regulatory region contains numerous binding sites for transcription factors. Activators of <italic>hTERT</italic> transcription include c-Myc, Sp1, hALP, Hif-1, Mbi-1, USF1/2 and estrogen response element. Repressors for <italic>hTERT</italic> have also been identified and include the tumor suppressor protein p53, Mad1, myeloid-specific zinc finger protein 2 (MZF-2), TGF-&#x003b2;, Wilms' Tumor 1 (WT1) and CTCF. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14 B15 B16 B17 B18 B19 B20">12&#x02013;20</xref>). Recently, Horikawa <italic>et al</italic>. described an E-box binding sequence located upstream of the transcriptional start site, as inhibitor of <italic>hTERT</italic> but not in <italic>mTERT</italic>, suggesting a differencial regulation of TERT in human and mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). We previously showed that 5&#x02032; exonic sequences might be involved in the regulation of the <italic>hTERT</italic> gene through an inhibitory effect on transcriptional activity of the minimal <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Moreover, this region inserted immediately downstream of <italic>CMV</italic> and <italic>CDKN2A</italic> promoters repressed their activity in normal, immortalized and cancer cells. We observed that the 11-zinc finger factor CTCF binds this region in telomerase-negative cells, but not in telomerase-positive cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Since CTCF represses transcriptional activity when it binds DNA downstream of transcriptional start sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), these findings suggest that CTCF might function as a transcriptional repressor for <italic>hTERT</italic> in normal cells. However, the mechanisms that might prevent CTCF from binding to the <italic>hTERT</italic> gene in telomerase-positive cells have not been determined. Therefore, it is essential to note that the identification of these activators and repressors of <italic>hTERT</italic> do not take in account the methylation profile of the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter described in numerous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25 B26 B27">25&#x02013;27</xref>).</p><p>The fact that the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter is located within a CpG island suggests that transcription of the gene might be regulated by DNA methylation. Previous studies showed that the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter is hypermethylated in most telomerase-positive tumors and hypomethylated in telomerase-negative normal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25 B26 B27">25&#x02013;27</xref>). These observations contrast with the general association between promoter methylation and gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), which prompted us to study how DNA methylation of the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter can lead to its expression.</p><p>To this end, we initiated a detailed evaluation of the methylation pattern of each CpG site in the areas that appear to contribute to the transcriptional regulation of the <italic>hTERT</italic> gene. Based on our previous analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), two regions of the <italic>hTERT</italic> CpG island seemed essential: one is the core promoter that is necessary to its expression; the other is the 5&#x02032; exonic region where the CTCF repressor binds. The <italic>hTERT</italic> region at &#x02212;441 to &#x02212;218 from the ATG translational start site examined in our previous studies was located immediately upstream of the regions we considered now as essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>).</p><p>Although the first two exons play a role in the repression of the <italic>hTERT</italic> transcription by CTCF, which binds to two sites, one in the first exon and the other at the beginning of the second (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>); in the present study, only the effect of CTCF on the first exon was investigated. The presence of an intron between these two CTCF sites complicate the analyses since, in transient transfections, splicing of this intron is only partial.</p><p>In the present report, we tested the hypothesis that <italic>hTERT</italic> methylation prevents binding of CTCF inhibitor and that a partial methylation of the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter region can result in some level of transcriptional activity. The results have allowed us to identify an unexpected dual role for DNA methylation in the transcriptional regulation of the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>The human tumor cell lines HeLa (cervical adenocarcinoma), SW480 (colorectal adenocarcinoma) and normal BJ fibroblasts were obtained from the ATCC. All these cells were grown in the medium recommended by the ATCC. The HLF/<italic>hTERT</italic> cells were kindly provided by Dr. Joachim Lingner (ISREC, Epalinges, Switzerland), and were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Basel, Switzerland). HeLa and SW480 cell lines are telomerase positive, whereas BJ is telomerase negative. HLF/<italic>hTERT</italic> cells, obtained through stable transfection of HLF cells with an MSCV-<italic>hTERT</italic> retrovirus, constitutively express <italic>hTERT</italic> and have high telomerase activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue samples</title><p>Tumor tissues (breast, bladder and cervix) were obtained from the Tissue Bank of the Institute of Pathology of Lausanne. Microdissection and DNA extraction were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>).

A HeLa Flp-In host cell line containing a single FRT site was created with this system. Positive clones were selected using 500&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml of Zeocin antibiotic. The vector containing the gene of interest was integrated into the genome via Flp-recombinase-mediated DNA recombination at the FRT site.

In tumor tissues and tumor cell lines, almost all CpGs between &#x02212;100 and +100, including the CTCF binding site (Region B) were methylated (75 to 100% methylated). By comparison, most of the CpGs from approximately &#x02212;165 to &#x02212;100 (Region A) were unmethylated (0 to 55% methylated). In BJ and HLF/<italic>hTERT</italic>, very few CpGs in the entire region were methylated (3 to 23%). These findings suggested that methylation of CpGs in Region B might inhibit CTCF binding while leaving unexplained the selective hypomethylation of Region A. </p><p>To test whether methylation might interfere with CTCF binding, we used <italic>Sss</italic>I methylase to modify a PCR fragment encompassing the first exon of the <italic>hTERT</italic> gene, previously derscribed to be bound by CTCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), and compared the native (F1) and modified sequences (F1-met) for their ability to bind CTCF in EMSAs. These studies revealed a marked preference of CTCF for the unmethylated site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>B and C).</p><p>We also tested the effect of CpG methylation on the affinity of CTCF binding <italic>in vivo</italic>. HeLa cells were stably transfected with an <italic>hTERT</italic> construct, pTERT &#x02013;297/ex2/FRT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D) that was methylated <italic>in vitro</italic> before transfection. Genomic DNA of stable transfectants was extracted after 30 population doublings (PD) and the methylation status was analyzed by Methylation-Sensitive Single-Strand Conformation Analysis (MS-SSCA). To differentiate endogenous <italic>hTERT</italic> gene sequences from the transfected sequence, we used a specific forward primer located in the reporter vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D). The transfected <italic>hTERT</italic> sequence remained methylated even after 30 PDs, whereas the unmethylated control transfectant stayed unmethylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E). ChIP assays were performed on methylated and unmethylated stable transfectants. CTCF bound to the <italic>hTERT</italic> exon1 region of the vector sequences only when this region was unmethylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>F). Taken together, these results indicated that methylation of the first exon of <italic>hTERT</italic> prevented binding of CTCF both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>CTCF binding is restored after treatment with 5-azadC</title><p>As was shown in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33 B34 B35">33&#x02013;35</xref>), treatment of telomerase-positive cells with the demethylating agent 5-azadC inhibits <italic>hTERT</italic> transcription and reduces telomerase activity. We hypothesize that demethylation of the first exon of <italic>hTERT</italic> restores CTCF binding. To test this hypothesis, we treated HeLa and SW480 cells with 5-azadC for 4 weeks. Methylation of <italic>hTERT</italic> as determined by bisulfite sequencing showed that CpG methylation in Region B was reduced from that in untreated cells (54 and 64% methylated after 5azadC treatment versus 93 and 90% methylated in untreated HeLa and SW480 cells, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). ChIP analyses revealed significant CTCF binding to <italic>hTERT</italic> first exon sequences from treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). In addition, real-time PCR analyses of <italic>hCTCF</italic> mRNA levels showed no significant differences before and after 5azadC treatment. In contrast, the <italic>hTERT</italic> mRNA level, which is high in HeLa and SW480 before 5azadC treatment, cannot be detected after 5azadC treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). </p></sec><sec><title>Total methylation of hTERT inhibits transcriptional activity: a region of the hTERT minimal promoter must be hypomethylated to allow its transcriptional activity</title><p>To evaluate the importance of methylation for <italic>hTERT</italic> activation, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with CpG-free plasmids containing a <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter that was previously methylated <italic>in vitro</italic>. The <italic>hTERT</italic> minimal promoter did not show any activity if all the CpG sites were methylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). Likewise, no transcriptional activity was observed in a construct with methylated promoter and the first exon of <italic>hTERT</italic>. These results showed that transcription of <italic>hTERT</italic> was completely repressed by full methylation of the promoter. Sequencing of bisulfite-modified DNA from telomerase-positive tumor cell lines (HeLa and SW480) and tumor tissues (breast, bladder and cervix) showed partial demethylation of the promoter, between &#x02212;160 to &#x02212;80&#x02009;bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, Region A). A recent study has also described partial methylation of the promoter region in telomerase-positive cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). This hypomethylation, just upstream of the transcriptional start sites, might permit the low transcriptional activity of the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter observed in tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). To test the role of methylation of this region in the regulation of <italic>hTERT</italic> transcriptional activity, we performed a methylation cassette assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). A &#x003b2;-galactosidase reporter plasmid was generated, containing a cassette with sequences from &#x02212;183 to &#x02212;73&#x02009;bp, encompassing 12 CpG sites and representing the region A described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. The methylated or unmethylated cassette was excised and ligated back into the vector, which was then transfected into HeLa cells. Methylation of the cassette reduced the activity of the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter to the background levels, a result similar to that obtained with the fully methylated promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). In contrast, the unmethylated cassette, ligated to the methylated vectors, reduced transcriptional activity of the minimal promoter nine-fold compared to the activity obtained with the same unmethylated reporter. When exon 1 is present in the construct, the activity is reduced only two-fold. Moreover, if we compare fold difference between the minimal promoter activity and the minimal promoter + exon1 in cassette methylation experiments, the difference is very significant when the plasmids are unmethylated; but when the exon1 is methylated, there is almost no difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C). These results suggested that the hypomethylation of the region A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), which contains three of the four Sp1 binding sites, was permissive for low levels of <italic>hTERT</italic> expression, comparable to those seen <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), and that the methylation of the exon1 allowed the transcriptional level to be likely the same than with the minimal promoter only. These results also suggested that the regions surrounding the region A in the minimal promoter might be sites for a strong activator that might have binding sites sensitive to methylation. </p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The aim of the present study was to define more precisely the role of CTCF and DNA methylation in transcriptional regulation of the <italic>hTERT</italic> gene. CTCF binds preferentially to GC-rich DNA regions, exerts an inhibitory effect when bound downstream of a transcriptional start site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>) and may be released when its binding site is methylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). In a previous study, we showed that CTCF binds to GC-rich regions within exons 1 and 2 of the <italic>hTERT</italic> gene, irrespective of the cell type or the promoter used. In the <italic>hTERT</italic> CpG island, binding of CTCF might be influenced by the methylation status of its sites. In the present study, ChIP assays revealed that CTCF binds to the first exon of <italic>hTERT</italic> when the <italic>hTERT</italic> CpG island is not methylated. In contrast, CTCF no longer binds its recognition sequence when this site is methylated. Hypermethylation of its binding site can therefore abolish CTCF repressor activity. This was confirmed by inducing demethylation with 5-azadC, which allowed CTCF to bind to the first exon region and repress <italic>hTERT</italic> expression. Therefore, the main role of <italic>hTERT</italic> methylation in tumor cells is probably to prevent binding of the CTCF repressor and, as a consequence, to allow transcription of the <italic>hTERT</italic> gene.</p><p>The observation that 5-azadC treatment results in <italic>hTERT</italic> gene repression was confirmed by other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33 B34 B35">33&#x02013;35</xref>). Nevertheless, these results are apparently in marked contrast to two other reports showing activation of <italic>hTERT</italic> following treatment of telomerase-negative ALT cells upon 5-azadC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). These seemingly contrasting effects might be explained as a result of the balance between demethylation of the <italic>hTERT</italic> first exon region allowing binding of CTCF and, possibly, demethylation of genes necessary for <italic>hTERT</italic> transcription. Indeed, in luciferase reporter gene assays, it was shown that the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter is much less active in ALT cells (e.g. U2-os) than in telomerase-positive tumor cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Further studies of ALT cells should be undertaken to develop a better understanding of this phenomenon.</p><p>Promoter methylation is an epigenetic process most commonly associated with transcriptional repression. Methylation of DNA helps to stabilize chromatin in an inactive configuration, thereby inhibiting gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). As expected, our results clearly show that methylation of all the CpG sites within the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter CpG island resulted in complete transcriptional repression, in spite of the inability of CTCF repressor to bind to the <italic>hTERT</italic> gene. In this condition, <italic>hTERT</italic> does not provide a real exception to the general model of gene silencing by promoter methylation. However, even if <italic>hTERT</italic> is generally hypermethylated in telomerase-positive tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), we showed in the present study that a region between &#x02212;165 to &#x02212;80&#x02009;bp upstream of the translational start site was hypomethylated in tumor tissues and cell lines. This region contains three of the four Sp1 sites present in the <italic>hTERT</italic> core promoter. We used cassette methylation assay to demonstrate the importance of this region for the transcriptional activity of the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter. A recent study also showed that <italic>hTERT</italic> transcription might require partial methylation of its promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). However, our data clearly indicate that selective partial demethylation of 12 CpGs limited to the small region upstream the transcription start site, defined as region A, significantly activates <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter in a reporter plasmid. Nevertheless, the activity of the promoter in these conditions is significantly lower than the activity obtained with the unmethylated minimal promoter. These results suggested that the regions surrounding the minimal promoter region A might be the target of transcriptional factors other than CTCF, whose binding are sensitive to methylation. The low expression level of the <italic>hTERT</italic> showed with this partial demethylation of the core promoter corresponded rather well to the level of <italic>hTERT</italic> expression observed <italic>in vivo</italic>. Indeed, the <italic>hTERT</italic> mRNA levels detected in telomerase-positive cell lines are very low, 0.2 to 6 copies per cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). This is in stark contrast with the high level of transcriptional activity obtained in transient transfection of the <italic>hTERT</italic> core promoter in telomerase-positive cell lines, a level comparable to that induced by strong SV40 early promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p><p>Methylation cassette experiments shows that the expression levels of the construct with partially methylated <italic>hTERT</italic> minimal promoter and methylated exon 1 in transient transfection is very close to the levels of the endogenous <italic>hTERT</italic> in human cancers showing similar methylation pattern. The methylation of the exon1 of <italic>hTERT</italic> seems to be sufficient to allow the transcription from the minimal promoter, and does no more exert its inhibitory effect as seen in umethylated constructs. Moreover, a CTCF site located at the beginning of exon 2 also plays an important role in the downregulation of the constructs with unmethylated <italic>hTERT</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). However, as previously mentioned, the presence of an intron between the two CTCF sites complicates the interpretation of the transfection assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Nevertheless, in our proposed model for the transcriptional regulation of the <italic>hTERT</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), we took the effect of the two CTCF sites into account. </p><p>Although promoter methylation might be one of the main mechanisms involved in <italic>hTERT</italic> regulation in tumor tissues and cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>), methylation-independent mechanisms have also been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41 B42 B43">41&#x02013;43</xref>). In normal tissues, we observed that the <italic>hTERT</italic> gene was not methylated in testis, a site where telomerase is highly expressed (unpublished data). It is interesting to note that expression of an <italic>hTERT</italic> transgene in mice remained high, especially in testis, regardless of whether the transgene comprised only an 8-kbp region of the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter or the entire <italic>hTERT</italic> gene promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). According to Horikawa <italic>et al</italic>., the use of the entire <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter in mouse leads to a human-like pattern of <italic>hTERT</italic> expression, suggesting that specific regulatory sequences, rather than mouse background, determines differences in <italic>hTERT</italic> and <italic>mTERT</italic> expression. Together, these data suggest that tissue-specific factors present in testis and in some tumor cells could prevent binding of the CTCF repressor to the first two exons of <italic>hTERT</italic> and thus lead to <italic>hTERT</italic> expression. According to previous data, the testis-specific factor BORIS, a paralog of CTCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>), might be a good candidate, and further studies will be necessary to investigate its potential role in the <italic>hTERT</italic> regulation.</p><p>In summary, <italic>hTERT</italic> expression is induced when the <italic>hTERT</italic> CpG island is sufficiently hypermethylated to avoid binding of the CTCF repressor and when a small part of the core promoter region is hypomethylated to allow the transcription complex to be formed. Under these conditions, additional regulators can come into play to effectively induce <italic>hTERT</italic> expression. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> illustrates the dual role of DNA methylation in the transcriptional regulation of the telomerase <italic>hTERT</italic> gene. The complexity of <italic>hTERT</italic> regulation might hamper the development of anticancer therapies targeting telomerase and calls for further studies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The authors are grateful to Dr. Herbert C.

In telomerase-negative somatic cells, CTCF binds to unmethylated CTCF binding site and inhibits <italic>hTERT</italic> transcription. Full methylation of the <italic>hTERT</italic> minimal promoter and exon1 in some telomerase-negative tumor cells cannot lead to <italic>hTERT</italic> transcription. A majority of the tumor CTCF sites within the <italic>hTERT</italic> gene are methylated, thus preventing CTCF binding. Partial demethylation of the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter region with the formation of an active transcriptional complex can lead to <italic>hTERT</italic> transcription and telomerase activity. CTS stands for CTCF target sites. The hatched box represents the region A showed as unmethylated in cancer cell lines and tumor tissues. Question marks represent the two regions surrounding the region A, and that might have a strong influence on the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter activity, most probably methylation-sensitive binding sites to transcription factors.
