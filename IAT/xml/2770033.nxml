T<sub>reg </sub>cells develop in the thymus through a process involving the recognition of self-peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and driven by high-affinity interactions between the T cell receptor (TCR) on developing thymocytes and self peptide-MHC complexes on thymic epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Forkhead box P3 (Foxp3), an X-chromosome-linked factor that controls T<sub>reg </sub>cell development and function, is generally thought to also control positively the functions of T<sub>reg </sub>cells in a binary fashion, as Foxp3 expression is sufficient to specify immune-suppressive activities in conventional T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Although Foxp3 is considered as a specific marker for the T<sub>reg </sub>cell lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], its expression pattern during thymocyte development remains less clear.</p><p>T<sub>reg</sub>-mediated suppression is cell contact dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], but the immunosuppressive cytokines transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x003b2; and IL-10 also play an important role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The collective activity of TGF-&#x003b2; and IL-10 ensures a controlled inflammatory response specifically targeting pathogens without evoking excessive immunopathology to self-tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. IL-10 is a cytokine which is an essential molecule in the mechanism underlying suppression mediated by T<sub>reg </sub>cells. It has anti-inflammatory activity and indirectly suppresses cytokine production and proliferation of antigen-specific CD4<sup>+ </sup>T effector cells. IL-10 is produced by subsets of CD4<sup>+ </sup>cells with regulatory function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. More specifically, it has been shown that IL-10 produced by T<sub>reg </sub>cells is essential for <italic>in vivo </italic>suppression, as IL-10-deficient T<sub>reg </sub>cells can not regulate T cell induced colitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. TGF-&#x003b2; and IL-10 are potent mediators of immune suppression, and T<sub>reg </sub>cells can not only use TGF-&#x003b2; and IL-10 to perform their immunosuppression function, but also to educate other CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>-</sup>cells to become T<sub>reg </sub>cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The adhesion molecule CD44 (synonymous with Pgp1, HUTCH-1, or ECM-III) is the principal receptor for hyaluronic acid. Multiple functions and cellular responses have been attributed to the activation of CD44, including the induction of cell motility, activation of cell survival responses, and promotion of cell adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Although CD44 has a wide tissue distribution, its expression during a particular stage or in a subset of thymocyte progenitors suggests a functional involvement of CD44 in homing and thymic colonization of precursor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Although differential expression levels of CD44 among different subsets of thymocytes have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], its biological relevance in T cell differentiation is unclear.</p><p>In this study, we used na&#x000ef;ve C57BL/6 mice and performed six-color flow cytometry and real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses, as well as <italic>in vitro </italic>T cell suppression assays. We present herein the following key findings: 1) the surface expression of CD44 in mouse thymocytes positively correlated with that of Foxp3; 2) CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>+ </sup>T<sub>reg </sub>cells expressed higher levels of IL-10 and were more potent in suppressing effector T cell proliferation than were CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>- </sup>cells; and 3) blocking IL-10 aborogated suppressive mechanisms of CD4 T<sub>reg </sub>cells. Our data suggest that T<sub>reg </sub>cells could be further divided into three subsets based on CD44 expression levels, with CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>high </sup>cells displaying the highest levels of IL-10 production and having regulatory functions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p>Female C57BL/6 mice (Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY) were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions, and used for experimentation at 4 to 6 weeks of age, according to protocols approved by the UTMB Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and NIH guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title>Flow cytometric analysis</title><p>Thymocytes and splenocytes were obtained from na&#x000ef;ve mice and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 1% fetal calf serum (FCS).

In this study, the simultaneous use of mAbs specific for CD4, CD8, CD25 and CD44 allowed us to detect 16 subtypes of thymocytes, with 80% of the thymocytes as being CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+ </sup>cells (data no shown). Of note, CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>+ </sup>and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>- </sup>T<sub>reg </sub>cells in the thymus constituted only 0.4% and 0.8%, respectively, of the total thymocytes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). While 72% of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>+ </sup>cells expressed Foxp3, only 28% of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>- </sup>cells expressed Foxp3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>).</p><p>The TCR-&#x003b2; locus plays an important role in the development of T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Although in TCR transgenic mice, exposure of the developing T cells to the cognate peptide in the thymus causes an increase in the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>T<sub>reg </sub>cell population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], it is unclear how the TCR&#x003b2;-chain regulates T<sub>reg </sub>cells. We examined TCR-&#x003b2; expression in thymic T<sub>reg </sub>cell development. Cells in these transition stages begin to express TCR genes. We found that CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>+ </sup>cells expressed higher levels of TCR-&#x003b2; than did CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>- </sup>cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), and that CD44<sup>high </sup>T<sub>reg </sub>cells from the thymus displayed higher levels of TCR-&#x003b2; than did CD44<sup>med </sup>or CD44<sup>low </sup>cells. Almost 100% of CD44<sup>high </sup>T<sub>reg </sub>cells expressed the TCR-&#x003b2;-chain, whereas the frequency of TCR-&#x003b2;-expressing cells was significantly lower in T<sub>reg </sub>cells with reduced CD44 expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Thus, our data suggest that the levels of TCR-&#x003b2; expression indicate the maturation status of T<sub>reg </sub>cells and correlate with the suppressive function of T<sub>reg </sub>cells. It is possible that CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>T cells require activation <italic>via </italic>their TCR to differentiate into suppressive cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Here, it should be mentioned that at the CD4 SP stage, thymocytes have already passed positive selection by virtue of TCR mediated signaling events. Nevertheless, our data implies that ~60% of CD4 SP CD25<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>- </sup>cells do not express a TCR-&#x003b2; chain. It is not clear whether TCR-&#x003b2;<sup>- </sup>cells might reflect a "spillover" from the double negative (DN) compartment and this possibility will be examined in the future.</p><p>It is known that Foxp3 is a conserved transcription factor that programs the development and the suppressive function of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>T<sub>reg </sub>cells. However, less is known about the Foxp3 expression pattern during thymocyte development. To address this issue, we examined the inter-relationship among the expression profiles of CD25, Foxp3, and CD44 and found several trends (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Since CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup>CD44<sup>+ </sup>SP or CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup>CD44<sup>high </sup>SP cells expressed high levels of Foxp3, our data suggest a positive correlation between Foxp3 expression and expression of CD44 and the TCR-&#x003b2;-chain. Additional precursor progeny studies are needed to further test/validate this hypothesis.</p><p>Because functional assays are critical parameters for assessing T<sub>reg </sub>cell function, we used CD4, CD8, CD25, and CD44 markers and the FACSAria sorter to carefully isolate T cell subsets from the spleens of na&#x000ef;ve mice. <italic>In vitro </italic>T cell co-culture and RT-PCR assays indicated stronger suppressive function and higher mRNA levels of IL-10 in CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>+ </sup>cells than in CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>- </sup>cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Because CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>high </sup>cells displayed the highest suppressive function and the highest mRNA levels of IL-10 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>), we suggest that CD44 can be considered a complementary marker for the functional potential of T<sub>reg </sub>cells. To further support this conclusion, we isolated four subsets of CD4<sup>+ </sup>thymocytes and examined their IL-10 mRNA levels <italic>via </italic>real-time RT-PCR analysis. We provided two lines of evidence indicating the role of IL-10 in T<sub>reg </sub>cell-mediated suppression. First, CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>+ </sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup>cells expressed much higher levels of intracellular IL-10 than did CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>- </sup>Foxp3<sup>+ </sup>cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Second, the addition of an IL-10 neutralizing antibody reversed this suppression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>), and affected Foxp3 expression in the splenocytes (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). Whether, IL-10 neutralizing antibody reversed this suppression through regulating Foxp3 expression is currently not known and will be explored in the future. One possibility exists that our cell population might contain IL-10 producing non-Foxp3<sup>+ </sup>T cells, so called Tr1-like cells, that could cause reduction in T<sub>reg </sub>cell suppressive effect using anti-IL-10 antibodies; however, this possibility seemed highly unlikely but will be examined in our future studies.</p><p>Our results suggest that the regulatory/suppressive potential of these cells can be ranked in the following order: CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>+ </sup>cells &#x0003e; CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>- </sup>cells &#x0003e; CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup>CD25<sup>-</sup>CD44<sup>+ </sup>cells. Thus, one would predict that na&#x000ef;ve CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells may have a higher possibility to convert into T<sub>reg </sub>cells in the periphery than do their counterparts.

While both CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>+ </sup>and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>- </sup>cells display suppressive activities, CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>high </sup>cells are the most potent T<sub>reg </sub>cells. The expression levels of CD44 positively correlate with the expression of IL-10 and Foxp3, as well as with the regulatory potential of T<sub>reg </sub>cells which suppresses T cell proliferation function by producing IL-10.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>TL and LS contributed equally to the design of the study and writing of the manuscript; TL performed the experiments and analyzed data; GL and RK participated in experimental design, data analysis, and manuscript preparation; AKC provided support for this research, contributed in designing the study and manuscript writing and revisions, as well as in responding to reviewers' comments.

The authors have presented a concise report of their findings in a well-written manuscript and clearly presented data. They have also speculated that Tregs may develop from DN2 or DN3 stage T cells separately before development of na&#x000ef;ve cells.</p><p><italic>Authors' response</italic>: <italic>We were very pleased to read your supporting comments on our study and felt that your suggestions were very helpful in assisting us to improve the quality of the revised manuscript.

Therefore, the title is misleading and changes the focus of the actual content of the paper i.e., CD44 correlates with Foxp3<sup>+ </sup>expression. There is no scientific evidence presented in the paper, showing that Treg cells actually arise from DN3 or 2/DN3 cell stage cells. The possibility that Treg cells could develop from DN4 cell stage cells by reacquiring CD44 and CD25 during negative selection and maturation processes has not been formally excluded. There is a school of thought that Treg cells escape negative selection even-though they have high affinity self-ligands. The authors should therefore address these points if they want to discuss about developmental aspects of Tregs in this paper. Otherwise, the authors should change the title of the manuscript and speculate the developmental aspects of Tregs only in the "discussion" section.</p><p><italic>Authors' response</italic>: <italic>To address question 1, we have changed the title to "CD44 expression positively correlates with Foxp3 expression and suppressive function of CD4</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>T</italic><sub><italic>reg </italic></sub><italic>cells", as suggested by the reviewer.

Therefore, if authors claim CD44 expression positively correlates with higher suppression and these suppressive cytokines, the authors should demonstrate if CD44 high subset of Tregs suppress predominantly by these suppressive cytokines. It would be interesting to test whether the suppressive activity of CD44<sup>+ </sup>subset is blocked by neutralizing these cytokines. It is possible that CD44<sup>- </sup>subset and CD44<sup>+ </sup>subset of CD25<sup>+ </sup>Tregs suppress in different manner, which is why one cannot abrogate suppression by neutralizing TGF-&#x003b2; and IL-10 in cultures with both the subsets so far.</p><p><italic>Authors' response: To address question 2, our new data showed that suppressive function of CD4 T</italic><sub><italic>reg </italic></sub><italic>cells on T cell proliferation could be reversed by neutralizing anti-IL-10 antibodies (Figure </italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). <italic>Further, our data provided evidence that IL-10 might regulate suppression of T cell proliferation function by modulating Foxp3 (Figure </italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Reviewers' report 2</title><p>Dr Klein &#x00026; Dr Wirnsberger (nominated by Dr JC Zungia-Pfluker)</p><p>The manuscript "CD44 expression positively correlates with Foxp3 expression and suppressive function of CD4<sup>+ </sup>Treg cells" by Liu et al. proposes a subdivision of thymic and splenic Treg into populations characterized by different levels of CD44 expression. Although the revised ms deals with the functional properties of these subpopulations rather than focusing on developmental aspects of Treg cell biology, several major concerns remain as to the characterization of these cells and the interpretation of the reported experiments. Because the focus of the ms has profoundly changed, we have looked at it as if it were a first submission.</p><p><bold>1) </bold>Introduction: <italic>"...the surface expression of CD44 in mouse thymocytes preceded that of Foxp3" - </italic>this statement implies a direct precursor/progeny relationship between the described subpopulations and "mature" Treg that is not experimentally addressed at all in this manuscript.</p><p><italic>Authors' response: Since our data indicated that CD44 expression positively correlated with Foxp3 expression, we have revised this line in the introduction to correctly reflect our data</italic>.</p><p><bold>2) </bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>: The authors claim that "...<italic>location and sequence of Treg development remain unclear." </italic>Significant progress has been made in terms of a delineation of critical events during the earliest phase(s) of Treg differentiation and also in terms of the localization of their differentiation, which are not referenced here (Lio et al., 2008, Lee et al., 2009, Fontenot et al., 2005).</p><p>The following characterization of thymocyte subpopulations is based upon CD4/8/25/44 staining.

The only specific Treg marker to date is Foxp3, hence - especially given the already reported heterogeneity of CD4 SP CD25<sup>+ </sup>cells - Foxp3 staining would be essential for these types of analyses.</p><p><italic>Authors' response: As suggested by the reviewer, we have added the following references: Lio et al., 2008, Lee et al., 2009, Fontenot et al., 2005 in the revised manuscript.

Additionally, as stated in the introduction, Treg differentiation is thought to rely on thymic antigen encounter/TCR signaling. Nevertheless, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> implies that ~60% of CD4 SP CD25<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>- </sup>("Treg") cells do not express a TCR-&#x003b2; chain. This discrepancy is not discussed in the manuscript at all and might reflect a "spillover" from the DN compartment.</p><p><italic>Authors' response: We agree with the reviewer that our original Figure </italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref><italic>was not very clear and that it may cause some confusion. The revised Figure </italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref><italic>now only focuses on TCR-&#x003b2; expression among CD4</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>CD25</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>CD44</italic><sup>-</sup><italic>and CD4</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>CD25</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>CD44</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>SP cells.

Staining showing different levels of TCR-&#x003b2; expression among the described subsets are not provided, however. The suggestion that <italic>"...CD4</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>CD25</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>CD44</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>cells represent a more mature subset of Treg cells..." </italic>based upon the presented staining (lacking Foxp3 staining) and lacking any experiments providing evidence for a precursor/progeny relationship is daring.</p><p><italic>Authors' response: We think that the reviewer meant Figure </italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref><italic>and not Figure </italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. <italic>We found that CD4</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>CD25</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>CD44</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>cells expressed the highest level TCR-&#x003b2; in thymocytes.

These results clearly necessitate a re-examination of the results and interpretation of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <italic>2</italic>. The results presented also argue for a relatively low percentage of CD25<sup>+</sup>/high cells being Foxp3<sup>+</sup>, which is not consistent with the literature on Foxp3<sup>+ </sup>cells in the (adult) thymus (Fontenot et al., 2005).</p><p><italic>Authors' response: We appreciate for reviewer's insightful comments. In more than 10 independent repeats, we sometimes detected higher frequencies and sometimes lower frequencies of Foxp3</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>cells. To confirm the trends, we carefully performed additional experiments. After careful reviewing all of our data, especially the new data, we decided to present a revised Figure </italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <italic>showing our new data. This is not to say that the old data were wrong, since it is a cellular staining, Foxp3 expression varied in different samples. Importantly, however, the rate of Foxp3 expression in CD44</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>and CD44</italic><sup>-</sup><italic>subset was similar in all of the data analyzed</italic>.</p><p><bold>6) </bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>: The authors claim to have done a <italic>"functional assessment of Treg cell subsets in mouse thymus and spleen." </italic>The data presented only show the suppressive activity of splenocytes. (For thymocytes: only Real Time PCR data are provided). The differences in suppressive potency (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>) are very modest.

The differences are modest and probably not too informative, however.</p><p><italic>Authors' response: The only ways to show "functional assessment of Treg cell subsets in mouse thymus and spleen" are by RT-PCR, real Time RT-PCR and intercellular staining, and we obtained similar results with these different assays. Our experiments were limited by cell sorting conditions, as we could not sort enough of CD44 Treg cells, which influenced our results. However, we have provided new data in which Treg: effector cells were used in a ratio of 1:2, and the suppressive potency was impressive (new Figure </italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>).</p><p><bold>7) </bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> are redundant.

Studies on a role of IL-10 and TGF-beta in Treg cell induction/homeostasis and suppressor function (Li and Flavell 2008, amongst many others) and a possible role for CD44 and Foxp3<sup>+ </sup>cells can - via intracellular staining - be visualized as a distinct population among CD4<sup>+ </sup>cells. The CD4/Foxp3 plots in Figure 8B do not really allow for gating on Foxp3<sup>+ </sup>cells. Due to the experimental setup and the lack of "resolution" provided by the Foxp3 staining shown an interpretation suggesting an low/high molecular weight hyaluronic-acid in Treg function (Bollyky et al., 2007) have been reported elsewhere and are not sufficiently referenced in this section.</p><p>In aggregate, this manuscript provides some insights into how Treg can be subdivided into subpopulations differing in their suppressive potency based upon the expression of the hyaluronic-acid receptor CD44. However, the concerns mentioned above should be addressed in order to clarify the validity of the given interpretations and conclusions. We hope that these comments are helpful to improve the quality of this manuscript.</p><p><italic>Authors' response: In this study, we have used anti-IL-10 antibody to block IL-10 in splenocytes, and we found that IL-10 induced Foxp3 expression was decreased.

Figure </italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref><italic>shows that TCR-&#x003b2; locus plays an important role in the development of T cells.

As pointed out in my previous review, the magnitude of suppression in this figure is not great (compared to other published studies) and the differences between the CD44<sup>+ </sup>and the CD44<sup>-</sup>populations could easily be accounted by minor differences in percentage of Foxp3<sup>+ </sup>T cells. The same criticism applies to the data in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>.</p><p><italic>Authors' response: We have quantitated by intracellular staining, the percentage of Foxp3 expressing cells in splenocytes (Figure </italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). <italic>Our experiments were limited by cell sorting conditions, as we could not get sufficient numbers of CD44 T</italic><sub><italic>reg </italic></sub><italic>cells.

As suppression requires TCR activation, they need to stimulate the populations to determine how much of these cytokines they are capable of producing. Elisa assays and intracellular staining are needed. MOST IMPORTANTLY, they need to do simultaneous staining for IL-10 and Foxp3. We agree that this it is difficult to analyze TGF-beta by IC staining.</p><p><italic>Authors' response: We have performed this study in Figure </italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>. <italic>The most critical step for detection of intracellular accumulation of cytokines by intracellular staining is activation of a cell population to induce production of cytokines of interest.

The authors need to add the anti-IL-10 to the na&#x000ef;ve T cells alone. Anti-IL-10 will frequently increase the response of this population as well. In general, anti-CD28 reverses suppression in the mouse model and it is very difficult to suppress mouse T cell activation in the presence of anti-CD28 (the authors might review some of the papers published years ago which address this point). It is unclear why the authors see a reversal of suppression with anti-IL-10 as other groups using highly purified Foxp3<sup>+ </sup>T cells have not seen this. There seems to be no difference in the susceptibility of the high versus the low population to anti-IL-10 reversal, so one would assume that their data should not differ from the published data using Tregs that are not fractionated based on CD44 expression. One possibility is that the cell populations contain IL-10 producing non-Foxp3<sup>+ </sup>T cells, so called Tr1-like cells.</p><p><italic>Authors' response: Anti-IL-10 with na&#x000ef;ve T cell data have been added (only anti-CD3 and not anti-CD28 in the medium) as a control.
