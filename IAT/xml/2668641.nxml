Cytokine-stimulated cord blood CD34<sup>+</sup> cells could be transduced at 85% efficiency and 95% cell viability by a single 24-h infection with RD114-pseudotyped retroviral vectors, produced by the packaging cell line Plat-F and bicistronic vector plasmids pMXs-Ig, pMYs-Ig, or pMCs-Ig, encoding EGFP. Infected CD34<sup>+ </sup>cells were seeded onto HESS-5 cells in the presence of stem cell factor and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, allowing the extensive production of B progenitors and granulocytic cells. We examined the cell number and CD34, CD33, CD19, and CD20 lambda and kappa expressions by flow cytometry. Ectopic expression of Pax5 in CD34<sup>+</sup> cells resulted in small myeloid progenitors coexpressing CD33 and CD19 and inhibited myeloid differentiation. After 6&#x000a0;weeks, the number of Pax5-transduced CD19<sup>+</sup> cells was 40-fold lower than that of control cells. However, the expression of CD20 and the &#x003ba;/&#x003bb; chain on Pax5-transduced CD19<sup>+</sup> cells suggests that the Pax5 transgene may not interfere with their differentiation.

B-cell development is closely associated with the coordinated expression of phenotypic markers, such as B-cell receptors, cytokine receptors, and their signal mediators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Most of our knowledge on B-cell development has come from extensive studies in mice; the examination of human B-cell lymphopoiesis has been hampered by a lack of appropriate experimental systems, although some studies have been performed on tumor cells. Recently, human B lymphopoiesis was partially reconstituted in immuno-deficient mice, and, several weeks after transplantation, the major B-cell populations consisted of immature CD19<sup>+</sup>IgM<sup>&#x02212;</sup> B-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, such an in vivo system is not amenable to the sequential observation of B-cell differentiation, especially in the early stages.</p><p>For manipulating and observing human B-lymphoid progenitors, the in vitro simulation of human B lymphopoiesis by cultivating cord blood CD34<sup>+</sup> cells (CBCD34<sup>+</sup> cells) on a layer of murine, bone marrow stromal cells has been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Studies have also reported the molecular characterization of human hematopoietic progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and early T/NK and B-lymphoid progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], derived from coculturing CBCD34<sup>+</sup> cells with murine stromal cells. This culture method offers a limited, but useful experimental system for investigating the transcriptional regulation of both B-cell and granulocyte differentiation via the ectopic expression or silencing of lineage-specific transcription factors, including EBF, E2A, Pax5, and C/EBP family members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Retro- and lentiviral vectors have been widely used for gene delivery to human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A major problem with Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV)-based vectors is their low transduction efficiency, due to the reduced expression of the corresponding cellular receptors. This problem was resolved by the application of a pseudo-typed envelope protein from RD114, a feline endogenous retrovirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Another problem involves silencing the promoter activity of its long terminal repeat (LTR) in primitive stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The use of the LTR from murine stem cell virus (MSCV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] or myeloproliferative sarcoma virus (MPSV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] facilitated a more stable expression of foreign genes, both in vitro and in vivo. Eventually, bicistronic, MSCV-based retroviral vectors expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were developed that could effectively transduce murine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] stem/progenitor cells. One report described a series of retroviral vectors, including pMXs-Ig, pMYs-Ig, and pMCs-Ig, together with a novel packaging cell line, Plat-F, which generates the RD114 envelope protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we assessed these three retroviral vectors for their ability to transduce human CBCD34<sup>+</sup> cells and to stably express a foreign gene during differentiation toward B-lymphoid and myeloid lineages using a coculture system with HESS-5 cells. We showed that a single 24-h infection was sufficient for these vectors to transduce CBCD34<sup>+</sup> cells and to achieve stable expression of the foreign gene. Furthermore, we examined the effects of the ectopic expression of Pax5 in early B-lymphoid and myeloid progenitors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Preparation of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells from human umbilical cord blood (CB)</title><p>Umbilical CB units were collected from single-birth, full-term, normal deliveries following the standards for CB collection developed by the Tokyo Cord Blood Bank and the Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo.

Information on early B lymphopoiesis in humans substantially lags behind that in mice, and important differences exist between the two species. For example, interleukin-7 can support this process in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], but not in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. No combination of cytokines has been identified that stimulates human B-cell production in culture. Thus, the most effective models for human B lymphopoiesis employ murine stromal cells, which provide, as yet, uncharacterized stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>CBCD34<sup>+</sup> cells are heterogeneous, and most of them express CD33. Early B-lymphoid progenitors are included in a CD34<sup>+</sup>CD33<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD19<sup>&#x02212;</sup> minor fraction. Because E2A is commonly expressed in early B-lymphoid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and myeloid progenitors of rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], its high-level expression on day 1 in CD34<sup>+</sup> cells is reasonable. In murine experiments, EBF is primarily expressed around the proB cell stage, and Pax5 can be seen from the late proB to mature B-cell stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Their low level of expression during the first 2&#x000a0;weeks of culture seems to reflect the quite rare population in this stage among CB progenitors. However, RAG1 is expressed as early as in common lymphoid progenitors, transiently down-regulated after completion of the IgH gene rearrangement in the proB cell stage, and upregulated again at the preB cell stage, until completion of the IgL gene rearrangement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Based on our data from FCM and QR-PCR, human B lymphopoiesis simulated in vitro occurs as follows: before day 14, most B-lymphoid progenitors are in the pre-proB cell or earlier stages. Around day 21, mixed populations of proB and large preB cells occur. After day 28, small preB cells are increasing, and, on day 42, immature B-cells are developing. This is consistent with the report of Fluckiger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] who showed that the development of surface IgM<sup>+</sup> immature B-cells delimited the differentiation stage in a coculture system. Despite such a restriction, the present coculture system is a unique and suitable procedure for analyzing the early B lymphopoiesis in humans.</p><p>We verified the efficient retroviral transduction of both B-lymphoid and myeloid progenitors and stable expression of the foreign gene during their differentiation. We tested three types of vector containing different LTR sequences. Although the expression level of EGFP mediated by each vector was comparable in primary CD34<sup>+</sup>-cell populations, pMXs-mediated EGFP expression was more prominently reduced in myeloid and B-lymphoid cells compared to pMYs and pMCs. The use of Plat-F packaging cells facilitated a &#x0003e;85% transduction efficiency with a single 24-h infection protocol and &#x0003e;90% with a 4&#x000d7;-repeated infection protocol. Additionally, an adequate EGFP expression level was maintained in transduced cells for up to 9&#x000a0;weeks of culture. It has been reported that pMXs-mediated gene expression, and possibly pMYs (MSCV), was down-regulated in mature blood cells including erythroid, myeloid, and B-lymphoid cells after an in vivo, long-term BM repopulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Collectively, a combination of pMCs-Ig and Plat-F is valuable for genetically engineering human CD34<sup>+</sup> cells and their progeny in vitro.</p><p>Using this system, we examined whether ectopic Pax5 expression in CBCD34<sup>+</sup> cells would interfere with myeloid cell commitment and/or accelerate B-cell differentiation. Chiang and Monroe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] showed that Pax5 inhibited the expansion of myeloid progenitors by suppressing their response to myeloid growth factors and by directing multipotent progenitors toward the B-cell lineage in vitro. Cotta et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] reported that Pax5 is not sufficient to block myeloid development in vivo when ectopically expressed in primitive, multipotent progenitors. Recently, Anderson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] demonstrated that the ectopic expression of Pax5 in multipotent stem/progenitor cells generated B220<sup>+</sup>Gr1/Mac1<sup>+</sup> biphenotypic progenitors, which sustained the long-term generation of myeloid progenitors in vitro and remained capable of myeloid differentiation. All of these studies were performed on murine stem/progenitor cells, and did not refer to the impact of the Pax5 transgene on inhibiting B-cell development. Our data indicated that Pax5 markedly inhibited myelopoiesis. Specifically, the clonal growth of common myeloid (CFU-Mix) and early erythroid (BFU-E) progenitors was almost completely inhibited. In the coculture assay, granulocytic differentiation during the first week was partially arrested. CD19 expression could be induced by Pax5 in a significant portion of immature myeloid cells, as was described in our previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], and these cell populations rapidly disappeared from the culture. Assuming that these populations were human counterparts of B220<sup>+</sup>Gr1/Mac1<sup>+</sup> biphenotypic progenitors, our culture conditions were not optimized to support their survival. Additionally, we examined the development of these biphenotypic progenitors in a lymphoid-directed cytokine condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] with HESS-5 support. The percentage of biphenotypic progenitors increased up to 70% in the second week, but we could not maintain them for more than 3&#x000a0;weeks (data not shown). We hypothesize that ectopic Pax5 may induce CD19 expression in myeloid progenitors and maintain its expression during the early phase of granulocytic differentiation. However, the differentiation of Pax5<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells seems to be blocked at the promyelocytic stage, and may undergo apoptosis instead of terminal differentiation. The results of cell cycle analysis and apoptosis assay support this hypothesis.</p><p>Although the mechanism by which Pax5 inhibits myelopoiesis is unknown, cross-talk appears to occur between Pax5 transcription factors, including GATA and C/EBP family members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], among which Pax5 is likely to be associated with PU.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], a transcription factor essential for myelopoiesis. The entrapment of PU.1 by ectopic Pax5 in myeloid progenitors may interfere with their growth and differentiation.</p><p>One of the unexpected findings of this study was the marked inhibition of B lymphopoiesis by ectopic Pax5. In the cell cycle analysis and apoptosis assay, ectopic Pax5-transduced B-lymphoid cells generated similar results to control cells. Inhibition apparently occurred during the first week of culture, when the expression of endogenous Pax5 was barely detectable but E2A was strongly expressed. The reduced number of early B-cell progenitors may decrease the production of B-cells without the impairment of differentiation. A defined hierarchy exists within B-cell-specific transcription factors, and endogenous Pax5 is induced by a coordinated action of E2A and EBF. Although we could not examine changes in the expression of endogenous transcription factors brought about by ectopic Pax5, negative feedback may occur from Pax5 to E2A, resulting in the impairment of further B-cell development. The conditional expression of Pax5, for example, by the use of estrogen receptor fusions during B-cell differentiation in combination with single cell sorting, will likely be required to examine the precise mode of action of ectopic Pax5. Nevertheless, this is the initial study to report the consequences of forced Pax5 expression in human hematopoietic progenitors.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported in part by a Grant-in-aid from the Ministry of Education, Science, Sports, and Culture of Japan.
