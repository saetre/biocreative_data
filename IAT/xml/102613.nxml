Biochemical studies have revealed La to be a promiscuous RNA-binding protein that appears to play a role in a variety of intracellular activities such as processing and&#x0002f;or transport of RNA polymerase III precursor transcripts and translational regulation from internal ribosome entry sites (IRES). We have previously identified an RNA-binding protein that is a <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> homolog of La (D-La) and shown that early transcript accumulation throughout the embryo is later refined to be most prevalent in the visceral mesoderm, gut, gonads and salivary glands. Here we report the first <italic>in vivo</italic> genetic characterization of a La homolog in a multicellular eukaryote. Lethality was observed in homozygous larvae harboring a small chromosomal deletion that removed the <italic>D-La</italic> gene, which was rescued by an inducible <italic>D-La</italic> cDNA transgene. This implies that D-La confers essential functions for larval development. In addition, loss of D-La function gives rise to defects in embryonic midgut morphogenesis; one of the midgut defects correlates with loss of <italic>Ultrabithorax</italic> (<italic>Ubx</italic>) expression along the second midgut constriction. Finally, genetic interactions between chromosomal deficiencies that remove <italic>D-La</italic> and certain <italic>Ubx</italic> alleles were demonstrated in adults. Our results support the hypothesis that D-La provides essential functions for proper <italic>Drosophila</italic> development and imply that the conserved La family of proteins may perform critical developmental functions in higher eukaryotes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The RNA-binding protein La&#x0002f;SSB is one of the major antigens against which autoantibodies are targeted in human rheumatological autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sjogren&#x02019;s syndrome. La normally localizes to the nuclear or cytoplasmic compartments of the cell, where it exists as part of a ribonuclear protein (RNP) complex of unknown function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c2">2</xref>). Biochemical and molecular studies have indicated that La can bind to the 3&#x02032;-end of small nuclear RNA (snRNA) precursors transcribed by RNA polymerase III. Examples of this association include precursors of tRNA, 4.5S RNA, 5S RNA, 7S RNA and U6 RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c4">4</xref>), where La binds to a short tract of uridylate residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c7">7</xref>). The significance of this binding is unknown but, as a consequence, La may function in the termination, processing and&#x0002f;or nuclear export of RNA polymerase III precursor transcripts. La has also been implicated in transcript release and transcription reinitiation by RNA polymerase III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c9">9</xref>).</p><p>Other studies have connected La to the regulation of translation. For example, La can bind to and alleviate the translational repression normally mediated by the secondary structure of the TAR sequence located within the first 111 nt of HIV-1 mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c11">11</xref>). This binding is direct and specific, since La&#x02013;TAR RNP complexes can be identified in HIV-1-infected lymphocytes. In addition, the specific binding of La to transcripts containing TAR sequences fused to a reporter gene can relieve TAR-mediated translational inhibition in reticulocyte lysates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c11">11</xref>).</p><p>La has also been implicated in regulating translational initiation from internal ribosome entry sites (IRES). Translation of mRNA is usually dependent on recognition of the 5&#x02032;-cap structure and subsequent scanning by the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c12">12</xref>). However, viruses with segmented RNA genomes that lack caps use IRESs to properly recruit the ribosome and initiate translation. La-enhanced internal initiation of translation at IRESs has been reported for certain uncapped picornaviruses such as poliovirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c13">13</xref>). In addition, certain cellular mRNAs possess relatively long 5&#x02032;-untranslated regions (UTRs) or extensive secondary structures that prevent cap-dependent translational read-through by the ribosome. In such cases, translational initiation can occur through an IRES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c15">15</xref>). UV crosslinking experiments and competition assays have revealed that La can bind to IRESs and that this binding can enhance IRES-mediated translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c16">16</xref>). Functional IRESs have been identified by assaying the expression of dicistronic constructs in transfected cells. Examples of mRNAs with a functional IRES include those encoding human fibroblast growth factor (<italic>fgf2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c17">17</xref>), human insulin growth factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c18">18</xref>), human eIF-4G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c19">19</xref>), human immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (<italic>Bip</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c21">21</xref>) and the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homeotic gene <italic>Antennapedia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c22">22</xref>). Moreover, mRNA encoded by the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homeotic gene <italic>Ultrabithorax</italic> (<italic>Ubx</italic>) has been shown to contain an IRES that can function in transfected cells and in transgenic flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c23">23</xref>).</p><p>In summary, biochemical and molecular data have shown La to be an RNA-binding protein implicated in many aspects of RNA metabolism. It has been proposed that La can do this by acting as a molecular chaperone that stabilizes the tertiary structure of RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c24">24</xref>). This stabilization is thought to make RNA more accessible to proteins that mediate diverse processes such as RNA transport, processing and translation. A genetic analysis of La protein function would provide an entry point to establish the <italic>in vivo</italic> role of La in these RNA metabolic and regulatory pathways. To date, genetic analysis has only been performed with a yeast La homolog in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. Unfortunately, yeast cells containing a null allele of the gene encoding the La protein are viable, suggesting that either La is not essential in yeast or that another protein(s) plays a functionally redundant role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c25">25</xref>).</p><p>To address the consequences of genetically altering the activity of the La gene in a higher multicellular eukaryote, we have focused on the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster.</italic> Previously, we reported the identification of cDNA clones from <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> that encode a protein homologous throughout its entire length to vertebrate La (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c26">26</xref>). Like its vertebrate homologs, D-La can bind RNA <italic>in vitro</italic>, presumably through its putative RNA recognition motif (RRM) which harbors RNP1 and RNP2 consensus sequences. Whole mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization experiments revealed that <italic>D-La</italic> transcripts are not present in all ovarian tissues and early expression throughout the embryo is later refined to be most prevalent in the visceral mesoderm, gonads, gut and salivary glands. In the present study, we provide genetic evidence suggesting that D-La is encoded by an essential gene that functions at multiple stages of <italic>Drosophila</italic> development. Our results imply that the activity of the conserved La protein family is essential for proper development of higher eukaryotes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> strains</title><p>Fly strain <italic>l(2)08327</italic> was obtained from the collection of Allan Spradling (Carnegie Institution). <italic>Df(2L)11A</italic> was obtained from Lynn Manseau (University of Arizona). <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization of <italic>l(2)08327</italic> larval salivary gland polytene chromosomes revealed the location of P-element insertions at 27A1,2, 38C1,2 and 47A11,14.

Though mutations in essential genes located in the vicinity of <italic>D-La</italic> at 38C1,2 have been reported, lethal saturation screens uncovering all possible complementation groups within this region have not been conducted. We thus decided to generate mutations for phenotypic analysis by conducting a P-element transposition screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c35">35</xref>) over a series of overlapping deficiencies that completely remove the <italic>D-La</italic> gene. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd228f1">1</xref> schematically depicts the boundaries of two available deficiencies, <italic>Df(2L)11A</italic> and <italic>Df(2L)pr21</italic>, that completely removed the 38C1,2 region. Quantitative genomic Southern blot analysis confirmed that <italic>D-La</italic> was completely removed from <italic>Df(2L)pr21</italic> (data not shown). An available P-element insertion <italic>l(2)08327</italic>, in the 38C1,2 region, was obtained from the collection of Allan Spradling (Carnegie Institution) and subsequent molecular analysis indicated that the <italic>D-La</italic> transcription unit was not disrupted (data not shown). In addition to the P-element (marked with <italic>ry</italic><italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic>) at 38C1,2, this chromosome also harbored two additional insertions at 27A1,2 and 47A11,14. Hence, before using this stock for local P-element transposition, we used genetic recombination to remove the two undesirable P-elements and generated a new stock containing only a single P-element insertion at 38C1,2. The resulting stock, which we refer to as <italic>fs(2)P8</italic>, was no longer homozygous lethal, but was female sterile due to a single P-element insertion that could not be complemented by mutant alleles of the female sterile gene <italic>spire</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c37">37</xref>).</p><p>DNA sequences flanking the transposon insertion in <italic>fs(2)P8</italic> were isolated, sequenced and found to be located in the first exon of <italic>spire</italic>, as deduced from P1 clone <italic>AC002503</italic>, placing the P-element less than 40 kb away from <italic>D-La</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd228f1">1</xref>). Since mobilized P-elements tend to reinsert locally in the vicinity of the original insertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c35">35</xref>), we attempted to mobilize the P-element in <italic>fs(2)P8</italic> in an effort to generate insertional mutations in <italic>D-La</italic>. Five of the 1200 jumps were lethal over the overlapping deficiencies <italic>Df(2L)11A</italic> and <italic>Df(2L)pr21</italic> that completely removed the <italic>D-La</italic> gene. To confirm that these five lethal lines contain P-elements, genomic DNA was digested with <italic>Eco</italic>RI and <italic>Sal</italic>I and probed with the left end of the <italic>ry</italic> gene (<italic>ry</italic><sub>L</sub>) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd228f2">2</xref>A). This probe hybridizes to a 3 kb <italic>Eco</italic>RI&#x02013;<italic>Sal</italic>I fragment of the endogenous <italic>ry</italic> gene as well as to fragments containing a <italic>ry</italic> transgene in the P-element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c38">38</xref>). Since this <italic>Sal</italic>I site is included in the <italic>ry</italic> transgene, the <italic>ry</italic><sub>L</sub> probe detects fragments from <italic>Eco</italic>RI on the P-element to the next flanking genomic <italic>Sal</italic>I or <italic>Eco</italic>RI site. This analysis indicated that all five lines contain P-element insertions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd228f2">2</xref>B). Moreover, the P-elements in <italic>PJ2</italic>, <italic>PJ17</italic> and <italic>PJ19</italic> appear to be located in the same position as in the original P-element in <italic>fs(2)P8</italic>. <italic>PJ20</italic> and <italic>PJ25</italic> contain new P-element insertions in the 38C region, but subsequent molecular analysis indicated that neither disrupted the <italic>D-La</italic> transcription unit (data not shown). This analysis also revealed that <italic>fs(2)P8</italic>, <italic>PJ2</italic> and <italic>PJ17</italic> display a band migrating below the 3 kb endogenous <italic>ry</italic> fragment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd228f2">2</xref>B) which may represent a P-element inserted within a P-element or a partially deleted <italic>ry</italic> gene inserted somewhere between <italic>Sp</italic> and <italic>cn</italic> on chromosome II. We favor the first possibility since there is no evidence for a second P-element in chromosomal <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization experiments. Nevertheless, since this second insertion is also in the parental <italic>fs(2)P8</italic> strain, it clearly does not contribute to any detectable phenotype.</p><p>The <italic>D-La</italic> gene is located between positions 44077 and 42468 on the P1 clone <italic>AC002503</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd228f1">1</xref>). Since <italic>PJ2</italic>, <italic>PJ17</italic> and <italic>PJ19</italic> represent lethal alleles that were indistinguishable (in Southern blots using the <italic>ry</italic><sub>L</sub> probe) from the female sterile <italic>fs(2)P8</italic> insertion, we concluded that the lethality must result from deletions adjacent to the original P-element insertion. To determine if any of these putative deletions affected <italic>D-La</italic>, a series of primers along the <italic>AC002503</italic> clone were designed and used together with P-element primers in PCR amplification experiments. The most interesting result was obtained with <italic>PJ17</italic> genomic DNA, when primer pair pBRI (at the 5&#x02032;-end of the P-element, facing proximally) and RhoGEF45180 (between positions 45180 and 45161 on <italic>AC002503</italic>) were used, which generated a fragment of ~1.2 kb. Sequencing of the generated PCR product revealed that the deletion broke at the fourth amino acid of D-La. At the opposite end of the P-element, when primer pair P-3 (at the 3&#x02032;-end, facing distally) and 4877 (between positions 4877 and 4897 on <italic>AC002503</italic>) were used, a fragment of ~750 bp was generated. Sequencing of this PCR product confirmed that the P-element in <italic>PJ17</italic> was still inserted at position 5611, exactly as in <italic>fs(2)P8</italic>, from which it was derived. Therefore, in <italic>Df(2L)PJ17</italic> the genomic region from 5612 to 44006 is deleted, removing all of the coding region of <italic>spire</italic> and <italic>D-La.</italic> The deletions in <italic>Df(2L)PJ2</italic> and <italic>Df(2L)PJ19</italic> contain the same distal break point but extend past <italic>D-La</italic> and <italic>RhoGEF</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd228f1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>D-La</italic> deficiencies are lethal</title><p>Molecular analysis indicated that the adjacent genes <italic>spire</italic> and <italic>D-La</italic> (which overlap by 6 bp at their 3&#x02032;-ends) are disrupted in deficiencies <italic>Df(2L)PJ2</italic>, <italic>Df(2L)PJ17</italic> and <italic>Df(2L)PJ19</italic>. Since <italic>spire</italic> is not an essential gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c37">37</xref>) and is located next to <italic>D-La</italic>, then the lethality associated with <italic>Df(2L)PJ17</italic> apparently results from either a deletion of <italic>D-La</italic>, an unknown overlapping transcription unit or from a spontaneously arising secondary lethal mutation located outside the 38C1,2 region. To examine the latter possibility, we performed complementation tests among <italic>fs(2)P8</italic>, <italic>Df(2L)PJ17</italic> and <italic>Df(2L)PJ19</italic>. The finding that <italic>Df(2L)PJ17</italic> and <italic>Df(2L)PJ19</italic> could not complement the female sterility of <italic>fs(2)P8</italic> is consistent with the molecular data that <italic>spire</italic> is disrupted in both deficiency chromosomes. However, <italic>fs(2)P8</italic> can complement the lethality of both <italic>Df(2L)PJ17</italic> and <italic>Df(2L)PJ19</italic>, which are derived independently and contain deletions in <italic>spire</italic> and <italic>D-La</italic>, whereas <italic>Df(2L)PJ17</italic> and <italic>Df(2L)PJ19</italic> cannot complement each other (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd228tb1">1</xref>). These results support the hypothesis that the lethality associated with <italic>Df(2L)PJ17</italic> is due to removal of DNA between <italic>D-La</italic> and <italic>spire</italic> and not the result of secondary mutations arising outside the chromosomal deletion at 38C1,2.</p><p>To determine the stage at which <italic>D-La</italic> may be required for viability, a lethality test was conducted (as described in Materials and Methods). Since only 25&#x00025; of the offspring derived from the test cross are homozygous mutant for <italic>D-La</italic>, lethality is defined as the stage whose survival rate is proportionally decreased. As shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd228tb2">2</xref>, the lethality associated with both <italic>Df(2L)PJ17</italic> and <italic>Df(2L)PJ19</italic> occurs at the larval stage. Based on the zygotic visceral mesoderm expression of <italic>D-La</italic>, mutant embryos would be expected to hatch but may die later as feeding larvae because of possible associated gut abnormalities. Examination of homozygous mutant <italic>D-La</italic> embryos (as revealed by lack of &#x003b2;-galactosidase staining of the <italic>lacZ</italic> marked balancer chromosome) indicated that most of the embryos displayed a gut phenotype resembling a failure of the three midgut constrictions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd228f3">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Genetic rescue of <italic>Df(2L)PJ17</italic> lethality</title><p>Assuming that loss of <italic>D-La</italic> is responsible for the associated lethality, we attempted to rescue <italic>Df(2L)PJ17</italic> and <italic>Df(2L)PJ19</italic> by introducing chromosomes that carried a <italic>D-La</italic> cDNA under control of the <italic>hsp70</italic> promoter. After examining over 5000 individual flies for each strain maintained at 25&#x000b0;C, we did not observe any <italic>Df(2L)PJ17</italic> or <italic>Df(2L)PJ19</italic> escapers. To induce expression of the <italic>hsp70-D-La</italic> cDNA, we employed a protocol which administered two heat shock treatments per day over a 2&#x000a0;week period. As a negative control, we performed identical heat shock induction experiments and monitored the emergence to adulthood of 1691 <italic>Df(2L)PJ17</italic> and 1123 <italic>Df(2L)PJ19</italic> mutants that lacked <italic>D-La</italic> cDNA transgenes. Homozygous escapers were not observed in these negative control groups. Thus, any homozygous (straight wing) flies carrying an inducible <italic>D-La</italic> cDNA transgene that emerge from our heat shock induction experiments would represent rescued adults. We did not observe any rescue of <italic>Df(2L)PJ19</italic> (out of a total of 881 flies examined). However, a total of three straight wing adults out of 682 flies examined were rescued in <italic>Df(2L)PJ17</italic> by the <italic>D-La</italic> cDNA transgene. Among these rescued flies, one was female and two were male. All three flies died within a week after eclosion in the absence of additional heat shock. As expected, no offspring were generated from the rescued female (which was still homozygous for the female sterile <italic>spire</italic> deletion) when crossed to wild-type males. These results support the hypothesis that the larval lethality associated with <italic>Df(2L)PJ17</italic> is due to a loss of <italic>D-La</italic> function and suggest that expression of D-La is also required in adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Deficiencies lacking <italic>D-La</italic> fail to express <italic>Ubx</italic> in the second midgut constriction</title><p>We have shown that deficiencies in <italic>D-La</italic> function give rise to a midgut phenotype in the embryo. Since vertebrate La has been implicated in regulating translational initiation from IRESs, we determined whether any of the genes known to function in <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut morphogenesis contained such an element. A good candidate was <italic>Ubx</italic>, which is expressed along and required for formation of the second midgut constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c39">39</xref>) and whose translation is mediated by internal ribosome entry mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c23">23</xref>). To test whether <italic>D-La</italic> may regulate expression of <italic>Ubx</italic> in this region, we examined the distribution of Ubx protein in wild-type and mutant embryos. In wild-type embryos, both <italic>Ubx</italic> mRNA and protein can be detected in the second midgut constriction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd228f4">4</xref>A and B). However, in homozygous mutant embryos (as revealed by lack of &#x003b2;-galactosidase staining of the <italic>lacZ</italic> marked balancer chromosome) expression of <italic>Ubx</italic> was lost (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd228f4">4</xref>E and F), resulting in gut constriction defects during embryogenesis. The penetrance of this midgut phenotype is 73&#x00025; (72 of 98 homozygous stage 15&#x02013;16 <italic>D-La</italic> mutant embryos). The constrictions and <italic>Ubx</italic> expression in the remaining mutant embryos (27&#x00025;) were unaffected.</p><p>The results suggesting that <italic>D-La</italic> is required for expression of <italic>Ubx</italic> in the second midgut constriction imply that D-La may regulate translational initiation of Ubx directly from the IRES. If <italic>D-La</italic> is required for the IRES-dependent translation of Ubx, we would expect to see an effect on translation of Ubx protein in <italic>D-La</italic> deletion embryos, but no effect on <italic>Ubx</italic> transcription in the second midgut constriction region. When we examined <italic>D-La</italic> mutant embryos for <italic>Ubx</italic> mRNA and protein simultaneously, neither was detected and we did not observe any embryos that expressed <italic>Ubx</italic> mRNA in the absence of Ubx protein (data not shown). Thus, instead of supporting a direct involvement of D-La in regulating translational initiation from the <italic>Ubx</italic> IRES, these results are more consistent with a role in stabilizing <italic>Ubx</italic> transcripts.</p></sec><sec><title>Genetic interactions in adults between <italic>D-La</italic> deficiencies and <italic>Ubx</italic> alleles</title><p>Certain <italic>Ubx</italic> alleles, when maintained as heterozygotes, display ectopic bristles on adult halteres. One such allele, <italic>Ubx</italic><italic><sup>9.22</sup></italic>, which contains a deletion that originates in the third intron and extends into the 3&#x02032; exon, does not produce any of the Ubx protein isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c40">40</xref>).

An examination of 203 adults revealed that flies heterozygous for both <italic>Df(2L)PJ17</italic> and <italic>Ubx</italic><italic><sup>9.22</sup></italic> display an average of 3.5 bristles&#x0002f;haltere, thus enhancing the <italic>Ubx</italic><italic><sup>9.22</sup></italic> adult phenotype. This is consistent with the deficiency screen of Burnette <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c41">41</xref>), who reported an average of 2.9 bristles&#x0002f;haltere for flies heterozygous for both <italic>Ubx</italic><italic><sup>9.22</sup></italic> and <italic>Df(2L)TW84</italic>, a large deficiency that covers the <italic>D-La</italic> region. These results imply that dominant genetic interactions between <italic>D-La</italic> and <italic>Ubx</italic> can occur in adult structures. In addition, RT&#x02013;PCR analysis of <italic>Ubx</italic><italic><sup>9.22</sup></italic> and <italic>Df(2L)PJ17</italic> double heterozygotes did not indicate any alterations in the relative accumulation of <italic>Ubx</italic> isoforms (A.R.Hatton and A.J.Lopez, personal communication), suggesting that D-La does not affect the splicing of <italic>Ubx</italic> transcripts.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The goal of this study was to address the consequences of genetically altering the activity of La in a higher multicellular eukaryote. To accomplish this aim, we focused on genetic assessment of D-La, a La homolog of <italic>D.melanogaster.</italic> In generating <italic>D-La</italic> null alleles, PCR analysis and DNA sequencing confirmed that <italic>Df(2L)PJ17</italic> contained a deletion which removed both <italic>spire</italic> and the adjacent <italic>D-La</italic> gene. Since <italic>spire</italic> is not a lethal gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c37">37</xref>), this implied that the lethality of <italic>Df(2L)PJ17</italic> was caused by loss of <italic>D-La</italic> function. This was confirmed in genetic rescue experiments by crossing into <italic>Df(2L)PJ17</italic>, a transgenic line which contained an inducible <italic>hsp70-D-La</italic> cDNA construct on the third chromosome. The fact that adults rescued with <italic>hsp70-D-La</italic> cDNA died after cessation of heat shock induction indicates that ongoing D-La expression is required even during adulthood. This low frequency of rescue is not surprising considering that the cDNA transgene was driven by a <italic>hsp70</italic> promoter and thus required a continuous induction scheme over the entire <italic>Drosophila</italic> life cycle. Moreover, since D-La is a promiscuous RNA-binding protein, its induced overexpression (which is a consequence of the rescue assay) may be detrimental to several different RNA metabolic pathways and this in turn can be responsible for the low rescue frequency. In support of this, we have noted loss of viability in heat shocked lines that contain wild-type copies of the endogenous <italic>D-La</italic> gene and a <italic>hsp70-D-La</italic>-cDNA transgene (data not shown). <italic>Df(2L)PJ19</italic>, which contains an extended proximal deletion beyond <italic>D-La</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd228f1">1</xref>), was not rescued by crossing in transgenic lines that contain a <italic>hsp70-D-La</italic> cDNA, suggesting the presence of additional essential genes in the deleted region.</p><p>In addition to larval lethality, we have shown that deficiency homozygotes that lack <italic>D-La</italic> function give rise to embryonic midgut phenotypes. Since <italic>Ubx</italic> mRNAs contain a functional IRES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c23">23</xref>) and are expressed and required for the second midgut constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c39">39</xref>), it seemed likely that <italic>D-La</italic> may be involved in controlling the translation of <italic>Ubx</italic>. In support of this hypothesis, vertebrate La has been shown to directly bind and regulate translation through IRES elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c16">16</xref>). Consistent with this interpretation, our analysis revealed that 73&#x00025; of homozygous stage 15&#x02013;16 <italic>D-La</italic> mutant embryos did not express Ubx protein. However, when <italic>D-La</italic> mutant embryos were examined for mRNA and protein simultaneously, we did not find any embryos that expressed <italic>Ubx</italic> mRNA in the absence of Ubx protein.</p><p>Rather than directly regulating Ubx translation through the IRES, our results are more supportive of the possibility that D-La may indirectly control translation by preventing the turnover of <italic>Ubx</italic> transcripts. Under this scenario, D-La may bind and stabilize <italic>Ubx</italic> mRNA by acting as a molecular chaperone. In contrast to what is observed in <italic>D-La</italic> mutants, <italic>Ubx</italic> mRNA is stable and can be clearly detected along the second midgut constriction of wild-type embryos. If D-La is functioning as a universal RNA chaperone, it is not surprising that a <italic>hsp70-D-La</italic> cDNA construct was capable of rescuing defects associated with <italic>D-La</italic> loss of function without introducing many adverse gain of function phenotypes. The RNA chaperone hypothesis is also consistent with the RNA-binding promiscuity associated with La family members and their putative functional role in several unrelated post-transcriptional processes (such as TAR- and IRES-mediated translational control as well as processing of RNA polymerase III precursor transcripts). This model also attractively explains how La can function in various aspects of RNA metabolism. However, the relatively discrete embryonic midgut phenotype associated with <italic>D-La</italic> loss of function is somewhat at odds with the RNA chaperone hypothesis. One possibility is that although D-La may stabilize a variety of RNAs and increase the efficiency of many RNA metabolic processes, it is not essential for most aspects of RNA metabolism. This is consistent with the lack of lethality in yeast knockouts. Specific phenotypes in higher organisms may be explained by proposing that, in addition to acting as an RNA chaperone, La might specifically interact with or recruit other essential proteins in particular processes. For example, D-La may be controlling the stability of the <italic>Ubx</italic> midgut-specific isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c40">40</xref>) by recruiting an essential unknown factor. The absence of D-La protein may allow otherwise sequestered nucleases to become available to degrade <italic>Ubx</italic> mRNA. Rather than a direct interaction between D-La and <italic>Ubx</italic> mRNA, our expression, rescue and haploinsufficiency data could be alternatively interpreted as indirect effects of D-La in the regulation of nuclease activity or localization.</p><p>Based on the results presented here, and the overwhelming evidence that La proteins directly bind to many RNAs, we favor the hypothesis that D-La may stabilize <italic>Ubx</italic> mRNA and facilitate its efficient translation. Whether this putative direct regulation of stability and indirect regulation of translational efficiency operates through the IRES remains to be demonstrated. Genetic analysis of a yeast La homolog supports this speculation. One of two yeast homologs is encoded by the <italic>LHP1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c25">25</xref>), which, like mammalian La, binds nascent polymerase III transcripts and is involved in their processing. In wild-type yeast cells, Lhp1p is involved in the endonucleolytic removal of the 3&#x02032;-trailer sequence of pre-tRNA<sup>Ser</sup>. In the absence of Lhp1p, the 3&#x02032;-trailer sequence of pre-tRNA<sup>Ser</sup> is removed by an exonuclease(s). Though <italic>LHP1</italic> is normally not required for viability, when a second mutation that disrupts the anticodon stem structure of pre-tRNAs occurs, Lhp1p becomes necessary for survival. An additional mutation that restores base pairing of the anticodon stem structure eliminates the requirement for <italic>Lhp1p</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd228c42">42</xref>). These data suggest that the yeast La homolog may function to stabilize the conformation of yeast pre-tRNA so as to allow pre-tRNA processing to occur in a specific pathway.</p><p>Interestingly, the midgut phenotype associated with <italic>D-La</italic> mutant embryos is not fully penetrant (i.e. 73&#x00025;) whereas larval lethality is observed in all homozygotes. One explanation to account for this difference is that maternal <italic>D-La</italic> may compensate for loss of the zygotic function in the embryo. Maternal <italic>D-La</italic> transcripts may persist and contribute functionally after gastrulation and therefore partially complement the requirement for zygotic <italic>D-La</italic>. Since the zygotic expression of <italic>D-La</italic> and <italic>Ubx</italic> overlap only in the central midgut, it is possible that a maternally derived source of D-La may regulate <italic>Ubx</italic> elsewhere in the embryo, but this will have to await the analysis of <italic>D-La</italic> germline clones. Thus, the incomplete penetrance (73&#x00025;) of the embryonic midgut constriction phenotype associated with <italic>Df(2L)PJ17</italic> homozygotes may be due to stochastic compensation by maternally derived <italic>D-La</italic> transcripts in the embryonic midgut. This maternal activity may be insufficient or may fail to persist later in development to compensate for lack of the zygotic function during larval development. Other possibilities are that translation of <italic>Ubx</italic> is controlled differentially in different tissues (supported by the observation that its translation in the ventral cord is not affected in the absence of D-La) or that other molecules can partially compensate for loss of <italic>D-La</italic> function. It is also possible that other RNA metabolic processes, such as expression and maturation of RNA polymerase III transcripts and translational regulation of other loci besides <italic>Ubx</italic>, may be affected by the D-La insufficiency.</p><p>To further examine its putative role as an RNA chaperone functioning in a variety of post-transcriptional processes, future experiments with <italic>D-La</italic> will focus on performing genetic screens to identify interacting genes and downstream targets.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd228f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Genomic map of the region containing <italic>RhoGEF</italic>, <italic>D-La</italic> and <italic>spire</italic>.
