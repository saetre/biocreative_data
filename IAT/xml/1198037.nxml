Osteopontin was localized to alveolar epithelial cells in IPF lungs and was also significantly elevated in bronchoalveolar lavage from IPF patients. To study the fibrosis-relevant effects of osteopontin we stimulated primary human lung fibroblasts and alveolar epithelial cells (A549) with recombinant osteopontin. Osteopontin induced a significant increase of migration and proliferation in both fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Epithelial growth was inhibited by the pentapeptide Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (GRGDS) and antibody to CD44, while fibroproliferation was inhibited by GRGDS and antibody to &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin. Fibroblast and epithelial cell migration were inhibited by GRGDS, anti-CD44, and anti-&#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>. In fibroblasts, osteopontin up-regulated tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease-1 and type I collagen, and down-regulated matrix metalloprotease-1 (MMP-1) expression, while in A549 cells it caused up-regulation of MMP-7. In human IPF lungs, osteopontin colocalized with MMP-7 in alveolar epithelial cells, and application of weakest link statistical models to microarray data suggested a significant interaction between osteopontin and MMP-7.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results provide a potential mechanism by which osteopontin secreted from the alveolar epithelium may exert a profibrotic effect in IPF lungs and highlight osteopontin as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in this incurable disease.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Osteopontin may have a critical role in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and be a target for therapeutic intervention in this disease.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic fibrosing interstitial pneumonia of unknown etiology characterized by alveolar epithelial cell injury/activation, fibroblast proliferation, and exaggerated accumulation of extracellular matrix in the lung parenchyma &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020251-b01">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020251-b02">2</xref>&#x0005d;.

We demonstrated that osteopontin was the most up-regulated gene in lungs of IPF patients, and that it was mainly expressed by alveolar epithelial cells. To better understand the potential local profibrotic effects of osteopontin, we studied its effects on lung fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Functionally, osteopontin induced fibroblast and epithelial cell proliferation and migration. The effect on fibroblast migration and proliferation was dependent mainly on integrins, while in epithelial cells proliferation was mainly dependent on CD44 and migration was dependent on CD44 and integrin signaling. Osteopontin exhibited profibrotic effects on molecules involved in extracellular matrix remodeling. Thus, in fibroblasts, osteopontin increased TIMP-1 and type I collagen and inhibited MMP-1 expression, while in alveolar epithelial cells it induced MMP-7. The effects on TIMP-1 and MMP-1 expression appeared to be mostly dependent on CD44, while the effect on MMP-7 expression was dependent on CD44 and integrin signaling. Interestingly, osteopontin was colocalized with MMP-7 in alveolar epithelial cells of IPF lungs, and application of the weakest link models to microarray data suggested that the genes of both interacted to affect the IPF phenotype. Our results provide a potential mechanism by which osteopontin secreted from epithelial cells exerts its profibrotic effects through direct signaling on fibroblasts and epithelial cells.</p><p>Several studies in experimental tissue fibrosis have suggested a possible profibrotic role of osteopontin.

Additionally, we observed a concomitant increase in TIMP-1, the main inhibitor of MMP-1 (as well as MMP-2 and &#x02212;9), and in <italic>type I collagen</italic> gene expression, suggesting that osteopontin may facilitate a profibrotic environment not only by its effect on epithelial cells but also by inducing a nondegradative microenvironment similar to the one observed in IPF and experimental lung fibrosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020251-b36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020251-b37">37</xref>&#x0005d;. Interestingly, osteopontin did not induce &#x003b1;-smooth muscle actin in lung fibroblasts in vitro, suggesting that although it had a role in facilitating the profibrotic environment in IPF, it had weaker role in the formation of myofibroblast foci. However, further experiments will be needed to determine this point.</p><p>Migration and proliferation of fibroblasts are essential for the expansion of their populations and the formation of the fibroblastic foci that seem to represent the &#x0201c;leading edge&#x0201d; of the progressive fibrotic process &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020251-b05">5</xref>&#x0005d;. The observation that osteopontin induced both migration and proliferation of primary human lung fibroblasts suggests that osteopontin may be involved in this process and is supported by previous observations in murine and human fibroblast cell lines &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020251-b15">15</xref>&#x0005d;. Osteopontin promotes fibroblast collagen gel contraction and rat cardiac fibroblast proliferation, and it has been suggested that it is an important mediator of angiotensin II regulation of fibroblast behavior in the cardiac remodeling process &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020251-b38">38</xref>&#x0005d;. It also induced proliferation of vessel smooth muscle cells, suggesting that it is involved in vascular remodeling during the development of atherosclerosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020251-b39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020251-b40">40</xref>&#x0005d;. These results highlight the sufficiency of a cytokine secreted from alveolar epithelial cell to induce many of the phenotypic changes associated with lung fibrosis.</p><p>The mechanisms by which osteopontin influences epithelial and fibroblast cells are not fully understood. In general it has been proposed that osteopontin affects cells by binding to CD44 isoforms, certain integrins, and EGFR &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020251-b41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020251-b42">42</xref>&#x0005d;. It is unknown whether the expression of these receptors is changed in IPF; CD44 is expressed on lung fibroblasts and epithelial cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020251-b43">43</xref>&#x0005d;, is induced in radiation- and bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020251-b44">44</xref>&#x0005d; and in acute alveolar fibrosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020251-b45">45</xref>&#x0005d;, and is critical for resolution of noninfectious lung inflammation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020251-b46">46</xref>&#x0005d;. The integrin receptors for osteopontin are widely expressed in lung epithelial cells and fibroblasts &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020251-b47">47</xref>&#x0005d;, but a change in their repertoire has not been reported yet with IPF. In this paper we did not seek to fully dissect these mechanisms; however, we explored some of the possible receptors that may be important to osteopontin effect on fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Our results support some of the previous observations regarding the importance of integrin-mediated signaling in fibroblast migration. Interestingly, we observed a differential effect in epithelial and fibroblasts cells. Inhibition of CD44 significantly reduced the effects of osteopontin on cell proliferation in epithelial cells, while &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> inhibition seemed to affect mostly fibroblasts. This integrin is a receptor for a wide variety of extracellular matrix ligands with an exposed RGD sequence, including vitronectin, fibronectin, fibrinogen, thrombospondin, proteolyzed collagen, von Willebrand factor, as well as osteopontin, and appears to play a critical role in cell migration &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020251-b48">48</xref>&#x0005d;. The hyaluronic acid receptor CD44 is also a receptor for osteopontin, and it has been implicated in chemotaxis mediated by this mediator &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020251-b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020251-b49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020251-b50">50</xref>&#x0005d;. In our experiments, the pan-integrin antagonist GRGDS-pentapeptide added to the culture medium abolished the effects in fibroblasts and epithelial cells, suggesting that different integrins may be involved in both cell types, and that for some effects, both integrins and CD44 are required. Detailed studies of the effects of variant osteopontin isoforms as well as cells that express different receptors will be needed to elucidate these mechanisms.</p><p>Our study focused on human tissues and human cell lines because of the unique features of IPF that are not readily mimicked by any animal models. We insisted on using primary human lung fibroblasts in our experiments; therefore, we are confident that these results represent a mechanism that may actually occur in the human lung. Unfortunately, it is nearly impossible to work with primary alveolar epithelial cells, and we had to resort to the epithelial cell line A549. However, we present evidence obtained from human lungs that suggest that the mechanisms that we proposed in vitro do exist in the human IPF lung.</p><p>In summary, in this study we highlight the role of osteopontin in human IPF. Although previous studies have suggested that osteopontin has a potential profibrotic effect in animal models of lung fibrosis, its role in human IPF was unclear. We demonstrated that osteopontin is highly expressed in IPF lungs, and that it is primarily expressed by hyperplastic alveolar epithelial cells. We demonstrated that osteopontin affected fibroblast and epithelial cell proliferation and migration, and that it had fibrosis-relevant effects on MMP and TIMP expressions. Our results suggest a mechanism explaining most of the profibrotic effects of osteopontin by its direct effects on fibroblasts and epithelial cells in the lungs. Furthermore, our results suggest that in IPF the interaction between MMP-7 and osteopontin may be involved in the relentlessly progressive nature of the disease, and highlight osteopontin as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in this incurable disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sd001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><title>Sample Mexico</title><p>(746 KB ZIP).</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.0020251.sd001.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="x-zip-compressed"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sd002"><label>Protocol S2</label><caption><title>Microarrays</title><p>(2.1 MB ZIP).</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.0020251.sd002.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="x-zip-compressed"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><sec id="s5a"><title>Accession Numbers</title><p>The GenBank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>) accession numbers of the genes discussed in this paper are <italic>R18S</italic> (X03205), <italic>MMP-1</italic> (NM_002421), <italic>MMP-7</italic> (XM_017384), and <italic>TIMP-1</italic> (X03124).</p><boxed-text id="box1" position="float"><sec id="sb1"><title>Patient summary</title><sec id="sb1a"><title/><sec id="sb1a1"><title>Background</title><p>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic progressive disease of the lung that leads to increasing amounts of scar tissue with subsequent destruction of the lung. There is no specific cure at present. Patients may be treated with corticosteroids or drugs to suppress their immune system, although these drugs are usually not effective. Some patients receive lung transplants.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>Previous work has suggested that a protein called osteopontin is increased in mice that have lung fibrosis and that mice that do not have the gene for osteopontin are protected from lung fibrosis. The researchers wanted to investigate if osteopontin was also involved in the human disease.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>They looked at samples taken from the lungs of people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and other diseases and measured many genes that are expressed there. They found that osteopontin was increased in the lungs of people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. They then looked at cultures of lung cells and found that osteopontin caused an increase in the number and movement of cells that are involved in lung fibrosis. Its presence also affected other proteins that seem to be involved in fibrosis.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>Osteopontin may have a key role in the pathway that causes fibrosis to occur in the lungs of people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Further work will need to be done to confirm these results, but in the future drugs directed against osteopontin or one of the related proteins might be a possible treatment for the disease. Currently there are no such drugs. Additionally osteopontin may be useful in the diagnosis and early detection of the disease, but further studies are required.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Where Can I Get More Information Online?</title><p>Medline Plus has links to many pages with information on the disease:</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/pulmonaryfibrosis.html">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/pulmonaryfibrosis.html</ext-link></p><p>The Coalition for Pulmonary Fibrosis is a nonprofit organization that has information for patients as well as physicians:</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.coalitionforpf.org/">http://www.coalitionforpf.org/</ext-link></p><p>The Dorothy P. and Richard P.
