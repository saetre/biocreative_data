A growing body of evidence shows the relevance of these shaping processes in the control of mitochondrial activity and cell metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003613-Bach1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003613-Yu1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Several genes encoding mitochondrial fusion and fission proteins have been recently identified. Mammalian proteins involved in mitochondrial fission are Fission 1 homologue protein (Fis1) and Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1). Similarly, Mitofusin 1 (Mfn1), Mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) and Optic Atrophy gene 1 (OPA1) are proteins that participate in mitochondrial fusion in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003613-Chen3">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. However, there are no evidences to date that demonstrate the ability of an upstream or transcriptional regulator to shift the balance between mitochondrial fusion and fission events by selective regulation of these proteins.</p><p>Several reports provide evidence that Mfn2 protein elicits pleiotropic effects which may be involved in pathology. For instance, Mfn2 is mutated in Charcot Marie Tooth type 2A neuropathy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003613-Zuchner1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> and, interestingly, some of these mutants cause selective defects in mitochondrial fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003613-Detmer1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, reduction in mitochondrial axonal transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003613-Baloh1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> or defects in mitochondrial coupling leading to inefficient mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003613-Loiseau1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Defective Mfn2 may also contribute to impaired mitochondrial function in the context of obesity and type 2 diabetes. This notion is supported by the observation that muscle Mfn2 expression is reduced in these patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003613-Bach1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003613-Bach2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, we have previously reported that Mfn2 can modulate mitochondrial activity through changes in the electron transport chain (ETC) and this modulation is independent of its role in mitochondrial morphology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003613-Bach1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003613-Pich1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x003b3; coactivator-1 (PGC-1) &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; are important positive regulators of mitochondrial activity and biogenesis in mouse skeletal muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003613-Arany1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003613-Puigserver1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Despite these similarities, PGC-1&#x003b1; and PGC-1&#x003b2; display low overall sequence identity, with the highest percentatges found in two particular domains (activation and RNA recognition domains, with identities of 40&#x00025; and 50&#x00025; respectively) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003613-Lin1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, key mitochondrial processes, such as organelle biogenesis and uncoupling, are differentially regulated by these homologues. For instance, in C2C12 muscle cells, PGC-1&#x003b1; but not PGC-1&#x003b2;, increases mitochondrial uncoupling, whereas PGC-1&#x003b2; causes a larger increase in mitochondrial volume than PGC-1&#x003b1; under the same conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003613-StPierre1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, while PGC-1&#x003b2; expression in distinct tissues is unaffected by physiological processes characterized by increased energy expenditure, such as cold exposure (in brown adipose tissue), fasting (in liver) or exercise (in muscle), PGC-1&#x003b1; is highly regulated at the transcriptional level under similar physiological challenges <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003613-Lin1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003613-Puigserver1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. These data suggest that PGC-1&#x003b2; likely controls basal mitochondrial biogenesis, whereas PGC-1&#x003b1; controls stimulated or regulated mitochondrial activity. In keeping with this view, PGC-1&#x003b2; expression is higher than PGC-1&#x003b1; expression in primary muscle cells under basal conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003613-Staiger1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The functional independency in mitochondrial physiology of these homologues is further illustrated by the phenotypes of PGC-1&#x003b1; and PGC-1&#x003b2; knockout (KO) mice. In both animal models, a general defect in the electron transport chain (ETC) system has been described, thereby demonstrating that PGC-1&#x003b1; does not fully compensate the effects of PGC-1&#x003b2; on mitochondria or vice versa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003613-Lelliott1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003613-Vianna1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, several mitochondrial phenotypes described in the particular case of PGC-1&#x003b2;-ablated mice cannot be completely explained by impairment of the ETC system. For instance, muscle and liver from PGC-1&#x003b2; KO mouse show a reduction of mitochondrial volume without changes in mitochondria number <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003613-Lelliott1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003613-Vianna1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. This decreased mitochondrial volume together with impaired ETC gene expression may explain the mitochondrial respiration defect found only in muscle strips and not in isolated mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003613-Lelliott1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. In keeping with these data, this reduction in mitochondrial size is absent in PGC-1&#x003b1; KO mouse under basal conditions, probably due to normal PGC-1&#x003b2; expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003613-Lin2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003613-Arany2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Of note, despite all these differences, both genes show a diminished expression in the context of type 2 diabetes, suggesting an impairment of mitochondrial effects selectively regulated by each homologue in this disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003613-Mootha1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003613-Patti1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We previously reported that PGC-1&#x003b1; was able to induce Mfn2 transcription and that mitochondrial activity regulated by PGC-1&#x003b1; partly depends on correct Mfn2 expression. However, effects on mitochondrial fusion were not determined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003613-Soriano1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. In the light of these results and the PGC-1&#x003b2; control of basal mitochondrial biogenesis, we aimed to determine whether PGC-1&#x003b2; was able to control Mfn2 transcription and, therefore, if the mitochondrial dynamics balance could be modulated by transcriptional regulation. Here, we address these questions by determining the role of PGC-1&#x003b2; in the control of mitochondrial fusion using a multi-approach strategy that combines Mfn2 KO cells, PGC-1&#x003b2;-overexpressing muscle cells and PGC-1&#x003b2;-ablated mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>PGC-1&#x003b2; induces Mfn2 transcription through ERR&#x003b1; coactivation</title><p>Our initial aim was to determine whether PGC-1&#x003b2; regulates the expression of Mfn2 in C2C12 muscle cells.

To this end, C2C12 myotubes were transduced either with a mouse PGC-1&#x003b2; adenovirus or with a control LacZ adenovirus. Mfn2 mRNA levels doubled in PGC-1&#x003b2;-expressing muscle cells compared to control transduced myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003613-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). To demonstrate that PGC-1&#x003b2; directly increases Mfn2 transcription, we transfected 10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts or HeLa cells with a construct containing a 2-kb fragment (&#x02212;1982/&#x0002b;45) of the Mfn2 promoter fused to a luciferase reporter gene, together with an irrelevant vector (Basal) or mouse PGC-1&#x003b2; expression vector (PGC-1&#x003b2;). PGC-1&#x003b2; markedly enhanced Mfn2 promoter activity (10.3&#x000b1;0.9- and 4.2&#x000b1;0.6-fold values over basal Mfn2 promoter activity in 10T1/2 and HeLa respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003613-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). In a previous study, using electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we showed that ERR&#x003b1; binds to Mfn2 promoter between nucleotides &#x02212;459/&#x02212;396 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003613-Soriano1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.

On the basis of these observations, we determined whether PGC-1&#x003b2; coactivated ERR&#x003b1; through box 2 in a similar way as PGC-1&#x003b1;. We transfected 10T1/2 cells with a construct containing a &#x02212;459/&#x02212;352 Mfn2 promoter fragment fused to a luciferase reporter gene or with a mutated version of the same fragment that disrupted box 2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003613-Soriano1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.

More specifically, we show that PGC-1&#x003b2; is a regulator of mitochondrial fusion through its effects of selectively promoting Mfn2 expression upon coactivation of ERR&#x003b1;. This new role of PGC-1&#x003b2; in mitochondrial physiology has been demonstrated using both in vitro (muscle cells) and in vivo (PGC-1&#x003b2;-ablated mice) approaches. Firstly, we have shown that PGC-1&#x003b2; overexpression in muscle cells regulates mitochondrial dynamics through a mechanism that involves the preferential induction of Mfn2 expression, among other mitochondrial dynamics effectors such as Mfn1, OPA1, Drp1 and Fis1. Furthermore, PGC-1&#x003b2; gain-of-function results in an elongation of mitochondrial tubules, which is linked to an increased mitochondrial fusion. Importantly, the effects of PGC-1&#x003b2; promoting mitochondrial elongation are not observed in Mfn2-ablated cells, thereby demonstrating that Mfn2 activity is essential for PGC-1&#x003b2;-mediated changes in mitochondrial dynamics.</p><p>The relevance of these observations is confirmed by our in vivo data showing that PGC-1&#x003b2; KO mice have a specific reduction of Mfn2 expression in skeletal muscle whereas Mfn1, OPA1, Drp1 and Fis1 levels are maintained. In fact, this preferential regulation of Mfn2 protein levels could explain the reduction in mitochondrial volume, without changes in mitochondria number, observed in liver and muscle from PGC-1&#x003b2; loss-of-function mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003613-Lelliott1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003613-Vianna1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.

Furthermore, we propose that PGC-1&#x003b2; controls basal mitochondrial fusion in skeletal muscle, whereas PGC-1&#x003b1; would probably control mitochondrial fusion in high energy expenditure situations, such as cold-exposure or exercise, conditions which largely induce Mfn2 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003613-Soriano1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. This is supported by the fact that PGC-1&#x003b2; expression is higher than PGC-1&#x003b1; expression in skeletal muscle under basal conditions and by the lack of a decrease in mitochondrial size in PGC-1&#x003b1; KO mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003613-Staiger1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003613-Arany2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. In keeping with this proposal, our data permit to explain the observation of a defective mitochondrial respiration found in muscle strips but not in isolated mitochondria from PGC-1&#x003b2; KO mice under basal conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003613-Lelliott1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. In isolated mitochondria, the integrity of the mitochondrial network and dynamics inside the cell is not maintained and therefore defects in mitochondrial activity secondary to abnormal mitochondrial dynamics are not detectable.</p><p>Here, we have also examined the mechanism by which PGC-1&#x003b2; induces Mfn2 transcription, and have identified ERR&#x003b1; as the key transcription factor coactivated by PGC-1&#x003b2; on the Mfn2 promoter. The effect of ERR&#x003b1; and PGC-1&#x003b2; occurred at the level of box 2 (located in the &#x02212;459/&#x02212;352 promoter region), although PGC-1&#x003b2; also displayed additional stimulatory actions on the Mfn2 promoter. The same box 2 region is the major component required for PGC-1&#x003b1; activation of the Mfn2 promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003613-Soriano1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. On the basis of these data, we conclude that PGC-1&#x003b1; and PGC-1&#x003b2; display a common mechanism of activation of the Mfn2 promoter, through nuclear receptor ERR&#x003b1;. However, despite using the same response elements, decreased expression of Mfn2 induced by genetic ablation of PGC-1&#x003b2; in mice cannot be counteracted by PGC-1&#x003b1; action, as shown in liver, heart and skeletal muscle of PGC-1&#x003b2; KO mice, in which Mfn2 expression is decreased, probably due to the low expression of PGC-1&#x003b1; under basal conditions.</p><p>In summary, we provide evidence that mitochondrial dynamics balance is selectively controlled by a transcriptional regulator, unravelling an upstream mediator of mitochondrial fusion. Furthermore, we also provide evidence of a novel role of PGC-1&#x003b2; in mitochondrial physiology. Given the crosstalk between mitochondrial activity and dynamics, together with reduced Mfn2 and PGC-1&#x003b2; expression in type 2 diabetes, we conclude that the pathway reported here is not only relevant for the thorough explanation of mitochondrial dynamics regulation and the overall mitochondrial effects of PGC-1&#x003b2;, but also may provide the basis for the correct understanding of the alterations of mitochondrial metabolism associated with type 2 diabetes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animal Care and tissue collection</title><p>All animal protocols were approved as previously published <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003613-Lelliott1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.
