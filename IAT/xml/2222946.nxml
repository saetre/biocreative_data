We have previously demonstrated that vaccinia virus strains are capable of systemic delivery to tumors in mouse models, but infection of normal tissues remains an issue. We hypothesized that interferon-beta (IFN-&#x003b2;) expression from an oncolytic vaccinia strain incapable of responding to this cytokine would have dual benefits as a cancer therapeutic: increased anticancer effects and enhanced virus inactivation in normal tissues. We report the construction and preclinical testing of this virus.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>In vitro screening of viral strains by cytotoxicity and replication assay was coupled to cellular characterization by phospho-flow cytometry in order to select a novel oncolytic vaccinia virus. This virus was then examined in vivo in mouse models by non-invasive imaging techniques. A vaccinia <italic>B18R</italic> deletion mutant was selected as the backbone for IFN-&#x003b2; expression, because the <italic>B18R</italic> gene product neutralizes secreted type-I IFNs. The oncolytic <italic>B18R</italic> deletion mutant demonstrated IFN-dependent cancer selectivity and efficacy in vitro, and tumor targeting and efficacy in mouse models in vivo. Both tumor cells and tumor-associated vascular endothelial cells were targeted. Complete tumor responses in preclinical models were accompanied by immune-mediated protection against tumor rechallenge. Cancer selectivity was also demonstrated in primary human tumor explant tissues and adjacent normal tissues. The <italic>IFN-&#x003b2;</italic> gene was then cloned into the <italic>thymidine kinase</italic> (<italic>TK</italic>) region of this virus to create <italic>JX-795</italic> (<italic>TK<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/B18R<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/IFN-&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic>). <italic>JX-795</italic> had superior tumor selectivity and systemic intravenous efficacy when compared with the TK<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/B18R<sup>&#x02212;</sup> control or wild-type vaccinia in preclinical models.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>By combining IFN-dependent cancer selectivity with IFN-&#x003b2; expression to optimize both anticancer effects and normal tissue antiviral effects, we were able to achieve, to our knowledge for the first time, tumor-specific replication, IFN-&#x003b2; gene expression, and efficacy following systemic delivery in preclinical models.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Stephen Thorne and colleagues describe, in a mouse model, an oncolytic vaccinia virus with interferon-dependent cancer selectivity that allows tumor-specific replication; it also expresses the IFN-&#x003b2; gene and hence has efficacy against tumors.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="editor"><title>Editors' Summary</title><sec id="sb1a"><title>Background.</title><p>Normally, throughout life, cell division (which produces new cells) and cell death are carefully balanced to keep the body in good working order. But sometimes cells acquire changes (mutations) in their genetic material that allow them to divide uncontrollably to form cancers&#x02014;disorganized masses of cells. Cancers can develop anywhere in the body and, as they develop, their cells acquire other genetic changes that enable them to move and start new tumors (metastases) elsewhere. Chemotherapy drugs kill rapidly dividing cancer cells but, because some normal cells are also sensitive to these drugs, it is hard to destroy the cancer without causing serious side effects. Consequently, researchers are trying to develop &#x0201c;targeted&#x0201d; therapies that attack the changes in cancer cells that allow them to divide uncontrollably but leave normal cells unscathed. One promising class of targeted therapies is oncolytic viruses. These viruses make numerous copies of themselves inside cancer cells (but not inside normal cells). Eventually the cancer cell bursts open (lyses), releases more of the therapeutic agent, and dies.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>Existing oncolytic viruses have two major disadvantages: they have to be injected directly into tumors, and therefore they can't destroy distant metastases; and they don't kill cancer cells particularly efficiently. In this study, the researchers have tried to adapt vaccinia virus (a virus that infects humans and which has recently been shown to kill tumor cells when injected into the bloodstream) in two ways: to both infect cancer cells selectively and then to kill them effectively.</p><p>They hypothesized that putting a gene that causes expression of a protein called interferon-beta (IFN-&#x003b2;) in a particular virus strain that is itself incapable of responding to IFN-&#x003b2; might achieve these aims. Human cells infected with viruses usually release IFNs, which induce an antiviral state in nearby cells. But vaccinia virus makes anti-IFN proteins that prevent IFN release. If the viral genes that encode these proteins are removed from the virus, the virus cannot spread through normal cells. However, many cancer cells have defective IFN signaling pathways so the virus can spread through them. IFN-&#x003b2; expression by the virus, however, should improve its innate anticancer effects because IFN-&#x003b2; stops cancer cells dividing, induces an antitumor immune response, and stops tumors developing good blood supplies.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers selected a vaccinia virus strain called WR-delB18R in which the B18R gene, which encodes an anti-IFN protein, had been removed from the virus. (WR is a wild-type virus.) In laboratory experiments, IFN treatment blocked the spread of WR-delB18R in normal human cells but not in human tumor cells. After being injected into the veins of tumor-bearing mice, WR-delB18R was rapidly cleared from normal tissues but persisted in the tumors. A single injection of WR-delB18R directly into the tumor killed most of the tumor cells. A similar dose injected into a vein was less effective but nevertheless increased the survival time of some of the mice by directly killing the tumor cells, by targeting the blood supply of the tumors, and by inducing antitumor immunity. Finally, when the researchers inserted the <italic>IFN-&#x003b2;</italic> gene into this WR-delB18R, the new virus&#x02014;JX-795&#x02014;was much better at killing tumors after intravenous injection than either WR or WR-delB18R.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These findings indicate that the vaccinia virus can be adapted so that it replicates only in tumor cells and kills these cells effectively after intravenous injection. In particular, they show that the strategy adopted by the researchers both optimizes the anticancer effects of the virus and minimizes viral replication in normal tissues. JX-795 is a promising oncolytic virus, therefore, particularly since vaccinia virus has been safely used for many years to vaccinate people against smallpox. Nevertheless, it will be some years before JX-795 can be used clinically. Vaccinia virus constructs like this need to be tested extensively in the laboratory and in animals before any attempt is made to test them in people and, even if they passes all these preclinical tests with flying colors, only clinical trials will reveal whether they can treat human cancer. Several related strains of vaccinia virus are currently undergoing clinical testing.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/:10.1371/journal.pmed.0040353">http://dx.doi.org/:10.1371/journal.pmed.0040353</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancer.gov/">The US National Cancer Institute</ext-link> provides information on all aspects of cancer (in English and Spanish)</p></list-item><list-item><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancerquest.org/">CancerQuest</ext-link>, from Emory University, provides information on all aspects of cancer (in several languages)</p></list-item><list-item><p>The UK charity <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancerbackup.org.uk/Aboutcancer">Cancerbackup</ext-link> also provides information on all aspects of cancer</p></list-item><list-item><p>Wikipedia has a page on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncolytic_virus">oncolytic viruses</ext-link> (note that Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit; available in several languages)</p></list-item><list-item><p>A short interview about oncolytic viruses with researcher Dr. John Bell is available on the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.insidermedicine.ca/Archives/In_the_Spotlight_-_Dr_John_Bell_1674.aspx">Insidermedicine Web site</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.oncolyticvirus.org/">The Oncolytic virus Web page</ext-link> provides lists of oncolytic viruses classified by type</p></list-item></list></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Kirn DH, Wang Y, Le Boeuf F, Bell J, Thorne SH (2007) Targeting of interferon-beta to produce a specific, multi-mechanistic oncolytic vaccinia virus. 4(12): e353. doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pmed.0040353">10.1371/journal.pmed.0040353</ext-link></meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Oncolytic viruses have promise as cancer therapeutics due to their targeted nature and ability to destroy cancer cells through novel mechanisms-of-action (oncolysis and/or necrosis) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040353-b001">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040353-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;.

It is therefore capable of binding and inactivating type-I IFN that has been secreted from infected and/or adjacent cells, and thereby prevents both the induction of an antiviral state in surrounding cells, and induction of an antiviral immune response. It was found that addition of type-I IFN (human IFN-&#x003b1;) to the primary cells prior to infection induced an antiviral state in these cells and limited viral replication in a one-step replication study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040353-g001">Figure 1</xref>A).

The ability of these cell lines to produce, or respond to, IFN-&#x003b2; was therefore examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040353-g002">Figure 2</xref>). IFN-&#x003b2; production in the presence of a viral pathogen may be in response to stimuli from within an infected cell (typically through PKR induction by dsRNA for DNA viruses), or external stimuli (typically detected through binding to Toll Like Receptors (TLR)). Primary cells (NHBEs) were found to up-regulate IFN-&#x003b2; secretion in response to either MV infection (which has previously been demonstrated to produce IFN-&#x003b2; upon infection of human fibroblasts, probably through PKR activation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040353-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;) or following exposure to LPS (which, along with viral glycolipids, binds to and activates TLR4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040353-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).

This lack of IFN-&#x003b2; production is not surprising because vaccinia expresses several genes that interfere with PKR activation and signaling (e.g., <italic>E3L</italic> and <italic>K3L</italic>). It was further found that A2780 cells could also increase IFN-&#x003b2; production in response to either MV infection or LPS exposure (but not to <italic>WR-delB18R</italic> infection); that HCT 116 could respond to LPS exposure, but could not respond to MV infection; and that C33A was unable to increase IFN-&#x003b2; production under any of the conditions examined.</p><fig id="pmed-0040353-g002" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Dysfunction in Type-I IFN Production or Signaling in Normal and Tumor Cell Lines</title><p>(A) Production of IFN-&#x003b2;.

NHBEs were found to be able to respond to IFN-&#x003b2; exposure, as were HCT 116 cells; however, A2780 cells, although able to produce IFN-&#x003b2;, were unable to respond to it. It therefore appears that (1) all vaccinia-infected cells are blocked in their ability to produce type-I IFN directly (even though both NHBEs and A2780 can produce type-I IFN in response to infection with the related MV); (2) C33A is unable to produce IFN in response to TLR activation; and (3) A2780 cells are unable to respond directly to type-I IFN.

To our knowledge, this is the first time that such a rationally designed combination of attenuating viral gene deletion and transgene expression has been incorporated into a systemically deliverable vector, and the first successful report of systemic <italic>IFN-&#x003b2;</italic> gene delivery to a tumor.</p><p>Oncolytic viruses hold promise for the treatment of cancer, but improvements are needed &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040353-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. In particular, systemic efficacy against metastatic tumors will be required in order to have a major impact on cancer patient survival. Novel approaches are therefore needed to improve intravenous safety and efficacy &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040353-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. We hypothesized that IFN-&#x003b2; expression from an oncolytic vaccinia virus could achieve both objectives. First, intravenous delivery of vaccinia viruses appears to be feasible in immunocompetent animal tumor models &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040353-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040353-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. Second, IFN-&#x003b2; antiviral effects in normal tissues should enhance safety. Finally, IFN-&#x003b2; expression in tumors should increase efficacy over that mediated by oncolysis alone.</p><p>Because type-I IFNs also possess antiviral properties, vaccinia has evolved to express both intracellular (K3L, E3L, and H1L) and extracellular (B18R) gene products that interfere with type-I IFN activity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040353-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. In particular, the viral <italic>B18R</italic> gene product is secreted from infected cells, binding and neutralizing extracellular IFN-&#x003b1; and -&#x003b2; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040353-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore, to prevent neutralization of IFN-&#x003b2; after secretion from infected cancer cells, we deleted the <italic>B18R</italic> gene from the vaccinia virus backbone used to express the <italic>IFN-&#x003b2;</italic> gene.</p><p>It appears that the <italic>B18R</italic>-deleted vaccinia virus (<italic>WR-delB18R</italic>) itself is capable of tumor-specific replication. Whereas all primary cells tested were capable of inducing an antiviral state when pretreated with type-I IFN, most (but not all) cancer cell lines were incapable of responding to this cytokine. However, when IFN-&#x003b1; was added 5 h postinfection, to better mimic the likely order of exposure in vivo, wild-type vaccinia (WR), but not <italic>WR-delB18R</italic>, was capable of preventing a subsequent block in viral replication in susceptible cells. As a result, <italic>WR-delB18R</italic> was attenuated in normal cells, but not in most tumor cells, when type-I IFN was added postinfection; this sequence would be expected to occur in vivo. Further examination of these effects revealed that in primary cells, <italic>WR-delB18R</italic>, like wild-type WR, was effective at preventing release of IFN-&#x003b2; from infected cells, but that uninfected neighboring cells could be induced to produce IFN-&#x003b2; (presumably through TLR binding), and so induce an antiviral IFN-&#x003b2; response. This antiviral response could be blocked by expression of <italic>B18R</italic> or by addition of anti&#x02013;IFN-&#x003b2; neutralizing antibody (unpublished data), and was irrelevant in many cancer cells that were deficient in their ability to produce (C33A) or respond to (A2780 and C33A) IFN-&#x003b2;.</p><p>The oncolytic potential of <italic>WR-delB18R</italic> was confirmed in immunocompetent mice, with the virus rapidly removed from all tissues other than the tumor, and capable of producing 100&#x00025; complete responses after local delivery. Antitumor effects were also seen following intravenous delivery, demonstrating the systemic potential of this virus. However, fewer complete responses were witnessed, indicating that an increase in tumor cell&#x02013;killing potential for this virus (such as by transgene expression) may be needed for optimal systemic efficacy. Intravenous delivery also exposes more nonmalignant tissues and organs to the potential of viral infection, and so tumor-selectivity may become more critical for this delivery route. Although no toxicity was observed with <italic>WR-delB18R</italic> at therapeutic doses, deletion of intracellular IFN-resistance genes may lead to similar effects as <italic>B18R</italic> deletion, and the combination of both deletions may act together to further attenuate this virus in normal tissues, if necessary.</p><p>This new oncolytic vector was also shown to be capable of targeting and infecting human colorectal tumor explants ex vivo, and of destroying tumor cells by multiple mechanisms of action, one of which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been previously described. First, cancer-selective replication results in direct oncolysis. Second, as rechallenge of mice with tumors following complete responses to treatment resulted in tumor rejection, it appeared that the virus was capable of inducing an antitumor immune state within the animal. Induction of tumor-specific CTLs by oncolytic virus treatment was reported previously with HSV &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040353-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;, but has not been shown for vaccinia virus. Although the exact mechanisms have not been proven, they are likely to include recruitment of antigen-presenting cells, induction of immunostimulatory cytokines, and release of tumor-associated and viral antigens following cell lysis, leading to in situ vaccination against the tumor. Finally, we report the infection of tumor-associated endothelial cells by the oncolytic virus, resulting in reduced tumor vascularity. Tumor-associated endothelial cell lysis can lead to tissue factor release and intratumoral vascular thrombosis. Endothelial cells are attractive targets for oncolytic viruses, given their accessibility to infection by intravascular virus &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040353-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. Tumor-associated endothelial cells may be specifically susceptible to this vaccinia mutant for several reasons &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040353-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. First, these cells tend to be hyperproliferative, and therefore may be generally more susceptible to vaccinia infection. Second, epithelial growth factor (EGF) receptors are frequently expressed on these cells. Vaccinia replication is enhanced by EGF receptor binding and activation by vaccinia growth factor (VGF). However, further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms involved and to take full advantage of this novel antitumoral approach. It will also be interesting to determine whether tumor&#x02013;endothelial cell targeting occurs with other vaccinia virus mutants and/or other oncolytic viruses.</p><p>Recombinant IFN-&#x003b2; has been administered systemically for the treatment of several cancer types. The protein has been delivered by intramuscular, intravenous, or intratumoral routes, with common toxicities including myelosuppression, transaminitis, and neurotoxicity (include seizures), indicating that localized, tumor-specific delivery of the cytokine would be desirable. Antitumoral efficacy was reported, however, both in patients with brain tumors (including glioblastoma multiforme) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040353-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040353-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d; and in a patient with colorectal carcinoma &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040353-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. IFN-&#x003b2; therefore represents a promising cytokine for use in cancer therapy. However, because the effects of the recombinant protein are locally mediated and are short-lived in vivo, and its systemic administration leads to toxicity, expression of IFN-&#x003b2; from a gene therapy or oncolytic virus within the tumor represents a promising means to apply this cytokine &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040353-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. However, previous approaches have suffered from a lack of targeted gene delivery &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040353-b038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040353-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The expression of IFN-&#x003b2; from <italic>WR-delB18R</italic> therefore represents a promising strategy. Transgene &#x0201c;arming&#x0201d; of oncolytic viruses has frequently been utilized to enhance antitumoral efficacy and for noninvasive imaging purposes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040353-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. However, in addition to increasing the antitumor effects of the virus, IFN-&#x003b2; expression serves to further reduce viral replication in normal tissues. To date, vaccinia virus&#x02013;expressed transgenes have not been utilized to inhibit viral replication and enhance clearance from normal tissues; because IFN-&#x003b2; has potent antiviral properties, we predicted viral inhibition would occur in this case. A similar strategy with IFN-&#x003b1; was recently described for an oncolytic adenovirus vector &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040353-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. However, this vector did not demonstrate systemic delivery or efficacy potential, and efficacy was limited even with multiple (more than ten) intratumoral injections. Vector replication and selectivity were not studied in normal nonimmortalized cells, and no primary human tissue was tested as reported in this study. Cancer selectivity was not studied in vivo, either, because tumor-free animals were studied for toxic effects to the liver only. In addition, because vaccinia genes expressed from early/late promoters will be expressed at low levels even during nonproductive infection of resistant cells, a small amount of IFN-&#x003b2; will be expressed in any normal tissues exposed to the virus, allowing the early production of an antiviral state. Of note, these levels are nontoxic, and high levels of gene expression are linked tightly to viral replication within tumor tissue. In this way, transgene expression will be linked to permissive infection, and thereby restricted to tumor cells.</p><p>The <italic>IFN-&#x003b2;</italic> gene was inserted into the <italic>TK</italic> gene, as this deletion has also been demonstrated to be tumor targeting &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040353-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. The resulting virus, <italic>JX-795</italic>, has deletions in both <italic>B18R</italic> and <italic>TK</italic> genes, and expressed IFN-&#x003b2;, as well as luciferase, for preclinical imaging purposes. It was shown to be highly specific for cancer cells in vitro, without the requirement for addition of exogenous cytokine. <italic>JX-795</italic> was also found to produce high levels of IFN-&#x003b2; in vivo, which remained localized within the tumor. Viral gene expression was also highly tumor-restricted in vivo, and so this report represents the first description of a system for the systemic delivery of type-I IFN to tumors. Furthermore, this virus was capable of effectively destroying established tumors in mouse models. We therefore demonstrated that <italic>JX-795</italic> is highly tumor selective and capable of potent antitumor effects in vivo. The highly tumor-restricted <italic>luciferase</italic> gene expression seen with <italic>JX-795</italic> indicates that this vector could also be used as a gene-delivery vehicle for any further therapeutic transgenes whose expression might lead to toxicity if expressed in any nonmalignant tissues.</p><p>In addition to <italic>B18R</italic>, vaccinia virus expresses several other type-I IFN-resistance proteins. These include several intracellular proteins that prevent production of IFN from infected cells through inhibition of PKR (e.g., E3L and K3L), or blockade of nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B) activation and interferon-regulatory factor (IRF) signaling (A52R, A46R, and N1L). In addition, additional proteins are expressed that may prevent infected cells from responding to IFN by blocking STAT1 signaling (H1L) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040353-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. Future research may demonstrate that the normal tissue clearance of <italic>JX-795</italic> is further enhanced by deletion of one or more of these genes or regions within these genes. However, although clearance from normal tissues is advantageous, overly rapid clearance from tumor tissue may reduce efficacy. A balance will need to be achieved for future viruses derived from <italic>JX-795</italic>.</p><p>The rational design of oncolytic viruses combining tumor-targeting viral deletions with specific transgenes capable of complimenting, or even synergizing with, the phenotype of the attenuated virus represents a promising strategy for the design of virotherapeutics. In addition, the potential to destroy the tumor by a multitude of different mechanisms, as seen with oncolytic vaccinia strains, and the targeting of not only the malignant cells, but also other cells (e.g., endothelial and immune cells) within the tumor environment, may be the most effective approach to applying biological therapies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Geoff Smith
