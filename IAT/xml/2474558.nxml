Hetero-oligomerization of the human DOP opioid and chemokine CXCR2 receptors could be detected following their co-expression by each of co-immunoprecipitation, three different resonance energy transfer techniques and the construction of pairs of individually inactive but potentially complementary receptor G-protein &#x003b1; subunit fusion proteins. Although DOP receptor agonists and a CXCR2 antagonist had no inherent affinity for the alternative receptor when either receptor was expressed individually, use of cells that expressed a DOP opioid receptor construct constitutively, and in which expression of a CXCR2 receptor construct could be regulated, demonstrated that the CXCR2 antagonist enhanced the function of DOP receptor agonists only in the presence of CXCR2. This effect was observed for both enkephalin- and alkaloid-based opioid agonists, and the effective concentrations of the CXCR2 antagonist reflected CXCR2 receptor occupancy. Entirely equivalent results were obtained in cells in which the native DOP opioid receptor was expressed constitutively and in which expression of the isolated CXCR2 receptor could be induced. These results indicate that a CXCR2 receptor antagonist can enhance the function of agonists at a receptor for which it has no inherent direct affinity by acting as an allosteric regulator of a receptor that is a heterodimer partner for the CXCR2 receptor. These results have novel and important implications for the development and use of small-molecule therapeutics.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="kwd"><kwd>allosterism</kwd><kwd>chemokine</kwd><kwd>G-protein-coupled receptor</kwd><kwd>heterodimer</kwd><kwd>opioid</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="abbr"><kwd>APC, allophycocyanin</kwd><kwd>BRET, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer</kwd><kwd>BRET<sub>50</sub>, half-maximal BRET signal</kwd><kwd>BRET<sub>MAX</sub>, maximum BRET signal</kwd><kwd>DADLE, <sc>D</sc>-Ala<sup>2</sup>, Leu<sup>5</sup>-enkephalin</kwd><kwd>DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium</kwd><kwd>DPDPE, [<sc>D</sc>-Pen<sup>2,5</sup>]-enkephalin</kwd><kwd>eCFP, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein</kwd><kwd>eYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein</kwd><kwd>FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer</kwd><kwd>GFP, green fluorescent protein</kwd><kwd>GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor</kwd><kwd>HEK, human embryonic kidney</kwd><kwd>IL-8, interleukin-8</kwd><kwd>MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1</kwd><kwd>RIPA, radio-immunoprecipitation assay</kwd><kwd>tr-FRET, time-resolved FRET</kwd><kwd>VSV-G, vesicular-stomatitis-virus glycoprotein</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="3"/><ref-count count="63"/><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>It has become increasingly clear in recent times that opioid agonists have a broad range of effects on cells of the immune system, including modulation of the inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Opioid receptor levels are regulated by peripheral inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], and it is thought that highly peripherally selective opioid agonists may provide a therapeutic approach for the treatment of inflammation and inflammatory pain (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] for review). Opioids function via three molecularly defined receptor subtypes, the DOP, KOP and MOP receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. These are all members of the rhodopsin-like family of GPCRs (G-protein-coupled receptors). As well as their characterized expression patterns in the central and peripheral nervous systems they are expressed on a wide range of white blood cells, including macrophages and neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Various opioid agonists are known to produce chemotactic responses in white cells, and to modulate chemotaxis induced by a range of chemokines. Chemokines and their receptors are also integrators of pain and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and there is a clear capacity for heterologous modification and desensitization between co-expressed chemokine and opioid receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Receptors for chemokine ligands also belong to the rhodopsin-like GPCR family, and one further potential mechanism that may contribute to the effects outlined above is direct interactions between chemokine and opioid receptors. At least for the CCR5 chemokine receptor, a capacity to co-immunoprecipitate each of the DOP, KOP and MOP receptors from both human and monkey lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] provided preliminary evidence of such interactions, and direct protein&#x02013;protein contacts between CCR5 and the MOP receptor have been confirmed independently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>The closely related CXCR1 and CXCR2 receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] share a common agonist ligand in IL-8 (interleukin 8; also called CXCL8). They are widely co-expressed on immune cells, including neutrophils, CD8(+) T-cells and mast cells, and allosteric inhibitors of these receptors have been suggested to offer a general means to inhibit polymorphonuclear cell recruitment <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Opioid agonists inhibit IL-8-induced chemotaxis of human neutrophils, and opioid agonists are able to cause phosphorylation of CXCR1 and CXCR2 receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Interestingly, CXCR2, but not CXCR1, is expressed by a variety of neurones and astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and may be involved in the directed migration of specific subsets of neurones.</p><p>Although it was believed for many years that GPCRs functioned exclusively as monomers, a growing consensus has challenged this view. Indeed, it is now widely believed that the minimal <italic>in situ</italic> functional unit for a GPCR is a dimer and that further, higher-order, oligomeric structures may exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Much evidence suggests that for many GPCRs dimerization/oligomerization occurs during synthesis and maturation within the endoplasmic reticulum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] prior to plasma membrane delivery. This model would explain why many GPCRs appear to be constitutively formed dimers/oligomers. It is also increasingly accepted that at least certain GPCRs have the capacity to form heterodimers/oligomers (i.e. dimers formed between two different GPCR gene products) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Such heterodimers/oligomers may have distinct functional and pharmacological properties and have been suggested to offer novel sets of targets for therapeutic small-molecule drug design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Although the CXCR1 receptor was originally reported not to homodimerize or to heterodimerize with the CXCR2 receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], Wilson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] recently employed a wide range of biochemical and biophysical approaches to demonstrate the capacity of both CXCR1 and CXCR2 to homodimerize and to show that these two GPCRs were able to form heterodimers as effectively as homodimers.</p><p>It has recently been demonstrated that selective ligands at pairs of GPCRs that heterodimerize have the potential to modulate ligand effects at the partner GPCR via allosterism (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] for review). Studies on heterodimerization between the CCR2b and CCR5 chemokine receptors have demonstrated the ability of CCR5-specific ligands, that are unable to compete for the binding of the CCR2 selective ligand MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1) on cells expressing CCR2b alone, to prevent efficiently MCP-1 binding when the two receptors are co-expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Similarly, co-expression of the orphan GPCR, GPR50, along with the melatonin MT1 receptor inhibits binding of [<sup>125</sup>I]melatonin to the MT1 receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>In the present study we use a range of approaches to demonstrate the capacity for heterodimerization between the human CXCR2 and DOP opioid receptors and show that a CXCR2 antagonist enhances the function of both peptide and alkaloid-based agonists at the DOP receptor via an allosteric mechanism when the two receptors are co-expressed. This is despite the CXCR2 ligand having no significant affinity to interact directly with the DOP receptor.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>[15,16-<sup>3</sup>H]Diprenorphine (50 Ci/mmol) and [<sup>35</sup>S]GTP[S] (1250 Ci/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Science.

We have previously shown the capacity of each of these receptors to form homodimers/oligomers via co-immunoprecipitation studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Expression in HEK-293 cells of FLAG&#x02013;hCXCR2 resulted in immunological detection in lysates of these cells of a 34&#x000a0;kDa polypeptide with a degree of micro-heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) representing differential N-glycosylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Expression of c-Myc&#x02013;hDOP resulted in the presence of a c-Myc-reactive polypeptide with a molecular mass of 60&#x000a0;kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Only with co-expression of FLAG&#x02013;hCXCR2 and c-Myc&#x02013;hDOP did immunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG antibody result in co-immunoprecipitation of c-Myc immunoreactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) and, even in SDS/PAGE, such immunoreactivity migrated with sizes ranging from 60&#x000a0;kDa to complexes with a substantially higher apparent molecular mass. Because the N-terminal region of GPCRs that are effectively delivered to the cell surface is expected to be extracellular, we also took advantage of the introduced N-terminal tags to perform tr-FRET studies in intact HEK-293 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] to detect protein complexes containing both receptors at the cell surface. Co-expression of c-Myc&#x02013;hCXCR2 and FLAG&#x02013;hDOP followed by the addition of a combination of Eu<sup>3+</sup>-labelled anti-c-Myc, to act as a long-lived energy donor, and APC-labelled anti-FLAG, to act as a potential energy acceptor, resulted in strong tr-FRET and output of light at 665&#x000a0;nm when samples were illuminated with 320&#x000a0;nm light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). This did not occur when HEK-293 cell populations individually expressing either c-Myc&#x02013;hCXCR2 or FLAG&#x02013;hDOP were combined prior to addition of the combination of Eu<sup>3+</sup>-labelled and APC-labelled antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Furthermore, the extent of energy transfer following co-expression of c-Myc&#x02013;hCXCR2 and FLAG&#x02013;hDOP was virtually the same as when c-Myc&#x02013;hDOP and FLAG&#x02013;hDOP were co-expressed to generate tr-FRET competent, cell-surface hDOP homodimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). We have also previously shown that in-frame fusion of auto-fluorescent proteins to the C-terminus of each of hCXCR2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and hDOP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] does not significantly alter the function or pharmacology of these receptors. Co-expression of hCXCR2&#x02013;eCFP and hDOP&#x02013;eYFP resulted in a capacity to image eCFP to eYFP FRET in individual single cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B), providing further evidence for direct hCXCR2&#x02013;hDOP interactions. Estimates of the relative affinities of GPCRs to interact can be obtained from &#x02018;saturation&#x02019; BRET studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In such experiments, forms of GPCRs C-terminally tagged with <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase and with an autofluorescent protein that is able to act as an energy acceptor of light emitted from substrate oxidation by the luciferase are co-expressed in various ratios and the BRET signal is monitored. Co-expression of hCXCR2&#x02013;<italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase and hCXCR2&#x02013;GFP<sup>2</sup> in HEK-293 cells resulted in BRET following addition of the luciferase substrate DeepBlueC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). At low energy acceptor (hCXCR2&#x02013;GFP<sup>2</sup>) to energy donor (hCXCR2&#x02013;<italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase) ratios the BRET signal increased with increasing [acceptor] to [donor] ratios, but this asymptotically approached a maximal value at higher [acceptor] to [donor] ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). Half-maximal BRET signal (BRET<sub>50</sub>) was achieved at an [acceptor] to [donor] ratio of 1.6&#x000b1;0.1. Co-expression of hDOP&#x02013;<italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase and hDOP&#x02013;GFP<sup>2</sup> also generated BRET signals that saturated with increasing [acceptor] to [donor] ratios, in this case with BRET<sub>50</sub>=2.2&#x000b1;0.07. Co-expression of hDOP&#x02013;<italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase with hCXCR2&#x02013;GFP<sup>2</sup> generated BRET signals that saturated, and in this case BRET<sub>50</sub> was 0.34&#x000b1;0.02 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). These results are consistent with hCXCR2&#x02013;hDOP hetero-interactions occurring with an even higher affinity than the corresponding hCXCR2&#x02013;hCXCR2 and hDOP&#x02013;hDOP homo-interactions.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Co-expression of FLAG&#x02013;hCXCR2 and c-Myc&#x02013;hDOP allows their co-immunoprecipitation</title><p>HEK-293 cells were mock-transfected (Mock) or transfected to transiently express FLAG&#x02013;hCXCR2, c-Myc&#x02013;hDOP or both (Co-transfected).

The capacity of both DADLE and SB225002 to compete with [<sup>3</sup>H]diprenorphine for binding to the hDOP&#x02013;C352I G<sub>&#x003b1;i2</sub> fusion protein indicated a p<italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> for DADLE of 9.0&#x000b1;0.09, whereas for SB225002 the p<italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> was &#x0003e;4.0 (results not shown). Pairs of GPCR&#x02013;G-protein fusions that are individually both inactive due to the introduction of mutations can reconstitute function when co-expressed if the GPCRs form a dimer and if one of the fusion proteins is mutated in the receptor whereas the other contains the inactivating mutation in the G-protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].

This expectation was confirmed via immunocytochemistry. Although plasma-membrane-localized anti-FLAG immunoreactivity was observed in these cells both with and without treatment with doxycycline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A), anti-CXCR2 reactivity was only observed following doxycycline treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A) and this overlapped strongly with the anti-FLAG signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A).

All but two of the medicines that interact directly with a GPCR do so via the orthosteric binding site, i.e. the binding site for the natural ligand, and function either to mimic or block the action of the natural ligand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Despite this, and due in part to the clinical effectiveness of cinacalcet, that acts as a positive allosteric modulator of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensing receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], and the recent development of the anti-HIV medicine maraviroc that acts as a CCR5 receptor-directed negative allosteric regulator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], there is now considerable interest in understanding the basis and mode of action of ligands that bind to allosteric sites on GPCRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. This reflects, in part, that true allosteric ligands are anticipated to function only in the presence of an orthosteric agonist and to modulate the effectiveness of signal transduction. To date, virtually all studies on allosteric regulators of GPCRs have focused on modulators that bind to the same GPCR as the orthosteric ligand but at a separate location. This reflects a combination of the traditional view that GPCRs exist and function as non-interacting monomeric species and that ligand screening strategies concentrate on analysis of the function of a single GPCR expressed in isolation.</p><p>It is now widely accepted that GPCRs can form dimers and/or higher-order oligomers and that dimerization is probably integral to function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Although the majority of early studies concentrated on homodimerization, i.e. interactions between multiple copies of the same GPCR, there has been a growing base of evidence to support the concept that GPCR heterodimerization can occur and that it is relevant to physiological function. Given the widespread co-expression of many GPCRs, such &#x02018;heterodimers&#x02019; are being considered as novel sets of therapeutic targets. Indeed, as the multiplicity of opioid receptor pharmacologies <italic>in vivo</italic> are far too complex to be explained by individual monomers, or indeed homodimers, of the molecularly defined DOP, KOP and MOP receptors, there is a large literature on how opioid receptor heterodimerization may help to explain this complex pharmacology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Furthermore, based on the co-expression patterns of opioid receptor subtypes, apparently orthosteric ligands have been reported to show considerable selectivity for specific opioid receptor heterodimer pairings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>].</p><p>In a GPCR heterodimer, it might be anticipated that the binding of a ligand to the orthosteric site of one GPCR could alter the pharmacology and function of the orthosteric binding site of the partner GPCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In such a situation the ligand at the first GPCR would act as an allosteric agent for the orthosteric agonist of the second GPCR and this would be a heterodimer-specific effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] because the ligand would display no direct effect on the second GPCR in assays in which the second GPCR was expressed alone. This concept has important implications for the design, identification and use of novel small-molecule regulators of GPCRs. For example, the allosteric effect of such ligands would be restricted to cells and tissues in which the GPCR heterodimer is present and would only be detected in assays in which the relevant target GPCR heterodimer is present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Although this concept has not been explored widely, there are a number of reports consistent with such a mechanism. For example, in cells co-expressing the CCR2b and CCR5 chemokine receptors CCR5-specific ligands that are unable to compete for MCP-1 binding on cells expressing CCR2b alone, and hence presumable do not bind directly to CCR2b, were able to prevent efficiently MCP-1 binding when the two receptors were co-expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In a similar vein, binding of the agonist [<sup>125</sup>I]melatonin to the MT1 receptor was eliminated when the orphan GPCR GPR50 was co-expressed along with the melatonin MT1 receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Furthermore, in cells natively co-expressing GPR50 and the MT1 receptor, specific [<sup>125</sup>I]melatonin binding could not be observed until GPR50 levels were reduced via a siRNA (small interfering RNA)-based approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. GPR50 is related to the MT1 receptor and these workers also provided a series of observations consistent with their heterodimerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Perhaps even more interesting from a therapeutic standpoint, the cannabinoid CB1 receptor orthosteric antagonist/inverse agonist rimonabant (marketed as Acomplia&#x02122;), which has been approved in Europe for the treatment of obesity, decreases the potency of the orexigenic peptide orexin A only when the cannabinoid CB1 receptor is co-expressed with the orexin-1 receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and these two GPCRs effectively form a heterodimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>As noted earlier, opioid receptors are widely expressed by white blood cells and there is a substantial literature on functional interactions between opioid ligands and chemokines in the regulation of white-cell chemotaxis. Prior to the present studies there have also been reports of direct physical interactions between opioid and chemokine receptors. Previously, these have concentrated on the CCR5 receptor due to its role as a co-receptor for HIV-1 entry into CD4<sup>+</sup> white cells and the susceptibility of opiate addicts to succumb to HIV-1 infection. Furthermore, very recent studies by Pello et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>] have shown that interactions between the chemokine CXCR4 receptor and the DOP receptor have functional consequences in immune cells in that co-addition of agonist ligands for these receptors fail to generate function, leading to a suppression of signalling potentially because the heterodimer produces a dominant-negative effect.</p><p>Therefore our initial studies centred on obtaining evidence for physical interactions between the CXCR2 receptor and the DOP opioid receptor. This was achieved by a combination of co-immunoprecipitation and various intact cell resonance energy transfer techniques, whereas the use of so-called &#x02018;saturation&#x02019; BRET studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] suggested that CXCR2 receptor&#x02013;DOP opioid receptor hetero-interactions may display higher avidity than either corresponding homo-interaction. This concept is not without parallel. Work on melatonin receptor subtypes has indicated greater avidity of hetero-interactions between the MT1 and MT2 receptors than the corresponding MT1&#x02013;MT1 or MT2&#x02013;MT2 homo-interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>].</p><p>For a number of years we [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and others (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>] for review) have employed fusion proteins, in which a G-protein &#x003b1; subunit is linked in-frame to the C-terminal tail of a GPCR to generate chimaeric, bi-functional polypeptides to explore many aspects of GPCR and G-protein function and pharmacology. We have also used this approach to examine GPCR homodimerization by demonstrating reconstitution of function only upon co-expression of pairs of GPCR&#x02013;G-protein fusions that are individually inactive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. When we co-expressed pairs of such fusion proteins in which, in the first, the CXCR2 receptor was not signal-transduction-competent because of the introduction of a mutation into the second intracellular loop, whereas in the second the DOP receptor was wild-type but the linked G-protein was modified to prevent guanine-nucleotide exchange, DOP agonists were able to cause activation of the wild-type G-protein linked to the CXCR2 receptor in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, following co-expression of this pairing, a CXCR2 antagonist was able to enhance the maximal activity of a range of DOP receptor agonists with distinct chemotypes. We also attempted to explore whether the CXCR2 agonist IL-8 also modulated the function or potency of DOP receptor agonists. However, we were unable to observe such effects (results not shown). The reasons for this are unclear. It could be hypothesized that an agonist ligand might have a greater effect on the structure/function of the partner GPCR of the heterodimer because agonist ligands must alter the conformation of their own target receptor to initiate signal transduction. Such an effect might then alter the orthosteric binding pocket or function of the GPCR heterodimer partner. However, it is impractical at this stage to speculate on the basis or implications of our inability to detect such an effect, not least because of the size and structural differences between the peptide agonist IL-8 and the synthetic small-molecule CXCR2 blocker employed.</p><p>Key experiments employed Flp-In T-REx HEK-293 cells. These contain a single site of chromosomal integration from which constructs cloned into this locus can be expressed in a completely inducible fashion. In these studies c-Myc&#x02013;I148E CXCR2&#x02013;C352I G<sub>&#x003b1;i2</sub> was harboured at the Flp-In locus, whereas in the same cells FLAG&#x02013;hDOP&#x02013;G204A,C352I G<sub>&#x003b1;i2</sub> was expressed stably and constitutively. Antibiotic-induced turn-on of c-Myc&#x02013;I148E CXCR2&#x02013;C352I G<sub>&#x003b1;i2</sub> expression was required to observe both DOP receptor function and the positive allosteric effects of the CXCR2 antagonist on this. Initial preliminary studies had confirmed that the DOP ligands had no direct effect at the CXCR2 receptor and that the CXCR2 antagonist had no direct effects at the DOP receptor, indicating the allosteric effects to be heterodimer specific. Importantly, as well as requiring expression of CXCR2, the allosteric effects of the CXCR2 antagonist were produced in a concentration-dependent fashion and with affinity consistent with its occupancy of the CXCR2 orthosteric binding site.</p><p>Although these key experiments were performed using pairs of GPCR&#x02013;G-protein fusions it is important to note that entirely equivalent results were produced when Flp-In T-REx HEK-293 cells were established in which the unfused wild-type hDOP receptor was expressed constitutively and the unfused mutant hCXCR2 receptor could be produced, on demand, from the Flp-In T-REx locus.</p><p>The present studies provide clear biochemical, biophysical and now pharmacological evidence to indicate the capacity of CXCR2 and DOP opioid receptors to interact physically. They also clearly indicate the capacity of GPCR heterodimers to provide novel allosteric pharmacology. Detection of such activities in ligand screening campaigns will be a challenge because they will be identified by neither primary screens, nor secondary counter screens, in which individual GPCRs are expressed and studied &#x02018;one target at a time&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. However, such heterodimer specific allosteric ligands offer obvious opportunities, modulating the function of the partner GPCR only in the presence of the orthosteric ligand for that receptor and doing so only in cells and tissues in which the relevant heterodimer is expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. It will be interesting to see if this principle can be exploited therapeutically.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>These studies were supported by the BBSRC (Biosciences and Biotechnology Research Council), Cara Therapeutics and the Wellcome Trust.</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rogers</surname><given-names>T.&#x000a0;J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Peterson</surname><given-names>P.&#x000a0;K.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Opioid G protein-coupled receptors: signals at the crossroads of inflammation</article-title><source>Trends Immunol.</source><year>2003</year><volume>24</volume><fpage>116</fpage><lpage>121</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12615205</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Pol</surname><given-names>O.</given-names></name><name><surname>Puig</surname><given-names>M.&#x000a0;M.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Expression of opioid receptors during peripheral inflammation</article-title><source>Curr.
