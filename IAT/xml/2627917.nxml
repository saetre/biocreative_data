Haptoglobin is present in three distinct phenotypes (Hp 1-1, Hp 2-1, and Hp 2-2), of which only individuals with phenotype Hp 1-1 or Hp 2-1 express the haptoglobin alpha-1 chain. As the expression of the haptoglobin alpha-1 chain, determined by SELDI-TOF MS, corresponds to the phenotype, initial results were validated by haptoglobin phenotyping of the independent sample set II by native one-dimensional gel-electrophoresis. With the Hp 1-1 phenotype as the reference category, the univariate hazard ratio for recurrence was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.56 &#x02013; 1.34, p = 0.5221) and 1.03 (95% CI: 0.65 &#x02013; 1.64, p = 0.8966) for the Hp 2-1 and Hp 2-2 phenotypes, respectively, in sample set II.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In contrast to our initial results, the haptoglobin phenotype was not identified as a predictor of recurrence free survival in high-risk primary breast cancer in our validation set.

This study illustrates the importance of validation in obtaining the true clinical applicability of a potential biomarker.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Following lung cancer, breast cancer currently is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. A substantial survival benefit is achieved by treatment with adjuvant systemic therapy. The main prognostic factors in breast cancer include clinical (age) and pathological parameters (tumour size, lymph node status, and grade of malignancy), whereas the hormone-receptor and Her2/neu-receptor status are (also) predictive factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However, 30 &#x02013; 50% of high-risk primary breast cancer patients will eventually develop metastatic relapse and die, despite locoregional treatment and adjuvant systemic chemotherapy, while there is a small percentage that would have survived without adjuvant chemotherapy and hormonal therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Clearly, improved breast cancer prognostication is urgently needed to more accurately predict clinical outcome in individual patients and as such reduce both over- and undertreatment of the disease.</p><p>High-throughput genomic and transcriptomic approaches have recently demonstrated to generate signatures that better predict clinical outcome than conventional prognosis criteria. For example, investigators from our respective institutes have published gene expression profiles in tumour tissue that outperformed all clinical variables in predicting disease outcome (risk of recurrence) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Similarly, a RT-PCR based multigene assay was recently shown to accurately predict both the probability of recurrence and the magnitude of chemotherapy benefit in node-negative, oestrogen-receptor positive breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>An alternative and complementary approach is to perform protein expression analysis. As the proteome reflects gene expression as well as protein stability and post-translational modifications, protein data could, in principle, be used for the same purpose. One of the techniques currently applied in proteomics research of breast cancer is surface-enhanced laser desorption ionisation time of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS). Until now, only two studies have been published in which this platform was applied in the identification of serum markers for prognosis of breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Comparing the tumour cytosolic extract of node-negative sporadic breast tumours with or without a recurrence, Ricolleau et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] identified a high level of ubiquitin and/or a low level of ferritin light chain to be associated with a good prognosis in breast cancer (n = 60). Goncalves et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] constructed a multiprotein model, consisting of 40 proteins, that correctly predicted relapse in 67 of the 81 patients of which fractionated sera were investigated. These promising results need to be interpreted cautiously, as in both studies only a limited number of patients was investigated, and results have not been validated yet by analysis of independent study populations.</p><p>Hence, the aim of the current study is to investigate sera of high-risk primary breast cancer patients to search for proteins predictive of recurrence free survival, and to validate our results by analysis of an independent study population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study population</title><p>From 1993 to 1999, high-risk primary breast cancer patients who had undergone modified radical mastectomy or breast conserving surgery with complete axillary clearance participated in a randomised multicentre phase III trial. This study investigated the benefit of high-dose adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with &#x02265; 4 axillary lymph node metastases. The design of the study has been described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Major eligibility criteria were histologically confirmed stage IIA, IIB or IIIA breast cancer with at least 4 tumour-positive axillary lymph nodes but no evidence of distant metastases, age under 56 years, and no previous other malignancies.</p><p>In sample set I, sera of 63 study patients who were treated in the Netherlands Cancer Institute were included. Sera were procured after surgery (7 &#x02013; 51 days), but prior to adjuvant chemotherapy (0 &#x02013; 45 days). All sera were obtained and stored under strictly defined conditions at the Institutional Serum Bank. In sample set II, serum/plasma samples (procured at any time point in therapy) of 371 study patients treated in the Netherlands Cancer Institute (sera; n = 15, plasma; n = 38), the Erasmus Medical Center &#x02013; Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center (sera; n = 114), the Radboud University Medical Center Nijmegen (sera; n = 87), the University Medical Center Groningen (sera; n = 69), and the University Medical Center Leiden (sera; n = 48) were included. All samples were obtained with medical-ethics approval and all patients gave informed consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Chemicals</title><p>All used chemicals were obtained from Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA, unless stated otherwise.</p></sec><sec><title>Biomarker discovery</title><p>Protein profiling was performed using the ProteinChip SELDI Reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Several chromatographic array surfaces with suitable binding conditions were screened for discriminative mass-to-charge ratio's (m/z) between unfractionated sera of breast cancer patients of set I either experiencing a recurrence at a relatively short follow-up (Recurrence Free Survival (RFS) &#x0003c; 16 months, n = 4), or experiencing no recurrence after a long follow-up (&#x0003e; 75 months, n = 4). Optimal discrimination between both groups was obtained by Q10 arrays (strong anion exchange chromatography) with 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8/0.1% TritonX-100 as a binding buffer. This assay was subsequently applied in the analysis of all sera in sample set I (n = 63).</p><p>In brief, samples were thawed on ice and denatured by 1:10 dilution in 9 M urea/2% 3- [(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS)/1% dithiotreitol (DTT). Arrays were assembled in a 96-well bioprocessor (Bio-Rad Labs), which was placed on a platform shaker at 350 rpm at all steps of the protocol. Arrays were equilibrated twice with 200 &#x003bc;l of binding buffer for 5 min. Pretreated serum samples were diluted 1:10 in binding buffer and were randomly applied to the arrays. After a 30 min incubation, the arrays were washed twice with binding buffer and twice with 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 for 5 min. Following a quick rinse with deionised water (Braun, Emmenbr&#x000fc;cke, Germany), arrays were air-dried. A 50% solution of sinapinic acid (Bio-Rad Labs) in 50% acetonitrile (ACN)/0.5% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was applied twice (1.0 &#x003bc;l) to the array as matrix. Following air-drying, the arrays were analysed using the ProteinChip SELDI (PBS IIc) Reader (Bio-Rad Labs). For mass accuracy, the instrument was calibrated on the day of measurements with All-In-One peptide standard (Bio-Rad Labs). Data were collected between 0 and 200 kDa, averaging 65 laser shots with intensity 158, detector sensitivity 5, and a focus lag time of 746 ns. Spectra were baseline subtracted and normalised to the total ion current from 1.5 to 200 kDa. The Biomarker Wizard software package (version 3.1, Bio-Rad Labs) was applied for peak detection. Peaks were auto-detected when occurring in at least 25% of spectra and when having a signal-to-noise ratio of at least 5. Peak clusters were completed with peaks with a signal-to-noise ratio of at least 2 in a cluster mass window of 0.3%.</p></sec><sec><title>Biomarker characterisation</title><p>A 500 &#x003bc;l serum sample containing the biomarker of interest marker (<italic>i.e</italic>. m/z 9198) was denatured in 9 M urea/2% CHAPS/1% DTT in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 9. The sample was subsequently fractionated on Q Ceramic HyperD beads with a strong anion exchange moiety (Biosepra Inc., Malborough, MA, USA). After binding of denatured sample to the beads, the flow through was collected and bound proteins were subsequently eluted with buffers of pH 9 &#x02013; 3. The fraction containing the marker was further purified by size fractionation, using Microcon 50 kDa MW spin concentrators (YM50, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) with increasing concentrations of ACN/0.1% TFA. The filtrate containing the m/z 9198 marker was subsequently de-salted by application on reversed phase RP18 beads (Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA), followed by elution with increasing concentrations of ACN containing 0.1% TFA. The purification process was monitored by profiling each fraction on Q10 arrays and NP20 arrays (a non-selective, silica chromatographic surface). Eluates containing the m/z 9198 marker were dried and redissolved in loading buffer for SDS-PAGE, which was performed on Novex NuPage gels (18% Tris-Glycine gel; Invitrogen, San Diego, CA, USA). Following Coomassie staining (Simply Blue; Invitrogen), protein bands of interest were excised and collected. The proteins within the excised bands were eluted by washing twice with 30% ACN/100 mM ammonium bicarbonate, followed by dehydration in 100% ACN. Gel bands were subsequently heated at 50&#x000b0;C for 5 min and eluted with 45% formic acid/30% ACN/10% isopropanol under sonification for 30 min. After leaving the eluates overnight at room temperature, they were profiled on NP20 arrays. Eluates were subsequently dried, resuspended in 20 ng/&#x003bc;l trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) in 10% ACN/25 mM ammonium bicarbonate, followed by incubation at room temperature for 4 h for protein digestion. For in-gel protein digestion, gel bands were first washed with 40% methanol/10% acetic acid twice, followed by a 30% ACN/100 mM ammonium bicarbonate wash. Gel bands were dried by SpeedVac and digested for 12 h by trypsin (20 ng/&#x003bc;l 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate). All tryptic digests were profiled on NP20 chips, using 1 &#x003bc;l 20% alpha-cyano-4-hydroxy cinnaminic acid solution in 50% ACN/0.5% TFA as matrix. Peptides in the digests were investigated with the NCBI database using the ProFound search engine at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://prowl.rockefeller.edu/prowl-cgi/profound.exe"/> with the following search parameters: standard cleavage rules for trypsin, 1 missed cleavage allowed. Confirmation of protein identity was provided by sequencing tryptic digest peptides by quadrupole-TOF (Q-TOF) MS (Applied Biosystems/MSD Sciex, Foster City, CA, USA) fitted with a ProteinChip Interface. Fragment ion spectra resulting from Q-TOF analyses were taken to search the SwissProt 44.2 database (Homo Sapiens: 11072 sequences) using the MASCOT search engine at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.matrixscience.com"/> (Matrix Science Ltd., London, UK), with the following search parameters: monoisotopic precursor mass tolerance: 40 ppm, fragment mass tolerance: 0.2 Da, variable modifications: methionine oxidation, and trypsin cleavage site. Throughout the identification experiments, a serum sample lacking the m/z 9198 marker was run concurrently as a negative control.</p></sec><sec><title>Haptoglobin phenotyping assay</title><p>The haptoglobin (Hp) phenotype of all samples in set I and II was assessed by native one-dimensional gel electrophoresis, followed by peroxidase staining. One &#x003bc;l of serum or plasma sample was mixed with 19 &#x003bc;l of a 1:100 dilution of haemolysate in phosphate buffered saline. Following incubation for 5 min at room temperature, 10 &#x003bc;l of 3&#x000d7; native sample buffer (30 ml glycerol/18.8 ml 1 M Tris-HCl pH 6.8/1.5 ml 1% (w/v) bromophenol blue, made to 100 ml with water) was added and mixed. Samples were then loaded onto a 3 &#x02013; 8% gradient Tris-Acetate NuPAGE precast gel (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). Samples were run at a constant 150 V, gradient 18 &#x02013; 7 mA for 3 h, using a running buffer of 25 mM Tris/250 mM glycine, adjusted to pH 8.6. After staining with 1% (w/v) rhodamine 1%, the gel was incubated for 10 min in a 1:1 water-diluted leucomalachite green peroxidase-development buffer (0.2 g leucomalachite green/0.02 g EDTA in 25 ml 40% (v/v) acetic acid with 0.06% (v/v) H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). The phenotype of each sample was subsequently determined by its specific migration pattern, which appears as black bands in the gel (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Haptoglobin phenotype assessment using a native one-dimensional gel electrophoresis system</bold>.

After staining, a clear band in the 9 kDa region was visible, which was excised and subjected to passive elution followed by tryptic digestion of the eluate.

Her2/Neu status (p = 0.0589) and treatment arm (p = 0.0809) were only borderline significantly associated with recurrence free survival in set II (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Recurrence free survival in sample set II (n = 371) by haptoglobin phenotype</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2407-8-389-7"/></fig></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The introduction of high-throughput analytical platforms, such as the genomic/transcriptomic microarray technology, or the proteomic SELDI-TOF MS technology, has enabled the advent of discovery-based research. Large quantities of data can now be analysed without underlying hypotheses, to search for patterns that discriminate between patients with different diagnosis, prognosis or response to treatment. Assessment of validity, however, is pivotal in this discovery-based '-omics' research, as the meaning of such patterns from a biological perspective often is unknown.</p><p>Our initial findings were, however, endorsed by the various biological functions of haptoglobin and their phenotype-dependency. The main physiological function of haptoglobin is binding of free haemoglobin. The haptoglobin-haemoglobin complex is too large to be filtered at the kidney glomerulus and is therefore retained. Both iron loss and free-radical mediated damage, caused by the haem-iron mediated generation of free hydroxyl radicals (by means of the Fenton reaction: H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>+ Fe<sup>2+ </sup>&#x02192; Fe<sup>3+ </sup>+ OH<sup>- </sup>+ <sup>&#x000b7;</sup>OH) are thus prevented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Haptoglobin has also been identified as a strong angiogenic agent, activating endothelial cell growth and differentiation. This function was shown to be phenotype dependent, as the Hp 2-2 phenotype has been found to be more angiogenic than the other phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The poor prognosis of our Hp 2-2 breast cancer patients in our discovery set (n = 63) could be exerted via this haptoglobin function, since angiogenesis is well known to be involved tumor growth, proliferation, and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Both haptoglobin and its phenotype have been described previously in relation to various diseases (including cancer), a finding which is not surprising in view of its biology. Both the intact protein and its subunits have been found overexpressed in serum of patients with various solid tumours, for example ovarian and small-cell lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The 9.2 kDa haptoglobin alpha-1 chain has been specifically detected by Tolson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] in sera of renal cell carcinoma patients and healthy controls. Following haptoglobin phenotyping, all patients having the Hp 2-2 phenotype indeed proved to be missing the 9.2 kDa haptoglobin alpha-1 peak in their serum protein profile. Due to its phenotypic distribution, this protein could, however, not be considered as a diagnostic marker. The influence of haptoglobin phenotype on recurrence free survival has not been investigated. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] Using the SELDI-TOF MS platform, the 9.2 kDa alpha-1 chain was also detected by Goncalves et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Unlike our own observations, they found the 9.2 kDa peak to be overexpressed in sera of high-risk primary breast cancer patients (n = 81) experiencing a relapse versus long-term disease free survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The absolute intensities of the m/z 9192 peak in SELDI-TOF MS spectra of Goncalves et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] ranged between 0 and 2, and a clear dichotomous peak intensity distribution was not observed. These discrepancies from our initial findings most likely originate in the serum pre-fractionation that was performed in this study. During protein purification, we repeatedly found the 9.2 kDa peak to be predominantly present in the pH 5 fraction. Goncalves et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] however, subjected only the pH 9/flow through, pH 4, and organic solvent fractions to SELDI-TOF MS analysis, resulting in a suboptimal assay for haptoglobin alpha-1 detection.</p><p>Another association between protein expression and recurrence free survival in breast cancer has previously been reported by Kuhajda et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. They described a decreased tumour tissue expression of haptoglobin-related-protein, quantitated immunohistochemically, to be associated with a prolonged recurrence free survival in 70 breast cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Their findings differ from our observations by the biological matrix analysed (tumour tissue vs. serum), by the exposure used for prediction of recurrence free survival (protein expression vs. phenotype), and by the identity of the protein used for prognostication (haptoglobin-related-protein vs. haptoglobin). Although coded for by two different genes, both proteins have more than 90% amino acid sequence homology. There are, however, distinct differences between the alpha-1 chain of haptoglobin and haptoglobin-related-protein, due to 8 amino acid substitutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Amino acid sequencing of the m/z 9198 marker, taking 7 out of 8 amino acid substitutions into account, enabled us to unequivocally identify our candidate biomarker as haptoglobin alpha-1 chain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>).</p><p>The haptoglobin phenotype has not been identified as a predictor of recurrence free survival in breast cancer thus far. The phenotype has nevertheless been associated with clinical outcome of other pathologies, a.o. mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], nephropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and cardiovascular disease outcome in diabetic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], mortality in HIV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and mortality in tuberculosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In these studies, the Hp 2-2 phenotype was invariably associated with worse clinical outcome, in contrast though to the study of Depypere et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], who found the Hp 1-1 phenotype associated with more severe hypertension and proteinuria in patients with preeclampsia.</p><p>Despite the potential biological justifications, our promising initial result of the haptoglobin phenotype being a predictor of recurrence free survival in a limited number (n = 63) of high-risk primary breast cancer patients was not confirmed following validation by analysis of a six-fold larger sample set (n = 371). It is unlikely that our findings result from differences in patient characteristics between our discovery and validation sample set, since all (known) characteristics were similarly distributed between both sample sets.</p><p>The two major threats to validity of discovery-based proteomics research come from chance and bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Sources of bias include differences in sample collection and storage, or in analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The haptoglobin phenotype however, is not influenced by specimen collection and storage. Besides, the native 1D-gelelectrophoresis method for assessment of haptoglobin phenotype is robust and reproducible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Study results are therefore unlikely to have been influenced by bias, but rather result from chance.</p><p>Due to small sample sizes and the artifice of discovery strategies, many biomarker candidates are prone to be false positive, <italic>i.e</italic>. be a type I error (erroneous rejection of the null hypothesis). The chance of candidate biomarkers being type I errors is inferred by the fact that most proteomic datasets are subject to both the 'curse of dimensionality' (large number of features) and the 'curse of dataset sparsity' (limited number of samples) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. As such, datasets are frequently subjected to multiple testing in search for candidate biomarkers. Yet, even a level of significance for type I errors of 0.01 is no guarantee that false positive findings are debarred, even following correction for multiple testing. Problems caused by chance are best avoided by analysis of an independent validation dataset, in which false positive markers will be ruled out, as they are unique to the discovery sample set [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>The above-mentioned hurdles in proteomics research apply equally to all other '-omics' research (<italic>e.g</italic>. genomics and metabolomics), as in general, these research approaches suffer from a limited number of samples in comparison with the large number of generated features.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, although we initially found the haptoglobin phenotype to be a predictor of recurrence free survival in a limited number of high-risk primary breast cancer patients, this was not confirmed following validation by analysis of a similar, but six-fold larger sample set. Clearly, validation of initial results is of pivotal importance in determining the clinical significance of a candidate biomarker. In spite of this, few, if any, related clinical diagnostic tests have yet been validated for clinical use, although the number of papers reporting on candidate protein biomarkers is large and still expanding. This lack of validation can result in chance results and erroneous conclusions, leading to disappointment when results cannot be reproduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Distillation of true positives from the total pool of candidate biomarkers is the single greatest challenge in biomarker development, and should therefore be the emphasis in data-driven proteomics research.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MCWG participated in the design of the study, performed the laboratory work, and drafted the manuscript.
