However, subtype-specific functions of the majority of the nine members of the mammalian plexin family are largely unknown. In order to investigate functional properties of B-plexins, we analyzed the expression of human and murine plexin B3 and expressed full-length human plexins B2 (B2) and B3 (B3) in NIH-3T3 cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Unexpectedly, B3 strongly and B2 moderately stimulate neurite outgrowth of primary murine cerebellar neurons. Both plexins mediate Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent cell aggregation due to homophilic <italic>trans</italic>-interaction, which is strong in the case of B3 and moderate for B2. Using different deletion constructs we show that the sema domain of B3 is essential for homophilic interaction. Using yeast two-hybrid analysis, we identified the neuron-specific and calmodulin-binding Ras-related GTPase Rin as an interaction partner of the intracellular part of B3, but not of B2. Rin, also known for its neurite outgrowth-inducing characteristics, co-localizes and co-immunoprecipitates with B3 in co-transfected COS-7 cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data suggest an involvement of homophilic interaction of B3 in semaphorin-independent signaling mechanisms positively influencing neuronal morphogenesis or function. Furthermore the neuron-specific small GTPase Rin is involved in downstream signaling of plexin B3.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>During the development of the nervous system neurons respond to attractive and repulsive guidance cues to navigate to their final targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The nine mammalian plexins, A1&#x02013;4, B1&#x02013;3, C1, and D1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] are characterized by a sema domain, three cysteine-rich repeats (MRS, <underline>M</underline>et-<underline>r</underline>elated <underline>s</underline>equences, or PSI, <underline>p</underline>lexins, <underline>s</underline>emaphorins, and <underline>i</underline>ntegrins), three glycine/proline-rich repeats (IPT, <underline>i</underline>mmunoglobulin-like fold shared by <underline>p</underline>lexins and transcription factors), a single-pass transmembrane region, and an intracellular SP (<underline>s</underline>ex <underline>p</underline>lexin) domain consisting of two different parts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Plexins are known as semaphorin receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Molecules associated with plexins in receptor complexes include cell adhesion molecule L1, the scatter factor receptors Met and Ron, erbB-2, OTK, and VEGFR2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Interactions have been shown between plexin C1 and semaphorin 7A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], plexin D1 and semaphorin 3E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], plexin B1 and semaphorin 4D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and plexin B3 and semaphorin 5A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Semaphorin 5A induces growth cone collapse in retinal ganglion cells, has axon-repelling activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], induces cellular collapse, and leads to inhibition of integrin-based adhesion of NIH-3T3 fibroblasts expressing recombinant plexin B3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The cytoplasmic C-terminus of B plexins activates Rho GTPase through Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors PDZ-RhoGEF and LARG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Based on this C-terminal interaction, plexin B1 mediates semaphorin 4D-induced growth cone collapse in neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Independently of this mechanism, a direct down regulation of the activity of neurite outgrowth-promoting GTPase R-Ras by the GTPase activating protein (GAP)-homologous domain of plexin B1 has been shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Thus, according to published data, plexins appear to be mainly involved in the repulsive activities of semaphorins on neuronal cells.</p><p>We found evidence for plexin B3- and B2-dependent stimulation of neurite outgrowth, subtype-specific homophilic interaction of B3 and B2, respectively, and an interaction of B3 with neuron-specific GTPase Rin, the latter one known for its involvement in neurite outgrowth.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Expression and alternative splicing of PLXNB3</title><p>Northern blot analysis of 12 different human organs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) revealed a strong band of ~6.2 kb from the brain sample but not the remaining organs, indicating that <italic>PLXNB3 </italic>is expressed abundantly only in brain. The estimated size of the mRNA corresponds well with that of the mature message predicted from the cloned full-length human cDNA [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AF149019">AF149019</ext-link>]. BLASTn screening of human dbEST by AF149019 revealed 56 fully matching entries, all of them representing the 3'-end of the transcript and two variants. EST [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="BF345653">BF345653</ext-link>] from oligodendroglioma lacks 246 nucleotides of exon 27, corresponding to bp 4,595&#x02013;4,840 of AF149019. This gap predicts an in-frame loss of 82 codons (aa 1,495&#x02013;1,575). EST [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="H51489">H51489</ext-link>] from adult brain lacks the 67 3'-terminal nucleotides of exon 27 (bp 4,774&#x02013;4,840 of AF149019). This gap predicts a C-terminally truncated isoform of B3 due to a frame-shift resulting in the inclusion of nine amino acids (aa 1,554&#x02013;1,563) followed by a premature stop. These findings suggest alternative splicing and the existence of at least three different B3-isoforms due to skipping of various parts of exon 27. Differential expression of the three isoforms in human organs was confirmed by PCR using isoform-specific primers. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> the full-length exon 27-isoform was detectable in the majority of the organs analyzed but skeletal muscle and heart. cDNA of the truncated isoform was detectable only in the brain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>), whereas the isoform lacking 82 codons was present in skeletal muscle, liver, pancreas, kidney, brain, and heart (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>).

Western blot (WB) analysis of proteins from COS-7 cells stably overexpressing full-length B3 and from human neocortex (but not from corpus callosum) using antibody pAbB3-B against the third IPT-domain of human B3 revealed bands of ~260 kDa and ~140 kDa that were absent in nontransfected control cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Antibody pAbB3-A against the human sema domain of B3 only detected the 260 kDa band (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest proteolytic processing of the extracellular portion of B3 similar to that described for plexins B1 and B2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Within the extracellular domains of B3 flanked by the epitopes of pAbB3-A and pAbB3-B there are two RXXR sites corresponding to the minimal consensus motif required by proprotein convertases. Cleavage at one of these sites would remove the sema domain leaving the truncated transmembrane part of B3 not recognizable by pAbB3-A. pAbB3-B did not cross-react with plexins B1, B2, or A1 expressed in COS-7 cells and was therefore also useful for the analysis of co-immunoprecipitation of B3 with these molecules (see figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12B&#x02013;D</xref>). Mouse B3 was detected by WB analysis of adult murine brain lysate using antibody pAbmB3 against the sema domain of mouse B3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, first lane). pAbmB3 detected bands of ~260 kDa, ~160 kDa, and ~140 kDa. This suggests posttranslational processing of murine B3 similar or analogous to that of human B3. Minor differences in band patterns between the murine and the human WB may be due to the different epitopes recognized by the antibodies. pABmB3 also recognized C-terminally truncated mouse B3 expressed in pcDNA/mB3V5-transfected COS-7 cells used as positive control (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, lane 2). B3 has ten potential N-glycosylation sites (Asn-X-Ser/Thr, X&#x02260;Pro). The 260 kDa protein detected by pAbB3-B in human brain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, lane 1) was resistant to EndoH treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, lane 2) yielding a distinct band of ~260 kDa in addition to a novel band running at ~200&#x02013;230 kDa. The latter one suggests the presence of incompletely processed B3 non-resistant to EndoH in the transfected cells. Treatment with tunicamycin resulted in a relatively reduced intensity of the 260 kDa band and the appearance of a novel band of ~200 kDa. These data suggest that the 200 kDa band corresponds to deglycosylated full-length B3, whereas the 260 kDa band represents fully glycosylated, mature, full-length transmembraneous B3 supposed to be located at the cell surface. This was confirmed by exclusive detection of a sharp band of a biotinylated 260 kDa protein after pAbB3-B-immunoprecipitation of surface-biotinylated protein of stably transfected COS-7 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, first lane). As shown by immunocytochemistry of living cells stably expressing full-length B3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>), a significant proportion of B3 is detectable at the cell surface.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Detection of plexin B3 protein in human and murine brain</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>Western blot detection of human plexin B3 (B3) protein in pIRES/B3-tranfected COS-7 cells (lane 1) and human brain (corpus callosum, lane 3; neocortex, lane 4) using antibody pAbB3-B.

Up to now, in the nervous system plexins were known to act as receptors involved in repulsion and growth cone collapse. The observed stimulation of neurite outgrowth by human plexins B2 and B3 could not be explained by the mechanisms known so far for B-plexins. For <italic>Xenopus </italic>plexin, homophilic interaction in <italic>trans </italic>has been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Homophilic interaction of various neuronal transmembrane proteins, including molecules involved primarily in repulsion, has been implicated in stimulation of neurite outgrowth. Therefore, we hypothesized that homophilic interaction of plexins B2 and B3 may underlie the neurite outgrowth-promoting activity of both plexins. Using cell aggregation assays and immunoprecipitation we found evidence of human B2- and B3-specific homophilic interaction in <italic>trans</italic>. Furthermore, human and murine B3 co-immunoprecipitated, and we could show expression of <italic>PlxnB3 </italic>in cultured murine cerebellar neurons. There seemed to be a correlation between plexin-dependent cell aggregation, adhesion, and neurite outgrowth stimulation, as B3, compared to B2, had a stronger effect on all features. These data, along with the fact that homophilic interaction of various neuronal CAMs has been implicated in stimulation of neurite outgrowth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], support the hypothesis that homophilic interaction of B3 and also possibly that of B2 is involved in stimulation of neurite outgrowth and that in the assay presented both human plexins may stimulate neurite outgrowth of murine cerebellar neurons via a quasi homophilic interaction of the human and murine homologs. However, a reverse signaling mechanism in which B3 would act as a ligand for a yet unknown receptor cannot be ruled out as an explanation for the observed B3-dependent stimulation of neurite outgrowth. Such a reverse signaling mechanism has been described for semaphorin 6D / plexin A1 in cardiac development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>For <italic>plxnB3</italic>, both glial and neuronal expression have been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Using combined <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization and immunocytochemistry, we found <italic>plxnB3 </italic>mRNA in cultured primary cerebellar neurons of six days old mice. <italic>PlxnB3 </italic>mRNA was also detected in adult murine cerebellum and we observed prominent neuronal B3-specific immunostaining in adult human cerebellum. Therefore, homophilic interaction of B3 is supposed to be a possible mechanism underlying the stimulation of neurite outgrowth of cerebellar neurons in the assay presented. The new ISH-probe used in this work and the probe used by Cheng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], both cover major parts of the 3'-UTR of <italic>PlxnB3</italic>. Probes hybridizing more upstream appear to detect a lower level of neuronal and a more pronounced non-neuronal expression of <italic>PlxnB3 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. We also found in addition to neuronal staining a non-neuronal staining pattern using the same probe as Worzfeld et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. These data suggest the existence of cell-type specific isoforms of B3 with different 3'-ends of the mRNA. In human organs we found evidence for the expression of such isoforms. However, in mouse EST database (NCBI dbEST) the 3'-end of <italic>PlxnB3 </italic>transcripts is strongly overrepresented with more upstream sequences represented very scarcely thus not allowing the rapid detailed analysis of tissue-specific expression of B3 isoforms.</p><p>B3 is a known receptor of semaphorin 5A that induces cellular collapse, growth cone collapse, has axon-repelling activity, and leads to inhibition of integrin-based adhesion of NIH-3T3 fibroblasts expressing transfected plexin B3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Our findings of both B3- and B2-associated cell aggregation and stimulation of neurite outgrowth suggest the possibility that plexins B2 and B3, via homophilic interaction, respectively, are also involved in signaling pathways independent of semaphorins. The sema domain of semaphorins contains a plexin interaction site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. By immunoprecipitation of various deletion constructs we showed that the sema domain of B3 was necessary and sufficient for the homophilic interaction. Since B3 does not co-immunoprecipitate with plexins A1, B1, or B2, and since B3-positive cells do not aggregate with L1-positive cells, the homophilic interaction seems to be highly specific. Therefore, the sema domain of B3 may be involved in both homophilic interaction and heterophilic interaction with semaphorin 5A. Under the experimental conditions presented for homophilic co-IP of recombinant B3, B3 also co-immunoprecipitates with semaphorin 5A. Since recombinant B3 and semaphorin 5A were co-expressed in the cells used for these experiments and semaphorin 5A could be co-immunoprecipitated by B3 despite its strong homophilic <italic>trans</italic>-interaction, both homophilic and heterophilic interactions of B3 may co-exist <italic>in vivo</italic>. Although the sema domain of B3 seems to be involved in both types of interaction, it is not clear whether semaphorin 5A and plexin B3 compete directly for B3 binding, whether different co-receptors are involved, and which signal transduction pathways are triggered by the different types of interaction.</p><p>B3 may be a multifunctional player in cell adhesion and both neurite outgrowth and repulsion, possibly due to competing ligands inducing "opposite" effects on neuronal morphology. There is a growing number of CAMs showing bifunctional characteristics with respect to involvement of homophilic interaction in stimulation of neurite outgrowth, neuronal attraction, migration, or axonal fasciculation, and heterophilic interactions in various functions including repulsion and growth cone collapse. A prominent example is represented by L1, known for its strong stimulation of neurite outgrowth in association with its homophilic binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] and also involved in semaphorin 3A mediated repulsion of cortical axons as part of a heteromultimeric receptor complex including plexin A1 and neuropilin 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The Roundabout (Robo) receptor, a transmembrane glycoprotein sharing structural homology with a number of neuronal CAMs of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily, is receptor for Slit, an extracellular matrix protein. Slit controls midline crossing of axons by inducing growth cone repulsion upon interaction with Robo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. On the other hand, homophilic <italic>trans</italic>-interaction of Robo promotes cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], most likely reflecting Robo's known role in selective axon fasciculation. The majority of the known CAMs which show involvement of homophilic interaction in stimulation of neurite outgrowth or neuronal migration contain Ig (&#x000b1; fibronectin type III) or cadherin domains; these CAMs include L1, NCAM, Robo1, Robo2, fasciclin II, LAMP, DM-GRASP, N-cadherin, and Celsr2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Currently, the number of known CAMs with homophilic binding and neurite outgrowth stimulating characteristics is rapidly growing, with an increasing variety of molecular features not shared by Igs, fibronectins, or cadherins, as e.g. the AMIGOs or ninjurins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Our work shows that B3 and suggests that also B2 belong to this latter group, adding further molecular heterogeneity to the group of homophilic CAMs with neurite outgrowth stimulating capacity.</p><p>Searching for intracellular pathways involved in the B2- and B3-dependent neurite outgrowth using the intracellular parts of B2 and B3 as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen of human fetal brain cDNA we identified Rin, a neuron-specific and calmodulin-binding Ras-related GTPase, as interaction partner for B3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. An interaction between B3 and Rin in mammalian cells (but not between B2 and Rin) could be shown by co-immunoprecipitation of recombinant B3 and Rin expressed in COS-7 cells in which co-localization of these proteins at plasma membrane-associated sites could be shown by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Therefore, one may assume physiological interaction of B3 and Rin as part of a neuronal receptor complex involved in B3-dependent signaling. Expression of recombinant Rin induces neurite outgrowth in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells and Rin interacts with the transcription factor Brn-3a, which is known to regulate different genes involved in neuronal differentiation and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. If the homophilic interaction of B3 is responsible for B3-dependent stimulation of neurite outgrowth one may speculate therefore that Rin may be involved in this process. Since Rin and B2 do not interact in yeast or mammalian cells, this interaction seems to be specific for B3 and other mechanisms seem to be involved in B2-dependent stimulation of neurite outgrowth. The Rin-interacting intracellular subdomain of B3 remains to be identified. This may help to elucidate how plexins may be involved in common and subtype-specific intracellular signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Further experiments are required to investigate whether homophilic interaction of B2 or B3 is responsible for the observed stimulation of neurite outgrowth, or whether these plexins function as heterophilic ligands of yet unknown neuronal receptors in a reverse signaling mechanism.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data suggest an involvement of the homophilic interaction of plexin B3 in stimulation of neurite outgrowth.

Expression of bait constructs was confirmed by immunoblotting of yeast lysates with an anti-hSos1 antibody. These pre-transformed cdc25H strains were transformed with pMyr-cDNA library plasmids and incubated at 22&#x000b0;C for 5 days on selective minimal glucose plates lacking leucin, uracil, and tryptophan. A total of ~2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>transformants were replica-plated onto selective minimal galactose plates and grown up (7 days, 37&#x000b0;C). From a first selection of 350 clones 39 putative positive clones were isolated after a second round of selection on galactose plates at 37&#x000b0;C. Bait-prey protein interactions of putative positive clones were analyzed by re-transformation of the cdc25H yeast strain with both the respective prey-encoding pMyr-plasmid together with pSos/B2IC, pSos/B3IC, or pSos vector without insert.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AV and UF conceived of the study and participated in its design and coordination; UF wrote the grant application.
