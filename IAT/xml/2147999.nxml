To investigate the mechanisms regulating this migration, we utilize mAbs selective for conformational epitopes as probes for active LFA-1. Expression of the KIM127 epitope, but not the 24 epitope, defines the extended conformation of LFA-1, which has intermediate affinity for ligand ICAM-1. A key finding is that KIM127-positive LFA-1 forms new adhesions at the T lymphocyte leading edge. This LFA-1 links to the cytoskeleton through &#x003b1;-actinin-1 and disruption at the level of integrin or actin results in loss of cell spreading and migratory speed due to a failure of attachment at the leading edge. The KIM127 pattern contrasts with high-affinity LFA-1 that expresses both 24 and KIM127 epitopes, is restricted to the mid-cell focal zone and controls ICAM-1 attachment. Identification of distinctive roles for intermediate- and high-affinity LFA-1 in T lymphocyte migration provides a biological function for two active conformations of this integrin for the first time.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>&#x003b1;-Actinin-1</kwd><kwd>integrin</kwd><kwd>LFA-1</kwd><kwd>migration</kwd><kwd>T lymphocyte</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>T lymphocytes are continually recruited from the circulation into lymph nodes and other tissues in response to stimuli released at sites of injury or infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">von Andrian and Mempel, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Cyster, 2005</xref>). This recruitment involves the integrin LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18; &#x003b1;L&#x003b2;2) acting as a migratory receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Hogg <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Dustin <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). If turnover of active to inactive LFA-1 is prevented, then motility decreases both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, indicating that conversion between different activity states is essential for lymphocyte migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Semmrich <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Smith <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). T lymphocytes move rapidly across the vasculature into lymph nodes where they can reach speeds of &#x0223c;40 &#x003bc;m/min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Mempel <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). This ability to migrate is vital for the ultimate success of the immune response as it increases the opportunity for cellular interactions, thereby improving the chance of antigen recognition.</p><p>Integrin activation involves an alteration in conformation giving rise to an affinity increase, and adhesion strengthening through receptor clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Carman and Springer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Dustin <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Kinashi, 2005</xref>). Crystallization of the &#x003b2;3 integrin &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 has revealed details of the conformational changes that integrins undergo following activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Xiong <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>). A basic model for &#x003b2;2 integrin LFA-1 activation has been developed from structural data, together with observations from electron microscopic studies of isolated integrins and from the use of mAbs that recognize epitopes expressed upon activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Takagi <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Luo <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Basically, one conformation of LFA-1 is bent at the junction between the thigh and calf-1 domains of the &#x003b1;L subunit and between EGF-like domains 1 and 2 of the &#x003b2;2 subunit. Upon activation, LFA-1 extends, exposing an epitope recognized by mAb KIM127 that is located in the EGF-like domain 2 at the bend in the &#x003b2;2 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Robinson <italic>et al</italic>, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Beglova <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). The extended KIM127&#x0002b; LFA-1 adopts both closed and open conformations corresponding to intermediate- and high-affinity forms of LFA-1, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Kinashi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Luo <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). The epitope recognized by mAb 24 is located in a loop at the top of the I-like domain near the MIDAS site in the &#x003b2;2 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Lu <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Kamata <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>), and its expression is characteristic of the high-affinity conformation of LFA-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Dransfield <italic>et al</italic>, 1992b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Lu <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Hogg <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Kamata <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). This epitope is postulated to form upon interaction of the &#x003b1; subunit I domain with the &#x003b2;2 subunit I-like domain via a pulling mechanism, giving rise to the open, high-affinity form of integrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Alonso <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Luo <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>In order to attach to integrin ligands and migrate, primary T lymphocytes require stimulus from a chemoattractant such as a chemokine. However, for preactivated T lymphoblasts, LFA-1-mediated binding to an ICAM-1-expressing surface is sufficient to cause cell polarization and migration without the need for added chemokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Dustin <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Smith <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). Previously we have shown that a &#x02018;focal zone' containing high-affinity 24&#x0002b; LFA-1 is located in the mid-cell region of the polarized T lymphocyte and influences the speed of migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Smith <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). To date, little is known of the characteristics of LFA-1 expressed at the leading edge of migrating T lymphocytes. To investigate the nature of these adhesions and compare them with LFA-1 in the focal zone, we have made use of two well-described mAbs, KIM127 and 24, as probes for intermediate- and high-affinity LFA-1. We find that they detect these two forms of active LFA-1 in distinct regions of the migrating cell.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Expression of LFA-1 activation epitopes KIM127 and 24 on T cells</title><p>A comparison was made of the expression patterns of LFA-1 activation epitopes recognized by mAbs KIM127 and 24 on T cells migrating on the LFA-1 ligand ICAM-1. Both freshly derived primary T lymphocytes and cultured T lymphoblasts, that are referred to in this study as T cells, were investigated. When analyzed by flow cytometry, the majority of T cells expressed both epitopes (60&#x02013;95&#x00025;; <italic>n</italic>=10), whereas a lower percentage of freshly derived T lymphocytes expressed the epitopes (10&#x02013;40&#x00025;; <italic>n</italic>=4). These percentages correlated with the proportions of cells able to attach to immobilized ICAM-1 (data not shown). Thus, the cells that attach and migrate represent pre-existing subsets on which LFA-1 displays activation epitopes.</p><p>The next step was to compare the distribution of the LFA-1 activation epitopes on T cells that were allowed to migrate before fixation and subsequent immunostaining. MAb 24&#x0002b; LFA-1 was restricted to the mid-cell focal zone both for unstimulated, cultured T cells as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Smith <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>) and primary T lymphocytes that had been stimulated with the chemokine SDF-1 (CXCL12) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). In contrast, mAb KIM127 labelled LFA-1 throughout the lamellar region, as well as intensely labelling the focal zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). Therefore, the extended intermediate-affinity form of LFA-1 that expresses the KIM127, but not 24, epitope is localized to the spreading lamella of the T cell, whereas high-affinity LFA-1 that expresses both epitopes is restricted to the focal zone. The distribution patterns of LFA-1 epitopes show that these two conformations of active LFA-1 have distinct locations on the migrating T cell.</p><p>As well as acting as activation reporters, both mAb 24 and KIM127 can stabilize the active forms of LFA-1 that they recognize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Dransfield <italic>et al</italic>, 1992a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Robinson <italic>et al</italic>, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Smith <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Nishida <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). When T cells were exposed to mAb KIM127 during migration, KIM127&#x0002b; LFA-1 attachments (red) to ICAM-1 were formed at the leading edge (see asterisks). As the T cell lamellae extended and made further attachments, KIM127&#x0002b; staining increased and the T cell rapidly stopped translocating forward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Video 1</xref>). When the KIM127&#x0002b; adhesions were stabilized to a certain level around one leading edge, another lamellipodial protrusion appeared that was in turn stabilized by making new KIM127&#x0002b; attachments. Eventually when the leading edge membranes could no longer move in any direction, the cell reversed its polarity and the process was repeated until the T cell was unable to make any new KIM 127&#x0002b; attachments.</p><p>By comparison, when T cells were exposed to mAb 24 during migration, 24&#x0002b; LFA-1 (green) was focused not at the leading edge but in the focal zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). Over time the focal zone extended forward as the number of new 24&#x0002b; attachments increased. Of note is the observation that KIM127 does not have access to its epitope in the focal zone area as might be expected. However, if the migrating cell is subsequently fixed and then stained for KIM127, the epitope is detected in the focal zone in keeping with the pattern of immunostaining shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref> (data not shown). There may be a lack of access of KIM127 in the focal zone region because of the positioning of the epitope on LFA-1 or because packing of LFA-1 molecules in this region interferes with mAb binding.</p><p>To investigate the formation of KIM127&#x0002b; adhesions in more detail, we carried out a two-stage experiment focusing on the interface with ICAM-1. T cells were allowed to migrate in an excess amount of KIM127-Alexa488 (green) to label the available adhesions. Unbound mAb was then washed out, and, to capture the adhesions formed subsequently, KIM127-Alexa546 (red) was added while the cells were being fixed. Under these conditions, KIM127&#x0002b; adhesions (red) were only observed at the leading edge confirming that new KIM127&#x0002b; adhesions form in this location and are stabilized by the mAb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>). This stabilizing effect then causes the unattached leading edge of the T cell to move in another direction over pre-existing stabilized LFA-1 adhesions to form new ones.</p><p>We next used interference reflection microscopy (IRM) to focus on the interface between LFA-1 on migrating T cells and ICAM-1 at the leading edge following addition of KIM127. At 0 s the T cell migrates in one direction, with its leading edge indicated by an arrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Video 2</xref>). After 30 s of exposure to KIM127, LFA-1 at the leading edge has become stabilized. The LFA-1 attachment points are seen as dark contrast regions and a new leading edge moves the cell in another direction. At 70 s, the cell changes direction again as the second leading edge becomes stabilized. Finally at 130 s the LFA-1 adhesions are stabilized all around the cell and it has come to a halt. We conclude that mAb KIM127 prevents turnover of LFA-1/ICAM-1 attachments through its ability to stabilize LFA-1 adhesions at the leading edge. Addition of mAb 24 has no effect on the leading edge (data not shown).</p><p>In contrast to both the 24&#x0002b; and KIM127&#x0002b; adhesions, the majority of which are restricted to LFA-1 in contact with ICAM-1, total LFA-1 was distributed over the entire cell surface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). The lamella at the leading edge displayed a lower level of LFA-1 compared with the focal zone and the uropod at the rear as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Smith <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Therefore, for T cells migrating on ICAM-1, the presence of mAbs recognizing activation epitopes causes build up of LFA-1 adhesions at the leading edge for KIM127, and at the focal zone, for 24.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>A role for intermediate-affinity LFA-1 in random T cell migration and chemotaxis</title><p>As mAbs 24 and KIM127 labelled distinct LFA-1 conformations in different locations when T cells were migrating on ICAM-1, we asked whether the way in which these mAbs affected migration could provide information about the differing roles of the two forms of LFA-1. Non-blocking anti-LFA-1 mAb YTH 81.5 had no effect, but KIM127 caused a 63&#x000b1;4&#x00025; reduction in speed of migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>) by preventing the translocation of individual T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>). In contrast, there was no significant alteration in cell speed after the addition of 24 for the initial 10-min period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A and B</xref>), but longer exposure gradually resulted in reduced migration (data not shown). To recreate more closely a potential <italic>in vivo</italic> situation, the effect of these mAbs on T cell migration through ICAM-1-coated filters in response to chemokine SDF-1 was tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>). SDF-1-induced migration was inhibited 96.4&#x000b1;0.7&#x00025; by KIM127, 45.7&#x000b1;1.0&#x00025; by 24 and was unaffected by YTH 81.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p>Confocal microscopy was used to observe T cells migrating on TNF-&#x003b1;-activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) following exposure to fluorescently labelled KIM127 or 24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Videos 3A and B</xref>). The cells that bound KIM127 failed to translocate, showing that KIM127 effectively inhibited turnover of LFA-1 adhesions to the endothelial cell surface. In contrast, mAb 24 stabilized only the mid-cell focal zone LFA-1, leaving the leading edge free to make fresh attachments and move forward. In fact the strength of this motility was sufficient to overcome the 24-stabilized LFA-1 adhesions, a proportion of which were left behind on the endothelium (see arrows). These results further underline the importance of intermediate-affinity KIM127&#x0002b; LFA-1 in making adhesions at the front of the cell and show that this LFA-1 controls the ability of T cells to migrate.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>KIM127&#x0002b; LFA-1 at the T cell leading edge is linked to <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-actinin-1</title><p>Given the dependence of LFA-1-mediated migration on reorganization of the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Porter <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Smith <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>) and the dramatic effect of KIM127 on T cell migration, an issue was how intermediate-affinity LFA-1 might be linked into the cytoskeleton. Pavalko and co-workers have demonstrated binding of the neutrophil &#x003b2;2 integrin subunit to both talin and &#x003b1;-actinin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Sampath <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>). As the focal zone LFA-1 is associated with talin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Smith <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>), we explored whether &#x003b1;-actinin-1 might be associated with KIM127&#x0002b; LFA-1. The T cell line HSB-2 was transfected with &#x003b1;-actinin-1&#x02013;GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Guvakova <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>) and the migrating cells exposed to mAb KIM127 while being fixed so that the mAb would label the newest adhesions. &#x003b1;-Actinin-1 was chiefly localized at the leading edge of the cell (green), overlapping with KIM127&#x0002b; LFA-1 (red) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). Quantification of the expression levels confirmed that the highest levels of both molecules were at the leading edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>). When viewed as a vertical slice along the <italic>y</italic>-axis, it was apparent that colocalized KIM127&#x0002b; LFA-1 and &#x003b1;-actinin-1 were not restricted to the interface with ICAM-1, but could also be found on non-attached membrane at the front of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>). As a control, GFP transfected into T cells was evenly distributed, indicating that the &#x003b1;-actinin&#x02013;GFP pattern did not simply represent the volume occupied by ruffled membranes (data not shown).</p><p>Further evidence for an association between LFA-1 and &#x003b1;-actinin-1 was sought by co-immunoprecipitation of T cell proteins using mAbs KIM127 and 24, pan-LFA-1 mAb 38 and an isotype control mAb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C</xref>). &#x003b1;-Actinin-1 co-immunoprecipitated with KIM127&#x0002b; and 38&#x0002b; LFA-1, whereas the co-immunoprecipitation of &#x003b1;-actinin-1 with 24&#x0002b; LFA-1 was at background levels (top panel). Loading control lanes for the LFA-1 &#x003b1;L subunit and &#x003b1;-actinin-1 are shown in the bottom panels. Using densitometry, we estimated that mAbs KIM127 and 38, but not mAb 24 or control mAb, immunoprecipitated 0.45&#x000b1;0.1&#x00025; of total &#x003b1;-actinin-1 (<italic>n</italic>=3). The &#x003b1;-actinin-1 associated with LFA-1 therefore represents a small but distinctive subpopulation of this cytoskeleton-associated protein. Together, these results provide evidence that intermediate-affinity LFA-1 on T cells is associated with &#x003b1;-actinin-1 at the leading edge.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>T cell migration on ICAM-1 requires <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-actinin-1</title><p>We asked whether &#x003b1;-actinin-1 was required for T cell migration and also in the step before migration that involves cell attachment from suspension onto immobilized ICAM-1. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) directed against &#x003b1;-actinin-1 was transfected into the HSB-2 T cell line, resulting in a 60&#x00025; knockdown after 48 h (see arrow), but with no effect on talin expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>). The decreased level of &#x003b1;-actinin-1 did not impede T cell attachment and, in fact, caused a 35&#x000b1;5&#x00025; increase in the level of adhesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B</xref>). However, when migration on ICAM-1 was assessed, &#x003b1;-actinin-1-knockdown T cells showed a 53&#x000b1;5&#x00025; reduction in speed and a decreased ability of individual cells to translocate compared with control siRNA-transfected or untransfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). These results are in contrast to knockdown of talin by 40&#x00025; that produced a corresponding decrease in HSB-2 T cell attachment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>), suggesting a key role for talin, and not &#x003b1;-actinin-1, in this step. Therefore &#x003b1;-actinin-1 has no role in the initial attachment to ICAM-1, but does have a major impact on the ability of the T cells to migrate.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>&#x003b1;-Actinin-1 links to the actin cytoskeleton during T cell migration</title><p>To establish whether &#x003b1;-actinin-1 was linked to the actin cytoskeleton, we transfected HSB-2 T cells with &#x003b1;-actinin&#x02013;GFP (green) and detected F-actin with phalloidin&#x02013;Alexa546 (red). There was overlap at the leading edge between the highest cellular levels of &#x003b1;-actinin-1 and F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7A</xref>). Next, T cells were transfected with an &#x003b1;-actinin-1 construct (&#x003b1;-actinin&#x02013;GFP), a second &#x003b1;-actinin-1 construct lacking the actin-binding domain (&#x00394;N-actinin&#x02013;GFP) or GFP as a control. The T cells expressing &#x00394;N-actinin&#x02013;GFP showed a 75&#x000b1;9&#x00025; decrease in speed compared with &#x003b1;-actinin&#x02013;GFP and control GFP-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7B</xref>).

Therefore colocalization of &#x003b1;-actinin-1 and F-actin at the leading edge, as well as the effect of the &#x003b1;-actinin-1 construct lacking the actin-binding domain, indicated the critical role played by &#x003b1;-actinin-1 linkage to the actin cytoskeleton in T cell morphology and migration.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>&#x003b1;-Actinin-1 binding to the LFA-1 <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>2 subunit is necessary for T cell migration</title><p>The previous experiments showed that &#x003b1;-actinin-1 interacting with F-actin at the leading edge was required for successful T cell migration and that a sub-population of &#x003b1;-actinin-1 is associated with KIM127&#x0002b; LFA-1. A question was whether the LFA-1/&#x003b1;-actinin-1 association was direct and whether interfering with it would alter aspects of migration that were also altered by manipulating &#x003b1;-actinin-1 itself. To investigate the interaction between LFA-1 and &#x003b1;-actinin-1, we synthesized a cell-permeable peptide corresponding to the &#x003b1;-actinin-1-binding site (H<sup>728</sup>&#x02013;S<sup>745</sup>) (&#x003b2;2-actinin peptide) on the LFA-1 &#x003b2;2 subunit cytoplasmic tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Pavalko and LaRoche, 1993</xref>).

When viewed by real-time low-light microscopy, &#x003b2;2-actinin peptide-treated cells were attached but exhibited dynamic membrane activity, with projections extending and retracting around the perimeter of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8C</xref>). Therefore, the failure to migrate was not due to an inability to generate membrane protrusions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Video 4A</xref>).

In contrast, the &#x003b2;2-actinin peptide-treated T cells showed only the dark close contact area, with little evidence for membranes making new contacts over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Figure 9A</xref>).

This newly identified sequence incorporates the &#x003b1;-actinin-1-binding site and raises the possibility that the &#x003b2; subunit might bind &#x003b1;-actinin-1 and talin sequentially. Our previous results showed that LFA-1 interacted with talin in the mid-cell focal zone region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Smith <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). We therefore used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to ask first whether we could detect any close contact between LFA-1 and &#x003b1;-actinin-1 in the lamella, focal zone or uropod regions on migrating T cells and, secondly, whether the region of the &#x003b2;2 cytoplasmic tail covered by the &#x003b2;2-actinin peptide served as the binding site for &#x003b1;-actinin-1 in the migrating cell.</p><p>Acceptor depletion FRET (adFRET) is a variation of the FRET technique, where an increase in donor signal following photobleaching of acceptor indicates that FRET had been occurring before the photobleaching step, but was quenched by the acceptor of donor fluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Di <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). We asked whether an adFRET signal could be detected between LFA-1 containing a GFP-tagged &#x003b2;2 subunit and endogenous &#x003b1;-actinin-1 labelled with Alexa546-conjugated anti-&#x003b1;-actinin-1 mAb. GFP&#x02013;LFA-1 displayed a positive FRET signal, with &#x003b1;-actinin-1 at the leading edge of the HSB-2 T cells that was not detected either in the focal zone or the uropod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f11">Figure 11A</xref>). This result indicates that LFA-1 is within 1&#x02013;10 nm of &#x003b1;-actinin-1 at the leading edge, but not in the other two compartments of the migrating cell.</p><p>To further confirm that the &#x003b2;2-actinin peptide blocked LFA-1 binding to &#x003b1;-actinin-1 at the front of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Pavalko and LaRoche, 1993</xref>), we tested its effect on the adFRET signal.

The &#x003b2;2-actinin peptide was found to abrogate the FRET signal that was otherwise detectable in both untreated or control peptide-treated T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f11">Figure 11B</xref>). These observations provide additional evidence that LFA-1 at the leading edge of the T cell migrating on ICAM-1 is directly engaged with &#x003b1;-actinin-1, and that the sequence on the &#x003b2;2 subunit (H<sup>723</sup>&#x02013;S<sup>742</sup>) covered by the &#x003b2;2-actinin peptide is where this interaction occurs.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study we show that intermediate-affinity LFA-1 is expressed throughout the lamella of T cells migrating on ICAM-1 randomly or in response to a chemokine. These LFA-1 adhesions are characterized by expression of the KIM127 epitope, but not the 24 epitope, and are initiated at the leading edge. Exposure of T cells to mAb KIM127 during migration stabilizes the LFA-1 adhesions and effectively brings the cell to a halt, showing that intermediate-affinity LFA-1 plays a dominant role in T cell migration. Previous IRM studies using T cells migrating on ICAM-1 embedded in a lipid bilayer indicate that the LFA-1 found in this zone can comprise up to 80&#x00025; of the contact with ligand ICAM-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Smith <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p><p>&#x003b1;-Actinin-1 has a number of functions in migrating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Otey and Carpen, 2004</xref>). By using siRNA knockdown and competitive inhibition with a mutated &#x003b1;-actinin-1 construct, we show that its ability to bind to actin is essential for T cell migration. The treated T cells remain attached to ICAM-1 in a talin-dependent manner, but fail to project membranes or spread. This is in keeping with a role for &#x003b1;-actinin-1 as an actin-bundling protein, a major function in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Otey and Carpen, 2004</xref>).</p><p>We have however focused on the subset of &#x003b1;-actinin-1 that binds to LFA-1 and show by colocalization and immunoprecipitation experiments that KIM127-expressing LFA-1 associates with &#x003b1;-actinin-1. A link between the &#x003b2; subunit of &#x003b2;1, &#x003b2;2 and &#x003b2;3 integrins and &#x003b1;-actinin-1 has been documented previously and the binding sequence identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Pavalko and LaRoche, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Otey and Carpen, 2004</xref>). The structure of the site on the &#x003b2;1 integrin cytoplasmic tail where &#x003b1;-actinin-1 binds has been determined and confirms the importance of this sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Kelly and Taylor, 2005</xref>).</p><p>We show in several ways that binding of KIM127&#x0002b; LFA-1 to &#x003b1;-actinin-1 has functional importance for T cell migration. T cells fail to migrate following knockdown of &#x003b1;-actinin-1 or more specific targeting of the binding site on the &#x003b2;2 subunit for &#x003b1;-actinin-1 (H<sup>723</sup>&#x02013;S<sup>742</sup>) with a peptide. FRET experiments revealed that this interaction occurs at the leading edge of the migrating T cell. Where LFA-1 binding to &#x003b1;-actinin-1 is prevented, the cells fail to attach and spread, although the T cell membrane continues to protrude. IRM images show reduced lamellipodial attachments in the presence of the LFA-1/&#x003b1;-actinin-1-blocking peptide. A direct functional link between KIM127&#x0002b; LFA-1 and &#x003b1;-actinin-1 is provided by showing that the blocking peptide can disrupt the KIM127-stabilized adhesions. Thus, intermediate-affinity LFA-1 attachment to &#x003b1;-actinin-1 either generates or stabilizes LFA-1 adhesions that support spreading at the leading edge of the T cell. However, as the cells are more highly adherent when &#x003b1;-actinin-1 is knocked down, it is possible that the protein is needed for the turnover of established adhesions.</p><p>In fibroblasts, &#x003b1;-actinin-1 is present at the leading edge of the cell but not included in nascent adhesions containing small integrin clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Laukaitis <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">von Wichert <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Wiseman <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). When &#x003b1;-actinin-1 is incorporated into these adhesions, a more mature focal complex is formed that aids the generation of force necessary for spreading and subsequent migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">von Wichert <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). This is in keeping with the idea that forward membrane protrusion is dependent upon turnover of adhesions at the leading edge to support strong propulsive forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Beningo <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>). Further investigation of events at the leading edge of T cells is needed to decide how close the parallels are with the spreading dynamics of fibroblasts.</p><p>Confocal and IRM images show that lamellar LFA-1 expressing the KIM127 epitope is in contact with ICAM-1. However, KIM127&#x0002b; LFA-1 is also observed on the apical surface at the leading edge under conditions of rapid fixing of the T cells. A possibility is that KIM127&#x0002b; LFA-1 might be released onto the membrane, potentially from intracellular vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Fabbri <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Another option is that there may be turnover and reuse of KIM127&#x0002b; LFA-1/&#x003b1;-actinin-1 adhesions during spreading. Small mobile complexes of &#x003b2;1 integrin and &#x003b1;-actinin-1 are detected on non-attached membranes of fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Wiseman <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Another issue is whether the extended conformation of LFA-1 characterized by KIM127 expression is caused by association with &#x003b1;-actinin-1. We find that neither knockdown of &#x003b1;-actinin-1 (or talin) nor incubation with the &#x003b2;2-actinin peptide alters KIM127 expression on migrating T cells, suggesting that &#x003b1;-actinin-1 binds to &#x003b2;2 integrin as a secondary event following integrin activation (data not shown). These findings concur with those of Pavalko and co-workers who postulated that when neutrophils were stimulated, a conformational change occurs on the &#x003b2;2 subunit, revealing the &#x003b1;-actinin-1-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Sampath <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>). This sequence of events is also in agreement with the results of Kinashi and co-workers who have evidence that LFA-1 activation through the Rap1 GTPase pathway induces KIM127&#x0002b; LFA-1. Active Rap1V12 promotes KIM127 expression while dominant negative Rap1N17 blocks the expression induced by chemokine (T Kinashi, personal communication). Together, the data indicate that binding of LFA-1 to &#x003b1;-actinin-1 is secondary to its conversion from a bent to an extended conformation exposing the KIM127 epitope.</p><p>Intermediate-affinity LFA-1 is expressed at the leading edge of the cell and bound to &#x003b1;-actinin-1, whereas high-affinity LFA-1 bound to talin is located in the mid-cell focal zone (this study; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Smith <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). The integrin &#x003b2; subunit shares a well-defined binding site on the talin FERM domain with PIPK1&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">de Pereda <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Now a second talin site on the &#x003b2; subunit has been mapped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Wegener <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>), which overlaps the &#x003b1;-actinin-1-binding sequence (H<sup>723</sup>&#x02013;S<sup>742</sup>) on the LFA-1 &#x003b2;2 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Pavalko and LaRoche, 1993</xref>). We made use of this sequence to make the &#x003b2;2-actinin peptide and confirmed that it is used for &#x003b1;-actinin-1 binding by means of affinity chromatography and also FRET analysis, showing that the peptide interferes with the signal between LFA-1 and &#x003b1;-actinin-1. Therefore, this site on the &#x003b2;2 subunit may be used both by &#x003b1;-actinin-1, talin and potentially other cytoplasmic proteins, and there may be competition for occupancy. Pavalko and co-workers have suggested that the &#x003b2;2 subunit undergoes alternate cytoskeletal connections to talin and &#x003b1;-actinin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Sampath <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>). Using immunoprecipitation, they found that the neutrophil &#x003b2;2 integrin cytoplasmic tail was associated first with talin, but following neutrophil stimulation, talin binding was lost due to calpain cleavage and an &#x003b1;-actinin-1-binding site was revealed. There is however no information yet as to whether LFA-1 exchanges &#x003b1;-actinin-1 for talin or vice versa as the T cell migrates. It is also possible that other cytoskeletal proteins might be involved. For example, vinculin contains a binding site used by both talin and &#x003b1;-actinin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Kelly <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). As &#x003b1;-actinin-1 and talin are most highly concentrated in distinct compartments, it may be this spatial arrangement that determines the specific LFA-1 conformation associated with each cytoskeletal protein.</p><p>Insight into how the two active forms of LFA-1 function together to enable T cell migration comes from the stabilizing effect of the conformation-specific mAbs 24 and KIM127. The high-affinity 24&#x0002b; focal zone LFA-1 provides adhesive stability by making firm attachments in the mid-cell region. Such anchoring would support the intermediate-affinity KIM127&#x0002b; LFA-1, making more dynamic attachments, while the T cell scans a DC cell surface for antigen or an endothelial surface for an exit point through the vascular endothelium. Such a division of roles is also suggested by the behavior of neutrophils migrating through endothelium, where the leading edge of the neutrophil penetrates the cell layer leaving high levels of LFA-1 in a ring-like structure at the trailing edge on the endothelial surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Shaw <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p><p>It is of interest that expression of intermediate-affinity LFA-1 at the leading edge of the T cell differs from migrating endothelial cells that display high-affinity &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 in this location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Kiosses <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>). Such an arrangement of high-affinity integrin at the leading edge might not be suitable for a fast moving T cell that needs to turn over membrane attachments rapidly, but might benefit a slower moving cell by allowing it to make firm contact with its surroundings as it adjusts its position within a particular tissue.</p><p>In summary, we have used mAbs specific for conformational epitopes as probes for intermediate- and high-affinity LFA-1 on migrating T cells. This approach has revealed for the first time that these two forms of active LFA-1 are expressed in two different regions of the migrating cell where they are associated with distinct cytoskeletal proteins and perform separate roles. These conformers of LFA-1 are also observed on T cells migrating on two other LFA-1 ligands, ICAM-2 and ICAM-3 (data not shown), and also on endothelial cells, indicating that they are also relevant in a more physiological context. The distinctive cellular locations for different forms of active LFA-1 would not be predicted from the total LFA-1 pattern that shows low-level expression throughout the lamellar region, with much higher levels in the focal zone and the projecting uropod (this study; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Smith <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). This study highlights the flexibility of integrins as receptors in terms of their ability to modulate their affinity in accordance with function and independently of expression on the cell membrane.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Antibodies and reagents</title><p>The following mAbs were used in this study: KIM127 (CD18 activation reporter) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Robinson <italic>et al</italic>, 1992</xref>); YTH81.5 (CD11a non-function blocker) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Smith <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>); 38 (CD11a function blocker) and 24 (CD18 integrin activation reporter) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Dransfield <italic>et al</italic>, 1992a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Hogg <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>) produced at Cancer Research UK; BM-75.2 (&#x003b1;-actinin-1), 8d4 (talin), hVIN-1 (vinculin) and DM 1A (&#x003b1;-tubulin) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, UK; AlexaFluor546&#x02013;phalloidin, AlexaFluor488- and AlexaFluor546-goat anti-mouse IgG were from Invitrogen, Paisley, UK; AlexaFluor488 and AlexaFluor546 fluorochrome kits were from Invitrogen and labelling carried out as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Smith <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p><p>The peptides were synthesized by Protein and Peptide Chemistry, Cancer Research UK, and were a 19-mer (HLSDLREYRRFEKEKLKSC) comprising the &#x003b2;2 subunit cytoplasmic sequence containing the &#x003b1;-actinin-1-binding site (&#x003b2;2-actinin peptide), as well as control scrambled 19-mer peptide (control peptide; KYEHRFELRLKSELDSKRC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Pavalko and LaRoche, 1993</xref>).
