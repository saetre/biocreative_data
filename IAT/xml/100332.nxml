Previously, we reported on the interactions among these proteins using baculovirus and two- and three-hybrid yeast systems. To test for interactions involving XRCC3 and Rad51C, stable human cell lines have been isolated that express (His)<sub>6</sub>-tagged versions of XRCC3 or Rad51C. Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding experiments demonstrate that XRCC3 and Rad51C interact in human cells. In addition, we find that Rad51C, but not XRCC3, interacts directly or indirectly with Rad51B, Rad51D and XRCC2. These results argue that there are at least two complexes of Rad51 paralogs in human cells (Rad51C&#x02013;XRCC3 and Rad51B&#x02013;Rad51C&#x02013;Rad51D&#x02013;XRCC2), both containing Rad51C. Moreover, Rad51 is not found in these complexes. X-ray treatment did not alter either the level of any Rad51 paralog or the observed interactions between paralogs. However, the endogenous level of Rad51C is moderately elevated in the XRCC3-overexpressing cell line, suggesting that dimerization between these proteins might help stabilize Rad51C.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The eukaryotic Rad51 protein is related to the prokaryotic RecA protein, and is the key protein facilitating both mitotic and meiotic homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c1">1</xref>). In addition to Rad51 and the closely related meiotic DMC1 protein, there are five Rad51-related proteins (or paralogs) in human cells: XRCC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c4">4</xref>), XRCC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c6">6</xref>), Rad51B&#x0002f;Rad51L1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c9">9</xref>), Rad51C&#x0002f;Rad51L2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c10">10</xref>) and Rad51D&#x0002f;Rad51L3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c12">12</xref>). These Rad51 paralogs share 20&#x02013;30&#x00025; sequence identity with Rad51 and with each other, and probably arose by gene duplication, followed by the development of new functions (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c15">15</xref>). The Rad51 paralogs were first implicated in homologous recombinational repair (HRR) on the basis of their sequence similarity to Rad51. In addition, there is now extensive evidence for an important role in HRR from analyses with mutations in hamster and chicken DT40 cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c18">18</xref>). To date, the precise functions of the set of five Rad51 paralogs in vertebrate cells have not been determined.</p><p>In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> there are only two Rad51 paralogs (Rad55 and Rad57). These proteins form a heterodimer that stimulates Rad51-mediated strand-exchange activity by facilitating Rad51&#x02019;s displacement of RPA from single-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c19">19</xref>). As there are several similarities between the Rad51 paralogs in yeast and in vertebrate cells, it is reasonable to expect that some or all of the mammalian Rad51 paralogs might perform an analogous function. As with the yeast paralogs, each of the human Rad51 paralogs interacts with other paralogs, but not with itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c20">20</xref>). Several studies argue that the vertebrate Rad51 paralogs may function as Rad51 accessory factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c23">23</xref>). Several of the human Rad51 paralogs have been purified, with the goal of determining their function(s). The Rad51D protein has both single-strand DNA binding and DNA-stimulated ATPase activities, and interacts with XRCC2 <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c21">21</xref>). The purified XRCC3&#x0002f;Rad51C heterodimer also binds to single-stranded DNA and forms networks of protein and DNA as seen by electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c23">23</xref>). This heterodimer was also reported to have homologous pairing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c24">24</xref>).</p><p>Here we report studies of the physical interactions of the Rad51 paralogs in human cells, as a follow-up to our findings in the yeast two-hybrid and baculovirus systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c20">20</xref>). Protein extracts of human lymphoblastoid cell lines expressing tagged versions of XRCC3 and Rad51C were used to pull down these recombinant proteins and to identify interactions with other Rad51 paralogs. We also examined whether DNA damage affected the protein level and&#x0002f;or pattern of interactions of any of the Rad51 paralogs. Our results support the simultaneous existence of at least two complexes of Rad51 paralogs in human cells, both containing Rad51C, but only one containing XRCC3.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture and DNA transfections</title><p>TK6 and WTK1 are human lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from the same progenitor cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c25">25</xref>).

We therefore used the following procedure, which avoided this problem. Immunoprecipitation of endogenous Rad51C protein was carried out using MagnaBind goat anti-mouse IgG magnetic beads (Pierce Chemical). A 200 &#x000b5;l aliquot of bead suspension was added to 1 ml native protein lysis buffer containing either &#x0223c;0.5 &#x000b5;g of monoclonal mouse anti-Rad51C antibody or &#x0223c;0.5 &#x000b5;g of control antibody (mouse IgG, Santa Cruz Biotech.).

Proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore) and probed with specific antibodies.

Sung) or monoclonal mouse anti-Rad51C (1:3000; isolated in J. Albala&#x02019;s laboratory). For detection of Rad51B we used polyclonal rabbit anti-Rad51B antibodies 1918 or 1919 (1:600; isolated in J. Albala&#x02019;s laboratory). For detection of XRCC3 we used two different polyclonal rabbit anti-XRCC3 antibodies, one isolated against the whole protein (1:20 000; kindly provided by P.

For detection of Rad51D we used polyclonal rabbit anti-Rad51D antibody (1:1000; Novus Biologicals), and for detection of XRCC2 we used polyclonal rabbit anti-XRCC2 antibody (1:2000; kindly provided by P. Sung). Note that we found no evidence that any of the antibodies against specific Rad51 paralogs cross-reacted against any of the other Rad51 paralogs in our experiments, and each of the anti-Rad51 paralog antibodies used recognized a protein of the expected molecular weight.</p><p>To control for loading variation during western analyses, we normalized to the protein signals of either &#x003b2;-tubulin or the transcription factor QM. We used rabbit polyclonal anti-&#x003b2;-tubulin antibody (1:1000, H-235; Santa Cruz Biotech.) or rabbit polyclonal anti-QM antibody (1:3000, SC-798; Santa Cruz Biotech.). For the detection of hRad51 we used polyclonal rabbit anti-hRad51 antibody (1:3000, PC-130; Calbiochem) or monoclonal mouse anti-hRad51 antibody (1:1000, NB100-148; Novus Biologicals).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Isolation of human lymphoid cell lines overexpressing tagged XRCC3 and Rad51C</title><p>TK6 and WTK1 human cell lines overexpressing tagged XRCC3 and Rad51C, respectively, were isolated in order to characterize their <italic>in vivo</italic> protein interactions and to study the phenotypic effect of their overexpression. These (His)<sub>6</sub>-tagged proteins were used for interaction studies because their characterization gave much cleaner results than immunoprecipitation of the native proteins using polyclonal antibodies and because a monoclonal antibody against XRCC3 is not yet available. TK6 cells are human B-lymphoblasts derived from WIL-2 cells that express wild-type P53 (also referred to as Tp53) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c31">31</xref>). TK6 cells were transfected with pDS158 to ectopically express XRCC3-HA-(His)<sub>6</sub> &#x0005b;hence referred to as just XRCC3-(His)<sub>6</sub>&#x0005d; using the CMV promoter. The plasmid pDS158 has already been shown to complement an <italic>xrcc3</italic> mutation in a CHO cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c2">2</xref>). Several TK6 clones were isolated that overexpressed XRCC3-(His)<sub>6</sub> as determined by western blot. The stable transfectant having the highest level of XRCC3-(His)<sub>6</sub> expression was named TK6-XRCC3. The level of XRCC3-(His)<sub>6</sub> protein in TK6-XRCC3 cells was determined to be &#x0223c;10-fold higher than that of native XRCC3 protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf159f1">1</xref>A). We intended to generate TK6 cells overexpressing a similarly tagged recombinant Rad51C protein, but were unsuccessful in several attempts. We speculate that this result reflects either a cytotoxic or cytostatic function of elevated levels of Rad51C that is particularly evident in cells expressing wild-type P53. We were able to isolate stable Rad51C overexpressing clones from WTK1 cells, a sister cell line of TK6 that expresses homozygous mutant P53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c31">31</xref>). Western analysis indicated that the clone (WTK1-Rad51C) that appeared to express the highest level of recombinant Rad51C protein expressed Rad51C-(His)<sub>6</sub> at only &#x0223c;35&#x02013;50&#x00025; of the level of the native Rad51C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf159f1">1</xref>B).</p></sec><sec><title>Constitutive and X-ray-induced protein levels of Rad51 paralogs in human lymphoid cells</title><p>Before characterizing the patterns of interactions among the Rad51 paralogs and whether DNA damage affected these patterns, we wanted to make sure that each paralog was detectable in our cell lines and determine if DNA damage altered their protein levels. Relative protein expression levels for each of the Rad51 paralogs and for hRad51 were determined, before and after X-ray treatment, in the four human cell lines we used in this study (WTK1, WTK1-Rad51C, TK6 and TK6-XRCC3) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf159f2">2</xref>). Densitometry of signal intensities was corrected for loading, using the immunoblot signals for either &#x003b2;-tubulin or transcription factor QM. As each antibody used has a different strength of interaction, it is not possible to determine the actual amount of each paralog, nor make comparisons between the amounts of the different paralogs. The levels of the native Rad51 paralogs and of hRad51 do not differ between TK6 and WTK1 cells. The relative native protein levels of the different paralogs and of hRad51 did not vary between WTK1 and WTK1-Rad51C, or between TK6 and TK6-XRCC3, with one notable exception: TK6-XRCC3 cells appear to contain higher levels of the native Rad51C protein (&#x0223c;1.5-fold) than TK6 cells (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf159f1">1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf159f2">2</xref>B). Different antibodies against XRCC3 were used in the experiments depicted in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf159f1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf159f2">2</xref>. One polyclonal antibody (Novus, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf159f2">2</xref>) was made against a C-terminal peptide of XRCC3. While it recognizes the native protein well, it does not recognize the C-terminally tagged recombinant XRCC3 protein nearly as well as does the polyclonal antibody (from P. Sung; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf159f1">1</xref>) made against the complete XRCC3 protein. Therefore, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf159f1">1</xref> most accurately depicts the true level of XRCC3 overexpression.</p><p>In order to test whether any of the Rad51 paralogs were induced or suppressed by DNA damage, the relative amount of each paralog was measured in whole-cell extracts made 4 and 8 h post-irradiation with 10 Gy X-rays. To ensure that the X-irradiation stimulated the expression of a well-characterized damage-response protein, we monitored P53. For TK6 cells we detected an increase in P53 4 and 8 h post-irradiation, but no significant increase in the WTK1 background, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c30">30</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf159f2">2</xref>G). In contrast, there were no significant X-ray-induced changes in the expression of any of the native Rad51 paralogs. Minor differences seen within any single experiment may be attributed to slight differences in the amount of protein loaded onto the gels and&#x0002f;or in the amounts of the protein that were transferred onto the membrane, and were not reproducible. Thus, we conclude that X-irradiation failed to alter the level of any paralog. This experiment does not rule out small differences, for instance if they were much less than 2-fold. We did observe in two western blots that TK6-XRCC3 cells exposed to 10 Gy X-rays showed a decrease in the level of recombinant XRCC3 8 h post-irradiation; the reason for this decrease is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of recombinant Rad51C and XRCC3 on DNA damage-induced cell death</title><p>The cytotoxic response to X-rays was determined for two independently isolated WTK1-Rad51C cell lines (clones 1&#x02013;3 and clone 8). These results were compared with the parental WTK1 cell line and to two control cell lines that were stably transfected with the pcDNA3 vector that contains the empty neo-cassette. No differences were observed in the cytotoxic response to X-rays between these cell lines, suggesting that the modest increase in the expression of Rad51C was not of physiologic significance (data not shown). To test this further, we exposed WTK1-Rad51C cells and appropriate control cells to the inter-strand cross-linking agent MMC and also found no significant differences in survival. We also investigated the cytotoxic response of TK6-XRCC3 to MMC and found that the toxicity was very similar in TK6 cells and TK6-XRCC3 cells, but as this experiment was performed only once, this result is preliminary. Taken together, the ectopic expression of recombinant XRCC3 or Rad51C in TK6 or WTK1 cells does not appear to confer a change in the sensitivities to IR or MMC for the levels of overexpression that were achievable.</p></sec><sec><title>Protein associations of hRad51 paralogs in human cell lines expressing tagged proteins</title><p>To test for the interaction of XRCC3 and Rad51C in human cells, we used TK6-XRCC3 and WTK1-Rad51C cells. Each of the tagged proteins was pulled down from native cell extracts using Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x02013;NTA beads, and associated proteins were identified by western blotting. The experiments revealed the association of XRCC3 and Rad51C in extracts of both cell lines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf159f3">3</xref>A and B). In addition, we detected Rad51B, Rad51D and XRCC2 in Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> pull downs in WTK1-Rad51C extracts, but these proteins were not detected in Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> pull downs in TK6-XRCC3 extracts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf159f3">3</xref>C&#x02013;E). The failure to detect proteins other than Rad51C in the XRCC3 pull down cannot be attributed to differences in the native abundance of these proteins. Instead, it is likely that two complexes of these proteins are present in undamaged cells: one containing Rad51C and XRCC3, and another containing Rad51C, Rad51B, Rad51D and XRCC2. As pulling down Rad51C-(His)<sub>6</sub> did not pull down native Rad51C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf159f3">3</xref>A), and pulling down XRCC3-(His)<sub>6</sub> did not pull down native XRCC3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf159f3">3</xref>B), this experiment also demonstrates that neither Rad51C nor XRCC3 interacts with itself either directly or indirectly. Rad51 was not detected over background in either pull down experiment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf159f3">3</xref>F). Additional Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> pull-down experiments were carried out in the presence of DNase I or ethidium bromide to test whether the observed interactions required DNA (see Materials and Methods); these treatments did not alter the observed interactions, demonstrating that these associations do not require the presence of DNA (data not shown).</p><p>To test if DNA damage changed the protein interactions observed in untreated cells, the WTK1-Rad51C and TK6-XRCC3 cell lines were treated with 10 Gy X-rays. No difference in the pattern of protein interactions was observed following X-ray treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf159f4">4</xref>A). MMC treatment of TK6-XRCC3 cells did not modulate the interaction between recombinant XRCC3 and native Rad51C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf159f4">4</xref>B).</p></sec><sec><title>Co-immunoprecipitation of untagged Rad51C and the other Rad51 paralogs from TK6 cells</title><p>As we were not able to isolate a TK6 cell line stably overexpressing Rad51C, Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> pull-down experiments with Rad51C were done in the WTK1-derived cells (see above). To assess whether Rad51C showed the same pattern of interactions in both cell lines, native Rad51C was immunoprecipitated from TK6 cells, and western analysis used to determine which other proteins were associated with Rad51C. Rad51C was found to interact with each of the other Rad51 paralogs, but not with Rad51 itself (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf159f5">5</xref>), in agreement with the results of the Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> pull-down experiments using extracts of WTK1-Rad51C cells.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The five Rad51 paralogs are each essential for the normal functioning of HRR. In chicken cells these proteins are involved in the repair of double-strand breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c18">18</xref>), and the three mouse homologs that have been tested (Rad51B, Rad51D and XRCC2) are required for development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c34">34</xref>). In order to characterize these proteins in human cells, two closely related human lymphoblast cell lines (TK6 and WTK1) were used. TK6 cells are wild-type with regard to P53, while WTK1 cells constitutively expresses only a mutant form of P53 (Met 237 to Ile) and are impaired in undergoing apoptosis after ionizing radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c31">31</xref>). WTK1 cells manifest higher levels of homologous recombination and inter-homolog mitotic recombination, presumably due to the unusual P53 mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c37">37</xref>). In the present study, human cell lines overexpressing two of the Rad51 paralogs (XRCC3 and Rad51C) were engineered. It is unclear why no stable transfectants of TK6 cells overexpressing Rad51C could be isolated, but one possibility is that overexpression of this protein is deleterious to cells containing wild-type P53.</p><p>Previously, it was reported that overexpression of the human Rad51B protein in CHO cells caused a G<sub>1</sub> delay in untreated cells and an increased sensitivity to UV due to increased apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c38">38</xref>). However, we found no effect of Rad51C or XRCC3 overexpression on MMC or X-ray sensitivity. Their results might be explained by heterologous overexpression of a human protein in hamster cells, whereas our experiments were performed with human cells overexpressing human proteins. Our yeast two-hybrid experiments showed differences in the abilities of human and mouse Rad51D proteins to interact with human Rad51C, suggesting that heterologous expression of some paralogs might not have the same effect as homologous expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c20">20</xref>).</p><p>Our experiments show that radiation exposure does not appear to significantly change the level of any of the Rad51 paralogs, suggesting that none of the proteins are induced by double-strand breaks. It has been reported that <italic>RAD51B</italic> is transcriptionally induced by X-rays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c7">7</xref>), but we saw no evidence for induction of the Rad51B protein after exposure to X-rays. When comparing the TK6 parental and TK6-XRCC3 cell lines both with and without DNA damage, the level of native Rad51C protein is reproducibly higher (&#x0223c;1.5-fold) in TK6-XRCC3 cells, but the levels of Rad51B, Rad51D and XRCC2 are normal (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf159f2">2</xref>). Our favored explanation for this observation is that the higher level of the XRCC3 protein in TK6-XRCC3 cells helps stabilize specifically the Rad51C protein. This interpretation is consistent with our observation that XRCC3 is bound to Rad51C but is not associated with any of the other Rad51 paralogs (discussed below).</p><p>Previous work, from both our group and others, has shown that in the yeast two-hybrid and baculovirus systems each human Rad51 paralog has the ability to interact with one or more of the others. The previous reports on interactions among human Rad51 paralogs in human cells showed that in HeLa cells Rad51D interacts with XRCC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c21">21</xref>), and XRCC3 interacts with Rad51C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c23">23</xref>). Besides confirming that both of these interactions also occur in human lymphoblastoid cells (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf159f3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf159f5">5</xref>), we demonstrate that other specific interactions observed in yeast or insect cells are actually occurring amongst the native proteins in human cells. We found that Rad51C interacts directly or indirectly with Rad51B, Rad51D and XRCC2. Conversely and somewhat surprisingly, we did not observe any direct or indirect interactions between XRCC3 and Rad51B, Rad51D or XRCC2. It seems extremely unlikely that this lack of interaction is an artifact due to the tagged nature of the XRCC3 protein, as this same tagged protein has been found to complement the xrcc3 mutation in IRS1-SF cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c2">2</xref>). X-irradiation did not change any of the observed interactions.</p><p>Previously, we suggested that all of the paralogs might interact simultaneously in a single complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c20">20</xref>). This speculation was based on results obtained using human proteins in yeast two- and three-hybrid experiments and in baculovirus experiments. We have presented evidence that in both unirradiated and X-irradiated human cells, the paralogs do not appear to form one large complex. Instead, there seem to be at least two complexes, both of which contain Rad51C: an XRCC3&#x02013;Rad51C complex and a complex that probably contains Rad51B&#x02013;Rad51C&#x02013;Rad51D&#x02013;XRCC2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf159f6">6</xref>). Our Rad51C experiments involve direct isolation of Rad51C, by either Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> pull down or by immunoprecipitation, and western analysis to detect the presence of other Rad51 paralogs that might be present in the Rad51C protein complexes. Using these methods, we cannot determine if there was a single complex containing Rad51B&#x02013;Rad51C&#x02013;Rad51D&#x02013;XRCC2 or, instead, two different complexes: a Rad51B&#x02013;Rad51C heterodimer and a Rad51C&#x02013;Rad51D&#x02013;XRCC2 heterotrimer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf159f6">6</xref>A). Our experiments cannot distinguish between direct and indirect interactions. Therefore, the presence of the Rad51C&#x02013;Rad51D&#x02013;XRCC2 heterotrimer is inferred based on the evidence that Rad51C is associated with both Rad51D and XRCC2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf159f3">3</xref>), as well as results from both the yeast two- and three-hybrid and baculovirus systems indicating that Rad51C only interacts with XRCC2 when Rad51D is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c20">20</xref>). We therefore assume either that XRCC2 and Rad51C interact indirectly in human cells through their mutual interactions with Rad51D, or that they interact directly, but that Rad51D is required for this interaction, possibly by inducing a conformational change in either XRCC2 or Rad51C.</p><p>Three independent studies have found evidence that a heterotetramer containing Rad51B&#x02013;Rad51C&#x02013;Rad51D&#x02013;XRCC2 exists in some human cells lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c41">41</xref>). These studies have also independently found that the only Rad51 paralog with which XRCC3 interacts is Rad51C, and that Rad51C can interact with each of the other paralogs. Our results agree with these observations, suggesting that the Rad51 paralogs form similar protein complexes in various human cell lines. Although our results suggest a heterotrimer and&#x0002f;or heterotetramer, it is very possible that individual dimers, such as XRCC2&#x0002f;Rad51D and Rad51B&#x0002f;Rad51C, may be present simultaneously in human cells.</p><p>Although our current results from human cells are consistent with most of our previous yeast two- and three-hybrid and baculovirus experiments, there are a few cases in which the current results diverge. One example is the apparent lack of interaction between either XRCC3 or Rad51C with Rad51 in our human cell lines, even though Rad51 is easily detected in both TK6 and WTK1 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf159f2">2</xref>). In the yeast two-hybrid system, Rad51 interacts strongly with XRCC3 and weakly with Rad51C, and the weak interaction of Rad51 with Rad51C is enhanced by simultaneous overexpression of XRCC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c20">20</xref>). We also reported that both Rad51C and XRCC3 interact with Rad51 when the proteins are expressed in insect cells. In addition, the interaction of XRCC3 and Rad51 was seen in HeLa cells overexpressing recombinant XRCC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c2">2</xref>). The lack of an interaction in the current experiments might relate to the cell lines used, or might be due to these interactions being either very weak or transient. A similar conundrum exists in yeast for Rad51 and one of its paralogs, Rad55. While Rad55 interacts strongly with Rad51 in the yeast two-hybrid system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c342">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c43">43</xref>), the two proteins interact very weakly in biochemical experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c19">19</xref>).</p><p>Evidence presented here shows that in human cells XRCC3 and Rad51B are not in the same complex, although each can interact independently with Rad51C. This finding is in contradistinction to our yeast three-hybrid data, as the direct interaction between XRCC3 and Rad51C was enhanced by expression of Rad51B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c20">20</xref>). This difference may be reconciled by hypothesizing that in the yeast three-hybrid system the interaction between Rad51B and Rad51C changes the conformation of Rad51C, such that it can now more easily bind to XRCC3 in a type of exchange reaction. Alternatively, a temporary interaction between Rad51B and Rad51C might stabilize Rad51C, enabling more of this protein to interact independently with XRCC3. A third possibility is that the three-hybrid result was an artifact. In an unpublished yeast three-hybrid experiment, we also asked whether overexpression of Rad51C could act to bridge the interaction of XRCC3 and Rad51B, and we found that it could not. This result is consistent with our inability to see an indirect interaction between XRCC3 and Rad51B in human cells. Another difference from previous experiments involves evidence from the yeast three-hybrid system that Rad51B can interact with two molecules of Rad51C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c20">20</xref>). We see no evidence for this in these human cells; when we pull down recombinant Rad51C, we also pull down native Rad51B, but do not detect native Rad51C &#x0005b;i.e. we do not observe the Rad51C-(His)<sub>6</sub>&#x0002f;Rad51B&#x0002f;Rad51C heterotrimer&#x0005d;. This argues that the Rad51C&#x0002f;Rad51B&#x0002f;Rad51C heterotrimer is unlikely to exist in these human cell lines.</p><p>In summary, we identified at least two protein complexes, each containing Rad51 paralogs. An explicit demonstration of the functional importance of the Rad51 paralogs in human cells in recombinational repair awaits the development of human cell mutants in which one or more of the paralogs is either knocked out or functionally deficient. Evidence already exists that the human Rad51 paralogs can restore recombinational repair proficiency when the corresponding native protein has been lost in rodent and chicken cell mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf159c18">18</xref>). Our finding of at least two protein complexes, both containing Rad51C, suggests that there might be a type of hand-off or exchange reaction occurring between these complexes during recombinational repair in human cells.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf159f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Expression levels of recombinant proteins in stable transfectants of human cell lines.
