Early decisions, including motoneuron axon targeting, are orchestrated by a cohort of transcription factors that act together in a combinatorial manner.

The perdurance of these factors in late embryonic neurons is, however, indicative that they might also regulate additional aspects of neuron development, including the acquisition of electrical properties.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>To test the hypothesis that a combinatorial code transcription factor is also able to influence the acquisition of electrical properties in embryonic neurons we utilized the molecular genetics of <italic>Drosophila </italic>to manipulate the expression of Eve in identified motoneurons. We show that increasing expression of this transcription factor, in two Eve-positive motoneurons (aCC and RP2), is indeed sufficient to affect the electrical properties of these neurons in early first instar larvae. Specifically, we observed a decrease in both the fast K<sup>+ </sup>conductance (I<sub>Kfast</sub>) and amplitude of quantal cholinergic synaptic input. We used charybdotoxin to pharmacologically separate the individual components of I<sub>Kfast </sub>to show that increased Eve specifically down regulates the Slowpoke (a BK Ca<sup>2+</sup>-gated potassium channel), but not Shal, component of this current.

Intrinsic factors will be determined by the clonal lineage of individual neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], while exposure to external factors, such as synaptic activity, glia-derived factors and sensory modifications, likely shape the final electrical phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Thus, the particular mix of individual conductances expressed by neurons is likely a product not only of regulated gene expression but also of activity-dependent mechanisms that together influence channel function through subcellular distribution, relative density and post-translational modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>A key question that remains to be resolved, however, is how much circuit tuning arises from genetic determination as opposed to activity-dependent mechanisms. Recent modeling studies indicate that extrinsic factors predominate given that indistinguishable network activity can arise from widely disparate combinations of individual conductances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, these analyses are based on neurons that are already components of functional networks. By comparison, in the early stages of their development, embryonic neurons are largely deprived of extrinsic factors such as synaptic activity and sensory feedback. It is in this relatively early phase of electrical development that genetic determination will likely predominate to ensure, at a minimum, the expression of a default set of ion channel proteins. Only after a neuron has the capability to contribute to a network can other, largely extrinsic factors, begin to shape the final mix of ion channels expressed.</p><p>A wealth of studies of motoneuron specification, in a range of animals from worms to mammals, has shown that subclass identity is dictated, in part, by a combinatorial code of transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. For example, in the <italic>Drosophila </italic>embryo, the approximately 36 motoneurons in each abdominal hemi-segment express a stereotypic mix of identified transcription factors that are evolutionarily conserved with mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Motoneurons that predominantly innervate ventral and lateral muscles express the LIM-homeodomain transcription factor genes <italic>islet </italic>and <italic>lim3 </italic>together with <italic>Hb9</italic>, while motoneurons that project to dorsal muscles express the transcription factor gene <italic>even-skipped </italic>(<italic>eve</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Given that motoneuron axon guidance is under combinatorial control of a set of transcription factors, this study addresses whether the acquisition of electrical properties, at least in early development, might be similarly influenced by these same regulatory proteins.</p><p>We used targeted gene expression to increase the level of Eve, in just two Eve-positive motoneurons (aCC and RP2), and show that this is sufficient to elicit reductions in both a voltage-gated K<sup>+ </sup>current and acetylcholine (ACh)-gated synaptic currents. We attribute the reduction in K<sup>+ </sup>currents to a reduction in the current carried by Slo. We identified binding sites for Eve using DNA adenine methyltransferase identification (DamID). Our analysis identified a discrete set of putative target genes, which includes those encoding for the voltage-gated K<sup>+ </sup>channel Slo and ligand-gated ACh nicotinic subunit nAcR&#x003b1;-96Aa. That Eve is able to transcriptionally repress these target genes is verified by quantitative PCR (QRT-PCR). Our results show that a transcription factor, known to be required for correct choice of axonal pathfinding, is also sufficient to influence the acquisition of electrical properties in neurons, indicating that both morphological and functional development in embryonic neurons are controlled by common regulatory mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Increased Eve alters electrical properties in motoneurons</title><p>The motoneurons aCC and RP2 express the transcription factor Eve, which is required for appropriate axon targeting during early embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This observation forms part of the body of evidence that underpins the hypothesis that a combinatorial code of transcription factor expression orchestrates axon pathfinding and target choice of motoneurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. It is notable, however, that <italic>eve </italic>expression can still be detected after these earlier processes have resolved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], indicating that it may also regulate additional facets of neuron development. One more obvious aspect of late neuronal development is the acquisition of electrical properties.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we manipulated the expression of <italic>eve </italic>in the motoneurons aCC and RP2 (using RN2-O GAL4) and used whole-cell patch recordings to determine the consequences. Our choice of motoneuron was guided by the fact that aCC/RP2 endogenously express <italic>eve </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and manipulation of its expression should, thus, result in altered electrophysiology if this transcription factor contributes to setting electrical properties in these neurons. Over-expression of <italic>eve</italic>, in aCC/RP2, is sufficient to perturb wild-type electrical properties. Of the voltage-gated conductances examined, only the peak fast K<sup>+ </sup>conductance (I<sub>Kfast</sub>) was significantly reduced (78.6 &#x000b1; 4.0 versus 62.3 &#x000b1; 8.4 pA/pF, measured at +45 mV, p &#x02264; 0.05), while I<sub>Kslow</sub>, I<sub>Na </sub>and I<sub>Ca </sub>were not affected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a,b</xref>). Analysis of current-voltage (IV) plots for I<sub>Kfast </sub>show no obvious change in activation, as might be expected if the reduction in peak amplitude of this current was due to a change in voltage-dependency of activation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>). Control recordings were made from RN2-O/+ (which are identical to the alternative controls of Canton-S wild type and RN2-O GAL4/UAS-GFP; ECG Pym and RA Baines, unpublished data).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Over-expression of <italic>eve </italic>in aCC/RP2 is sufficient to alter electrical properties. <bold>(A) </bold>Over-expression of <italic>eve </italic>in aCC/RP2 results in a decrease in peak conductance of I<sub>Kfast </sub>(78.6 &#x000b1; 4.0 versus 62.3 &#x000b1; 8.4 pA/pF, measured at +45 mV, p &#x02264; 0.05) and no significant change in I<sub>Na </sub>(-23.4 &#x000b1; 1.6 versus -21.4 &#x000b1; 2.2 pA/pF, -15 mV), I<sub>Ca </sub>(-15.7 &#x000b1; 1.6 versus -17.1 &#x000b1; 2.9 pA/pF, 0 mV) or I<sub>Kslow </sub>(48.3 &#x000b1; 3.5 versus 53.7 &#x000b1; 6.8 pA/pF, +45 mV). <bold>(B) </bold>Example voltage clamp recordings (examples shown from wild-type aCC/RP2) of the four major voltage-gated currents in aCC/RP2; I<sub>Na</sub>, I<sub>Ca</sub>, I<sub>Kfast </sub>(arrow shows current measured) and I<sub>Kslow </sub>(for a more detailed discussion of these conductances see [34]).

To determine which of these components is affected by over-expression of <italic>eve</italic>, we utilized charybdotoxin (ChTX), which is a selective blocker of Slo in both <italic>Drosophila </italic>neurons and muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In the presence of ChTX (200 nM), I<sub>Kfast </sub>in wild-type aCC/RP2 was reduced by 22% (87.9 &#x000b1; 4.6 versus 61.2 &#x000b1; 6.0 pA/pF, p &#x02264; 0.05; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c,d</xref>). Removal of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the influx of which is required to activate Slo, resulted in a similar reduction (36%; 55.8 &#x000b1; 3.2 pA/pF), consistent with ChTX blocking only the Slo-mediated component of I<sub>Kfast </sub>(data not shown). Following over-expression of <italic>eve</italic>, the addition of ChTX is unable to further reduce the magnitude of peak I<sub>Kfast </sub>(62.3 &#x000b1; 8.4 versus 65.4 &#x000b1; 4.8 pA/pF; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c,d</xref>). The inability of ChTX to affect I<sub>Kfast </sub>under these conditions is consistent with the reduction of this conductance, due to over-expression of <italic>eve</italic>, being due to a decrease in the current carried primarily by Slo and not by Shal.</p></sec><sec><title>Increased Eve alters action potential firing in motoneurons</title><p>To test how over-expression of <italic>eve </italic>might impact on functional output, we determined intrinsic membrane excitability (that is, ability to fire action potentials (APs)) by injection of constant current. Our prediction, based on the observed and specific change in I<sub>Kfast </sub>following over-expression of <italic>eve </italic>in aCC/RP2, was that these motoneurons would be more excitable. The membrane potential of individual aCC/RP2 neurons was first maintained at -60 mV by injection of hyperpolarizing current (normal resting membrane potential is -43.5 &#x000b1; 1.9 mV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]) and we then used injections of constant depolarizing current (10 pA/500 ms) to induce AP firing. Excitability was determined by counting APs fired. This measure shows that the change in I<sub>Kfast </sub>is indeed associated with a small but significant increase in excitability in aCC/RP2 (19.6 &#x000b1; 1.0 versus 24 &#x000b1; 1.6 APs, 10 pA/500 ms, p &#x02264; 0.05; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The membrane potentials induced by this current injection (measured in the presence of 1 mM tetrodotoxin (TTX) to eliminate AP firing) were not significantly different between the two conditions (-33 &#x000b1; 4 versus -36 &#x000b1; 2.5 mV, control versus experimental, p &#x0003e; 0.05, data not shown). Thus, there is no obvious change in input resistance that might account for the increased excitability due to depolarizing current injections. Addition of ChTX (200 nM), a specific blocker of I<sub>kslo</sub>, to wild-type aCC/RP2 is also sufficient to induce a comparable increase in membrane excitability (19.6 &#x000b1; 1.0 versus 22.5 &#x000b1; 0.9 APs, 10 pA/500 ms, p &#x02264; 0.05; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Over-expression of eve increases membrane excitability. <bold>(A) </bold>APs can be evoked in aCC/RP2 by injection of constant current (10 pA/500 ms, indicated by bar).

The most parsimonious explanation for this effect, given that expression of <italic>eve </italic>is entirely postsynaptic, is that of reduced postsynaptic sensitivity to ACh. Motoneurons of <italic>Drosophila </italic>first instar larvae receive entirely cholinergic synaptic excitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. To test this prediction, we measured spontaneous miniature (mini) synaptic currents, which are the result of action potential-independent release from presynaptic cholinergic interneurons (that is, the release that persists in the presence of 1 &#x003bc;M TTX). Analysis of minis shows a significant decrease in amplitude in aCC/RP2 in which <italic>eve </italic>is over-expressed compared to controls (8.32 &#x000b1; 0.26 versus 7.53 &#x000b1; 0.22, pA, p &#x02264; 0.05; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>).

To circumvent this, we used a temperature-sensitive <italic>eve </italic>allele (<italic>eve</italic><sup>1<italic>D</italic>19</sup>) previously used by to remove Eve function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].

We were unable to use homozygous <italic>eve</italic><sup>1<italic>D</italic>19 </sup>larvae as these fail to hatch at any temperature (RA Baines, personal observation).</p><p>Comparison of both I<sub>Kfast </sub>and mini amplitude in young second instars (approximately 18 h after hatching at 30&#x000b0;C or 30 h at 20&#x000b0;C) shows that both were increased in larvae that developed at 30&#x000b0;C (partial Eve knock-down) relative to those maintained at 20&#x000b0;C (wild-type Eve; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). By comparison, I<sub>Kslow</sub>, which was not affected by <italic>eve </italic>over-expression (see above), was unaffected by Eve knock-down. That I<sub>Kslow </sub>remains unchanged, together with the fact that cell capacitance was also unchanged (data not shown), serves to demonstrate that development of aCC/RP2 was not disproportionately influenced by developmental temperature. Examination of electrical properties in wild-type larvae similarly showed no temperature-dependent effects (RA Baines, unpublished data). Thus, we conclude that, whilst over-expression of <italic>eve </italic>is clearly sufficient to reduce I<sub>Kfast </sub>and quantal cholinergic currents, a partial removal of Eve results in the opposite phenotype, indicating that the level of Eve function is a critical determinant for the development of these two electrical properties in aCC/RP2.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Removal of Eve increases I<sub>Kfast </sub>and sensitivity to ACh. <bold>(A) </bold>Supression of Eve function, using the temperature-sensitive allele <italic>eve</italic><sup>1<italic>D</italic>19</sup>, results in an increase in I<sub>Kfast </sub>but no change in I<sub>Kslow </sub>(78.5 &#x000b1; 6.1 versus 96.8 &#x000b1; 4.6 pA, p &#x0003c; 0.05; see Materials and methods for details). <bold>(B) </bold>Removal of Eve function, through development at 30&#x000b0;C, is also sufficient to increase the amplitude of AP-independent quantal synaptic currents.

Note that the current amplitude in controls (20&#x000b0;C) is smaller in second instars than in first instars (compare Figure 3b), even though the aCC/RP2 neurons are greater in size.

Using tiling arrays that span the entire euchromatic genome (TD Southall, S Choksi, E de Wit, B van Steensel and AH Brand, unpublished data), our analysis identified 2,411 individual DamID peaks in the genome and 1,268 genes (possessing one or more peaks within 2 kb of their transcriptional unit) as potential direct targets of Eve. Using a web-based set of tools, GOToolbox [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], we performed statistical tests to determine Gene Ontology (GO) annotation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] enrichment on 819 members of our list with associated annotations.

For this to occur the constituent neurons must not only develop a specific pattern of dendritic branching and synaptic connectivity, but must also express a stereotyped mix of ion channel genes that, together, set membrane excitability. Previous work in <italic>Drosophila </italic>has shown that motoneuron axon pathfinding is determined by a combinatorial code of transcription factor expression, including Eve, Islet and Hb9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In the present study, we show that at least one of these transcription factors, pivotal for morphological development, is also sufficient to affect the acquisition of electrical properties. It is well established that cellular morphology and electrical properties are key contributors to the diversity in neuronal signaling observed in the CNS. Against this backdrop it is gratifying that specific transcription factors are clearly able to regulate both these facets, which suggests that each are regulated by common developmental mechanisms.</p><p>Our electrophysiology clearly demonstrates that over-expression of <italic>eve </italic>in aCC/RP2 results in a down-regulation of both peak I<sub>Kfast </sub>and amplitude of cholinergic minis. I<sub>Kfast </sub>is a composite of at least two separate conductances encoded by <italic>shal </italic>and <italic>slo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Addition of ChTX indicates that the effect of Eve on I<sub>Kfast </sub>is through a reduction in the Slo-mediated component of this current. This conclusion is reinforced by two complementary approaches: DamID and QRT-PCR, the latter of which shows that <italic>slo </italic>is specifically repressed by Eve while <italic>shal </italic>remains unchanged. That both DamID and QRT-PCR identify <italic>slo </italic>as a target of Eve repression indicates that regulation of this ion channel gene is direct (that is, not occurring indirectly through unknown intermediates). Transcriptional regulation of <italic>slo </italic>is relatively complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], with at least five different promoters characterized: C<sub>0 </sub>and C<sub>1</sub>, which drive expression in neurons; C<sub>1b </sub>and C<sub>1c</sub>, which drive expression in the mid-gut; and C<sub>2</sub>, which drives expression in muscle and trachea. Each promoter gives rise to different splice variants. It remains to be determined how Eve regulates the expression of individual splice variants. The family of channels of which <italic>slo </italic>is a member, BK Ca<sup>2+</sup>-gated potassium channels, are activated by membrane depolarization during action potential firing and, as such, contribute to the after-hyperpolarization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Consistent with our data, I<sub>kslo </sub>has been shown to regulate excitability via both duration and frequency of action potential firing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and also to modulate synaptic release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>In addition to decreasing peak I<sub>Kfast</sub>, over-expression of <italic>eve </italic>in aCC/RP2 is sufficient to decrease the amplitude of action potential-dependent excitatory synaptic currents. Analysis of spontaneous minis reveals a similar reduction, which is indicative of reduced postsynaptic sensitivity to ACh. Our analyses indicate that expression of <italic>nAcR&#x003b1;-96Aa</italic>, a nAChR subunit, is negatively regulated by Eve. Unlike <italic>slo</italic>, however, we have not been able to use additional pharmacology to further corroborate this regulation. To show specificity, however, we used QRT-PCR to analyze mRNA levels for a second nAChR, <italic>nAcR&#x003b2;-64B</italic>, a subunit not found in the same complex as nAcR&#x003b1;-96Aa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. We saw no significant alterations in <italic>nAcR&#x003b2;-64B </italic>mRNA levels, which allows us to tentatively conclude that Eve acts selectively on <italic>nAcR&#x003b1;-96Aa</italic>. This regulation, which is evident from DamID, QRT-PCR and electrophysiology, is again likely to be direct.</p><p>There is, however, a caveat that should be borne in mind in the interpretation of our data. This is that the changes we observed following over-expression of <italic>eve </italic>may be the average of both direct and indirect effects. We consider that indirect effects are likely to arise through two main sources. The first possibility would be changes that result from homeostatic compensatory mechanisms that are known to be active in <italic>Drosophila </italic>motoneurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Such homeostatic mechanisms are capable of adjusting the relative peak amplitudes of specific membrane conductances (most notable I<sub>Na </sub>and I<sub>K</sub>) to maintain consistency in action potential firing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Thus, changes to membrane excitability mediated by <italic>eve </italic>over-expression may be countered, at least in part, by homeostatic regulation. The effects observed in action potential firing following over-expression of <italic>eve </italic>in aCC/RP2 are in keeping with the known homeostatic mechanisms active in these two motoneurons; a decrease in exposure to synaptic excitation results in a compensatory increase in excitability to fire action potentials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The changes to the underlying electrical properties that are associated with this response (that is, a decrease in I<sub>Kfast</sub>) are not, by comparison, in keeping with known homeostatic regulation that would predict significant increases in I<sub>Na</sub>, I<sub>Kfast </sub>and I<sub>Kslow</sub>. Thus, whilst homeostatic regulation may contribute to the changes observed in membrane excitability, it seems unlikely that such mechanisms can account entirely for the changes observed in specific underlying membrane conductances.</p><p>A second possibility that may result in indirect change to membrane excitability is an alteration in the synaptic connectivity of motoneurons in which <italic>eve </italic>is over-expressed. Considering the documented role for <italic>eve </italic>in axon pathfinding, it is conceivable that alterations in electrical properties may arise as secondary consequences of morphological changes. We tend to discount this possibility for two reasons. First, all motoneurons were filled during our recordings and no obvious perturbation in wild-type morphology was noted. Of course, our level of analysis would not have detected subtle changes in fine dendritic branching. Second, Landgraf <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] show that misexpression of <italic>eve </italic>is sufficient to only perturb axon pathfinding but not final target recognition in motoneurons (which is only delayed). Thus, although over-expression of <italic>eve </italic>in the ventral motoneurons is sufficient to misdirect their axons to dorsal muscles, these errors are rectified by the time of hatching.</p><p>In addition to our own experiments, there is a precedent for transcription factor misexpression resulting in altered membrane excitability. For example, expression of <italic>lox1</italic>, a homologue of the <italic>Drosophila </italic>genes <italic>sex-combs reduced </italic>and <italic>antennapedia</italic>, in leech neurons is sufficient to increase the size of the AP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. In keeping with a basic principle of a combinatorial code, these authors report cell-type specific effects &#x02013; only discrete groups of cells exhibit increased action potential amplitude. In the ascidian, <italic>Halocynthia roretizi</italic>, motoneurons that express the transcription factor HRlim have a set of common properties, including the expression of the sodium channel gene <italic>TuNa2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Ectopic expression of HRlim is sufficient to drive expression of TuNa2 in cells that normally do not express either.</p><p>An important question raised by our examination of the consequences of <italic>eve </italic>over-expression in differing motoneuron subpopulations is the universality of its effects. Our data are consistent with a model in which the transcriptome of specific cell types is a critical determinant of the nature of regulation. Comparison of the effects produced by over-expression of <italic>eve </italic>in aCC/RP2 compared to those produced in the RPs shows differences consistent with this hypothesis. Whatever the precise mechanism, this apparent dichotomy of action strongly implicates a context-dependent mode of regulation. Such a conclusion is not too surprising given that Eve, Isl and Hb9 form part of a combinatorial code of motoneuron specification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and that specification of other neuronal properties, for example, <italic>dFMRFa </italic>expression and <italic>furnin 1 </italic>expression, is also under complex combinatorial and non-combinatorial control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Thus, the electrical properties of neuronal membranes are most likely dictated by a combined activity of a range of transcription factors, which our data indicates includes Eve, Islet and HB9. Alteration of this balance within specific neurons will likely result in an equally diverse range of effects on both electrical and signaling properties.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The processes by which neurons acquire their unique electrical characteristics are, at present, not particularly well understood. Our study is of importance because it shows that a transcription factor known to be essential for axon guidance decisions is also able to influence the acquisition of specific electrical properties in the same motoneurons. Based on this observation, it is our prediction that other members of the combinatorial code (Lim3, Islet, and so on) will act through the transcriptional regulation of additional sets of ion channel genes, the particular expression of which will account for the unique electrical characteristics that we observe between motoneurons. It will now be of importance to determine how Eve influences the expression of ion-channel genes when expressed in other, non-endogenously <italic>eve </italic>expressing motoneurons. Our results clearly indicate that the effects we observe in aCC/RP2 are not recapitulated when <italic>eve </italic>is ectopically expressed in the RP1,3&#x02013;5 motoneurons, indicative perhaps that additional co-factors might be required. Presumably, these co-factors might also be cell-type specific.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Fly stocks</title><p>Flies were maintained on apple juice agar supplemented with yeast at 25&#x000b0;C.

Cells were initially identified based on position within the ventral nerve cord and absolute identification was determined after recording by labeling with sulfur rhodamine (0.3%; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA), which was included in the patch saline. Recordings were made using an Axopatch-1D amplifier controlled by pClamp 8.1 (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA, USA). Only cells with an input resistance &#x0003e;1 G&#x003a9; were accepted for analysis. Traces were filtered at 2 kHz and sampled at 20 kHz. To better resolve Na<sup>+ </sup>currents, an on-line leak subtraction protocol was used (P/4). Currents shown are the averages of five trials for each cell. Membrane excitability was determined using injection of depolarizing current (10 pA/500 ms) from a maintained membrane potential (Vm) of -60 mV. Vms were maintained at -60 mV by injection of a small amount of hyperpolarizing current.
