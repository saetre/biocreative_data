The polymerase (Pol) III transcript, with a length of about 330 nucleotides (nt) (Kr&#x000fc;ger and Benecke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1987</xref>; Murphy et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1987</xref>), is highly conserved in vertebrates (G&#x000fc;rsoy et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2000</xref>). Due to its abundance, it has been known since the 1960s. Its function as a transcriptional regulator, however, has only recently been discovered. 7SK mediates the inhibition of the general transcription elongation factor P-TEFb by the HEXIM1 protein and thereby represses transcript elongation by Pol II (Blazek et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2005</xref>; Egloff et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2006</xref>; Michels et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2004</xref>; Peterlin and Price <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2006</xref>). Furthermore, 7SK RNA suppresses the deaminase activity of APOBEC3C and sequesters this enzyme in the nucleolus (He et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2006</xref>).</p><p>Two distinct secondary structure elements are highly conserved throughout vertebrates (Egloff et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2006</xref>): a 5&#x02032;-terminal hairpin structure that binds both HEXIM1 and P-TEFb, and a 3&#x02032;-terminal hairpin that interacts with P-TEFb only. In contrast to the nearly perfect sequence conservation in jawed vertebrates, the 7SK RNA from the lamprey <italic>Lampetra fluviatilis</italic> differed in more than 30% of its nucleotide positions from its mammalian counterpart (G&#x000fc;rsoy et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2000</xref>). The highest sequence conservation is observed in the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; hairpin regions. The sequence conservation seems to decline rapidly outside the gnathostomes. In G&#x000fc;rsoy et&#x000a0;al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2000</xref>), some of us also reported on an unsuccessful attempt to find 7SK RNA in hagfish and lancet and suggested that the 7SK RNA might be a vertebrate innovation. In this paper we combine improved cloning strategies with systematic computational homology searches to detect highly divergent 7SK RNAs in invertebrate animals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cloning and Sequencing of 7SK RNAs</title><p>Total cellular RNA was isolated from frozen tissue, minced with scissors, and homogenized in buffer containing guanidinium thiocyanate (Chomczynski and Sacchi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1987</xref>). Northern blots were performed with 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of purified RNA separated in 2% agarose gels containing 0.67&#x000a0;M formaldehyde. After transfer to nylon membranes (Hybond-N; Amersham), immobilized RNA was hybridized with labeled antisense RNA probes generated by T7 transcription of inversely cloned cDNA fragments of the previously identified 7SK RNA of <italic>Lampetra fluviatilis</italic> (G&#x000fc;rsoy et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2000</xref>). Hybridization with labeled antisense RNA (2&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>6&#x000a0;</sup>cpm/ml) was in 50% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5 &#x000d7; Denhardt&#x02019;s reagent, 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml each of yeast tRNA and denatured salmon sperm DNA, and 5 &#x000d7; SET (150&#x000a0;mM NaCl, 20&#x000a0;mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1&#x000a0;mM EDTA).</p><p>Cloning of new 7SK cDNAs was based on RT-PCR reactions. In the first step 4&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of total RNA was reverse transcribed using the Omniscript RT-Kit (Qiagen) with a primer complementary to the 3&#x02032;-end of 7SK RNA. An aliquot of that assay was taken for PCR with the same 3&#x02032;-primer and a specific upstream primer. The successful combination for <italic>Myxine</italic> and <italic>Branchiostoma</italic> amplification was nt 54&#x02013;72 as upstream primer and nt 197&#x02013;215 as downstream primer, both of the human 7SK DNA sequence. For <italic>Helix</italic>, the same upstream primer, but in combination with a lamprey downstream primer (corresponding to positions 299&#x02013;316), was successful. Candidate fragments were cloned, sequenced, and taken to deduce gene-specific &#x0201c;nested&#x02019;&#x02019; primers for rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) experiments (Frohman et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1988</xref>), as described earlier (G&#x000fc;rsoy et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2000</xref>). Briefly, for the 3&#x02032;-ends cellular RNA was first polyadenylated and reverse transcription started with oligo(dT) carrying at its 5&#x02032;-side an oligonucleotide sequence suitable for subsequent PCR with two &#x0201c;nested&#x02019;&#x02019; gene-specific primers. The 5&#x02032;-ends were obtained by reverse transcription with a specific primer and oligonucleotide ligation (T4-RNA ligase) to the 3&#x02032;-end of first-strand cDNAs. As before, PCR amplification was achieved with nested gene-specific primers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Computational Homology Search</title><p>Homology search was performed as a stepwise procedure.

In this way, we identified candidates in other vertebrate genomes, including the following, previously published sequences: <italic>Mus musculus</italic> (M63671, Moon and Krause <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1991</xref>), <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic> (K02909, Reddy et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1984</xref>), <italic>Takifugu rubripes</italic> (AJ890104, Egloff et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2006</xref>; Myslinksi et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2004</xref>), <italic>Tetraodon nigroviridis</italic> (AJ890103, Egloff et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2006</xref>), <italic>Danio rerio</italic> (AJ890102, Egloff et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2006</xref>), and <italic>Gallus gallus</italic> (AJ890104, Egloff et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2006</xref>). In addition, we searched the shotgun traces of a selection of unfinished mammalian genomes as well as all unfinished nonmammalian animals. Beyond jawed vertebrates, this initial <!-- WARNING: Literal has not been converted -->search recovered a single candidate in the genome of the lamprey <italic>Petromyzon marinus</italic>, which turned out the be very closely related to the published sequence of <italic>Lampetra fluviatilis</italic> 7SK RNA (G&#x000fc;rsoy et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2000</xref>). The match to a single shotgun trace (1047111637562) from the nematode <italic>Brugia malayi</italic> was disregarded since it exactly matched the human sequence and hence is certainly a contamination.</p><p>We then created a multiple sequence alignment starting with an initial <!-- WARNING: Literal has not been converted -->alignment. This was then manually refined to conform to the experimentally determined structure model of human 7SK snRNA by Wassarman and Steitz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1991</xref>). The best-conserved blocks were marked and converted in the search patterns using the <!-- WARNING: Literal has not been converted -->program, which is part of the <!-- WARNING: Literal has not been converted -->package (Mosig et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2007</xref>). This step was guided by the functional interpretation of the structural domains of the 7SK in Egloff et&#x000a0;al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2006</xref>). The program <!-- WARNING: Literal has not been converted --> which searches fragmented approximate sequence patterns in genomic DNA sequences, was then used to scan the available genomic DNA data.</p><p>First efforts focused on the 3&#x02032;-terminal hairpin structure (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Both the loop motive and the GGC-GCC stem have been shown to be crucial for P-TEFb binding and have little or no sequence variation. Search patterns for <!-- WARNING: Literal has not been converted -->are specified as partial sequence patterns (using IUPAC notation), annotated by the minimal and maximal number of unspecified nucleotides separating the sequence motifs and the maximal number of mismatches and in/dels that are acceptable in each of the sequence motifs.

The best matches also showed high sequence conservation in the part of the 5&#x02032;-terminal hairpin structure responsible for HEXIM1 and P-TEFb binding (Egloff et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2006</xref>) and were clearly identifiable as homologues by aligning them with each other. We then extended our pattern to search for highly conserved regions in both the 5&#x02032; and the 3&#x02032; hairpin structures. The pattern was refined in an iterative way every time a new candidate sequences was found.

The PSE of the Pol III snRNAs is very similar to that on the snRNA transcribed by Pol II (U1, U2, U4, U5, U11, U12, U4atac).</p><p>In order to distinguish functional 7SK genes from pseudogenes we investigated their upstream regions for snRNA-specific promoter elements. Since these sequence motifs can vary significantly (Hernandez Jr et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2007</xref>) between species, we searched the genomes also for spliceosomal snRNAs, extracted 100-nt upstream regions, and used <!-- WARNING: Literal has not been converted -->(version 3.5.4) (Bailey and Elkan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1994</xref>) to identify the PSE consensus separately for each species.

The alignment was then edited so as to maximize the number of base pairs in the consensus structure.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Northern Blot Verification of 7SK Sequences</title><p>Numerous attempts to identify 7SK RNA in invertebrate phyla have been unsuccessful in the past. Neither RT-PCR experiments with mammalian primers nor northern blot analyses with oligonucleotide-primed cDNA probes were successful (G&#x000fc;rsoy et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2000</xref>). Therefore, we decided to increase northern blot sensitivity by using radioactively labeled antisense RNA probes. For this, the two most conserved (in comparison with the human sequence) regions of the lamprey (<italic>Lampetra fluviatilis</italic>) 7SK RNA gene (G&#x000fc;rsoy et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2000</xref>) were subcloned in inverted orientation under control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. Thus, these two clones allowed the synthesis in&#x000a0;vitro of labeled transcripts with very high specific activity. The resulting two antisense RNA probes were complementary to regions 1&#x02013;94 (A) and 283&#x02013;316 (B) of lamprey 7SK RNA, respectively.</p><p>A northern blot obtained with cellular RNA of six vertebrate and six invertebrate organisms was consecutively hybridized with the aforementioned probes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

In contrast, only hagfish (<italic>Myxine glutinosa</italic>) and two of the five invertebrates on the right side in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> were found to be positive with respect to the 7SK antisense probes: amphioxus (<italic>Branchiostoma lanceolatum</italic>) and snail (<italic>Helix pomatia</italic>). Even longer exposure did not give a hint to any 7SK hybridization signal of either of the two probes with sea urchin (<italic>Paracentrotus lividus</italic>), fruitfly (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>), or nematode (<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>) RNA. <fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Northern blot of cellular RNA from 12 different organisms using <bold>(A)</bold> 3&#x02032;- and <bold>(B)</bold> 5&#x02032;-terminal 7SK antisense RNA for hybridization.

In both rounds, U6 antisense RNA hybridizes to the same target sequences, whereas the two 7SK probes bind to different areas of the 7SK RNA. The broad smear observed with sea urchin RNA is due to cross contamination of the 7SK antisense probe with ribosomal RNA and degradation products thereof.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>cDNA Cloning of Novel 7SK RNAs</title><p>Cloning of invertebrate 7SK cDNA was performed by RT-PCR and primers deduced from the most conserved elements of vertebrate 7SK RNA. Routinely, about 10 different primer combinations had to be tested. In many cases, PCR fragments with the expected lengths were obtained. After subcloning and sequencing, however, most fragments were found to represent pieces of ribosomal DNA. Only a single previously unidentified sequence was amplified from hagfish RNA. Two identical sequences, but differing in length, were obtained from amphioxus. A single new clone was obtained from snail. These clones showed a limited but significant sequence homology with the corresponding central sections of the vertebrate 7SK DNA. Therefore, the 3&#x02032;- and 5&#x02032;-flanking sequences of those clones were amplified by RACE experiments.

In contrast, there are only 31 hits in <italic>Monodelphis domestica</italic> and 11 hits in the chicken genome. The current assembly of the genome of <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic> features two adjacent copies. These are identical also in an extended flanking sequence, indicating a recent segmental duplication of the locus or an assembly artifact; see, e.g., Cheung et&#x000a0;al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2003</xref>). In each of the five sequenced teleost fish, only a single copy of the 7SK is present. Three <!-- WARNING: Literal has not been converted -->hits were found in the <!-- WARNING: Literal has not been converted -->release of the sea lamprey genome. Only a single one, located on Contig17254, matches the published sequence from <italic>Lampetra fluviatilis</italic> over its full length.</p><p>In three vertebrate species, however, we failed to find a complete 7SK gene. Only a single partial hit was recovered from the low-coverage genome elephant shark <italic>Callorhynchus milli</italic>. All convincing <!-- WARNING: Literal has not been converted -->hits of the chicken 7SK sequence against the available <italic>Taeniopygia guttata</italic> shotgun reads seem to belong to a single locus. The corresponding sequence very well matches the chicken sequence but shows a 398-nt insert, which we interpret as an artifact. To our surprise, only a single <!-- WARNING: Literal has not been converted -->hit was found in the platypus genome. The corresponding sequence significantly deviates from the vertebrate consensus both in the first &#x0223c;8 nt and in the last &#x0223c;100 nt, and it is not located in a region that is syntenic to the functional 7SK genes in other vertebrates. This <!-- WARNING: Literal has not been converted -->hit thus is most likely a pseudogene. Since the locus around the platypus ICK homologue is incompletely assembled, it is reasonable to assume that we fail to find the platypus 7SK due to missing data, not because platypus has lost its functional 7SK RNA.</p><p>The functional 7SK genes can be recognized by the characteristic PSE sequence in their promotor regions; see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. Furthermore, their genomic location between the glutathione S-transferase &#x003b1; GTA4 on the 5&#x02032; side and serine/threonine protein kinase ICK on the 3&#x02032; side is conserved throughout most vertebrates. In <italic>Dasypus novemcinctus</italic>, the 3&#x02032; neighbor of 7SK is a homologue to &#x0201c;F-box only protein 9&#x02019;&#x02019; (Fbox9). The same gene is found adjacent to the 7SK candidate in <italic>Sorex araneus</italic>. This is interesting because in most mammalia where the information is available (with the exception of <italic>Felis cattus</italic> and <italic>Tupaia belangeri</italic>, in which the 7SK snRNA lies between two glutathione transferase genes, possible an assembly artifact), Fbox9 is usually the first gene 3&#x02032; on the same strand as 7SK. This is also observed in <italic>Gallus gallus</italic> and <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic>; in the latter no GTA4 homologue is annotated. Fbox9 is also located in close vicinity to the 7SK snRNA gene in teleosts except zebrafish. <fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Conservation of the the 7SK promoter region of the 7SK candidates located between the GTA4 and the ICK genes.

In this case we found a good candidate for the 3&#x02032; stem-loop structure, but the 300 nt upstream of this hit does not match other 7SK sequences.

The 3&#x02032; stem-loop structure can be extended by an additional 5 base pairs (bp) in vertebrates and, to a lesser extent, also in the other 7SK snRNAs.

While previously examples were known only from vertebrates, we found 7SK RNAs in most major deuterostome clades (chephalochordata, urochordata, and hemichordata) and in two lophotrochozoan clades (mollusca and annelida) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). In contrast, extensive efforts to find 7SK homologues in yeast and plants by us and others have remained unsuccessful. In these clades, no orthologue of HEXIM has been reported. Thus, most likely, neither fungi nor plants have the 7SK system. <fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;6</label><caption><p>Phylogenetic distribution of 7SK sequences.

In contrast, we found no trace of a 7SK RNA candidate either in platyhelminthes, in any of the numerous ecdysozoan species for which genomic data are available, or in the genome of the cnidarian <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic>. In summary, our data support an (early) bilaterian origin for 7SK snRNA.</p><p>The monophyly of the Ecdysozoa is, among other arguments, also supported (Telford <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2006</xref>) by the shared secondary absence of large numbers of genes in euarthropods and nematodes (Hughes and Friedman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2004</xref>). There is no functionally described HEXIM1 orthologue in insects. The current release of the ENSEMBL (v. 44) homology annotation, however, lists HEXIM homologues in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (CG3508), <italic>Aedes aegyptii</italic> (AAEL013291), and <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> (AGAP002875). It is at least conceivable, therefore, that an ancestral 7SK gene has been secondarily lost in this clade. Alternatively, the 7SK sequence might have diverged so far that it is not recognizable with currently available bioinformatic approaches.</p><p>The analysis of sequences and secondary structures revealed a striking difference between vertebrate and invertebrate sequences. While vertebrate 7SK RNAs are highly conserved in both sequence and structure, the molecule is highly variable in the other clades. Consensus structure models derived using a combination of thermodynamic folding and evaluation of compensatory mutations reveal three structural motifs that are conserved throughout all known 7SK sequences. The central domain (stem B), however, is present in vertebrates only, while elsewhere this region is so variable that our attempts to construct plausible alignments failed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Supporting Material</title><p>Supplemental data, in particular, machine-readable sequence alignments, tables of genomic coordinates, and lists of PSE elements can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/Publications/SUPPLEMENTS/07-021/">http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/Publications/SUPPLEMENTS/07-021/</ext-link>.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work has multiple roots: Dorota Koper-Emde&#x02019;s Ph.D. thesis at the Ruhr University Bochum (2004), Manja Marz&#x02019; M.Sc. thesis at the University of Leipzig (2006), and an Advanced Bioinformatics Computer Lab Course on &#x0201c;RNA Homology Search&#x02019;&#x02019; organized by PFS at the University of Vienna in Fall 2006.
