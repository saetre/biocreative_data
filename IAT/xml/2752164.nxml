Since their discovery in 1935, numerous studies characterizing L-form morphology, growth, and pathogenic potential have been conducted. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation and survival of L-forms remain unknown. Using unstable L-form colonies of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> as a model, we performed genome-wide transcriptome analysis and screened a deletion mutant library to study the molecular mechanisms involved in formation and survival of L-forms. Microarray analysis of L-form versus classical colonies revealed many up-regulated genes of unknown function as well as multiple over-expressed stress pathways shared in common with persister cells and biofilms. Mutant screens identified three groups of mutants which displayed varying degrees of defects in L-form colony formation. Group 1 mutants, which showed the strongest defect in L-form colony formation, belonged to pathways involved in cell envelope stress, DNA repair, iron homeostasis, outer membrane biogenesis, and drug efflux/ABC transporters. Four (Group 1) mutants, <italic>rcsB</italic>, a positive response regulator of colanic acid capsule synthesis, <italic>ruvA</italic>, a recombinational junction binding protein, <italic>fur</italic>, a ferric uptake regulator and <italic>smpA</italic> a small membrane lipoprotein were selected for complementation. Complementation of the mutants using a high-copy overexpression vector failed, while utilization of a low-copy inducible vector successfully restored L-form formation. This work represents the first systematic genetic evaluation of genes and pathways involved in the formation and survival of unstable L-form bacteria. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying L-form formation and survival and have implications for understanding the emergence of antibiotic resistance, bacterial persistence and latent infections and designing novel drugs and vaccines.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bacteria can be found in every niche on earth. Within these niches, bacteria exist in an array of sizes and morphologies. An important contributor to this diversity of cellular morphologies is the bacterial cell wall. The cell wall is not only important for maintaining cell shape but also for protection in constantly changing environments. Under certain conditions bacteria can spontaneously or by induction, lose part or all of their cell wall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007316-Dienes1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007316-Lederberg1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, resulting in osmosensitive cells known as cell wall deficient or defective bacteria (CWDB).

CWDB capable of &#x0201c;fried egg&#x0201d; growth on specialized solid media are termed L-forms, which can be classified into four groups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007316-Allan1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> based upon their ability to remain in the L-form state (unstable versus stable L-forms) and the presence or absence of residual cell wall (spheroplast-type versus protoplast-type L-forms). Many aspects of L-form manipulations can be carried out in liquid media; however, L-forms are best verified by observing growth on specialized solid media which often resemble &#x0201c;fried egg&#x0201d; colonies exhibited by mycoplasmas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007316-Clasener1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Since their discovery by Emmy Klieneberger in 1935 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007316-Klieneberger1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, L-forms, named in honor of the Lister Institute where she worked, have been suspected to be causative agents of disease underlying chronic and persistent infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007316-Domingue1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007316-Clasener1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007316-Gutman1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

This, in part, is due to lack of understanding of the basic biology of L-forms and the circumstances favoring the transition of classical bacteria into L-forms. Additionally, the fact that L-forms can be obtained <italic>in vitro</italic> by multiple methods which can influence subsequent analyses and that multiple types of L-forms appear to exist, have made the design of a definitive study implicating these forms as causative agents extremely challenging. More importantly, difficulty in establishing standardization within the field has contributed to the lack of clarity in the field, which ultimately led to neglect and abandonment of research on these forms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007316-Allan1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> until recently.</p><p>A renewed interest in L-form research has emerged as of late <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007316-Fuller1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007316-DellEra1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. In 2005, Fuller et al. conducted research on the osmotic stability of unstable <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> L-forms and inherited beta-lactam resistance in revertants. In 2006, Siddiqui et al. analyzed the <italic>dcw</italic> locus and identified mutations in the stable <italic>E. coli</italic> L-form strain LW1665F<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>. Joseleau-Petit et al. studied cell division and peptidoglycan synthesis of unstable <italic>E. coli</italic> L-forms and identified regulatory and structural colanic acid mutants and an <italic>mrcB</italic> penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 1B mutant defective in L-form formation, in 2007. More recently, Leaver et al. examined <italic>ftsZ</italic> independent cell division and an <italic>ispA</italic> mutation in stable <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> L-forms, and Dell'Era et al. observed cell division and changes in gene expression in stable <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> L-forms. With the exception of Joseleau et al. much of this renewed research has been conducted on Gram-positive bacteria and/or stable L-forms which usually required mutagenesis or long-term passages for generation. Historically, it has been known that stable L-forms are genetically different from their parent strain due to accumulation of mutations during the lengthy process of their selection, although the mutations involved remain poorly characterized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007316-Allan1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007316-LEDERBERG1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Stable L-forms represent good models to study basic biological functions in L-forms, their ability to cause disease, and mechanisms involved in their inability to revert to classical bacteria. However, they are considered to be distinct entities from unstable L-forms although they appear to share commonalities. Unstable L-forms are considered to be genetically identical <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007316-Allan1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> to their parent strain and retain their ability to revert back to the classical form. Thus, unstable L-forms represent a unique opportunity to examine the molecular processes underlying the transition of classical bacteria to the L-form phenotype and the gene expression alterations that occur as a result of this transition.</p><p>In this study, we first established an unstable <italic>E. coli</italic> L-form model and then conducted genome-wide transcriptome analysis comparing classical colonies and antibiotic induced unstable L-form colonies to investigate changes in gene expression that result from transition to L-forms. Microarray analysis revealed drastic changes in the transcription profile of <italic>E. coli</italic> L-forms, which included the overexpression of many genes involved in stress responses and of unknown function that may be involved in the formation and survival of L-forms. Using an optimized L-form induction media, we screened an <italic>E. coli</italic> deletion mutant library for mutants defective in forming L-form colonies. This approach successfully identified various mutants belonging to cell envelope stress, DNA repair, iron homeostasis pathways, outer membrane biogenesis, and drug efflux/ABC transporters.

Many genes involved in lipopolysaccharide core biosynthesis, two component systems, toxin-antitoxins modules, osmoregulation, ABC transporters/drug efflux pumps, intracellular signaling, and numerous transcription factors, were up-regulated as well.

This lack of progress is mainly because of the unstable nature of L-form bacteria, the variability of the models used for their generation, and the unavailability of modern molecular biology tools before the 1980s when L-form research was largely abandoned. In this study, we took advantage of microarray technology and an <italic>E. coli</italic> deletion mutant library. These tools were used to perform whole genome-wide gene expression analysis and mutant library screens to provide insight into the molecular basis of L-form formation using the <italic>E. coli</italic> L-form as a model. The major findings of this study are the identification of pathways and genes involved in cell envelope stress, DNA repair, iron homeostasis, outer membrane biogenesis, and drug efflux/ABC transporters being involved in L-form formation and survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007316-g005"><bold>Fig. 5</bold></xref>).

These findings suggest a relationship between L-forms and persisters may exist and that both combat stress within their environment in a conserved manner. Persister cells may be the surviving cells on LIM which subsequently lead to L-form colony formation. L-form cells could also be a type of persister cell that unlike their walled counterparts, are able to grow in the presence of beta-lactam antibiotics due to the unique conditions in which they are cultured. In addition to persister cells, several enriched overexpressed pathways in L-form colonies were also found to be overexpressed in biofilms, these included stress pathways such as colanic acid, heat shock, DNA repair/SOS, and phage shock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007316-Beloin1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007316-Domka1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, it was revealed that efflux pumps and transporters are important in biofilm formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007316-Kvist1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. This is consistent with our microarray data which showed up-regulation of AcrAB and EmrAB-TolC drug efflux pumps, as well as the Mar operon. It is highly probable that these multidrug efflux systems contribute to L-form colony formation through removal of toxic substances, including antibiotics. Besides enriched stress pathways, several genes that have been described to be involved in biofilms formation were also among induced genes in L-form colonies. These include <italic>yahA</italic> which encodes a phosphodiesterase with specificity for cleaving the intracellular signaling molecule c-di-GMP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007316-Schmidt1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <italic>ycfR</italic>/<italic>bhsA</italic> that encodes a protein involved in biofilm formation through its ability to modulate quorum sensing indole concentrations, multiple stress responses, cell aggregation, and cell surface hydrophobicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007316-Zhang1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, and <italic>bdm/yddX</italic>, which encodes a protein involved in biofilm dependent modulation and is regulated by the Rcs two-component system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007316-FrancezCharlot1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. These findings are quite surprising given that the conditions under which L-form colonies are produced (formed with antibiotics) and biofilms are produced (formed without antibiotics) are quite distinct. However, the typical &#x0201c;fried egg&#x0201d; L-form colony exhibits signs of group behavior similar to that of biofilms, which could explain why they share certain stress pathways in common.</p><p>Utilization of the <italic>E. coli</italic> deletion mutant library allowed us to further examine genes required for L-form formation and survival identified by microarray analysis. It is reassuring that most genes identified in the mutant screens were also found to be differentially expressed by microarray analysis. We identified 3 groups of mutants that showed varying degrees of defects in L-form colony formation, possibly reflecting the relative importance of the genes involved in L-form formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007316-g003"><bold>Fig. 3</bold></xref>), with the majority of the mutants belonging to Group 1 mutants which showed a complete inability to form L-form colonies. Among the 24 Group 1 mutants, only 4 mutants, <italic>acrA, acrB, yfgL</italic>, and <italic>mrcB</italic> mutants, have previously been reported to be hypersensitive to beta-lactam antibiotics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007316-Tamae1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. It is possible that their inability to develop L-form colonies could be due to hypersensitivity to penicillin. However, most beta-lactam hypersensitive mutants such as <italic>rpmF, rimK, rplA, pgmB, dksA, phoP, surA, emtA,</italic> identified in a previous study using the same Keio mutant library <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007316-Tamae1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> were able to form L-form colonies in this study. This suggests that increased antibiotic susceptibility under normal MIC testing conditions for classical forms may not necessarily translate into defects in L-form colony formation. However, the majority of the Group 1 mutants, i.e., the remaining 20 mutants are genuine and their lack of L-formation is not due to hypersensitivity to penicillin, but due to a defect specific to L-form formation or survival. Currently, we do not know if the Group 1 mutants have defects in L-form formation or survival. Future studies are needed to determine which step the mutants are defective in.</p><p>To confirm that the identified genes in Group 1 mutants are indeed responsible for the defect in L-form formation, we chose 4 representative mutants for complementation studies. These 4 mutants, which represent key pathways identified in the mutant screens, are involved in colanic acid synthesis (<italic>rcsB</italic>), iron homeostasis (<italic>fur</italic>), DNA repair/SOS response (<italic>ruvA</italic>), and a small lipoprotein component of the outer membrane assembly complex (<italic>smpA</italic>). Our initial attempt to complement these mutants with their corresponding wild type gene on a multicopy plasmid vector was unsuccessful, presumably because of the toxicity of uncontrolled overexpression of these gene products. However, using the inducible pBAD vector, we were able to successfully restore the L-form colony formation phenotype of the 4 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007316-g004"><bold>Fig. 4</bold></xref>).</p><p>Colonic acid synthesis appears to be essential for L-form colony formation and is regulated by the Rcs phosphorelay system, however, our microarray and mutant screen results suggest that the Rcs phosphorelay system plays a greater role. This is consistent with a recent report which suggests that the Rcs system senses damage to the peptidoglycan layer and contributes to low-level intrinsic beta-lactam antibiotic resistance, which is independent of colanic acid capsule synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007316-Laubacher1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.

Many of the genes regulated by the Rcs phosphorelay system, as well as the Rcs system itself, were upregulated in our L-form colonies, indicating that this system may be activated and utilized for L-form formation or survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007316-g005"><bold>Fig. 5</bold></xref><bold>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007316.s001">Table S1</xref></bold>).

Key to the activation of this killing mechanism is the reaction of reactive oxygen species with intracellular iron from damaged iron-sulfur clusters, resulting in the formation of hydroxyl radicals via the Fenton reaction, which leads to subsequent cell death. Our results suggest that L-forms rely on increased iron sulfur cluster biosynthesis and repair mechanisms to manage the amount of iron available to undergo the Fenton reaction. This is apparent by the up-regulation of several genes within the <italic>isc</italic> gene cluster involved in iron sulfur cluster biosynthesis and repair in our microarray analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007316-Johnson1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>(<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007316.s001">Table S1</xref></bold>). The ferric uptake regulator (Fur) also appears to be essential for the formation of L-form colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007316-g004"><bold>Fig. 4</bold></xref>). Fur is a repressor of iron uptake and regulates iron levels through its ability to control intracellular free iron concentrations, thus minimizing iron-induced redox stresses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007316-Andrews1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Loss of Fur function in the <italic>fur</italic> mutant may lead to increased toxic levels of intracellular iron that can cause excessive reactive oxygen radical production and DNA damage which is not conducive to L-form formation.</p><p>DNA repair pathways in response to DNA damage caused by reactive oxygen radicals also appear to be important for L-form colony formation, since maintenance of intact DNA structure is required for replication and viability. The SOS response, which represents one of the DNA repair pathways we identified in the microarray, may also contribute to the delay of L-form colony formation, due to inhibition of cell division during the DNA repair process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007316-Miller1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007316-g004"><bold>Fig. 4</bold></xref>). RuvA is part of a protein complex RuvAB that resolves Holliday junctions and is essential for recombinational repair of DNA lesions, whereas RecG is a DNA translocase that also catalyses branch migration of Holliday junctions like RuvAB but through a different mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007316-Grove1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. It is significant that our mutant screens identified two Group 1 mutants <italic>ruvA</italic> and <italic>recG</italic> that are involved in DNA repair that had a defect in L-form formation or survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007316-g003"><bold>Fig. 3</bold></xref>).</p><p>The small membrane lipoprotein (SmpA) is a non-essential member of the YaeT complex involved in outer membrane biogenesis in Gram-negative bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007316-Sklar1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Along with <italic>smpA,</italic> fellow lipoprotein <italic>yfgL</italic> was also among our Group 1 mutants and was overexpressed in L-form colonies along with fellow lipoprotein members <italic>yfiO</italic>, <italic>nlpB,</italic> and <italic>yfgL.</italic> Although <italic>yfgL</italic> mutants are hypersensitive to ampicillin, <italic>smpA</italic> mutants have not been shown to be hypersensitive. This difference is possibly due to the interaction YfgL has with YaeT, which is independent of the other lipoproteins in the complex. <italic>smpA</italic> mutants are viable and are reported to have only mild defects in their outer membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007316-Sklar1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. The fact that we did not isolate other mutants with cell envelope defects such as those from the Tat or Tol-Pal systems suggests that inability of the <italic>smpA</italic> mutant to grow on LIM media may not be directly related to its outer membrane defect. This is perhaps due to a defect in initial cell aggregation resulting from changes in its cell surface properties, which affected L-form formation. Further studies are required to test this hypothesis.</p><p>Despite the significant findings of this study there are several limitations. Firstly, microarray analysis was performed using 72 hr unstable L-form colonies that had already formed. Thus the array data may have favored identification of genes required for the survival rather than the formation of L-form colonies. This could also explain why the vast majority of significant differentially expressed genes were up-regulated compared to down-regulated. A more comprehensive, temporal microarray analysis over a range of time points may shed more light on the gene expression changes that occur in early stages of L-form colony formation. Secondly, the <italic>E. coli</italic> strain used for the microarray analysis was the W3110 strain which is not the same as the BW25113 strain used in the construction of the deletion mutant library. Although this might cause some minor discrepancies in the correlation between the microarray and the mutant screen data, this should not alter the major findings and conclusions of the study. The fact that the mutant screen data which is more reliable than the microarray findings correlate well with the microarray data suggests that the above limitation is not a major concern. Thirdly, because induction of classical bacteria into L-forms usually require high concentrations of antibiotics, equivalent drug concentration controls and exposure times for classical cells are not possible. Furthermore, our microarray analysis may have included gene expression changes that are the result of cell wall loss and may not necessarily be required for the creation or maintenance of L-forms per se. Even though these gene expression changes may not be specific for L-forms, the data highlights important biological processes that depend on the existence of an intact cell wall. Future microarray analyses utilizing additional controls such as cells grown at a lower concentration of Penicillin G, and cells that are enzymatically stripped of their cell wall might be useful to better pinpoint L-form specific responses. Lastly, microarray analysis and mutant screens used in this study can only examine alterations at the RNA and DNA level that influence L-form formation and survival. Future studies utilizing proteomic and epigenetic analyses will be needed to further investigate changes at the protein level underlying L-form formation and survival.</p><p>In conclusion, we report the use of whole genome transcriptome analysis, mutant library screens, and complementation experiments to address the molecular basis of L-form formation. Microarray analysis revealed a network of stress responses and pathways that possibly contribute to the survival of L-form colonies and that are also overexpressed or important in persisters and biofilms. Mutant library screens identified three groups of mutants with varying degrees of defects in L-form formation or survival. Complementation experiments allowed us to confirm four Group 1 mutants, <italic>rcsB</italic>, <italic>ruvA</italic>, <italic>fur</italic>, and <italic>smpA</italic> that are involved in the formation or survival of L-form colonies. This work represents the first systematic genetic study to identify genes and pathways involved in the formation and survival of L-forms. These results shed new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying L-form formation and survival while also establishing the framework for future research on how the identified pathways and genes interact leading to the emergent properties of L-forms. Our findings have implications for understanding the emergence of antibiotic resistance and bacterial persistence and designing novel drugs and vaccines targeting L-form bacteria for improved control of persistent bacterial infections.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Culture media and growth conditions</title><p>Routine growth of <italic>E. coli</italic> strains was conducted using Luria-Bertani (LB) medium.

The microarray data have been deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo">http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo</ext-link>) and are accessible through Gene Expression Omnibus series accession number GSE14796.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>SYBR Green real-time PCR</title><p>Gene expression of 11 up-regulated genes from different pathways was verified using a Quantitative real-time SYBR Green MasterMix Kit (Applied Biosystems) on an Applied Biosystems 7300 real-time instrument and ABI Prism SDS 1.2.2. software. Primers corresponding to the 11 genes of interest were designed using Primer Express software (version 2.0, Applied Biosystems). Standardized total RNA was converted to cDNA using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. cDNA was then used as template to perform real-time PCR following Applied Biosystems protocols. The 16S rRNA gene was used as the reference gene for comparison with the genes of interest. Changes of expression are the average of three biological replicates.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Library screen for mutants defective in L-form colony formation</title><p>The Keio collection, a non-essential gene library consisting of 3985 single-gene deletion mutants of <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 BW25113 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007316-Baba1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, was grown at 37&#x000b0;C overnight in 100 &#x000b5;l of LB medium in 96-well plates without shaking.
