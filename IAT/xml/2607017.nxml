Here, we report that in the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, <italic>CUL3</italic> regulates plant growth and development, not only during embryogenesis but also at post-embryonic stages. First, we show that CUL3 modulates the emission of ethylene, a gaseous plant hormone that is an important growth regulator. A CUL3 hypomorphic mutant accumulates ACS5, the rate-limiting enzyme in ethylene biosynthesis and as a consequence exhibits a constitutive ethylene response. Second, we provide evidence that <italic>CUL3</italic> regulates primary root growth by a novel ethylene-dependant pathway. In particular, we show that <italic>CUL3</italic> knockdown inhibits primary root growth by reducing root meristem size and cell number. This phenotype is suppressed by ethylene-insensitive or resistant mutations. Finally, we identify a function of <italic>CUL3</italic> in distal root patterning, by a mechanism that is independent of ethylene. Thus, our work highlights that <italic>CUL3</italic> is essential for the normal division and organisation of the root stem cell niche and columella root cap cells.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis plays a central role in controlling intracellular levels of essential regulatory molecules in all eukaryotic organisms. This protein degradation pathway has a large number of components, including hundreds of ubiquitin protein ligases (E3s) that are predicted to have regulatory roles in cell homeostasis, cell cycle control, and development. Recent research revealed the molecular composition of CULLIN3 (CUL3)-based E3 ligases, which are essential enzymes in both metazoans and plants. Here, we report that in the model plant <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, <italic>CUL3</italic> modulates the emission of ethylene, a gaseous plant hormone that controls a variety of processes such as fruit ripening and stress response.

Degradation <italic>via</italic> the UPS is a two-step process: the protein is first tagged by covalent attachment of ubiquitin and subsequently degraded by a multicatalytic protease complex called the 26S proteasome. The transfer of ubiquitin to a target protein substrate requires an ubiquitin protein-ligase (E3).</p><p>E3 enzymes act to specify the substrates and thus they play a key role in the ubiquitylation reaction. Several hundred different E3s have been identified in metazoan and plant genomes, based on specific, commonly shared structural motifs. However, the most intensively studied subclasses of E3s are those of the cullin-RING ligase (CRL) superfamily, which form multi-protein complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000328-Petroski1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. CRL E3s can be viewed as two functional modules brought together by the CULLIN proteins, acting as molecular scaffolds. The first module forms the catalytic centre and is composed of a RING finger domain protein and an ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2). The second module can be considered as the substrate recognition module, in which a specific protein physically interacts with the target substrate.</p><p>A series of recent reports has shed light on the molecular composition and function of the CUL3-based CRL E3s (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000328-Pintard1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>).

These BTB domain proteins bind CUL3, via the BTB domain and direct substrate specificity through an independent protein-protein interaction domain.

It is noteworthy that the <italic>ctr1-1</italic> mutation affects both cell elongation and root meristem size, indicating that ethylene signalling is involved in both mechanisms. Because the number of mitotic cells in the <italic>cul3<sup>hyp</sup></italic> root meristem was not significantly different from wild type, we conclude that the reduced meristem size is the consequence of the premature transition of cells from the meristem to the cell elongation zone, rather than caused by differences in cell division activity.</p><p>An intriguing observation is that in <italic>eto1-1</italic>, which overproduces ethylene, or in ACC-treated roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000328-Ruzicka1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> and our data), no decrease on the root meristem size was observed. This suggests that despite the fact that ethylene is a volatile gas, depending on its sites of production and/or perception, ethylene can induce different local responses. Hence, this fits with the evidence that ACS genes in Arabidopsis display distinct expression patterns during plant development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000328-Tsuchisaka1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title><italic>CUL3A/B</italic> Activity Is Necessary for Normal Root Cap Organisation</title><p>The strong <italic>CUL3A</italic> and <italic>CUL3B</italic> expression in the distal part of the root and their involvement in distal root patterning suggest that CUL3A/B proteins control the division and organisation of the stem cell niche and columella root cap cells. By which mechanism(s) do <italic>CUL3A/B</italic> genes maintain QC and root cap organisation? It was recently reported that ethylene modulates cell division in the stem cell niche <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000328-OrtegaMartnez1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Such an effect of ethylene would be consistent with the role of <italic>CUL3A/B</italic> in ethylene biosynthesis (see above). However, several lines of evidence argue against this possibility. First, 1 &#x000b5;M ACC treatment of wild type roots revealed no abnormalities in columella cell differentiation and/or tissue organisation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000328-Ruzicka1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Second, such a phenotype was not observed in the <italic>eto1-1</italic> null mutant. Third and most importantly, the ethylene insensitive mutation <italic>ein3-1</italic> did not suppress cell division defects in the QC and in columella cells. A possible explanation for the discrepancies between our data and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000328-OrtegaMartnez1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> is that the two <italic>eto1-11</italic> and <italic>eto1-12</italic> alleles used in their studies, which are point mutations, are acting in a dominant negative way to inhibit CUL3A/B activity. Overall, even if a subtle effect of ethylene on stem cell division is not excluded, our data point to an ethylene-independent role of CUL3A/B in organizing stem cell niche and columella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000328-g007">Figure 7B</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, we noticed that the DR5::GFP signal in the <italic>cul3<sup>hyp</sup></italic> root tip was weaker and more restricted than in wild type roots, suggesting altered auxin signalling. In addition, we also observed a higher PIN7 protein accumulation in <italic>cul3<sup>hyp</sup></italic> columella cells. One way to connect these observations is a scenario in which PIN7 missexpression leads to the depletion of intracellular auxin from the root tip, resulting in reduced auxin signalling and as a consequence patterning defects. Further experiments need to confirm such a model. Moreover, because PIN7 accumulation in columella cells is under post-transcriptional control and because <italic>CUL3A/B</italic> genes are strongly expressed in these cells, it will be interesting to address whether the PIN7 protein is a direct target of a still unknown CRL3 complex. Finally, a broader connection between CUL3A/B and auxin may exist, since several developmental abnormalities in the <italic>cul3<sup>hyp</sup></italic> mutant, such as altered number of cotyledons, or defects in root and venation patterning and embryogenesis (this work and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000328-Thomann2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>) are reminiscent of auxin transport or signalling defects.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plant Material, Growth Conditions, and Treatment</title><p>The Arabidopsis <italic>cul3a-3</italic> (SALK 012973) mutant line has been identified using the web assisted program: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://signal.salk.edu/cgi-bin/tdnaexpress">http://signal.salk.edu/cgi-bin/tdnaexpress</ext-link>.
