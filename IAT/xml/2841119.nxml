We identified 169 hypersensitive deletion mutants. The deleted genes encode proteins mainly involved in mitochondrial functions, DNA repair, transcription and chromatin remodeling, and oxidative stress response. We found that the susceptibility of yeast cells to CTBT depends on molecular oxygen. Transcriptome analysis of the immediate early response to CTBT revealed rapid induction of oxidant and stress response defense genes. Many of these genes depend on the transcription factors Yap1 and Cin5. Yap1 accumulates rapidly in the nucleus in CTBT treated cells suggesting acute oxidative stress. Moreover, molecular calculations supported a superoxide generating activity of CTBT. Superoxide production <italic>in vivo </italic>by CTBT was found associated to mitochondria as indicated by oxidation of MitoSOX Red.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We conclude that CTBT causes intracellular superoxide production and oxidative stress in fungal cells and is thus enhancing antimycotic drug effects by a secondary stress.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Fugal pathogens pose a serious threat to immunocompromised persons. Despite many antifungal agents interfering with metabolism and growth of fungal cells a limited number of compounds are being used for treatment of mycotic diseases caused by human pathogenic fungal species. Over the past two decades, the number of invasive fungal infections has increased in the clinical setting. <italic>Candida sp</italic>. is the fourth most common pathogen identified, and other pathogens such as <italic>Cryptococcus sp., Aspergillus sp</italic>., and <italic>Fusarium sp</italic>., have a high morbidity and mortality. In addition, the incidence of mycoses caused by opportunistic fungi is rising [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. CTBT, 7-chlorotetrazolo [5,1-c]benzo[1,2,4]triazine, has antifungal activity and enhances the efficacy of other antifungals with different targets such as cycloheximide, fluconazole or 5-fluorocytosine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The molecular mechanism of CTBT action has not yet been resolved.</p><p>Currently used antifungals belong to three major classes of agents: azoles, polyenes, and echinocandines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. These compounds target ergosterol biosynthesis, membrane functions and cell wall biosynthesis. Additionally, other currently applied compounds are the pyrimidine, 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC), which acts by inhibiting RNA and DNA synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and ciclopiroxolamine which seems to induce oxidative stress and iron deprivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The intrinsic resistance of human fungal pathogens to these substances is different. Echinocandins are effective in <italic>Candida </italic>prevention and offer a greater spectrum of activity across the various <italic>Candida </italic>species, including also <italic>C. krusei </italic>and <italic>C. glabrata</italic>, which are not reliably covered by azoles e.g. fluconazole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Fungal drug resistance mechanisms involve decreased drug uptake, increased drug export, overexpression or structural modification of the drug target protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Reversal of antifungal drug effectiveness in yeast cells mediated by efflux has been reported for a variety of substances targeting different molecular processes. These are for example the immunosuppressive agents FK506 and cyclosporine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. To overcome drug resistance of human fungal pathogens, new antifungals with novel cellular targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and multidrug resistance reversal agents rendering drug resistant strains sensitive to commercially used antifungals are being developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] but have not surfaced as yet. Studies evaluating combinations of antifungals have shown synergistic and additive activity. However, caution is required, because some antifungal combinations have demonstrated antagonistic activity. Controlled clinical trials are still necessary to explore the various efficacious antifungal combinations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Since the common antifungals are mainly targeting membrane and cell wall components, efficient combination therapy might be reached by involving substances with an alternative mode of action.</p><p>The site and mode of CTBT action have not yet been resolved. CTBT displayed a weak antifungal activity which was unaffected by deletion of the <italic>PDR1 </italic>and <italic>PDR3 </italic>genes encoding the main transcription activators involved in the control of multidrug resistance in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Yeast cells grown in its presence had altered sterol composition and were more sensitive to this compound in the <italic>yap1&#x00394; </italic>genetic background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Here we report insights gained for the mode of CTBT action by systematic identification of yeast genes required for resistance to CTBT in combination with transcriptome analysis. We will show that CTBT causes an unexpected dramatic response to oxidative stress including damage to mitochondria and genomic DNA. These results provide a model for CTBT action and indicate that its synergic effect with commonly used antifungal drugs is due to the combination of oxidative and other stresses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>CTBT action depends on molecular oxygen and is connected by mitochondrial functions</title><p>CTBT has been shown to display cytotoxic activity and the ability to enhance the activity of several antifungal agents at sub-inhibitory concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In disk diffusion assay on YPD medium using the <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>BY4741 wild type and its <italic>rho</italic><sup>- </sup>mutant strains CTBT induced the formation of clear growth inhibition zones that were surrounded by outer inhibition zones corresponding to reduced yeast growth (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, B</xref>). Growth inhibition zones of respiring cells growing on YPGE medium containing glycerol plus ethanol were significantly larger compared to those with fermenting cells on YPD. This suggested that CTBT disrupted mitochondrial functions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Essentially the same results were obtained with the BY4742 and FY1678-28C wild type strains (data not shown). On the other hand, <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>yeast cells grown anaerobically were found to be insensitive to CTBT. As expected for qualitative anaerobicity of our experimental setup, both strains failed to grow anaerobically without ergosterol and unsaturated fatty acids. No inhibition zones were observed when cells of the BY4741 and BY4742 wild type strains were grown in the absence of molecular oxygen on YPD medium supplemented with ergosterol and unsaturated fatty acids (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D, E</xref>). These results clearly indicate that mitochondrial functions and molecular oxygen are involved in the CTBT susceptibility in yeast cells.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>CTBT induced growth inhibition zones on complex media. <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>BY4741 wild type on YPD</bold>.

We screened the <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>haploid deletion mutant collection for altered growth in the presence of CTBT. The wild type strain BY4741 from which the EUROSCARF collection has been derived was unable to grow on YPD medium supplemented with 6 &#x003bc;g/ml of CTBT. Therefore, the hypersensitive mutant strains were identified on YPD media containing 2 and 4 &#x003bc;g/ml of CTBT. Using pin replicator, cells of each mutant strain grown in YPD medium containing G418 sulphate were replicated as quadruplets to CTBT containing medium and to YPD control plate. After 6 days of growth the mutant strains sensitive to 2 or 4 &#x003bc;g/ml of CTBT were identified, collected and their sensitivity to CTBT confirmed in independent assays. This screen of the 4700 haploid gene deletion mutants was carried out once and resulted in the isolation of 169 CTBT hypersensitive mutant strains (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).</p><p>Significantly, some molecular complexes or biochemical pathways were represented by more than one mutant (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

Generally, phenotypic display data do not have large overlaps with transcript profile data. This is due to the fact that pathways activate many target genes in parallel with sometime redundant functions. However, in some cases the overlap is informative since it points to exceptionally important nodes of stress resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Here we found a small number of genes both required for tolerance and significantly induced.

Thus, we suspected that CTBT induces superoxide formation. To determine this directly, MitoSOX Red was used to assess superoxide radical production in live cells. This dye is selectively targeted to the mitochondria where it is selectively oxidized by superoxide and exhibits red fluorescence upon binding to nucleic acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, a large fraction of wild type cells grown for 12 h in YPGal medium in the presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of CTBT accumulated the dye and fluoresced intensively red, compared with control cells grown in the absence of CTBT. Analysis of individual cells under a fluorescence microscope revealed cells with mitochondrial fluorescence. In addition, a small fraction of cells showed red brilliant fluorescence, which may represent severely damaged or dead cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). A high percentage of cells exhibiting mitochondrial fluorescence was also observed in the population of the <italic>sod2&#x00394; </italic>mutant strain treated with a 10-times lower concentration of CTBT.

In fact, when the <italic>sod2&#x00394; </italic>mutant cells were grown for 24 h in YPD medium containing a sub-inhibitory concentration of CTBT the respiration deficient <italic>petite </italic>mutants were induced in high frequency indicating the damage to mtDNA induced by CTBT (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>).

First, CTBT toxicity required molecular oxygen. Second, it has predicted molecular properties of a molecule capable of redox cycling. Third, we detected oxidative stress using the two <italic>in vivo </italic>reporters MitoSOX Red and Yap1-GFP. Fourth, genetic evidence was provided by the isolation of characteristic mutants with defects in oxidative stress scavenging functions. Fifth, transcription profiling showed activation of regulons associated with oxidative stress response. CTBT activity was strictly dependent on the presence of molecular oxygen because no inhibition of growth by this drug was observed under strictly anaerobic conditions.</p><p>Antifungal activity of CTBT was higher on media containing glycerol plus ethanol instead of glucose indicating that developed functional mitochondria might be involved in drug action. This implies that apart from superoxide anion radical (O<sub>2</sub><sup>.-</sup>) and ROS generation CTBT does not have other direct cytotoxic effects. ROS affect many cellular functions by damaging nucleic acids, oxidizing proteins and causing lipid peroxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Dismutation of superoxide into hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen is catalyzed by two superoxide dismutases: the Cu, Zn-depending Sod1p localized in the cytosol and the mitochondrial intermembrane space and the Mn-depending Sod2p which is localized in the mitochondrial matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Among the gene deletion strains selected for increased CTBT sensitivity (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>), the <italic>sod1&#x00394; </italic>and <italic>sod2&#x00394; </italic>mutant strains were found to be the most sensitive. Additionally, the mutants deleted for <italic>SOD1 </italic>and <italic>CCS1</italic>, a copper chaperone essential for Sod1p maturation, had a similar phenotype. CTBT could act as an inhibitor of Sods. Since the <italic>sod1&#x00394;sod2&#x00394; </italic>double mutant cells were also sensitive to CTBT the Sod1p and Sod2p superoxide dismutases cannot be the primary targets of CTBT action. Therefore, CTBT is a producer of superoxide in presence of oxygen.</p><p>CTBT could either directly be a reducing agent or, alternatively, as a cofactor in the context of an enzyme. Our genetic data suggest that CTBT is not acting via a single enzyme because such deletion mutants would be resistant to CTBT and could be easily isolated by genetic means. In fact, in similar screen we were unable to find deletion mutants resistant to CTBT used at the concentration of 10 &#x003bc;g/ml. However, the possibility of a redundant enzymatic activity exists plus the requirement of reducing equivalents. In intact cells, the superoxide anion radical (O<sub>2</sub><sup>.-</sup>) is the precursor of most ROS and is generated under specific bioenergetic conditions at several sites within the mitochondrial electron-transport system. Most of superoxide is converted to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>and oxygen inside and outside the mitochondrial matrix by superoxide dismutases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Non-mitochondrial sources of ROS involve cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>5 </sub>reductase, NADPH oxidases, lipoxygenases, monoamine oxidases, xanthine oxidase and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the main sites of mitochondrial superoxide formation are one NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and facing the matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], two NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductases facing the mitochondrial intermembrane space and the ubiquinol:cytochrome <italic>c </italic>reductase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. This is in line with our scheme proposing CTBT induced superoxide generation in mitochondria (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).

On the other hand one cannot rule out a higher permeability of mitochondrial membranes for CTBT, superoxide or other ROS generated in dysfunctional mitochondria. The increased damage to mutant mitochondria caused by ROS may also reduce the mitochondrial membrane potential under critical level resulting in the arrest of mitochondrial biogenesis required for growth of eukaryotic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>Other significant pathways involved in CTBT susceptibility were also identified by the presence of several genes involved in the same pathway or encoding the subunits of the particular cellular complexes. This concerns genes involved in the <italic>RAD52 </italic>and <italic>RAD6 </italic>epistasis groups of DNA repair, Paf1 complex of RNA polymerase II (<italic>CDC73, HPR1 </italic>and <italic>RTF1</italic>), protein sorting to vacuole (<italic>VPS15, VPS34</italic>), vacuolar ATPase (<italic>TFP1, TFP3, VMA4, VMA21, VMA22</italic>), N-terminal acetyltransferases (<italic>ARD1, NAT1, NAT3</italic>) acetylating many proteins involved in cell cycle, heat shock resistance, mating, sporulation and telomere silencing as well as genes involved in ergosterol metabolism (<italic>DAP1, ERG2, ERG3, ERG6 </italic>and <italic>ERG24</italic>) and tryptophan biosynthesis (<italic>TRP2, TRP3 </italic>and <italic>TRP5</italic>). Along with tryptophan, interruption of the synthesis of cystein, isoleucin and proline also enhanced the CTBT toxicity. The sensitivity displayed by corresponding mutant strains is apparently not the result of the absence of the amino acids because CTBT was toxic on YPD plates that contain all necessary amino acids. It is possible that the accumulation of intermediates enhances the effect of CTBT.</p><p>The overlay of expression data with phenotypic data pointed mainly to superoxide dismutase activity (Sod1, Sod2, Ccs1) and second to the activation of transcription factors Yap1, Cin5/Yap4, and Yap7. Yap1p is a transcription activator involved in the control of multidrug resistance and oxidative stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated both from endogenous and exogenous sources induce accumulation of Yap1p in the nucleus resulting in enhanced transcription of many genes involved in removing or detoxifying ROS. Cin5/Yap4 is activated by oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] like Yap1. The contribution of Yap7 to transcription is less understood. Yap7 is involved in transcriptional activation of the <italic>SOD1, SOD2 </italic>and <italic>CCS1 </italic>genes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://yeastract.com;">http://yeastract.com;</ext-link>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]). However, we found no transcriptional induction of DNA damage specific genes and possibly because this stress type does not surface within the observed time frame. These findings suggest a highly focused primary effect of CTBT on oxidative stress and delayed effects on other pathways.</p><p>CTBT enhances activity of several drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. This synergy becomes perhaps clearer when considering the production of superoxide and other ROS. Our phenotypic screen showed an enhanced sensitivity of mutants in the <italic>RAD52 </italic>and <italic>RAD6 </italic>epistasis groups of DNA repair. 5-Fluorocytosine is a drug which enters nucleotide metabolism and damages the cells by interfering with dNTP and mRNA synthesis. CTBT could act at two levels. Oxidative damage might cause DNA damage and at the same time hamper deoxynucleotide synthesis requiring glutathione or thioredoxin for production via ribonucleotide reductase. Azoles and terbinafin both target ergosterol synthesis. Interestingly, CTBT reduces transcription of most genes for the enzymes of the pathway. Finally, CTBT might exacerbate cycloheximide inhibition on translation by reduction of synthesis of ribosomal protein genes. Oxidative stress causes inactivation of the target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) and thus inactivation of the Sfp1, one major activator of transcription of ribosomal protein genes. An interaction with the popular echinocandines remains to be shown. Up to now the combination of antifungals has been tried <italic>in vitro </italic>in many different combinations. The application of combinations may reduce costs, and importantly shift the effect of the drug towards fungicidal activity (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]). Apart from combinations of classical antifungals (amphotericin B, azoles, echinocandines), unusual combinations lead to unexpected results as for example in the case of azoles plus calcineurin inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] or with membrane active compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>CTBT, apart from its weak antifungal activity, is able to strongly inhibit the proliferation of multidrug resistant yeast cells in combination with subinhibitory concentrations of other antifungals. Its mode of action depending on the molecular oxygen has been resolved using the combination of two genome-wide approaches including the screening of yeast deletion library for CTBT hypersensitivity mutants and transcriptome analysis of yeast cells exposed to this drug. We found that CTBT induces an increased production of superoxide and oxidative stress associated with damage to mitochondria and genomic DNA. Yeast cells deleted in nonessential genes encoding proteins involved mainly in mitochondrial function, DNA repair, transcription and oxidative stress response are hypersensitive to CTBT. CTBT rapidly induces transcription of oxidant and stress response defense genes activated mainly by Yap1 and Yap4/Cin5 transcription factors.</p><p>The exact molecular mechanism of CTBT action, associated with superoxide generation in mitochondria, is not known so far. It does not require a complete and functional respiratory chain as demonstrated by CTBT sensitivity of <italic>rho</italic><sup>- </sup>mutant cells. Theoretical treatment of CTBT activity revealed that this compound might be amenable to one electron reduction. Electrons donated from mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenases or cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1 </sub>complex can lead to CTBT anion radical formation that can be re-oxidized by molecular oxygen generating superoxide probable on the both sides of the inner mitochondrial membrane (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).
