Analysis of PER subcellular distribution and repressor competence in the PER dimer mutant revealed defects in PER nuclear translocation and a disruption of rhythmic period transcription.

These complexes are usually heterodimers (that is, made up of two different clock proteins) and appear to enter the nucleus at certain times of the circadian day in order to shut down their own gene expression by deactivating specific transcription factors. After progressive phosphorylation the repressor proteins eventually are degraded so that a new cycle of transcription can begin. Here we present evidence that in addition to heterodimeric complexes, the clock protein PERIOD (PER) also forms homodimers (pairs of identical proteins). Based on a structural model a PER mutant was designed, which is not able to form homodimers but can still bind to its partner TIMELESS (TIM). Flies expressing this mutant PER protein show abnormal clock function in regard to PER nuclear translocation, repressor activity, and behavioral rhythms. The circadian clock model in flies therefore needs to be extended by adding the PER:PER homodimer as a functional unit. Recent structural studies with mammalian PER proteins suggest that homodimers between clock proteins are an important general feature of eukaryotic clocks.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>The circadian molecular clock model needs to be extended by adding the PERIOD:PERIOD homodimer as a functional unit in rhythm generation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.

Although it had originally been postulated that the PER:TIM interaction is required for nuclear translocation of both proteins, it seems now generally accepted that in flies PER and TIM can enter the nucleus separately &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000003-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000003-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;.

A F&#x000f6;rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based study performed with PER and TIM proteins in an embryonic <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell line (S2) revealed that PER and TIM form a complex immediately after their synthesis in the cytoplasm, but separate right before nuclear translocation and enter the nucleus independently &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000003-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;.

This suggests that events during or after PER:TIM formation are important for the correct timing of nuclear entry. These events most likely involve the reciprocal regulation of the phosphorylation status of PER by DBT and CKII, whereby CKII function seems crucially important for efficient nuclear localization of PER in wild-type flies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000003-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000003-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000003-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000003-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In order to enter the nucleus in absence of TIM, PER needs somehow to be protected from DBT-induced degradation. One possible way to stabilize PER in the absence of TIM could be the formation of PER:PER homodimers, which could either form after the PER:TIM complexes dissolve, or co-exist with PER:TIM.

The R345E mutation we introduced is expected to disrupt the salt-bridge observed between Arg345 in PAS-A of molecule 1 and Glu566 in the &#x003b1;F-helix of molecule 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000003-g001">Figure 1</xref>B&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000003-g001">1</xref>D); &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000003-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;). As in the case of W482E, flies expressing the R345E transgene accumulated only very little R345E PER compared to controls, indicating that this mutant protein is also unstable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000003-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000003-sg001">Figure S1</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>).</p><p>R345E and W482E carry a mutation in the PAS-A, and CLD domain, respectively, which have been described to be involved in binding to the clock protein TIM in cell culture &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000003-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000003-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore, instead or in addition to disrupting PER:PER binding, the mutations could interfere with formation of the PER:TIM dimer. Since PER and TIM heterodimerization is thought to stabilize PER &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000003-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000003-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;, this could explain the low levels of our mutant PER proteins. We therefore decided to generate a PER mutant that, based on the 3-D structure, should interfere only with the formation of PER:PER dimers and not with the PER:TIM interaction. Residue Met560 is situated in the &#x003b1;F-helix contacting Val243 in the PAS-A domain of the dimerizing molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000003-g001">Figure 1</xref>B&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000003-g001">1</xref>D). Although Val243 has been implicated both in PER:PER and PER:TIM interactions (it is the site of the original <italic>per<sup>L</sup></italic> mutation: V243D), no such interactions have been reported for any residues in the &#x003b1;F-helix or C-domain. The M560D mutant we generated indeed exhibited robust levels of mutant PER protein, indicating that stabilizing PER:TIM interactions are not disrupted by the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000003-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). In agreement with the results just described, a PER W482E-M560D double mutant expressed a low level of mutated PER protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000003-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000003-sg001">Figure S1</xref>).</p><p>Since the M560D mutant exhibited wild-type levels of PER, we analyzed the temporal expression profile of this mutant PER protein. For this, we performed western blots with extracts prepared from flies at six different time points throughout the day, which were probed with anti-PER antibodies. We compared temporal expression between nontransgenic <italic>per<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> control flies, PER wild-type transgenics, and the M560D mutants at six different time points throughout the day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000003-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). The nontransgenic <italic>per<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> controls exhibited the typical robust PER oscillations in abundance and mobility (because of temporal regulated phosphorylation, &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000003-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d;) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000003-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, left panels; e.g., &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000003-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d;). Similarly, the transgene encoded wild-type PER proteins exhibited daily abundance and mobility oscillations, although the mobility shifts appeared to be reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000003-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, upper right panel). The reduced mobility changes observed for the transgene-encoded wild-type proteins were apparent in several independent transgenic lines both containing the HA or <italic>c-myc</italic> tag (unpublished data). Since the transgenic proteins contain the entire PER open reading frame, the altered migration properties are likely caused by the different tags attached to the C termini of PER.</p><p>Nevertheless the wild-type transgenic PER proteins underwent robust daily oscillations, which were absent or severely diminished from the M560D mutant proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000003-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000003-sg002">Figure S2</xref>A). The M560D protein was almost equally expressed during the 24-h day; and during all time points analyzed, fast and slow migrating mutant PER species were present. Quantification of the band intensities revealed that fast migrating, hypophosphorylated forms of PER are more abundant in the late night in the M560D mutant compared to the slower migrating phosphorylated forms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000003-sg002">Figure S2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000003-g002">Figure 2</xref>B; note the distinct fast migrating forms in the mutant at ZT16 and ZT20). Although as discussed above, the tags attached to the proteins likely contribute to this effect, this finding indicates that the M560D protein is less efficiently phosphorylated compared to the wild-type protein. In any case, a significant reduction in the overall PER abundance rhythm could be observed in all M560D transgenic lines analyzed, independent of the insertion site or type of tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000003-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000003-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). If the M560D mutant indeed interferes with PER:PER homodimerization, our results imply that dimer formation is necessary for proper PER cycling. We therefore tested whether wild-type polypeptides form homodimers in the living fly, and if their formation may be compromised by the M560D mutation.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>PER:PER Dimers Are Present in the Fly and Are Disrupted by the M560D Mutation</title><p>Homodimer formation in flies was tested by performing co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP) experiments making use of the HA and <italic>c-myc</italic> tags attached to the wild-type and mutant PER proteins. <italic>per<sup>01</sup></italic> flies homozygous (on Chromosome <italic>2</italic>) for a transgene encoding a HA-tagged PER and homozygous (on Chromosome <italic>3</italic>) for a transgene encoding a <italic>c-myc</italic>-tagged PER were synchronized to a 12-h:12-h light&#x02013;dark (LD) cycle and collected at ZT20, a time where homodimer formation was previously reported &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000003-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;.

To test if HA-tagged PER molecules are able to bind to anti-c-myc coated beads unspecifically, we subjected extract from flies expressing only the PER-HA proteins to the same CoIP. The lack of anti-HA signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000003-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, lane 6) clearly shows that PER-HA can only be pulled down in the presence of PER-c-myc. It should be mentioned that we are only able to detect homodimers formed between HA and c-myc tagged molecules and not PER-HA:PER-HA and PER-c-myc:PER-c-myc dimers, which are likely to be formed at similar rates. Therefore, the overall levels of PER:PER homodimers are expected to be two times higher compared to those we detected in our CoIP experiments (there are two possible ways to form PER-HA:PER-c-myc dimers, but only one to form dimers between PER molecules carrying identical tags).</p><fig id="pbio-1000003-g003" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Formation of PER:PER Dimers Is Disrupted by the M560D Mutant</title><p>CoIP experiments with flies containing double-homozygous wild-type PER (A) or M560D PER (B) encoding transgenes fused to HA and <italic>c-myc</italic> tags (lanes 1&#x02013;3), or homozygous transgenes fused to HA (lanes 4&#x02013;6).

The lack of signal in lane 6 indicates that HA-tagged proteins do not bind unspecifically to anti-MYC beads. Note that both wild-type and M560D mutant proteins bind to TIM (lane 3, upper and lower panels). This experiment was repeated three times with similar results, except that the anti-HA signal of M560D flies was completely absent in the &#x0201c;Beads&#x0201d; fraction in the other two trials (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000003-g005">Figure 5</xref>A).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.1000003.g003"/></fig><p>The same experiment was then performed using double-homozygous <italic>per<sup>01</sup></italic> M560D-HA/M560D-<italic>c-myc</italic> flies.

This therefore explains the stability of the mutant M560D protein.

For example at 25 &#x000b0;C, when wild-type control flies where relatively inactive during the siesta, M560D mutant flies showed increased activity levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000003-g004">Figure 4</xref>A).

Moreover, the number of rhythmic animals and the period length did not vary significantly at 18 &#x000b0;C and 29 &#x000b0;C, indicating that the PER-HA and PER-<italic>c-myc</italic> fusion proteins are able to replace endogenous PER protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000003-g004">Figure 4</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000003-g004">4</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000003-st001">Table S1</xref>). In contrast, depending on the temperature, only between 30&#x00025; and 60&#x00025; (40&#x00025; at 25 &#x000b0;C) of the M560D mutant flies were rhythmic in DD, indicating that the circadian clock is drastically impaired in these flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000003-g004">Figure 4</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000003-st001">Table S1</xref>). Nevertheless, the period length did not vary much between the different temperatures, indicating that temperature compensation is not affected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000003-st001">Table S1</xref>). As was observed for flies from the two control strains, overall rhythmicity for M560D flies was correlated with an increase in temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000003-g004">Figure 4</xref>C, left panel). At each of the different temperatures tested the M560D mutants showed slightly longer periods compared to transgenic controls (&#x0223c;1 h longer at each temperature, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000003-g004">Figure 4</xref>C, right panel; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000003-st001">Table S1</xref>). This period lengthening could be due to the specific mutation, since in the homodimer M560D is predicted to disrupt the interaction with the <italic>per<sup>L</sup></italic> site Val243. Alternatively, slightly reduced overall PER levels in the M560D transgenics compared to the wild-type transgenics could account for the period lengthening, because <italic>per</italic> function is dosage sensitive (e.g., females carrying only one copy of the <italic>X-</italic>linked <italic>per</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> allele have 25-h periods, &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000003-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d;). In any case, together with the biochemical results described, the behavioral defects observed in the M560D mutants clearly point to a crucial function of the PER:PER dimer within the circadian clock.</p><p>We also analyzed the behavioral rhythms of the other mutants we generated (W482E, R345E, and the double mutant W482E M560D). Neither of the mutant proteins was able to restore rhythmic behavior in <italic>per<sup>01</sup></italic> in LD or DD conditions in more than 20&#x00025; of the flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000003-g004">Figure 4</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000003-st001">Table S1</xref>), consistent with the low mutant PER protein levels present in these flies. The few rhythmic flies exhibited widely variable periods, and temperature compensation was severely compromised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000003-g004">Figure 4</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000003-st001">Table S1</xref>). Although this effect can be due to many different reasons, it may indicate that PER:TIM interactions are more important for proper temperature compensation compared to PER:PER (temperature compensation in M560D flies is normal, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000003-g004">Figure 4</xref>C).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>The M560D Mutant Reduces the Repressive Function of PER In Vivo</title><p>So far our data indicate that disruption of the PER:PER dimer interferes with circadian clock function and results in abnormal behavioral rhythms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000003-g002">Figures 2</xref>B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000003-g003">3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000003-g004">4</xref>).

One possibility we tested is that PER's function as a repressor of CLK/CYC activated <italic>per</italic> and <italic>tim</italic> transcription involves the PER:PER dimer. In order to test this we first analyzed if the abundance of PER:PER dimers varies throughout the circadian day. If the PER:PER homodimer is important for PER's function as a repressor, one would expect to see a higher accumulation of the dimer at times when PER is nuclear, which corresponds roughly with the second half of the night until the early day (ZT18 to ZT4) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000003-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000003-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;.

Indeed, the temporal analysis of PER:PER abundance revealed that peak amounts are reached at ZT2, suggesting that the PER:PER dimer is an active repressor unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000003-g005">Figure 5</xref>A).

A single amino-acid replacement (M560D) largely disrupted homodimer formation, resulting in severe behavioral and molecular phenotypes. These results point to a prominent function for the PER dimer within the circadian clock. The mutation just noted specifically interferes with PER:PER and not PER:TIM formation, indicating that the observed phenotypes are due to faulty PER:PER dimer formation. The normal interaction between the mutant PER protein and TIM also indicates that the circadian phenotypes are not due to abnormal function of a monomeric PER protein, although we can not completely rule out this possibility. Moreover, this alternative interpretation of our data would imply that formation of PER:PER dimers (which occurs within the fly and is probably under circadian control: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000003-g003">Figures 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000003-g005">5</xref>A) has no functional meaning, because disruption of this homodimer would have no effect on the clock. The most likely interpretation of our data is therefore that the effects caused by the M560D mutation are due to the disruption of the PER:PER homodimer rather than being caused by a faulty monomeric PER protein.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Residues Important for PER:PER and PER:TIM Interactions</title><p>Our in vivo findings are supported by biochemical studies analyzing homodimer-formation of the N-terminal crystallized PER:PER fragment (amino acids 232&#x02013;599). Although the M560D mutant in the context of this fragment runs as a dimer in gel filtration experiments, the affinity of the dimer is significantly reduced by the mutation (see accompanying report). Furthermore, the V243D mutant (<italic>per<sup>L</sup></italic>) version of this PER fragment and a fragment entirely lacking the &#x003b1;F-helix behave as monomers in gel filtration, demonstrating the importance of the PAS-A-&#x003b1;F interface (including Val243 and Met560) for dimerization in solution &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000003-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Unlike our in vivo results, when the M560D mutant in the context of the whole PER protein was expressed in S2 cells, it efficiently entered the nucleus and also acted as a potent repressor &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000003-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;. This discrepancy is likely linked to the fact that events in S2 cells not necessarily reflect the in vivo situation (for example TIM was not co-expressed in the study just cited) as was observed repeatedly in the past (e.g., cytoplasmic localization of PER&#x00394; in S2 cells versus nuclear localization in flies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000003-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000003-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;) and underscores the importance of in vivo studies.</p><p>Except for the M560D mutation all other mutant proteins we analyzed were unstable in flies. The W482E mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000003-g001">Figure 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000003-g001">1</xref>C) is predicted to disrupt dimer formation at two symmetrical positions between the Trp482 located at the tip of the &#x003b2;D&#x02032;-&#x003b2;E&#x02032; loop in PAS-B and the hydrophobic pocket formed by the &#x003b2;A, &#x003b1;B, and &#x003b1;C strands and helices of the other PER molecule &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000003-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;. As expected from this disruption of a prominent dual interaction point, the W482E weakens the dimer in the context of the PER (232&#x02013;599) PAS domain fragment (see accompanying Research Article). Moreover, and similar to M560D, in S2 cells a W482A mutation shows enhanced repression compared to the wild-type fragment in the context of full length PER &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000003-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;. Since the purified PAS domain fragment carrying the W482E mutation is stable and properly folded (see accompanying Research Article), the instability of the W482E mutation in flies suggests that in vivo additional factors contribute to PER stability. One important feature missing from the stable PAS domain fragments, is a newly discovered N-terminal interaction domain with SLIMB, which is required for efficient degradation of PER &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000003-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. The same applies for the R345E mutant, which is expected to disrupt a salt bridge between Arg345 on the &#x003b2;D strand of molecule 1 and Glu566 located on the &#x003b1;F-helix of molecule 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000003-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000003-g001">1</xref>C). Most likely the TIM protein and phosphatase activity supply this additional stability in vivo as discussed above. All mutants analyzed in the current study (except M560D), map to the PAS-A (R345E) or the PAS-B (W482E) domains, which have been implicated in directly mediating the PER:TIM interaction (&#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000003-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000003-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;, also see accompanying report). The most simple explanation for the observed instability of PER mutants containing amino acid changes in one of the PAS domains is therefore that they also interfere with the PER:TIM interaction (see accompanying Research Article). If true, mutants mapping to the &#x003b1;F helix and predicted to weaken dimer formation (like M560D) should result in stable proteins that are still able to interact with TIM. Such candidates include Met564 and Glu566, predicted to weaken the interaction with Val243 and Arg345, respectively &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000003-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The <italic>per<sup>L</sup></italic> mutation (V243D) lengthens the free-running period dramatically &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000003-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d; and also compromises temperature compensation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000003-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d;.

Indeed, we observed normal interactions between M560D PER and TIM, further supporting this hypothesis. It follows, that whereas the Val243 residue of PER is involved in mediating both PER:TIM and PER:PER interactions, the Met560 residue mediates only (or mainly) homodimerization. Further support for the importance of the Val243 residue for PER:TIM interactions came from a genetic screen, in which a &#x0201c;suppressor of <italic>per<sup>L</sup></italic>&#x0201d; mutation (<italic>tim<sup>SL</sup></italic>), which ameliorated both phenotypes (period length and temperature compensation), was isolated and found to map to the <italic>timeless</italic> gene &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000003-b059">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000003-b060">60</xref>&#x0005d;.

Alternatively, a different signal could promote the PER:TIM break down, and the PER:PER dimer could serve as a prime substrate for CKII, followed by nuclear translocation. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that CKII mutants and M560D PER mutants share similar phenotypes. Both result in period lengthening without compromising temperature compensation, although CKII mutants have a much more drastic effect on clock speed compared to M560D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000003-g004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000003-st001">Table S1</xref>) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000003-b030">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000003-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;.

It is likely that M560D does not completely block homodimer formation, as indicated by the weak band we sometimes see in the M560D CoIP experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000003-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). We do see nuclear M560D PER, mainly within the small LNv cells, but much less frequently in the large LNv's. Perhaps this difference is simply due to the smaller cytoplasmic volume in the s-LNv compared to the l-LNv, which could enhance homodimer formation because of a higher local concentration of monomeric proteins.

CoIP samples were separated on the same gels, and proteins were blotted to Nitrocellulose at 500 mA for 1 h with a Semi-dry electro blotting unit (Fisherbrand) according to the manual. After blotting, the nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 5&#x00025; nonfat milk in TBS-T at room temperature for 1 h. First antibodies (5&#x00025; nonfat milk/TBS-T) were diluted and incubated at 4 &#x000b0;C overnight, followed by secondary antibody (5&#x00025; nonfat milk/TBS-T) incubation at room temperature for 2 h. Dilution of first antibodies were 1:10,000 for rabbit anti-PER, 1:2,000 for rat anti-TIM, and 1:1,000 for mouse anti HA-tag (MMS-101p, Covance). The dilutions of HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were 1:100,000 for goat-anti-rabbit IgG, 1:25,000 for goat anti rat IgG, and 1:5,000 for goat-anti-mouse IgG. ECL substrates were used, and X-ray films were developed according to manufacturer's instructions.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Luciferase monitoring.</title><p>Bioluminescence assays were performed as previously described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000003-b057">57</xref>&#x0005d;.
