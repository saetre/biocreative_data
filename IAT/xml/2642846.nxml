As such, GPCRs are currently the target of several pharmaceuticals aimed at treating pain, inflammation, and a broad range of diseases including cancer, cardiac disease, and diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. Of the more than 700 GPCRs identified by the Human Genome Project, 150 or more of these receptors are annotated as &#x0201c;orphan&#x0201d; or functionally uncharacterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>]. Prior to its identification as the nicotinic acid (niacin) receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>], GPR109A was classified also as an orphan GPCR. GPR109A is expressed primarily in adipocytes and immune cells. Indeed, it is the abundant expression of the receptor in adipocytes that led to its identification as the receptor for niacin, a drug widely used for decades in the treatment of hyperlipidemia. GPR109A is coupled to the inhibitory G protein G<sub>i</sub>. Activation of the receptor with its ligands results in a pertussis toxin-sensitive decrease in cAMP levels. One of the actions of cAMP in adipocytes is to stimulate the hormone-sensitive lipase by protein phosphorylation, which leads to triglyceride hydrolysis and release of free fatty acids into the circulation. Niacin, by its ability to reduce cAMP levels, decreases the activity of lipase and prevents the release of free fatty acids from fat stores.</p><p>While the discovery of GPR109A as a receptor for niacin helps to explain the mechanism of action of the drug, it sheds little light on any physiologic function of the receptor, as circulating levels of niacin in normal individuals not taking the drug for therapeutic purposes are too low to activate the receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. This led to the identification of &#x003b2;-hydroxybutyrate (&#x003b2;-HB) as the physiologic ligand for the receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. As with niacin, interaction of &#x003b2;-HB with the receptor decreases intracellular cAMP levels. Since &#x003b2;-HB is generated in the liver from fatty acid oxidation following fat mobilization from adipocytes, it is believed that &#x003b2;-HB, through its interaction with GPR109A present on adipocytes, may inhibit triglyceride hydrolysis and release of free fatty acids as a negative feedback regulatory mechanism, promoting the maintenance of metabolic homeostasis during conditions such as starvation and diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>].</p><p>Though GPR109A is most noted for its anti-lipolytic effects in adipocytes, recent studies demonstrate that the activation of the receptor produces differential responses depending on the location/cell-type in which the receptor is expressed. For example, activation of GPR109A on dermal dendritic cells or dermal macrophages mediates the characteristic cutaneous vasodilation or &#x0201c;flushing&#x0201d; response associated with chronic therapeutic use of niacin, an effect very different from the antilipolytic actions seen in adipocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. In murine macrophages, GPR109A expression is upregulated by cytokines such as interferon-gamma (IFN-&#x003b3;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>], suggesting a role for GPR109A in immunity and inflammation. Thus, GPR109A expression and function likely extends beyond adipocytes and immune cells.</p><p>In the present study, we asked whether GPR109A is expressed also in retina. We were interested in expression of the receptor in this tissue for several reasons. First, chronic use of niacin at high doses necessary for therapeutic efficacy as a lipid-lowering agent is associated with several side effects, including an ocular complication known as niacin maculopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. This suggests that the niacin receptor GPR109A may be present also in retina and contribute to the pathogenesis of maculopathy. Second, activation of GPR109A is associated with decreased cAMP levels. The essential role of cAMP in maintenance of neuronal health in retina and overall visual function is widely accepted, as alterations in cAMP levels severely compromise retinal function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. Thus, if GPR109A is expressed in retina, it is possible that alterations in cAMP levels as a consequence of GPR109A activation might play a role in these vital retinal processes. Under normal physiologic conditions, in the absence of niacin drug therapy, this would likely be of little relevance; &#x003b2;-HB, the predominant ketone body in circulation and endogenous ligand for GPR109A, is normally found at low levels in the circulation (&#x0003c;50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M), concentrations insufficient to activate the receptor (concentrations necessary to elicit half-maximal effect on the receptor, 300&#x02013;800&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M). &#x003b2;-HB levels increase several-fold (approximately 3&#x000a0;mM), however, during periods of prolonged fasting, starvation, and strenuous exercise to maintain the energy status in vital organs, including brain and retina. The same is true in poorly controlled diabetes (especially type 1 diabetes), when circulating levels of &#x003b2;-HB may increase to as much as roughly 20&#x000a0;mM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]. Equally interesting is the postulated role for GPR109A in the inflammatory response in certain cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. Increasing evidence points to the involvement of inflammatory processes in the pathogenesis of several retinal diseases, including diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. Thus, determining whether GPR109A is expressed in retinal cells and understanding how the receptor is regulated in retina would be of immense clinical relevance, particularly in diabetic conditions when levels of &#x003b2;-HB are substantially elevated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>Reagents used in cell culture, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell isolation, and RNA extraction, Hoechst 33342, Image-iT FX signal enhancer, and secondary antibodies were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).

The antibody was raised against the peptide sequence RKKTLGEPDNNRSTSV, which corresponds to residues 311&#x02013;326 of mouse GPR109A. The corresponding sequence in rat GPR109A is RRKTLGEPDNNRSTSV, which differs from the antigenic peptide in only one amino acid. The corresponding sequence in human GPR109A is QRKMTGEPDNNRSTSV, which differs from the antigenic peptide in four amino acids. We investigated the species specificity of the antibody and found that the antibody recognizes GPR109A in all three species. Rodents have a single gene coding for GPR109A, whereas humans have two closely related genes coding for highly homologous receptors (GPR109A and GPR109B) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. Even though the amino acid sequences of GPR109A and GPR109B are similar, GPR109B does not function as a niacin or &#x003b2;-hydroxybutyrate receptor. Since the region containing the antigenic peptide is identical in GPR109A and GPR109B, the antibody is expected to recognize not only GPR109A but also GPR109B in human tissues or cell lines.</p><p>Prior to use in immunohistochemical studies, the specificity of the antibody was confirmed by analysis of antibody staining in a cell line that does not express GPR109A constitutively. Briefly, rat, mouse, or human GPR109A was expressed in cells via lipofectamine-mediated transient transfection (transfection efficiency &#x0003e;90%). Immunofluorescence experiments were then performed in parallel in nontransfected cells and in GPR109A-transfected cells. Nontransfected cells served as a negative control. Normal rabbit pre-immune serum was used as an additional negative control, as was peptide-blocked antigenic peptide. For peptide blocking experiments, the anti-GPR109A antibody was neutralized with 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml of the antigenic peptide and used as a negative control for immunofluorescence studies. No immunopositive signal was detected when the antibody was used in nontransfected cells, cells incubated with pre-immune serum, or peptide-blocked antigenic peptide (data not shown). However, the antibody gave strong positive signal in cells transfected with the rat, mouse, or human GPR109A construct.</p></sec><sec><title>Animals</title><p>The present study used 3-week-old C57BL/6 mice for the preparation of total RNA from neural retina and RPE/eyecup, and for the establishment of primary RPE cell cultures. Albino (Balb/c) mice, age 6&#x02013;9 weeks, were used for immunofluorescence and fluorescent in situ hybridization analyses. All animals were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN). Mice were maintained in clear plastic cages and subjected to standard light cycles (12 h light/12 h dark). Mice were fed Harlan&#x02019;s Teklad rodent diet #8604 (min. crude protein, 24.0%; min. crude fat, 4.0%; max. crude fiber, 4.5%) and water was available ad libitum.

All culture media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin. The culture medium was replaced with fresh medium every other day.

For immunocytochemistry, ARPE-19, RGC-5, or rMC-1 cells were cultured on glass coverslips for 1&#x02013;2 days; ARPE-19 cells were not polarized.</p></sec><sec><title>Establishment of primary RPE cell cultures from mouse eyes</title><p>C57Bl/6 mice were used for preparation of primary RPE cell cultures according to our previously published method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. Briefly, enucleated mouse eyes were rinsed in 5% povidone-iodine solution, followed by rinsing with sterile Hank&#x02019;s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS). Eyes were then placed in cold RPE cell culture medium (DMEM:F12), supplemented with 25% fetal bovine serum, 0.1&#x000a0;mg/ml gentamicin, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/ml streptomycin. To aid in the degradation of extracellular matrix components and enhance the dissociation of RPE from neural retina and choroid, eyes were then incubated in HBSS, containing 19.5 U/ml collagenase and 38 U/ml testicular hyaluronidase for 40 min at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, followed by incubation in HBSS containing 0.1% trypsin (pH 8) for 50 min at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C.

Isolated RPE cells were collected in a 15&#x000a0;ml centrifuge tube and centrifuged at at 1,228&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;g for 10 min (Thermo Medilite Centrifuge, ThermoScientific, Waltham, MA), followed by resuspension in RPE cell media. RPE cells were then cultured at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. The purity of RPE cells was evaluated by the expression of CRALBP (a marker for RPE cells and M&#x000fc;ller cells) and RPE-65 (a marker for RPE cells) using specific antibodies.</p></sec><sec><title>RT&#x02013;PCR</title><p>Neural retina and RPE/eyecup were prepared according to our previously published method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>] and used for preparation of total RNA.

The methods of Mullis and Faloona [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>] and Stoflet et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>] were employed to generate digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled riboprobes, using the aforedescribed PCR primers for RT&#x02013;PCR analysis. Briefly, the 23 bp T7 promoter sequence (5&#x02032;-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGA G-3&#x02032;) was appended to the 5&#x02032; end of the antisense primer such that the promoter was incorporated into the PCR product. Subsequent amplification of the target DNA (cDNA prepared using RNA from mouse RPE/eyecup) yielded a PCR product that contained the T7 promoter sequence upstream of the mouse GPR109A sequence. To produce a template for transcription of the sense (control) strand of the amplified region, we designed an additional primer set with the T7 promoter sequence added to the sense-strand GPR109A primer. These templates were then used for the synthesis of riboprobes (antisense and sense) with T7 RNA polymerase. A DIG tag for antibody labeling was added to sense and antisense probes using a DIG RNA labeling kit (Roche). Mouse eyes were frozen immediately in Tissue-Tek Optimal Cutting Temperature compound (OCT; Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA), and sections were made at 10-&#x000b5;m thickness and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Sections were rinsed in ice-cold PBS and treated with 0.1% diethylpyrocarbonate prepared in PBS to facilitate penetration of the labeled probe. Sections were permeabilized further with 1&#x000a0;mg/ml proteinase K in PBS for 4 min. The proteinase K activity was stopped by rinsing the slides in 2&#x000a0;mg/ml glycine in PBS. Sections were washed in PBS, equilibrated in 5% saline-sodium citrate (SSC), and prehybridized for 2 h at 58&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C in 50% formamide, 5% SSC, and 50&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/ml salmon sperm DNA (pH 7.4). Sections were hybridized with 1&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/ml DIG-labeled antisense or sense probes and incubated overnight at 58&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. The sections were washed under high stringency conditions, first in 2% SSC for 1 h at 65&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, and then in 0.1% SSC for 1 h at 65&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, and transferred to PBS. Immunologic detection of the probe was performed by blocking sections with PBS-BB (PBS + 1% BSA, 0.2% powdered skim milk, and 0.3% Triton X-100) for 30 min at room temperature. DIG-labeled probes were detected by incubating the sections with 1:1000 peroxidase-conjugated mouse monoclonal anti-digoxigenin antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were then washed in PBS, followed by incubation with 1:500 anti-mouse TSA-Cy3 conjugate 30 min at room temperature. Next, 1:10,000 Hoechst 33342 was used to counterstain the cell nuclei, and coverslips were mounted using Vectashield Hardset mounting medium.

However, interpretation of the data from ARPE-19 cells is subject to limitations. First, these cells are transformed and, therefore, there is no guarantee that the results from this cell line are extrapolatable to normal RPE cells. Second, ARPE-19 cells are of human origin and thus are expected to express both GPR109A and GPR109B. This was evident from the RT&#x02013;PCR data. Immunofluorescence studies showing positive signals with GPR109A antibody in ARPE-19 cells are difficult to interpret because the antibody would not differentiate between GPR109A protein and GPR109B protein. In this regard, rodents offer a fortuitous model system in which to study GPR109A expression/function, as they only have a single gene coding for the receptor. Therefore, we analyzed GPR109A expression in primary cultures of RPE cells isolated from mouse eyes (mRPE). Prior to analyzing GPR109A expression in these cells, we evaluated the purity of the cells by morphology and by analyzing the expression of various RPE-specific cell markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>). Phase-contrast microscopic analysis of the cell preparations after 6 days in culture indicated that the cells had large spherical nuclei and contained numerous dark deposits, suggestive of the presence of pigment granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>). Analysis of the cells at higher magnification after several days in culture also indicated that in addition to displaying robust pigmentation, cultures of these cells also begin to exhibit the classic cobblestone morphology characteristic of RPE cells in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B</xref>). Using immunofluorescence methods, we analyzed the expression of CRALBP, a protein that is considered to be a marker for RPE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6C</xref>). The cells were highly positive for CRALBP. However, as retinal M&#x000fc;ller cells are also known to express CRALBP, the RPE cultures were analyzed also for expression of RPE-65, a RPE-specific marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6D</xref>). Hoechst 33342 dye was used to counterstain all cell nuclei. Greater than 95% of cells were positive for RPE-65 protein expression. Immunofluorescence for the neuronal marker MAP2 was not positive (data not shown).

The antilipolytic activity of niacin is explainable by the presence of the receptor on adipocytes; the biologic role of the receptor on immune cells remains to be determined. Recently, &#x003b2;-HB was found to be the physiologic ligand for the receptor. Patients with diabetes often have marked elevated levels of this metabolite in circulation. These factors combined with our ongoing interest in the retina (particularly diabetic retinopathy) prompted us to ask whether GPR109A is expressed in retina. Prior to the present study, expression of this receptor in retina has not been reported in the literature.</p><p>Analysis of GPR109A expression in intact retina by RT&#x02013;PCR and FISH demonstrated the presence of GPR109A mRNA exclusively in RPE. These expression data were corroborated by immunofluorescence analysis of GPR109A protein. As RPE is a polarized cell with distinct apical and basolateral membranes, further studies were devoted to determining whether GPR109A expressed in the RPE cell layer distributes preferentially to one or both of these distinct membrane compartments. To address this issue, we employed double-labeling immunofluorescent techniques using a marker specific for RPE apical membrane (MCT1). These studies demonstrated unequivocally that in mouse retina, GPR109A protein preferentially distributes to the basolateral membrane in RPE. Data obtained using intact mouse retinal sections were verified by examining GPR109A mRNA and protein expression in cultured RPE (ARPE-19), ganglion (RGC-5), and rMC-1 (M&#x000fc;ller) cells. Analysis of GPR109A mRNA and protein in these cells demonstrated expression of the receptor only in ARPE-19 cells. Because ARPE-19 cells are of human origin, the cells expressed not only GPR109A but also GPR109B. Since GPR109A and GPR109B exhibit 96% amino acid sequence identity, it is not possible to generate antibodies, which would recognize only GPR109A in human tissues. Only GPR109A functions as a high-affinity receptor for nicotinate. In contrast, GPR109B does not recognize nicotinate as a ligand. The expression of GPR109A in RPE was further confirmed with mouse primary RPE cells as rodents have only a single gene coding for the receptor.</p><p>The data presented in the present report demonstrate for the first time the expression of GPR109A in the retina and, even more interesting and important, the restriction of its expression to RPE where the receptor localizes to the basolateral membrane. These findings provide the basis for future studies designed to determine the functional relevance of GPR109A expression in retina. The localization of the receptor to the RPE basolateral membrane places the receptor in a location conducive to its exposure to substrates in the choroidal circulation. Binding of ligand to the GPR109A is associated with decreases in cAMP levels within the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. In the present study, we found this to be true also in RPE cells.</p><p>In addition to its roles in the phagocytic turnover of photoreceptor cells, and maintenance of the outer blood-retinal barrier, the RPE cell layer is obligatory for the supply of nutrients to the outer retina, and cAMP is an important regulator of this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. Thus, alterations of cAMP levels in this cellular layer have tremendous implications in terms of nutrient transport and overall neuronal health and retinal function. Under normal physiologic conditions, the GPR109A may have little relevance because of low levels of &#x003b2;-HB or nicotinate in circulation; however, in conditions such as uncontrolled type 1 diabetes, when circulating levels of &#x003b2;-HB are elevated to levels that could have a maximal impact on receptor activity, the expression of the GPR109A in the basolateral membrane of RPE assumes great significance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, &#x003b2;-HB may not be the only physiologic ligand for the receptor. Since this metabolite becomes relevant only under conditions such as prolonged starvation and uncontrolled diabetes, in terms of activation of GPR109A, it would mean that the receptor does not have any biologic relevance under normal conditions. This seems unlikely. We speculate that there may be other ligands, not yet identified, that may activate the receptor even under conditions when the levels of &#x003b2;-HB are not elevated. Thus, our discovery that GPR109A is expressed in retina, particularly in the basolateral membrane of the RPE, has important physiologic and pathologic implications.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grant 5 K99
