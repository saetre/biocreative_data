Myometrial stretch has been implicated clinically in the initiation of labor and the etiology of preterm labor, but the molecular mechanisms involved in the human have not been determined. We investigated the mechanisms by which gestation-dependent stretch contributes to myometrial activation, by using human uterine samples from gynecologic hysterectomies and Cesarean sections. Here we demonstrate that the Ca requirement for activation of the contractile filaments in human myometrium increases with caldesmon protein content during gestation and that an increase in caldesmon phosphorylation can reverse this inhibitory effect during labor. By using phosphotyrosine screening and mass spectrometry of stretched human myometrial samples, we identify 3 stretch-activated focal adhesion proteins, FAK, p130Cas, and alpha actinin. FAK-Y397, which signals integrin engagement, is constitutively phosphorylated in term human myometrium whereas FAK-Y925, which signals downstream ERK activation, is phosphorylated during stretch. We have recently identified smooth muscle Archvillin (SmAV) as an ERK regulator. A newly produced SmAV-specific antibody demonstrates gestation-specific increases in SmAV protein levels and stretch-specific increases in SmAV association with focal adhesion proteins. Thus, whereas increases in caldesmon levels suppress human myometrium contractility during pregnancy, stretch-dependent focal adhesion signaling, facilitated by the ERK activator SmAV, can contribute to myometrial activation. These results suggest that focal adhesion proteins may present new targets for drug discovery programs aimed at regulation of uterine contractility.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In late pregnancy increasing fetal growth significantly increases uterine wall tension. Compared to the nonpregnant uterus, human uterine weight increases from 70 grams to about 1100 grams at term pregnancy. Its total volume averages about 5000 ml, an expansion in size of approximately 250 fold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007489-GaryCunningham1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. No other smooth muscle organ in the human is able to stretch as much as the uterus. Myometrial stretch has been implicated, clinically, in the activation of the myometrium for labor, but the mechanisms involved are unclear. For example, it is known that multiple gestation pregnancies and polyhydramnios, conditions associated with increased tension/stretch on the uterine wall, cause an increased incidence of premature labor. Understanding the molecular basis of uterine contraction will aid the better control and manipulation of uterine contractile function in preterm and dysfunctional labor.</p><p>Focal adhesion complexes (also called dense plaques in smooth muscle) connect the intracellular cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix and are recognized sites of mechanotransduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007489-Gerthoffer1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007489-Macphee1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007489-Wu1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> in rodent myometrium have demonstrated that focal adhesion signaling is activated at late pregnancy. The authors suggested that neuronal and hormonal pathways alone may not be sufficient to bring about myometrial activation for labor and that a synergy of neuronal-hormonal pathways and mechanotransduction pathways could play an important role in parturition. Current knowledge of the roles of mechanical stretch in uterine regulation is based on data from animal models, and little information is available as to how this system works in human myometrium. Furthermore, the identity of signaling molecules involved in mechanotransduction pathways in human myometrium is little studied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007489-Taggart1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We have recently reported in the timed pregnant rat model that mechanical stretch of pregnant uterine smooth muscle activates ERK via focal adhesion signaling. In the rat, we have shown that in addition to classical GPCR-mediated pathways, this ERK pathway, in a cause-and-effect manner, facilitates myometrial contraction, and plays a distinct role in the switch from the quiescent phase of pregnancy to a more contractile phenotype at the end of pregnancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007489-Li1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007489-Li2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Smooth muscle archvillin (SmAV) is a regulator of ERK pathways newly identified by our group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007489-Gangopadhyay1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007489-Gangopadhyay2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.

Four myometrial strips were dissected from each sample for in vitro stretch experiments. The satisfactory condition of each uterine smooth muscle strip was confirmed before the experiment by the presence of active, spontaneous contractions with or without 51 mM KCl treatment.

The justification for stretch of 2&#x000d7; slack length is based on the optimal length of term pregnant uterine smooth muscle strips in the rat model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007489-Li2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007489-Li3">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> and the pilot stretch experiments on human myometrium. Also, this optimal length is same as in vivo length as measured when the uterine wall is stretched by the fetus in the rat model. Clinically, it is impossible to measure the in vivo length of the uterine smooth muscle that will be sampled later. In general, in vitro stretch to 2&#x000d7; slack length generates force in the range of 10&#x02013;15 grams. This is about a 20-fold increase in force compared to baseline tension of term, not-in-labor uterine strips in the organ bath.

Thus, since phosphorylation of the adhesion plaque protein FAK at residue 925 increases in these samples with stretch, we probed for the association of phospho-FAK-Y925 with ERK and, as is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007489-g008">Fig. 8D</xref>, this association also increased with stretch.</p></sec><sec id="s3i"><title>Sub-cellular localization of SmAV with the adhesion plaque marker vinculin in pregnant human myometrium</title><p>In vascular smooth muscle cells, SmAV undergoes a stimulus-induced translocation from the core of the cell to the cell cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007489-Gangopadhyay1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

CaD is an actin binding smooth muscle protein that, like troponin in striated muscle, works with tropomyosin to block the binding site of myosin on actin. Upon phosphorylation of the ERK site on CaD, however, a conformational change occurs that increases actin availability for interaction with myosin. We have shown here that not only do CaD protein levels increase with pregnancy, as previously described, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007489-Word1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007489-Laporte1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> but also that CaD phosphorylation increases in myometrial samples from women in labor, compared to those from women not-in-labor. Furthermore, as predicted by the known effects of CaD to inhibit Ca-dependent acto-myosin interactions in vitro, we have directly shown that human myometrial smooth muscle from pregnant women (&#x0003e;37 week, not in labor) exhibits an increased Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>i</sub> threshold for contraction (decreased Ca sensitivity) as CaD levels increase with gestation. In the rat model we have previously shown that an ERK inhibitor delays the onset of RU486-induced preterm labor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007489-Li2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, pointing to a cause-and-effect relationship between ERK and the onset of labor.</p><p>Another major finding of the current study is that stretch of human myometrium directly induces CaD phosphorylation in vitro. Although myometrial quiescence in vivo is clinically important for normal pregnancy, it has not been totally clear that how the myometrium switches phenotypically from the &#x0201c;myometrial quiescence&#x0201d; typical of the early pregnant uterus to &#x0201c;myometrial activation&#x0201d; during labor. Similarly, it is known that clinical conditions that increase uterine wall tension stimulate uterine contractions; however, the molecular mechanisms involved have not been clear. Our results support the hypothesis that stretch from the growing fetus at term, when the rate of fetal growth is 7 times that in the first trimester <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007489-GaryCunningham1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, promotes uterine contractions through activation of adhesion plaques and downstream ERK signaling. Furthermore, this stretch-sensitive signaling pathway would help explain the high incidence of preterm labor due to abnormal uterine stretch in conditions such as multiple gestation, polyhydramnios, and macrosomia. Additionally, the increased CaD expression during pregnancy may minimize the level of CaD phosphorylation per mole CaD and counteract the effect of stretch-induced stimuli before the onset of labor.</p><p>In the present study we report that expression levels of a newly identified smooth muscle protein, SmAV, increase significantly during pregnancy. SmAV, a known regulator of ERK is likely to facilitate the activation of ERK associated with the onset of labor. Knockdown of SmAV in vascular cells has been shown to inhibit agonist-induced activation of ERK and contraction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007489-Gangopadhyay1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. We show here that SmAV is biochemically associated with, the adhesion plaque protein FAK in term human myometrium. This association could be direct or, an indirect interaction through binding to other adhesion plaque proteins. Its association with focal adhesion molecules in human myometrium places it in a location where mechanotransduction from the growth of the fetus is sensed and can be transmitted to downstream ERK-dependent pathways including CaD phosphorylation.</p><p>In the current study we used an in vitro experimental stretch model to investigate the effect of stretch on ERK, CaD phosphorylation and activation of focal adhesion signaling. Previous studies have shown that myometrial stretch also can activate focal adhesion signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007489-Macphee1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007489-Wu1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, MAP kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007489-Sooranna1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007489-Oldenhof1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> and regulate expression of transforming growth factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007489-Shynlova1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. The current study demonstrates, for the first time the relationship of stretch and CaD phosphorylation in human myometrium. Brief in vitro stretch is clearly different from the in vivo stretch due to fetal growth. This is a limitation of the in vitro stretch model. However, the advantage of in vitro stretch is that it is allows the study of the effect of stretch in the absence of circulating hormones and neuronal inputs. Other investigators also used in vitro stretch models to study the effect of stretching and shortening of human myometrial strips on prostaglandin production. Those data demonstrated a differential prostaglandin synthesis that is related to myometrial stretching and shortening which could also play a role in uterine quiescence during gestation and increased contractility during parturition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007489-Hurd1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Here we have shown that the molecular mechanisms of stretch-induced activation of human myometrium include (1) increased tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK, and Cas, hallmarks of focal adhesion signaling, (2) increased association of, or tyrosine phosphorylation of, &#x003b1;-actinin with adhesion plaque complexes and (3) downstream, stretch-induced increases in ERK and CaD phosphorylation. We have previously shown in the timed pregnant rat model that ERK is targeted to the cell cortex in late term pregnancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007489-Li1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> and the upregulation of SmAV expression may be one factor that contributes to the targeting of ERK to focal adhesions in a gestation-dependent manner. As illustrated in the model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007489-g010">Fig. 10</xref>, we suggest that signals mediated through GPCR pathways (such as oxytocin, prostaglandins, endothelin etc) and signals mediated through focal adhesions pathways (growth of fetus, polyhydramnios and multiple gestations) may synergize to activate myometrium and initiate the labor contractions.</p><fig id="pone-0007489-g010" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007489.g010</object-id><label>Figure 10</label><caption><title>Model of signaling pathways involved in myometrial ERK activation.</title><p>In addition to classical G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) pathway described by others, data presented here suggest that the activation of ERK by focal adhesion signaling also promotes myometrial contraction and contributes to the initiation of labor. p: phosphorylation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0007489.g010"/></fig><p>Taken together, these results indicate that gestational stretch of human myometrium activates adhesion plaque (dense plaque) signaling, and acting through the ERK scaffold SmAV, recruits ERK to dense plaques, leading to the activation of ERK and the subsequent phosphorylation of CaD to promote myometrial contractility during labor. These results could also identify these signaling molecules as target molecules for drug development aiming in regulation of uterine contractility and interruption of preterm contractions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the obstetricians and nursing staff on the Labor and Delivery Floor at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston Massachusetts and staff at St Mary's Hospital, Manchester (UK) for their dedication in collection of the human myometrial samples.
