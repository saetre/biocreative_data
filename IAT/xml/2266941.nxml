It is highly expressed in lung and trachea in both human and mouse, with additional tissues expressing the protein that differ depending on the species. However, little is known about the function and transcriptional regulation of this gene in normal mouse tissues.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>By reporter gene transfection and gel mobility shift analyses, we demonstrated that expression of the mouse <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>gene is regulated by a PU-box binding protein and a ubiquitous transcription factor NF-Y that respectively binds to the PU-boxes located at -99 to -105 bp and -158 to -164 bp, and the "CCAAT" binding sites located at -425 to -429 bp and -498 to -502 bp from the transcription start site of the gene. However, the effect of PU-box binding protein on transcriptional activation is minimal as compared to NF-Y, suggesting that NF-Y is a more critical transcription factor for mouse <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>gene transcription. Despite that NF-Y is a ubiquitous factor, <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>is highly expressed only in mouse lung and mtCC cells that are derived from SV40 transformed mouse Clara cells, but not in ten other mouse tissues/cells examined. Gene methylation analysis revealed that within 600 bp of the <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>gene promoter region, there are nine CpG methylation sites present, of which two CpGs closest to the transcription start site of the gene are unmethylated in the tissues/cells expressing SCGB3A1.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A ubiquitous transcription factor NF-Y binds to and activates expression of the mouse <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>gene and tissue-specific expression of the gene is associated with CpG methylation of the promoter.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Secretoglobin (SCGB) 3A1, also called high in normal-1 (HIN-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] or uteroglobin-related protein 2 (UGRP2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], is a member of the SCGB gene superfamily that consists of small secretory proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. HIN-1 was originally identified as a tumor suppressor gene because its expression was silenced by methylation in the majority of human breast carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. UGRP2 was independently identified as a homologous gene to UGRP1 (also called SCGB3A2) that is a downstream target for the homeodomain transcription factor NKX2-1, also called TITF1, TTF1, NKX2.1, or T/EBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Mouse SCGB3A1 and SCGB3A2 share 33% amino acid sequence identity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>In humans, SCGB3A1 is highly expressed in the trachea, lung, salivary gland, prostate, esophagus, duodenum and mammary gland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], whereas in mouse, it is primarily expressed in the trachea and lung, and weakly expressed in the heart, stomach, and small intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Methylation patterns of the human <italic>SCGB3A1 </italic>gene promoter have been extensively studied and a correlation of methylation and loss of SCGB3A1 expression and malignant phenotypes is well established in many human cancers including breast, prostate, lung, and pancreatic carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The AKT signaling pathway is responsible for the SCGB3A1's tumor suppressor function as characterized by inhibition of cell growth, cell migration and invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In this connection, it was shown that EGF and TGF&#x003b3; increase SCGB3A1 expression through activation of the ERK-MAPK and phosphoinositide-3 kinase-AKT pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Further, the expression of SCGB3A1 is restricted to terminally differentiated airway epithelial cells and is up-regulated during retinoic acid induced differentiation of bronchial epithelial cells, suggesting that SCGB3A1 may be involved in the acquisition or maintenance of the terminally differentiated epithelial phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Under interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 stimulation, SCGB3A1 expression is up-regulated through binding of STAT6 to the STAT binding element located in -201 to -209 bp of the mouse <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>gene promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], suggesting that SCGB3A1 may also play a role in inflammation. In fact, a recent report demonstrated that SCGB3A2 (UGRP1), a homologous gene to SCGB3A1, suppresses allergic airway inflammation when a mouse model for allergic airway inflammation is subjected to intranasal administration of recombinant adenovirus expressing SCGB3A2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. STAT6 is the only transcription factor downstream of IL-4 and IL-13 signaling thus far demonstrated that directly binds to the <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>promoter and regulates expression of the gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. It is not known what transcription factors are involved in constitutive expression of the mouse <italic>Scgb3a1</italic>.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate that a ubiquitous transcription factor NF-Y is an important transcription factor for controlling expression of the mouse <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>gene through its binding to the responsive "CCAAT" element located at -425 to -429, and -498 to -502 bp upstream of the <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>gene. The methylation pattern of the mouse <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>gene is examined and the association of the two closest CpGs to the transcription start site in tissue-specific expression of the mouse <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>gene is discussed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Analysis of the mouse <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>gene promoter</title><p>In an attempt to understand the mechanism of mouse <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>gene expression, we first compared the promoter sequence of the mouse <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>gene with the human <italic>SCGB3A1 </italic>gene. Interestingly, no significant homology was found by BLAST analysis when 2-kbp mouse <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>gene promoter sequence was subjected to analysis, suggesting that the regulation of human and mouse <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>genes may be quite different. Six mouse <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>gene promoter-luciferase reporter constructs (pGL4, -59, -91, -184, -273, and -598) were then prepared and subjected to transient transfection analysis using transformed mouse Clara cells (mtCC) that are derived from tumor tissues of lungs obtained from transgenic mice expressing the simian virus 40 large T antigen gene under control of uteroglobin/Clara cell secretory protein promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The reporter activity slightly increased with construct -91 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). An approximately ten-fold enhancement of promoter activity as compared to a control construct pGL4 was obtained with the -184 construct, and the extent of activity remained at similar levels up to -273 bp of the promoter sequence. A further robust up-regulation (~25-fold) of the promoter activity as compared to control was obtained with construct -598, suggesting that transcriptional response elements may be present between -91 and -184 bp, and -273 and -598 bp of the mouse <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>gene promoter. Possible binding sites for transcription factors were analyzed using the TF search [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], TRANSFAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and the reference of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The analysis revealed the presence of two PU boxes (5'-AGAGGAA-3') between -91 and -184 bp and two NF-Y binding sites (5'-CCAAT-3') between -273 and -598 bp that may be responsible for up-regulation of <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>gene expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The PU-box is a binding site for the ETS family of transcription factors that participate in an array of cellular activities in development, differentiation and tumorigenesis, and is a main regulator of the immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. NF-Y is a ubiquitous heterotrimeric transcription factor, composed of NF-YA, NF-YB, and NF-YC, all of which are necessary for DNA binding, and recognizes "CCAAT" penta-nucleotide element [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. A STAT binding site (-201 to -209 bp) that we previously characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] for IL-4/13-induced increase of SCGB3A1 expression did not seem to be involved in the constitutive expression of SCGB3A1. Further TF search analysis with low stringency revealed a possible binding site for GATA (-11 to -20 bp and -132 to -141 bp), C/EBP (-61 to -72 bp) and HNF3&#x003b2; (-64 to -76 bp), transcription factors known to be involved in lung-specific gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]; the latter two might contribute a slight increase of the reporter activity found with the -91 construct.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Reporter analysis of the mouse <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>gene</bold>.

Only construct -598 has putative NF-Y binding sites. Luciferase activity increased approximately two-fold with the constructs -59 and -273. Further inclusion of upstream sequence up to -598 bp markedly increased luciferase activity to almost twenty-fold as compared to control, confirming the involvement of NF-Y in mouse <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>gene transcription. In order to examine whether all three NF-Y subunits are required for expression of SCGB3A1, co-transfecting analysis was carried out using single or a various combinations of NF-Y subunits (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). The results clearly demonstrate that all three NF-Y subunits are required for <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>gene transcription as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Further, replacing the NF-YA construct with NF-YAm29, a dominant negative form of NF-YA that lacks the DNA binding activity due to displacement of three critical amino acids in the middle of the DNA binding domain but retaining the ability to form the NF-Y heterotrimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], NF-Y up-regulation of -598 luciferase activity was reduced to close to basal levels, suggesting that the NF-YA subunit is critical for transcriptional activation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). These results demonstrate that NF-Y may activate mouse <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>transcription by binding to the NF-Y binding site(s) located between -273 and -598 bp of the <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>gene promoter.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>NF-Y comprised of all three subunits is required for mouse <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>gene transcription</bold>.

In order to determine which putative binding sites are involved in binding of NF-Y that is responsible for the increase of <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>gene promoter activity, electrophoretic gel mobility shift analysis (EMSA) was carried out using double strand oligonucleotides containing proximal (-425 to -429 bp) or distal (-498 to -502 bp) "CCAAT" box as a probe and nuclear extracts prepared from COS-1 cells over-expressing NF-Y, mouse lungs, or mtCC cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). In all three nuclear extracts, the same pattern of specific protein-DNA shifted band was obtained, although intensity varied, for both probes 1 and 2 (lane 1 and 6); the specific band was competed out by a 200-fold excess of cold probe (lane 2 and 7), but not by an oligonucleotide having a mutation at the "CCAAT" site (lane 3 and 8). Further, polyclonal anti-NF-Y antibody specifically super-shifted the NF-Y-DNA complex with both probes (lane 5 and 10), which was not seen with IgG (lane 4 and 9) or anti- C/EBP antibody (data not shown) as a negative control.

With both mutations together, luciferase activity was further reduced to approximately one-fourth of that of wild type.

In order to understand the mechanism for tissue-specific expression of SCG3A1, RT-PCR was first carried out to determine the levels of expression of three NF-Y subunits, NF-YA, NF-YB, and NF-YC, and SCGB3A1 in various mouse tissues including brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, skeletal muscle, spleen and testis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). NF-YB and NF-YC were expressed in all tissues examined at similar levels, whereas expression of the NF-YA subunit varied depending on tissue/cell types as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]: expression in the brain, liver and skeletal muscle was very low or barely detected as compared with other tissues. Interestingly, SCGB3A1 was highly expressed only in the lung with very weak expression detected in the heart. These results confirmed the ubiquitous pattern of NF-Y expression, which does not correlate with SCGB3A1 expression.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>RT-PCR analysis for the expression of NF-YA, NF-YB, NF-YC, and SCGB3A1</bold>.

It is well known that DNA methylation plays an important role in tissue-specific gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. To this end, genomic DNA was subjected to bisulfite modification, and the DNA fragment spanning -600 bp upstream through +90 bp in the intron 1 of the mouse <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>gene was PCR amplified, followed by a direct DNA sequencing of the PCR fragment to determine the site of CpG methylation in the promoter and around the transcription start site of the gene. This modification converts non-methylated cytosine to uracil but does not affect 5-methyl cytosine. In the region between +90 to -600 bp of the mouse <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>gene, nine CpG methylation sites were found, all of which were located between NF-Y binding sites and the transcription start site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Of nine, seven methylation sites located at the most 5' were always methylated regardless of tissues/cell lines examined, whereas two methylation sites closest to the transcription start site were partially or totally unmethylated in lung or mtCC cells, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). When 28 individual clones obtained from PCR products of bisulfite modified lung DNAs were subjected to sequencing, 10 were found to have the two CpG sites closest to the transcription start site methylated while 18 were unmethylated. These results suggest that lung DNAs consist of a mixture of methylated and unmethylated CpGs. Note that direct sequencing of DNAs from lung, mtCC and NIH3T3 cells without bisulfite modification did not demonstrate any mutations anywhere within +90 to -600-bp region. Interestingly, lung and mtCC were the only tissues/cells that exhibited high level of SCGB3A1 expression. Together with the results obtained by ChIP analysis, in which all mtCC, NIH3T3, and MLE15 cells have bound NF-Y at its specific binding sites of the mouse <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>promoter regardless of SCGB3A1 expression, and that NF-Y is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues/cells examined, the bisulfite sequencing results demonstrate that two methylation sites closest to the transcription start site in the <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>promoter may be responsible for tissue-specific expression of SCGB3A1.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>DNA methylation analysis</bold>.

When CpG was methylated, an additional band(s) was observed for both oligonucleotides flanking proximal or distal CpG using nuclear extracts prepared from mtCC and mouse hepatoma-derived Hepa1 cells. Since the shifted band is at different position between two oligonucleotides, they may represent different DNA-binding proteins. These results suggest that CpG methylation affects the binding of DNA-binding proteins.</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>EMSA with methylated CpG oligunucleotides</bold>.

NF-Y recognizes a "CCAAT" penta-nucleotide that can be found at every 500 bp in random genomic DNAs based on mathematical calculation. With additional high stringency, in which the "CCAAT" box is expanded to a 9-nucleotide element as (G/A)(G/A)CCAAT(C/G)(A/G)(G/C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], this sequence appears every 16 kbp in frequency. A "CCAAT" box is found in the vicinity of promoter region (between -60 and -100 bp of the major start site in both orientations) with significant high frequency (30%), suggesting that NF-Y may play a pivotal role in controlling expression of many genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In the current study, CCAAT boxes were located further upstream (-425 to -429 bp and -498 to -502 bp), away from the vicinity of <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>gene transcription start site.</p><p>Transfection analysis in COS-1 cells revealed that the -59 and -273 constructs increased reporter activity two-fold in an NF-Y dependent manner (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). However, no "CCAAT" binding sequence was found between -59 bp and the transcription start site, nor did EMSA reveal any NF-Y binding in this region (data not shown). While an exact "CCAAT" sequence is required for NF-Y binding, "CCACT" sequence was reported to similarly function as the NF-Y binding site in regulation of Oncoprotein18 gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. A low stringency survey revealed the presence of two "CCACT" sequences in the <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>gene promoter at -44 to -48 bp and -113 to -117 bp, however, neither bound NF-Y as determined by EMSA (data not shown). Further, when NFYAm29, a dominant negative form of NF-YA was co-transfected with the constructs -598, an approximately two-fold higher luciferase activity as compared to control remained even though a heterotrimer with NF-Yam29 cannot bind DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Moreover, mutation of the two NF-Y binding sites did not completely abolish NF-Y activation of the -598 construct luciferase activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). The exact reason for these phenomena is not known. However, it has been established that NF-Y interacts with TATA-binding protein (TBP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], TFIID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], and coactivators such as p300 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and P/CAF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] that modify gene expression. The interaction of NF-Y with these factors could stabilize basic transcription machinery and/or its association with DNA, which in turn results in a slight increase in <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>reporter activity with co-transfection of constructs -598 and NF-YAm29, and/or the constructs -59/-273 and NF-Y expression plasmid. Note that in these reporter assays, three expression constructs, NF-YA, NF-YB, and NF-YC were simultaneously co-transfected along with a reporter construct. The fact that only cells that have taken up all four plasmids can produce a complete form of NF-Y that can activate the promoter suggests that the 20-fold increase of <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>promoter activity obtained in this co-transfection assay system may represent only a fraction of naturally occurring NF-Y regulated <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>expression.</p><p>The importance of NF-Y, in particular the NF-YA subunit in mouse <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>gene expression was demonstrated by reporter activities using a various combination of NF-Y subunits and reduced SCGB3A1 mRNA expression by NF-YA shRNA. In the latter, both NF-YA protein and SCGB3A1 mRNA levels were suppressed at similar levels of approximately 50&#x02013;60% of the control. This incomplete suppression may be due to the fact that NF-Y is a ubiquitous transcription factor and regulates many genes including housekeeping genes and those involved in cell cycle control, that account for approximately 20% of all genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Thus, complete suppression of NF-Y expression may likely result in suppression of cell proliferation and cell death. Indeed, a knockout mouse for NF-YA is embryonic lethal, and embryonic fibroblasts prepared from this mouse demonstrate halted cell proliferation and DNA synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>An important factor controlling tissue-specific expression of genes is CpG methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. This may particularly play a role in suppressing expression of NF-Y-responsive genes in many tissues since NF-Y is ubiquitously expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and is responsible for recruitment of RNA polymerase II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. However, the possibility exists that NF-Y may cooperate with another transcription factor(s), which could render expression of genes tissue and/or stage-specific. For instance, NF-Y and C/EBP&#x003b1; interact with each other and synergistically activate the mouse amelogenin gene, which contributes to physiological regulation during amelogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Whether this could be the case in the regulation of mouse <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>gene expression remains to be determined.</p><p>DNA methylation is known to suppress gene expression through two basic mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]; first, methylation of cytosine bases inhibit association between DNA-binding factors and their cognate DNA recognition sequences, resulting in direct inhibition of transcriptional activation. Second, proteins that recognize methyl-CpG such as methyl-CpG-binding proteins elicit repressive potential of methylated DNA by recruiting co-repressor molecules to silence gene transcription and to modify surrounding chromatin, including histone modification. In the case of the mouse <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>gene, the second mechanism most likely plays a role in silencing expression of the gene since two CpGs are located closest to the transcription start site, which is 3&#x02013;400 bp downstream of the NF-Y binding sites. These two CpGs in the mouse <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>gene promoter are partially or completely unmethylated in mouse lung and mtCC cells, respectively. The partial methylation observed in the lung is the result of a mixture of methylated and unmethylated CpGs at approximately a 1:2 ratio. Although we do not have a proof, the methylated CpGs might be at least partially derived from non-epithelial cells such as mesenchymal cells that are contained in whole lung from which genomic DNA for methylation analysis was prepared. We found that the two CpGs were totally methylated when embryonic lung mesenchymal cells that do not express SCGB3A1 were separately prepared from epithelial cells and subjected to sequencing (Tomita and Kimura, unpublished results). SCGB3A1 is known to be expressed only in the airway epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, very low SCGB3A1 expression was observed in the heart even though the two CpGs closest to the transcription start site were methylated. The reason for this difference is not known. A small percentage of these CpGs might be unmethylated in a specific part of the heart and not abundant enough to be detected particularly using mRNA prepared from whole heart. In this regard, the expression site in the heart is not known. Alternatively, another transcription factor(s) enriched in the heart might be responsible for the low SCGB3A1 expression in this tissue. EMSA using methylated CpG oligonucleotides revealed the presence of additional shifted bands as compared to unmethylated oligonucleotides. This could be due to binding of one of the methyl-CpG-binding proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] or other DNA-binding proteins (transcription factors or co-factors) to these sites. We do not know which methyl-CpG-binding protein or DNA-binding protein is responsible for the new band, however the results at least suggest that CpG methylation affects binding of DNA-binding proteins within the region around proximal and distal CpGs in the mouse <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>gene promoter. Previously we reported that a STAT binding element located at -201- to -209 bp of the mouse <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>gene promoter is responsible for the IL-3/14-induced increase of <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>gene expression in mtCC and mouse embryo lung primary cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This STAT element is located to close to the 3' most methylated CpG. Whether any changes in methylation status in this CpG under IL-3/14 induction remains to be determined.</p><p>Lastly, in the human <italic>SCGB3A1 </italic>gene promoter, 138 potential methylation CpG sites are found within 1,500 bp of the promoter region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. High frequency of methylation of these CpGs is associated with loss of SCGB3A1 expression in many human cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In contrast, there are only 9 CpGs within 600 bp of the mouse <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>gene promoter. This remarkable species difference in CpG islands can be explained by little significant homology in DNA sequences between the human and mouse gene promoters, suggesting that mouse <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>and human <italic>SCGB3A1 </italic>may be under different regulation. This could explain the different patterns of SCGB3A1 expression between these two species. Whether the difference in gene regulation has any implication in functional role of SCGB3A1 between mouse and human requires additional studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A ubiquitous transcription factor, NF-Y appears to be a potential potent regulator of mouse <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>gene expression through binding to two "CCAAT" boxes located at -425 to -429, and -498 to -502 bp in the <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>gene promoter.

PCR condition used was 94&#x000b0;C, 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94&#x000b0;C, 15 sec, 55&#x000b0;C, 15 sec, and 68&#x000b0;C, 30 sec.</p></sec><sec><title>Northern blot</title><p>Total RNA (3 &#x003bc;g) isolated from mtCC cells was electrophoresed on 1% agarose gel containing 0.22 M formaldehyde and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Immobilon-Ny+, Millipore, Billerica, MA). Filters were hybridized with mouse SCGB3A1 and ribosomal protein B36 (loading control) as a probe. Hybridization was performed in Perfect Hybridization solution (Amersham Biosciences) at 68&#x000b0;C overnight. The membrane was washed twice with 2 &#x000d7; SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 68&#x000b0;C for 30 min, followed by exposure to phosphoimager screen. Data processing was carried out using ImageQuant TL 2005 software (Amersham Biosciences).</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot</title><p>Nuclear extracts (3 &#x003bc;g) obtained from mtCC cells were run on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and proteins transferred onto PVDF membrane (Hydond-P, Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was gently shaken with PBS containing 5% skim milk at 4&#x000b0;C overnight, followed by incubation with anti-NF-YA or NF-YB antibody diluted in PBS containing 1% Tween 20 (PBST). After washing three times with PBST, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (NA9340V, Amersham Biosciences) followed by further three times wash with PBST. Signals were directly detected and quantified using chemiluminescence reaction (Immobilon Western, Millipore) with CCD camera system and equipped software (Alpha Innotech Fluor Chem HD2, San Leandro, CA).</p></sec><sec><title>DNA methylation analysis</title><p>Genomic DNAs were isolated based on simplified procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] from various tissues and cultured cells. Isolated DNAs were overnight digested with Bam HI at 37&#x000b0;C, ethanol precipitated after phenol-chloroform extraction and pellets were dissolved in TE buffer. EZ DNA methylation kit (Zymo Research, CA) was used to generate bisulfite treated DNA. Five hundred ng of DNA was incubated with bisulfite at 50&#x000b0;C for 16 h, and the product was purified and desulphonated through a spin-column. This procedure converts all non-methylated cytosine to uracil but does not affect 5-methyl cytosine. Two &#x003bc;l of final elution from the spin-column was used as template for two different PCRs with a primer set, 5'-GTGGTTTTTGGAAGAAAGGTTTAGTATTTGAGTTTAGG-3' and TACTAAACCCCCAAAAAAACTCACCAAAAATCAC-3' for proximal <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>promoter region (343 bp), and 5'-GAGAGATTTAGAGTTTTTGGGATTTGTTGATTTAT-3' and 5'-CCCACCTCAATCCTAAAAATTTCCTCTTAAC-3' for distal <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>promoter region (279 bp). Both PCR reactions were carried out at the same conditions; 94&#x000b0;C, 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94&#x000b0;C, 15 sec, 52.8&#x000b0;C, 15 sec, and 68&#x000b0;C, 30 sec. All PCR products were subjected to 2% agarose gel electrophoresis, and each band was excised and purified (gel extraction kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) for subsequent direct sequencing analysis to identify cytosine residues, but not thymine (uracil), that was the result of resistance to bisulfite reaction due to methylation. In some cases, PCR products were subcloned into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) and individual clones were subjected to sequencing analysis. For confirmation of non-bisulfite treated genomic DNA sequence, PCR was carried out using the following primer sets: 5'-CAGAAAAATGTCACAGCCCCTC-3' and 5'-CCAACTTCCTCTTATGGTCAGTGGAC-3' to obtain 543-bp fragment of the distal <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>promoter region containing the two CCAAT sites and 5'-CTTCCAGACCCAGAACCTACATAATC-3' and 5'-AGAGTCACTGAGCAGAGCCACAC-3' to obtain 471-bp fragment of the proximal <italic>Scgb3a1 </italic>promoter region. PCR condition used was 94&#x000b0;C, 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94&#x000b0;C, 15 sec, 58&#x000b0;C, 15 sec, and 68&#x000b0;C, 60 sec.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>TT performed all experiments and drafted the manuscript.
