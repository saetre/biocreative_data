The present study was to determine the significance of the entire C-terminus in RON or its variant RON160-mediated activities related to cell motility and tumorigenesis. Analysis of protein phosphorylation revealed that elimination of the entire C-terminus significantly impairs the ligand-dependent or independent RON or RON160 phosphorylation and dimerization. Phosphorylation of downstream signaling proteins such as Erk1/2, AKT, and p38 MAP kinase was also diminished in cells expressing the C-terminus-free RON or RON160. These dysfunctional activities were accompanied with the inability of truncated RON or RON160 to mediate cytoplasmic &#x003b2;-catenin accumulation. Functional analysis further demonstrated that truncation of the C-terminus significantly impairs RON or RON160-mediated cell proliferation, morphological changes, and cellular migration. Significantly, oncogenic RON160-mediated tumor growth in athymic nude mice was lost after the deletion of the C-terminus. Thus, the C-terminus is a critical component of the RON receptor. The entire C-terminus is required for RON or RON160-mediated intracellular signaling events leading to various cellular activities.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The RON (Recepteur d'Origine Nantaise) receptor tyrosine kinase is the product of the c-RON proto-oncogene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and the high affinity receptor for macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], also known as hepatocyte growth factor like protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. RON is mainly expressed in cells of epithelial origin and required for embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Biochemically, RON is first synthesized as a single-chain precursor with 1400 amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Proteolytic conversion of pro-RON into a mature RON is a step necessary for MSP binding and biological activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This process is mediated by proteases at the cleavage site of Pro<sup>304</sup>-Lys<sup>305</sup>, resulting in a 180 kDa heterodimeric protein with a 40 kDa extracellular &#x003b1;-chain and a 145 kDa transmembrane &#x003b2;-chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], both chains are linked by a disulphide bound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Several functional domains have been identified in the RON protein. In the RON &#x003b2;-chain, the extracellular sequences contain a N-terminal semaphoring (Sema) domain followed by a plexin-semaphorin-integrin (PSI) motif and four IPT (Immunoglobulin, Plexin, and Transcription factor) domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The sema domain is responsible for MSP binding and receptor dimerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The IPT domains are essential in regulating RON maturation and kinase activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Deletion of the first or fourth IPT domain through the mRNA splicing processes has been linked to constitutive RON phosphorylation and impaired receptor maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The juxtamembrane domain, tyrosine kinase domain and C-terminus are three functional structures in the intracellular sequences of the RON &#x003b2;-chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Deletion of the juxtamembrane domain has been shown to enhance RON phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In contrast, deletion of last 46 amino acids in the kinase domain severely impairs MSP-induced RON phosphorylation and tyrosine kinase activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The C-terminus contains a bidentate motif (-Y<sup>1353</sup>VQLPATY<sup>1360</sup>MNL-) and additional determinants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Both positive and negative effects of the C-terminus have been demonstrated by <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Thus, the functional domains are critically important in regulating RON-mediated activities.</p><p>Studies of RON in epithelial carcinogenesis have recently demonstrated that RON is highly expressed in various primary tumor samples including breast, colon, and pancreatic cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Overexpression has also been shown to be associated with advanced clinical stages and poor clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. One pathogenic feature associated with RON overexpression is the production of biologically active RON variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. These variants are produced either by alternative mRNA splicing or by alternative mRNA initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. A typical example is RON160 identified in primary colon cancer samples and in established cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. RON160 is derived from an mRNA splicing transcript that has an in-frame deletion of 109 amino acids coded by exons 5 and 6. These 109 amino acids constitute the first IPT domain in the RON &#x003b2;-chain extracellular sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. RON160 has a molecular mass of 160 kDa and is constitutively phosphorylated with increased kinase activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. High levels of Erk1/2, PI-3 kinase, and AKT activities are often observed in RON160 expressing cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Expression of RON160 results in transforming phenotypes in rodent fibroblast and human colonic epithelial cells and causes tumor growth in athymic nude mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Moreover, RON160 stimulates colonic cell morphological changes and motilities characterized by epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Although the mechanisms underlying RON160 mediated tumorigenesis are currently unknown, it is believed that the tumorigenic potential is attributed to its increased kinase activities leading to enhanced intracellular signaling cascades. Thus, RON overexpression, accompanied with generation of tumorigenic RON variants, is a pathogenic factor contributing to pathogenesis of various epithelial cells.</p><p>The present study was to determine the significance of the entire C-terminus in regulating RON or RON160-mediated biological activities. Previous studies have showed that the C-terminal bidentate motif is essential in regulating RON kinase activities leading to increased cellular functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, biochemical analysis suggests that the C-terminus plays a negative role in regulating RON kinase activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This is evident in experiments showing that the C-terminus and the peptide containing Y<sup>1353</sup>/Y<sup>1630 </sup>or substituted F<sup>1353</sup>/F<sup>1360 </sup>motif strongly inhibit RON kinase activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In contrast, experiments of tumorigenesis mediated by certain RON mutants suggest that the C-terminal Y<sup>1353</sup>/Y<sup>1360 </sup>motif is not required for tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The RON mutant (M<sup>1254</sup>T) with F<sup>1353</sup>/F<sup>1360 </sup>substitutions is capable of mediating tumor growth in nude mice, which is comparable to the control RON mutant without Y<sup>1353</sup>/Y<sup>1360 </sup>substitution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Considering the pathogenic significance of RON160 in colonic epithelial cells, we wanted to determine the importance of the entire C-terminus in RON or RON160-mediated activities. By generating cDNA encoding human RON or RON160 free of the C-terminus, we demonstrated that the entire C-terminus is critically important in regulating RON/RON160 kinase activities and essential for RON or RON160-mediated biological activities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cells and reagents</title><p>NIH3T3 cells expressing RON or RON&#x00394;160 were used as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].

High levels of AKT phosphorylation were also seen. The levels of p38 MAKP kinase phosphorylation were relatively low. In 3T3-RON160-cf cells, truncation of the C-terminus significantly reduces the Zt/g4-induced RON-mediated Erk1/2 phosphorylation although low levels of phosphorylation were still visible. Trance amounts of Akt phosphorylation were also seen in 3T3-RON-cf cells. Phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase was at the minimal level.

The C-terminus plays the vital role in regulating RON-mediated activities. Both positive and negative activities have been documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], suggesting that the functions of the C-terminus are complex. Studies from previous reports have mainly focused on identification and characterization of structural domains in the C-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The role of the entire C-terminus was often ignored or less emphasized. For example, the sequence of -Y<sup>1353</sup>-VQLPAT-Y<sup>1360</sup>MNL- designated as the bidentate domain in the C-terminus has been studied in details [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The domain is known as the docking site for anchoring intracellular proteins necessary for transduction of RON signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. However, this domain has the inhibitory effect on RON kinase activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and the inhibitory activity remains strong even Y<sup>1353</sup>/Y<sup>1360 </sup>was substituted with other amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This suggests the existence of additional determinants in the C-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. We took a function-based approach to study the roles of the entire C-terminus in RON or RON160-mediated biological activities. Our data demonstrated that the C-terminus is required for ligand-dependent RON phosphorylation, dimerization, activation of Erk1/2 and AKT, and cellular activities such as cell proliferation and migration. The C-terminus was also critical for ligand-independent RON160 phosphorylation and downstream signaling events. Significantly, elimination of the entire C-terminus completely blocked the RON160-mediated tumor growth in athymic nude mice.</p><p>The RON receptor contains several functional domains critical in ligand binding, protein maturation, and biological activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. As shown in RON160, deletion of the first IPT domain in the extracellular sequence of the RON &#x003b2;-chain results in the gain of oncogenic functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In contrast, splicing out the last 46 amino acids coded by exon 19 in the catalytic kinase domain creates a kinase-dead variant RON170, which is unable to transduce signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Previous studies have defined two functions of the C-terminal tail. One is to act as a docking site for interaction with intracellular signaling proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. This is mainly manifested by the bidentate tyrosine motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Upon phosphorylation of Y<sup>1353</sup>/Y<sup>1360</sup>, the motif serves as an anchor to recruit downstream signaling molecules such as PI-3 kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], Grb-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Substitutions of Y<sup>1353</sup>/Y<sup>1360 </sup>with phenylalanine significantly impair RON-mediated cell migration and other activities but have no effect on MSP-induced RON phosphorylation at Y<sup>1238</sup>/Y<sup>1239 </sup>in the kinase domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Another function of the C-terminus is the auto-inhibitory effect on the RON kinase activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This activity is presumably mediated by functional domains in the C-terminus that interact with the kinase catalytic domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. There is evidence suggesting that the bidentate motif is involved in interaction with the RON kinase domain. However, substitutions of Y<sup>1353</sup>/Y<sup>1360 </sup>cannot eliminate this effect, indicating that other determinants in the C-terminus are also involved in the inhibitory effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The results from our current studies showed that the entire C-terminus is essential in RON auto-phosphorylation and signal transduction. First, deletion of the C-terminus resulted in the inability of RON to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation upon ligand or agonistic mAb stimulation. Spontaneous and Zt/g4-induced phosphorylation of RON160 were also abolished. These data suggested that ligand-dependent or independent RON or RON160 phosphorylation occurred only in the presence of the C-terminus. These findings are different from previous studies showing that ligand induces RON phosphorylation in the presence of F<sup>1353</sup>/F<sup>1360</sup>. Second, activation of downstream signaling proteins such as Erk1/2 and ATK was diminished in cells stably expressing RON-cf. This effect occurred also in RON160-cf cells. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>, high levels of spontaneous and Zt/g4-enhanced Erk1/2 or ATK phosphorylation were dramatically reduced in RON160-cf cells, confirming that the entire C-terminus is essential in activation of downstream signaling components. However, it needs to point out that truncation of the entire C-terminus cannot completely abolish MSP or Zt/g4-induced phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and other signaling proteins as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>. It is possible that activated RON kinase by itself is capable of activating downstream signaling events although the levels of the activation are relatively low. Finally, the increased stabilization by RON or RON160 of cytoplasmic &#x003b2;-catenin was significantly impaired due to the truncation of the C-terminus. The impairment was also accompanied by the inability of RON-cf or RON160 -cf in response to Zt/g4 induced GSK-3&#x003b2; Ser-9 phosphorylation. Cytoplasmic &#x003b2;-catenin accumulation plays a role in RON or its variant-mediated tumorigenic activities in colonic epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In conclusion, the entire C-terminus plays a pivotal role in controlling RON or RON160-mediated phosphorylation and signaling events.</p><p>The role of the C-terminus in RON or oncogenic RON variant-mediated tumorigenic activities is complex. Most of the studies focused on the bidentate tyrosine Y<sup>1353</sup>/Y<sup>1360 </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Analysis of oncogenic mutant RON<sup>D1232V </sup>has revealed that substitution of Y<sup>1353</sup>/Y<sup>1360 </sup>completely abolishes <italic>in vitro </italic>cell-transforming activities and tumor growth in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. However, this effect was not seen in cells expressing oncogenic mutant RON<sup>M1254T </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. RON<sup>M1254T </sup>continues to cause cell transformation and tumor growth even the C-terminal Y<sup>1353</sup>/Y<sup>1360 </sup>were substituted. Nevertheless, Y<sup>1353</sup>/Y<sup>1360 </sup>substitutions have a negative impact on RON<sup>M1254T</sup>- mediated tumorigenic activities. As shown in the focus formation and tumor growth assays, the numbers of foci was reduced and the tumor latency was prolonged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. These results imply that the bidentate motif is involved in the oncogenic activity of RON<sup>M1254T </sup>but is displaceable. Further studies demonstrated that the catalytic kinase activities play the vital role in these pathological events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Considering the report showing that the synthetic peptide containing Y<sup>1353</sup>/Y<sup>1360 </sup>or even F<sup>1353</sup>/F<sup>1360 </sup>inhibits RON kinase activities both <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], it is likely that the requirement of the bidentate motif in oncogenic RON mutant-mediated activities depends largely on the activation status of the kinase domain. We demonstrated that the entire C-terminus is required for RON-mediated cell growth, migration, and morphological changes. The C-terminus was also crucial for RON160-mediated cellular transformation and tumorigenic growth <italic>in vivo</italic>. The function of the entire C-terminus, in the case of RON and RON160, is not displaceable. As shown in results, increased cell proliferation, morphological change, and enhanced migration were diminished in cells expressing RON-cf and RON160-cf. These changes were directly associated with the inability of RON-cf or RON160-cf to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation and to activate the high levels of the downstream signaling events. Thus, the C-terminus is an intriguing component in the RON protein. In quiescent cells, it controls RON kinase activities through the use of the bidentate motif to interact with the catalytic domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Such interaction seems to be necessary in maintaining RON in the inactive mode. Upon ligand stimulation and subsequent phosphorylation at Y<sup>1353</sup>/Y<sup>1360</sup>, the C-terminal tail is released from the catalytic pocket and acts as the docking site for signaling proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The current data support this model. We showed that the deletion of the entire C-terminus abolished RON or RON160-mediated cell growth, shape change, and migration. Moreover, it eliminated the oncogenic potentials of RON160 acquired from the deletion of the first IPT domain. Thus, the entire C-terminus is a vital component of RON not only for structural integrity, but also for biological activities. Understanding the roles of the C-terminus should help us to gain insight into the mechanisms by which RON or RON160 exerts its activities relevant to cancer progression.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>YL and HPY performed experiments.
