The transformants were screened by hybridization with a cDNA fragment, derived from plasmid p gamma(11)7, corresponding to the 5' portion of the constant region of MPC11 heavy chain. Several positive transformants were found to contain various lengths of the variable region of the heavy chain. We describe the structure and sequence of one of these clones, pV(11)2, which contains cDNA corresponding to the entire variable region of MPC11 heavy chain and extends to codon 248 in the constant region. The protein sequence deduced from the DNA sequence indicates that the variable region of MPC11 heavy chain contains 121 amino acids and belongs to subgroup II of mouse heavy chains. Comparison of this sequence with other heavy chain sequences suggests a J (joining) segment of 16 residues which overlaps five residues of the third hypervariable region. The cDNA sequence shows that there is no discontinuity between the end of the variable region and the beginning of the constant region.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00433-0113-a" xlink:role="3598"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00433-0106.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3591"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00433-0107.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3592"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00433-0108.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3593"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00433-0109.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3594"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00433-0110.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3595"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00433-0111.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3596"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00433-0112.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3597"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00433-0113.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3598"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00433-0114.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3599"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00433-0115.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3600"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00433-0116.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3601"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
