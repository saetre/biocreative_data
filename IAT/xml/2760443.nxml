Shifting the cellular redox balance through pharmacologic manipulation in favor of increasing intracellular ROS may lead to oxidative stress and subsequent induction of apoptosis within cancer cells. The engagement of apoptosis in cancer cells induced by ROS-generating agents is probably accompanied by the activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Apoptosis can be initiated by death receptors stimulating the extrinsic pathway, or by perturbation of intracellular homeostasis involving mitochondria-associated intrinsic pathway and ER stress-mediated pathway. These initiating pro-apoptotic signals finally converge on central executioner of apoptosis by the disruption of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MMP) in mitochondria as well as the activation of caspase cascades. Reaching the level to an extent exceeding the endurable redox threshold, ROS can act as specific signals stimulating ER stress-mediated apoptosis specifically in cancer cells. In response to various stimuli including oxidative stressors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007538-Tu1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007538-Haynes1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, ER has evolved unfolded protein response (UPR) modulating several transcription factors (e.g., ATF6, XBP1 and CHOP) in an attempt to adapt for survival or otherwise undergo apoptosis facing prolonged UPR. However, there is limited knowledge about mechanisms underlying the conversion from oxidative signaling to downstream stress events leading cells to death. With the availability of appropriate therapeutic ROS-generating agents, systematic characterization of gene expression and the underlying transcriptional regulation will be the key to the elucidation of such conversion.</p><p>With the development of ROS-generating agents such as arsenic trioxide (ATO) for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007538-Niu1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, the possibility of exploiting selective oxidative stress as apoptosis-inducing cancer therapy is the emerging as a promising therapeutic option.

However, the mechanisms by which ROS formation leads to ER stress and cancer cell apoptosis are far from clear. Detailed elucidation of these mechanistic links may allow insight into oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis in cancer cells and permit the optimization of cancer-specific targeting therapies.</p><p>We speculate that cancer cells with predisposition of redox signaling are most likely sensitive to oxidative stimuli from ROS-generating agents such as fenretinide, undergoing oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis. To precisely uncover regulatory mechanisms underlying the conversion from oxidative signaling to downstream stress events exerted on ER and eventually to death outcomes rather than survival advantages, we employed integrative methods of advanced data mining with microarray technology to profile transcriptome changes in a fenretinide-sensitive cell line, and found numerous temporal-spatial relationships between stress-responsive events. Moreover, stress-responsive transcription factors, as highlighted by NF-E2-related factor-2 (NRF2) and heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), play prominent roles in the configuration of these relevant events. Validations through immunofluorescene and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and stress-related transcriptome comparisons further provided evidence that these stress-responsive regulators and thus their target genes are involved in converting oxidative signaling into downstream stress activities including redox response, ER stress/UPR and proteasome activation, representing typical events of oxidative stress mediated apoptosis in fenretinide-treated malignant cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>Fenretinide induces intracellular production of ROS and thus apoptosis in a variety of malignancies including leukemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007538-Oridate1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. We analyzed the antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of fenretinide on leukemia-derived cell lines NB4, U937, and HL60, and found that these cell lines underwent growth inhibition and apoptosis in response to 1&#x02013;2 &#x000b5;M of fenretinide, and that their susceptibilities appeared to be correlated with levels of ROS (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007538.s002">Figure S1</xref>). Based on its relatively high sensitivity to drug-induced ROS generation and apoptosis, NB4 was chosen as a prototype cell line for cellular and molecular assessments prior to detailed transcriptome analysis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007538-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, NB4 cell growth was inhibited by fenretinide treatment in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment with a low dose (1 &#x000b5;M) of fenretinide appeared to be sufficient to induce apoptosis in NB4 cells within 72 hours, as shown by mitochondrial membrane potential and annexin V assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007538-g001">Figures 1B and 1C</xref>). We further examined intracellular ROS changes during this time course. Surprisingly, we found that ROS changes were more complex than previously recognized, displaying left-skewed bell-shape curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007538-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). As expected, ROS accumulated sharply, reaching a four-fold increase compared to the basal levels within 6 hours of treatment, whereas it unexpectedly decreased gradually thereafter to levels corresponding roughly to twice the basal levels of untreated cells. This data suggests the involvement of redox signaling in NB4 cells upon fenretinide treatment. Fenretinide stimulation causes a rapid accumulation of intracellular ROS, which may in turn activate cellular mechanisms to reduce ROS levels. Also, the moderate levels of intracellular ROS are probably required for fenretinide-induced apoptosis.</p><fig id="pone-0007538-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007538.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Cellular and molecular characterization of fenretinide-induced apoptosis in leukemia-derived NB4 cells.</title><p>(A) Cell viability was evaluated using an MTT assay after various doses of fenretinide for 48 hours.

Notably, we observed activation of genes involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Most of genes coding for the proteasome apparatus were induced after the early stage, promoting the degradation of overloaded unfolded/misfolded proteins resulting from ER stress/UPR.

NRF2 induction was extended beyond 24 hours whereas HSF1 induction was terminated at this time point. Similarly, immunofluorescence microscopy analyses revealed marked accumulation of both factors in nuclei of cells treated with fenretinide for 6 hours, compared to a diffuse distribution of NRF2 and HSF1 in untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007538-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Also, nuclear gathering of NRF2 was sustained beyond the 24 hour treatment period whereas that of HSF1 was terminated. Considering the relatively low levels of ROS at 24 hour treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007538-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), the inactivation of HSF1 is probably due to a reducing microenvironment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007538-Ahn1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

Altogether, our evidence indicates that NRF2 and HSF1 are activated upon ROS accumulation by the end of the early stage, converting oxidative signaling into downstream effects by directly acting on their target genes.

Activation of NRF2 upon the formation of oxidative signaling at the early stage enhances expression of antioxidant genes, which may consequently result in gradual ROS reduction at the intermediate stage, and moderate ROS levels at the late stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007538-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Potential targets of HSF1 are largely represented by genes encoding UPR-related chaperones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007538-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) such as <italic>HSPA8</italic>, <italic>HSPH1</italic>, <italic>HSPA1A</italic>, <italic>HSPA9B</italic>, <italic>DNAJA1</italic>, <italic>DNAJB1</italic>, <italic>DNAJB6</italic> and <italic>SERIPINH1</italic>. HSF1 activation and their target genes appear to be transient, providing additional evidence that UPR observed in fenretinide-treated cells occurs during the intermediate stage.

Typically, these stress-responsive genes are represented by those clustered in Group 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007538-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Accordingly, we speculated that genes in Group 6 might represent a signature spectrum characteristic of cancer cells undergoing oxidative stress-mediated programmed cell death rather than survival upon stress stimulus. To validate this assumption, and to evaluate the potential impact of NRF2 and HSF1 on the assumed signature spectrum, we comparatively overlapped genes in Group 6 with several sets of expression data relevant to various stress responses under non-apoptotic conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007538-Murray1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> and our previously published expression data relevant to ATO/RA-induced differentiation/apoptosis of NB4 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007538-Zheng1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Through hierarchical clustering followed by integration of genomic TFBS information, stress-responsive transcriptome features under apoptotic or non-apoptotic conditions were displayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007538-g005">Figure 5</xref>). By comparing these features across all the conditions, the signature spectrum can be further partitioned into four categories (I&#x02013;IV). Modulation of genes in category I is attributed largely to HSF1 activation, as also indicated by prominent up-regulation under heat shock. HSF1 activation under non-apoptotic heat shock conditions appears to be sustained rather than transient. Modulation of genes in category II appears to be more complex, probably because they are orchestrated by multiple stress-responsive transcription factors such as CHOP and XBP1, as implicated by the observed multifaceted TFBS composition. Our data suggest that this gene category is also involved in the ER stress/UPR occurring at the intermediate stage of oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis, based on expression patterns as well as functional annotations. Genes in category III are those directly involved in redox signaling during the intermediate and late stages, as highlighted by significant enrichment of NRF2 and its co-factor MAF. Activation of genes encoding subunits of the proteasome apparatus is one of the most prominent features in this study. These genes are exclusively clustered in category IV. TFBS analysis implicates that genes in this category are modulated by ELK1.</p><fig id="pone-0007538-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007538.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Prominent impact of NRF2 and HSF1 on transcriptome signatures underlying oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis in NB4 cells.</title><p>Stress-related expression data were assembled and displayed through hierarchical clustering.

The oxidative microenvironment of malignant cells is of particular interest. Cancer cells are often sensitive to pharmacological agents that affect the intracellular redox balance, favoring the genesis of oxidative stress and subsequent cell apoptosis. To understand how oxidative signaling is converted into programmed cell death and to develop more sophisticated protocols preferentially targeting cancer cells with minimal cytotoxicity to normal cells, we performed a comprehensive analysis of oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis in leukemia-derived NB4 cells sensitive to fenretinide apoptotic effect through a systems approach integrating methods of experimental and computational biology together with robust tools of data mining.</p><p>In this study, we have delineated a global network with the temporal-spatial relationships at both the transcriptional and functional levels using a systems approach integrating experimental and computational biology. Our results depict a typical process of oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis in cancer cells wherein stress-responsive transcription factors play prominent roles in the configuration of the underlying molecular networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007538-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The rapid generation of ROS at the early stage is probably a biochemical process with minimal involvement of transcriptional regulation. When ROS reaches a certain threshold level, stress-responsive transcription factors appear to be responded. Nuclear translocation of NRF2 and subsequent induction of its target genes via antioxidant response element (ARE) may function to buffer oxidative stress response during the intermediate and late stage, whereas nuclear accumulation of HSF1 and thus activation of its target genes via heat shock element (HSE) may contribute to the occurrence of ER stress/UPR at intermediate stage, as implicated by induction of ER-localized chaperones, repression of protein translation and enhancement of ubiquitin-proteasome system. The sequential involvement of ER stress/UPR and mitochondrial associated apoptosis at the late stage is implicated separately by induction of pro-apoptotic ER stress marker CHOP and ER stress-specific caspase CASP4, and disruption of mitochondria transmembrane potential (&#x00394;&#x003a8;m) and activation of caspase cascades. Moreover, we provide solid evidence that oxidative stress is translated into downstream effects through stress-responsive transcription factors as highlighted by NRF2 and HSF1. Activation of NRF2 and thus its target genes may therefore contribute to reduction of ROS levels, as observed during the intermediate and late stage, whereas activation of HSF1 and thus its target genes may contribute to the transient occurrence of UPR. Although detailed relationships between UPR and subsequent cell apoptosis remain to be clarified, UPR termination prior to the late stage is probably essential for the effective activation of apoptosis. Notably, dynamic changes in ROS levels are of well relevance to not only the initiation of pro-apoptotic CHOP activities, but also to expression pattern of NRF2-regulated oxidative stress genes and HSF1-regulated ER stress genes during fenretinide-induced apoptosis (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007538.s003">Figure S2</xref>). Although these two sets of stress-responsive genes are individually considered as regulators of cellular defense mechanisms, their coordinated regulation in such manner as consistent activation of NRF2 targets and transient activation of HSF1 targets can be critical for the effective progression of apoptosis in response to fenretinide stimuli. Although exploring whether blocking specific transcription factors affects apoptosis is straightforward, our comparative transcriptome data of various stress responses clearly show that stress-relevant transcriptome features of fenretinide-treated NB4 cells can be recognized as a signature spectrum characteristic for oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis in cancer cells. Moreover, our evidence indicates that the temporal-spatial coordination of NRF2 and HSF1 in gene regulation plays an essential role in the configuration of this signature spectrum.</p><fig id="pone-0007538-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007538.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Ideogram illustrating temporal-spatial relationships among major stress-responsive events relevant to oxidative stress mediated apoptosis in NB4 cells.</title><p>Early, intermediate and late stage apoptosis and their characteristic events are indicated on the bar underneath.

H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or ATO may cause extensive cellular damage while exerting biological functions through selective signaling molecules. However, fenretinide has shown to increase intrinsic ROS levels with minimal <italic>in vivo</italic> side effects, probably by interacting with specific cell membrane or cytoplasmic receptors with minimal impacts on other non-related molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007538-Lovat2">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.

Fenretinide is more effective, and possibly more specific in inducing transcriptome changes relevant to oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis compared to oxidative stressors such as ATO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007538-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Our previous work has characterized the transcriptome features of ATRA-induced differentiation and ATO-induced apoptosis in NB4 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007538-Zheng1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, and the results of the present study have allowed us to perform a detailed comparison of the expression patterns between these three compounds. Comparing the transcriptome between ATRA-induced differentiation and fenretinide-induced apoptosis in NB4 cells, we found that fenretinide treatment series were dissimilar to ATRA treatment series, possibly reflecting the distinct biological action of these two retinoids (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007538.s004">Figure S3</xref>). Among our assumed signature spectrum characteristic for oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis, however, overlaps of genes between ATO-induced apoptosis or ATRA/ATO-induced differentiation/apoptosis and fenretinide-induced apoptosis in NB4 cells were not trivial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007538-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Based on these observations, we can speculate that fenretinide functions more in an ATO-like manner to trigger apoptosis, rather than in an ATRA-dependent manner to induce differentiation, although the possibilities that some ATRA-like indirect effects in oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis can not be excluded.</p><p>Choosing fenretinide as an anti-tumor agent may also be superior to the conventional chemotherapeutic agent, cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), in terms of the cytotoxicity. To evaluate the potential cytotoxicity of fenretinide and Ara-C to normal cells, we isolated normal hematopoietic CD34<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells from four non-leukemic donors (i.e., ND1, ND2, ND3, and ND4). As illustrated in Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007538.s005">Figure S4</xref>, the viability (marked by both Annexin V-FITC and 7-ADD negative) was almost unchanged between 2.5 &#x000b5;M fenretinide-treated and untreated cells, whereas the viability after the treatment of 2.5 &#x000b5;M Ara-C was considerably reduced. As summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007538-t001">Table 1</xref>, normal hematopoietic CD34<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were highly resistant to fenretinide, even at the higher dose. Moreover, no significant difference was observed with the increase of fenretinide concentration, with the relative viability of 97.8&#x000b1;5.4&#x00025; at 2.5 &#x000b5;M and 94.2&#x000b1;6.2&#x00025; at 5 &#x000b5;M (P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.414). In contrast, the relative viability of CD34<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells in Ara-C treated samples (43.0&#x000b1;10.6&#x00025;) were significantly lower than that in samples treated by fenretinide of the same concentration (P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;9.04&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>). These results, together with the high sensitivity of leukemia-derived cell lines NB4, U937, and HL60 to fenretinide (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007538.s002">Figure S1</xref>), demonstrated that fenretinide, unlike the conventional chemotherapeutic agents, could specifically target cancer cells while maintaining its minimal cytotoxicity to normal cells.

To such end, we generated transcriptome profile of normal hematopoietic CD34<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells with and without fenretinide treatment, and compared it with genes in Group 6 exclusively induced by fenretinide in NB4 cells. As revealed by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007538-Subramanian1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, we observed significant differences in expression of these genes between fenretinide-treated NB4 cells and fenretinide-treated normal CD34<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007538.s006">Figure S5A</xref>). Rather than the coordinated induction of genes in Group 6 in fenretinide-treated NB4 cells, those genes were predominantly inactive in fenretinide-treated normal CD34<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells, suggesting the absent responses of normal cells to fenretinide. As shown in Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007538.s006">Figure S5B</xref>, similar results were also obtained by GSEA of those genes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007538-g005">Figure 5</xref>.

For the construction of TRSD, putative promoter sequences for about 25,000 RefGene reference sequences, each spanning 2-kb upstream and 200 bp downstream of putative transcription start site, were extracted from the UCSC genome browser (March 2006 build) and mapped to Entrez Gene (NCBI) for unique gene identification. These putative promoter fragments, representing 18,284 unique genes, were then scanned for putative TFBSs by a position weight matrix (PWM)-based MATCH software program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007538-Kel1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Through a rank-based threshold of maximal 2,500 hits per PWM, a genome-wide TRSD was constructed, containing 493 transcriptional regulatory signatures/PWMs with the average of 1,686 potential target genes per PWM. Using this TRSD, we assessed each neuron for the significant enrichment of each transcriptional regulatory signature under the hypergeometric distribution. Under this distribution model, we calculated neuron-specific <italic>p-values</italic> against each regulatory signature using the entire EntrezGene as the background, with each <italic>p-value</italic> representing the likelihood of a specific signature enriched in the neuron. Afterward, the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) derived step-up procedure of FDR was applied to account for multiple hypothesis testing.
