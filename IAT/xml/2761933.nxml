Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), a common clinical disease, is one of the most severe complications of ALF and a major cause of death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. However, the mechanism responsible for SBP is unclear. Previous studies reported that the serum level of tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;) is elevated in patients with severe liver injury and is positively associated with serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. TNF-&#x003b1; is a cytokine with broad-spectrum physio-and patho-responsiveness and is primarily secreted by monocaryons and macrophages. In addition to participating in humoral and cellular immune responses, TNF-&#x003b1; also plays an important role in diseases such as severe hepatitis, septic shock, and inflammatory bowel disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, it is not known whether TNF-&#x003b1; affects the barrier function of the intestinal mucosa.</p><p>The intestinal mucosa is a physical and metabolic barrier against toxins and pathogens in the lumen of the gut. Tight junctions (TJs) are the main structures responsible for restricting paracellular movement of compounds across the intestinal mucosa. Structurally, TJs are composed of cytoplasmic proteins, including the zona occludens proteins, ZO-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and two distinct transmembrane proteins, occludin and claudin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], which are linked to an actin-based cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. TJs function as occluding barriers by maintaining cellular polarity and homeostasis and by regulating the permeability of paracellular spaces in the epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. ZO-1, a member of the MAGUK family of proteins, acts as a scaffold for organizing transmembrane TJ proteins and recruits various signaling molecules and the actin cytoskeleton to the TJs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Although previous studies have afforded an insight into the molecular structure of TJs, much less is known about TJ functionality under physiological or pathophysiological conditions. Few studies have described intestinal mucosa ultrastructure or changes in TJs during liver failure. In this study, we used ALF animal models to investigate the effect of TNF-&#x003b1; on the ultrastructure of the intestinal mucosa with emphasis on the role of TJs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals and treatment</title><p>Male, six-to eight-week-old BALB/c mice (China Medical University) were obtained from the China Medical University (Shenyang, China).

All animal experimental procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee of China Medical University before the commencement of the study.</p><p>All mice were randomly divided into eight groups (n = 8 per group). One group of mice was given intraperitoneal injections of D-galactosamine (GalN; 800 mg/kg body weight; Sigma, Saint Louis, USA) and LPS (10 &#x003bc;g/kg body weight; Sigma) to induce ALF. A second ALF-induction group was also given intraperitoneal injections of GalN (800 mg/kg body weight) and TNF-&#x003b1; (10 &#x003bc;g/kg body weight; Sigma). Two groups were given antibody treatments prior to ALF induction: one was given anti-TNF-&#x003b1; IgG (100 &#x003bc;g per mouse; US Biological, USA) and the other was given anti-TNF-&#x003b1; R1 antibody (100 &#x003bc;g per mouse; R&#x00026;D Systems, USA). The anti-TNF-&#x003b1; IgG and anti-TNF-&#x003b1; R1 antibodies were injected via the vena caudalis 30 minutes and 15 minutes before GalN/LPS administration. There were four control groups, which were injected intraperitoneally with GalN, LPS, TNF-&#x003b1;, or NS.</p><p>In summary, the eight groups were: 1) GalN/LPS; 2) GalN/TNF-&#x003b1;; 3) GalN control; 4) LPS control; 5) TNF-&#x003b1; control; 6) NS control; 7) anti-TNF-&#x003b1; IgG and GalN/LPS; and 8) anti-TNF-&#x003b1; R1 antibody and GalN/LPS. Mice in the first six aforementioned groups were euthanized 2, 6, 9, 12 and 24 h after treatment.

The second highest TNF-&#x003b1; level was observed 9 h after the GalN/LPS injection (319.43 &#x000b1; 33.72 pg/ml). Liver histopathology showed massive or submassive necrosis at 9 h after the GalN/LPS injection. We successfully used TNF-&#x003b1; in place of LPS to induce ALF in conjunction with GalN. The ALT levels and histopathological characteristics of the GalN/TNF-&#x003b1; group were similar to those of the GalN/LPS group. As the ALF mice that died 9 h (60%, 54/90) after GalN/LPS administration displayed levels of serum biochemical markers and liver morphology consistent with liver failure, we assessed the protective effects of anti-TNF-&#x003b1; IgG and anti-TNF-&#x003b1; R1 antibodies on liver failure 9 h after induction of ALF. The mortality of mice treated with either of the two antibodies was 0% (0/8).

TJs are the most important structures in the mucosal barrier. The mechanisms responsible for SBP include cytotoxic effects and alterations in the structure of the intestinal mucosa. Altered TJ structure in active liver cirrhosis has been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] preciously. However, it is rarely reported the ultrastructural characteristics and TJ structrue of the intestinal mucosa in ALF and the mechanisms that link ALF with SBP are still keep unclear.</p><p>In the present study, we found that severe damage to the intestinal mucosa occurred 9 h after GalN/LPS or GalN/TNF-&#x003b1; treatment. Morphologic alterations to the intestinal mucosa included shedding of epithelial cells, fracturing of villi, fusion of adjacent villi, mucosal atrophy and edema. Disruption of TJs on enterocytes and damage to the mitochondria and endoplasm were also observed. The recent discovery that several polarity complexes are conserved in mammalian cells and are closely associated with TJs indicates that TJs play a vital role in establishing epithelial cell polarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Although damage to the intestinal mucosa plays a significant role in bacterial invasion of the body, the responsible mechanism remains to be elucidated.</p><p>Moreover, we observed that bacteria in the intestinal tract of ALF mice invaded the intestinal mucosa by pinocytosis at 9 h after GalN/LPS administration. It should be noted that we observed simultaneous disruptions in the integrity of the TJs. Some studies showed that the integrity of TJs is important for maintaining cellular polarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], a change in cell polarity may have facilitated bacterial invasion, and bacterial invasion may have occurred via the sites of disrupted TJs between intestinal mucosa epithelial cells.</p><p>ZO-1 is important for maintaining the integrity of intestinal mucosal TJs during pathological insults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In our study, we found that the immunoreactive ZO-1 signal in the intestinal mucosa was significantly decreased in ALF mice, which was confirmed by the results of Western blot analysis. We also found that ZO-1 expression was significantly decreased in the intestinal tissue of human ALF patients compared with controls, which is consistent with our findings with animal models. Thus, we conclude that decreased ZO-1 expression causes TJ disruption.</p><p>To detect the key role in the mechanism of the TJ disruption and ZO-1 protein dicreased in ALF, in liver injury, inflammation involves sequential activation of signaling pathways that result in the production of pro-and anti-inflammatory mediators. Among the pro-inflammatory mediators, the TNF-&#x003b1; and TNF-&#x003b1; R1 systems play central roles in the physiological regulation of intestinal barrier function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. TNF-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b3; can induce intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In the present study, we found that in GalN/LPS-treated mice, TNF-a level reached a first peak at 2 h after GalN/LPS injection. We did not observe bacterial invasion of the intestinal mucosa or hepatocyte necrosis at this timepoint. The second peak occurred 9 h after the injection, at this timepoint we did observe bacterial invasion of the intestinal mucosa and hepatocyte necrosis. But bacterial invasion and hepatocyte necrosis were not observed in mice injected with either GalN or TNF-&#x003b1; alone. We thought that the first peak in TNF-&#x003b1; was the result of GalN/LPS injection, not ALF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Then TNF-&#x003b1; was removed through degradation, whereas the second peak was released by activated macrophages, dendritic cells and kupffer cells, which was reported by Nakama T et al[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Moreover, some researchers have found that endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide: LPS) infection due to bacterial translocation is intimately involved in the organ failure. LPS that has translocated into portal blood binds to LPS-binding protein (LBP), was transported to the monocytes and Kupffer cells in liver sinusoids. Inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1; et al are produced and released by monocytes and Kupffer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This study show that the bacterial invasion may play a role in the occurring of the second TNF-&#x003b1; peak, their relationship needs to be further investigated.</p><p>In addition, we found that the decrease in ZO-1 expression was correlated with an increase in the serum level of TNF-&#x003b1;. Many researchers have found that some cytokines can induce endocytosis of TJ proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and internalization of epithelial TJ proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Reductions in levels of the tight junction protein, occludin, in intestinal epithelial cells may be caused by the production of TNF-&#x003b1; in mice with fulminant hepatic failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. TNF-&#x003b1;-induced increase in Caco-2 cell TJ permeability was mediated by NF-kappa B activation. The increase in permeability was associated with NF-kappa B-dependent downregulation of ZO-1 protein expression and altered junctional localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In this study we found that event chronology is more important because it gives us some vital clues. The first TNF-&#x003b1; peak 2 h post GalN/LPS injection may induce the ZO-1 down expression and the tight junction disruption observed at 9 h. The pathophysiological processes of ALF in <italic>vivo </italic>is complicated, TNF-&#x003b1; plays an important role. TNF-&#x003b1; perhaps is an initiator which can induce more cytokines such as IL-6 and IFN-&#x003b3;, which can aggravate liver injury and initiate the development of ALF, and the disruption of TJ intestinal. The first TNF-&#x003b1; peak occurred at 2 h post injection may induce the ZO-1 down expression and the tight junction disruption observed at 9 h timepoint.</p><p>There was no any damage on TJs and no decrease in the expression of ZO-1 on the mice group accepted recombinant TNF-&#x003b1;, the purpose of this study was to discolse the change of TJ in ALF process, a positive finding could be observed if mice accepted a high dose of recombinant TNF-&#x003b1;, a further study need to performed in the future.</p><p>In order to study the role of TNF-&#x003b1; further, we used TNF-&#x003b1; antibody and anti-TNFR antibody. TNF-&#x003b1; antibody could neutralize the quantity of TNF-&#x003b1;, and anti-TNFR antibody could block the combination between TNF-&#x003b1; and TNF-&#x003b1; R. When TNF-&#x003b1; was blockaded with anti-TNF-&#x003b1; IgG antibody or anti-TNF-&#x003b1; R1 antibody, there was a significant decrease in the mice of liver failure and no bacterial invasion or hepatocyte necrosis. These data indicate that TNF-&#x003b1; is an important mediator of bacterial invasion of the intestinal mucosa during ALF. Moreover, we found that a significant reduction in ZO-1 mRNA expression in ALF mice and a significant induction of ZO-1 mRNA expression in ALF mice pretreated with either anti-TNF-&#x003b1; IgG antibody or anti-TNF-&#x003b1; receptor1 antibody. These findings suggest that TNF-&#x003b1; downregulates ZO-1 protein expression in intestinal tissue by inhibiting ZO-1 mRNA expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study demonstrated the changes in intestinal mucosal morphology in mice with ALF. These changes were associated with disruption of TJ structure, changes in epithelial cell microvilli (disarrangement, distortion, and swelling or shrinkage) and mitochondrial matrices (mitochondrial swelling and disturbance of cristae). The disruption of the intestinal mucosa and consequent bacterial invasion of the body in ALF may be caused by reduced levels of the TJ-associated protein, ZO-1, the production of which was not controlled by transcription. These changes were caused by an elevated serum level of TNF-&#x003b1;, as they were absent when TNF-&#x003b1; was blocked by anti-TNF-&#x003b1; IgG antibody or anti-TNF-&#x003b1; R1 antibody. This study confirmed that TNF-&#x003b1; damages TJs and affects the expression of ZO-1 protein <italic>in vivo</italic>. TNF-&#x003b1; also may participate in the pathophysiological mechanism of SBP complicated to ALF. The mechanism of TNF-&#x003b1;-induced changes during ALF is complex and arrants further study.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>ALF: Acute liver failure; GalN: D-galactosamine; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; TJ: tight junction; ZO-1: zona occludens 1; TEM: transmission electron microscopy; TNF-&#x003b1;: tumor necrosis factor-a; WB: Western blot; ALT: alanine transaminase; SBP: spontaneous bacterial peritonitis; TEM: transmission electron microscopy; TNF-&#x003b1; R: tumor necrosis factor-a receptor; NS: normal saline.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>HLS and PL participated in the conception and design of the study and drafted the manuscript.
