The host innate immune Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) was shown previously in cells of myeloid origin to recognize the viral replicative, intermediate double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Thus, dsRNA is critical for the outcome of the infection and appears to be an active component of viral infection that stimulates antiviral activities. It accumulates during the replication of many viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001985-Heitmeier1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001985-Jacobs1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, including influenza virus.

However, the role of influenza A virus infection in the regulation of the newly described pro-inflammatory factor IL-32 expression is still unclear. Furthermore, since COX-2 and IL-32 are obligatory mediators of inflammation, the question arises as to whether there is an interaction between the two proteins or they act as independent effectors of host inflammatory response to viral infection.</p><p>Because COX-2 and IL-32 gene expression are associated with inflammatory processes, the aim of this study is to investigate the role of influenza A virus infection in the regulation of IL-32 expression and to determine the molecular mechanisms responsible. Our results showed that influenza A virus infection or poly(IC) treatment activates COX-2 and IL-32 expression by a heretofore unrecognized mechanism, in which influenza A virus stimulates IL-32 expression through COX-2, and IL-32 feedback inhibits COX-2 expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients</title><p>The study examined 108 consecutive adults with influenza A virus infection (59 male, 49 female, aged 39.2&#x000b1;13.5 yr) seropositive for influenza A antigen and 115 healthy adults (62 male, 53 female, aged 37.6&#x000b1;11.3 yr) seronegative for influenza A antigen.

Because TLR3 contributes directly to the inflammatory response of respiratory epithelial cells to both influenza A virus and dsRNA, we focused on the function of dsRNA in the regulation of COX-2 and IL-32 expression in this study. Role of viral NS1 protein in the pro-inflammatory process need further investigation.</p><p>Cyclooxygenase metabolizes arachidonic acid to prostaglandins (PGs) and thromboxane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001985-Samuelsson1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.

NSAID-associated GI mucosal injury is an important clinical problem and the increased knowledge of physiological roles of COX-2 enzyme in a variety of tissues, including stomach and kidney, together with the withdrawal from the clinic trials of rofecoxib and valdecoxib because of cardiovascular toxicity, have challenged the benefits of selective COX-2 inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001985-Coruzzi1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.

In this model, we further demonstrate that COX-2 is located up-stream of IL-32 in the positive regulatory pathway. The cross-talk between the two genes is described as follows: COX-2 upregulates IL-32 production, and conversely, IL-32 attenuates COX-2 activity.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Hubei provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Hubei CDC) for providing serum samples with seronegative for influenza A antigen in this study, and thank Dr. Kenneth K.
