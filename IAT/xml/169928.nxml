In order to investigate the evolutionary conservation of these biological roles, we have characterized two new family members in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>. The <italic>C.elegans</italic> member, Ce-GRH-1, groups with the Grainyhead subfamily, while the <italic>X.laevis</italic> member, Xl-LSF, groups with the LSF subfamily. Ce-GRH-1 binds DNA in a sequence-specific manner identical to that of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> Grainyhead. In addition, Ce-GRH-1 binds to sequences upstream of the <italic>C.elegans</italic> gene encoding aromatic <sc>l</sc>-amino-acid decarboxylase and genes involved in post-embryonic development, <italic>mab-5</italic> and <italic>dbl-1</italic>. All three <italic>C.elegans</italic> genes are homologs of <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> Grainyhead-regulated genes. RNA-mediated interference of <italic>Ce</italic>-<italic>grh-1</italic> results in embryonic lethality in worms, accompanied by soft, defective cuticles. These phenotypes are strikingly similar to those observed previously in <italic>D.melanogaster grainyhead</italic> mutants, suggesting conservation of the developmental role of these family members over the course of evolution. Our phylogenetic analysis of the expanded LSF&#x0002f;GRH family (including other previously unrecognized proteins&#x0002f;ESTs) suggests that the structural and functional dichotomy of this family dates back more than 700 million years, i.e. to the time when the first multicellular organisms are thought to have arisen.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The LSF&#x0002f;Grainyhead (GRH) transcription factor family initially included LSF, LBP-1a, LBP-9 and LBP-32 in <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, CP2, NF2d9 and CRTR-1 in <italic>Mus musculus</italic>, Grainyhead in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and cCP2 in <italic>Gallus gallus</italic> (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg644tb1">1</xref>). While <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> Grainyhead predominantly regulates genes involved in various stages of fruit fly development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c4">4</xref>), <italic>H.sapiens</italic> and <italic>M.musculus</italic> LSF&#x0002f;CP2 members regulate expression of genes involved in a variety of cell cycle, growth and differentiation processes in non-developmental contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c7">7</xref>). The precise basis of division of various functions among different family members is, however, unclear. The recent discovery and characterization of two new mammalian members, MGR (mammalian grainyhead) and BOM (brother of mammalian grainyhead), plus a new <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> member, dCP2 (considered to be the fruit fly ortholog of LSF), has provided initial evidence for the existence of two distinct divisions in this transcription factor family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c8">8</xref>) (referred to as the LSF and GRH subfamilies in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg644tb1">1</xref> and hereafter). Still, it is unclear if physiological functions among members within each subfamily are conserved and, if so, to what extent. The taxonomic spread across which physiological functions may be conserved, if at all, also remains to be determined.</p><p>We report the sequencing of new members in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> and investigate their placement in the family phylogeny. As part of our analysis, we have constructed protein sequence profiles and corresponding multi-alignments of the family members to address two key points: first, assignments of the new sequences from other species (including some ESTs) to the suggested family dichotomy; second, an identification of the distinctive as well as shared features of the two family divisions. In addition, the profiles provided a basis for constructing a phylogenetic tree that exploits the positional sequence variation across the entire family, rather than using just individual, pairwise similarities. This is the first comprehensive comparative analysis of the entire LSF&#x0002f;GRH family, including proteins&#x0002f;ESTs identified from additional genomes such as <italic>C.elegans</italic>, <italic>X.laevis</italic>, <italic>Danio rerio</italic>, <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> and <italic>Balanus amphitrite</italic>. Our analysis suggests that the family is ancient and that there is a distinct dichotomy among family members in the DNA binding structure and the type of DNA sequences bound, as well as in the type of physiological function. To this end, we have systematically characterized the DNA binding site preference of the <italic>C.elegans</italic> member, Ce-GRH-1, <italic>in vitro</italic> and have shown that it binds to sites upstream of the following <italic>C.elegans</italic> homologs of Grainyhead-regulated genes: <italic>mab-5</italic>, <italic>dbl-1</italic> &#x0005b;both genes involved in post-embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c10">10</xref>)&#x0005d; and the gene encoding aromatic <sc>l</sc>-amino acid decarboxylase. Using RNAi analysis, we have shown that <italic>Ce-grh-1</italic> is an essential gene for embryonic development and cuticle morphogenesis therein and that this developmental role is conserved across evolution between <italic>C.elegans</italic> and <italic>D.melanogaster</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>GenBank accession nos of sequences analyzed</title><p><italic>Ce-grh-1</italic> mRNA, AY323527; Xl-LSF mRNA, AY323528; <italic>A.gambiae</italic> CP2, EAA11971; <italic>A.gambiae</italic> GRH, EAA03941; <italic>B.amphitrite</italic> BCS-3, BAA99545; Y48G8AR genomic clone, AC024797; Y48G8AR.1 (ORF), AAF60703; Xl-5prime EST, AW765842; Xl-3prime EST, AW640817; <italic>D.rerio</italic> EST 1, AL721647; <italic>D.rerio</italic> EST 2, AI794123; <italic>X.laevis</italic> EST 1, BJ066002; <italic>X.laevis</italic> EST 2, BJ060916; <italic>G.gallus</italic> EST 1, BU469673, <italic>Strongyloides stercoralis</italic> EST, BE581124; <italic>Conidiobolus coronatus</italic> EST, BQ621910.</p></sec><sec><title>Construction of protein sequence profiles</title><p>Bayesian prior-based PIMA profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c11">11</xref>) of the protein sequences were constructed for the LSF and GRH subfamilies using local dynamic programming. <italic>Mus musculus</italic> and <italic>G.gallus</italic> LSF&#x0002f;GRH sequences were excluded from the defining set of the profile since they were nearly identical to the corresponding <italic>H.sapiens</italic> orthologs.

The positions of the primers are indicated by the arrows in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg644f1">1</xref>A. Sequencing of purified amplified products yielded exon boundaries similar to the GeneID predicted gene structure. In order to determine the translation initiation site, we took advantage of the phenomenon of trans-splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c23">23</xref>) that occurs to generate mRNAs of an estimated 70&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c24">24</xref>) of the genes in <italic>C.elegans</italic>. In these genes, 5&#x02032; untranslated regions of pre-mRNAs are trans-spliced by splice leader 1 (SL1) RNA and internal sites upstream of coding regions in polycistronic transcripts are trans-spliced by SL2 RNA. RT&#x02013;PCR analysis of <italic>C.elegans</italic> total RNA was performed using sequence complementary either to SL1, to SL2 or to regions of in-frame methionine codons upstream of the computationally predicted translation start site in the putative first exon as a forward primer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg644f2">2</xref>B). No major products were obtained in amplification reactions using the SL2 primer (data not shown). The RT&#x02013;PCR product corresponding to the forward primer around M<sub>13125</sub> (methionine at position 13125 in Y48G8AR) was approximately the same size as the largest product amplified using the SL1 primer (lanes 2&#x02013;5), suggesting that the Ce-GRH-1 pre-mRNA is trans-spliced to SL1 near the codon for M<sub>13125</sub> and that this codon represents the translation initiation site. We confirmed that the junction for SL1 trans-splicing is one base upstream of the codon for M<sub>13125</sub> by sequencing the indicated products (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg644f2">2</xref>B). Therefore, the predicted, full-length Ce-GRH-1 protein is 563 amino acids long, and comprises eight exons. (The ORFs predicted by Wormpep19, Y48G8AR.a and Y48G8AR.b, stand partly corrected in Wormpep 96 as Y48G8AR.1; this predicted ORF has nine exons with a conceptual translated product of 584 amino acids. It still differs from our experimentally verified gene structure in some exon&#x02013;intron boundaries and in the presence of an additional exon.) Ce-GRH-1 mRNA is expressed in all five developmental stages tested, and at apparently comparable levels.</p><p>Two <italic>X.laevis</italic> ESTs, when translated, aligned to N- and C-terminal regions of the LSF subfamily profile (Xl-5prime EST and Xl-3prime EST in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg644f1">1</xref>B). In order to determine if they indeed represented two regions of the same transcript and, if so, to determine the full-length protein sequence, we performed RT&#x02013;PCR assays using RNA extracted from <italic>X.laevis</italic> oocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg644f2">2</xref>C) and primers positioned as indicated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg644f1">1</xref>B. The complete <italic>X.laevis</italic> member (hereafter referred to as <italic>Xl-LSF</italic>) sequence was then reconstructed using the sequence from the purified RT&#x02013;PCR product plus the flanking EST sequences. Given the 87&#x00025; identity over the alignment between Xl-LSF (506 amino acids) and human-LSF (502 amino acids) and the fact that the 3&#x02032; <italic>X.laevis</italic> EST was generated from poly(A)-selected mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c25">25</xref>), it is likely that the predicted Xl-LSF protein is full length.</p></sec><sec><title>Protein sequence profile and phylogenetic analyses of the expanded LSF&#x0002f;GRH family</title><p>The protein sequence profile for each subfamily was expanded to include the additional members from <italic>C.elegans</italic>, <italic>X.laevis</italic>, <italic>B.amphitrite</italic> and <italic>A.gambiae</italic>. Ce-GRH-1, BCS-3 (<italic>B.amphitrite</italic>) and one of the <italic>A.gambiae</italic> members (referred to as <italic>A.gambiae</italic> GRH) aligned to the GRH profile. Xl-LSF and the other <italic>A.gambiae</italic> member (referred to as <italic>A.gambiae</italic> CP2) aligned to the LSF profile. Profile-induced multi-alignments based on the expanded LSF and GRH subfamilies show conservation within, as well as between, subfamilies in the regions required for DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c27">27</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg644f3">3</xref>). However, the regions required for oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c27">27</xref>) are conserved only within each subfamily (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg644f3">3</xref>). It is useful to note that the region required for DNA binding of LSF as mapped by deletion analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c27">27</xref>) partially overlaps the oligomerization-associated region and is consistent with the fact that tetramerization of LSF is a prerequisite for DNA binding. The region directly interacting with DNA, although unknown, is likely to be within the region depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg644f3">3</xref>D.</p><p>We then constructed a phylogenetic tree exploiting the positional amino acid variations across the entire family (including the new sequences in <italic>C.elegans</italic>, <italic>X.laevis</italic>, <italic>A.gambiae</italic> and <italic>B.amphitrite</italic>) using PAUP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c15">15</xref>). We restricted our analysis to regions that could be aligned across all sequences. The tree has two distinct divisions corresponding to the two subfamily profiles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg644f4">4</xref>). The time scales estimated in the tree suggest that this division occurred more than 700 million years ago. It is important to note that in such a reconstruction, the longer branches are more informative. Also, the implied variation in the length of terminal branches suggests some variation in the rates of evolution, particularly between vertebrates and invertebrates in the GRH subfamily.</p></sec><sec><title>Ce-GRH-1 binds DNA sequences upstream of genes involved in post-embryonic development with binding site preference identical to that of Grainyhead</title><p>The phylogenetic placement of <italic>Ce-grh-1</italic> suggests that it is a member of the GRH subfamily. To test this experimentally and to characterize the DNA binding characteristics of Ce-GRH-1 protein, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays using <italic>in vitro</italic> translated Ce-GRH-1 and four different known Grainyhead binding sites upstream of the following <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> genes: <italic>decapentaplegic</italic> (<italic>dpp</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c4">4</xref>), <italic>Ultrabithorax</italic> (<italic>Ubx</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c1">1</xref>), <italic>dopa decarboxylase</italic> (<italic>Ddc</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c2">2</xref>) and PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c28">28</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg644f5">5</xref>A). Both Ce-GRH-1 and Grainyhead bind to the <italic>Ubx</italic> (lanes 4 and 5), <italic>Ddc</italic> (lanes 7 and 8) and PCNA (lanes 10 and 11) sites, although Ce-GRH-1 has an apparent lower binding affinity. Grainyhead only weakly binds the <italic>dpp</italic> site (lane 2), where no binding is observable with Ce-GRH-1 (lane 1). This is not surprising given the relative affinities for binding of the two proteins to the other sites tested. In a competition binding assay of Ce-GRH-1 with wild-type or mutant <italic>Ubx</italic> DNAs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg644f5">5</xref>B), 10- and 40-fold molar excess of non-radiolabeled wild-type or Mt3 DNA competed effectively for binding (lanes 2 &#x02013;5), while a 40-fold excess of Mt1, Mt4 or Mt2 DNA offered little competition (lanes 6&#x02013;11), demonstrating the sequence specificity of the central C(A&#x0002f;C&#x0002f;T)(T&#x0002f;G)G as well as flanking bases in the site required for DNA binding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg644f5">5</xref>D). Similar results were obtained for competition assays with Grainyhead (data not shown). Thus, Ce-GRH-1 binds DNA in a sequence-specific manner identical to that of Grainyhead.</p><p>To test whether there is functional conservation between the two proteins, the upstream regions of <italic>C.elegans</italic> homologs of the four genes, <italic>dpp</italic> (<italic>C.elegans dbl-1</italic>), <italic>Ubx</italic> (<italic>C.elegans mab-5</italic>), <italic>Ddc</italic> (<italic>C.elegans</italic> gene encoding aromatic <sc>l</sc>-amino acid decarboxylase) and PCNA (<italic>C.elegans pcn-1</italic>) were scanned for potential Ce-GRH-1 binding sites. Binding assays of Ce-GRH-1 and Grainyhead with DNAs containing these sites were performed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg644f5">5</xref>C and data not shown). Both Ce-GRH-1 and Grainyhead bound to sites upstream of <italic>dbl-1</italic> (lanes 1 and 2), <italic>mab-5</italic> (lanes 4 and 5) and the gene encoding aromatic <sc>l</sc>-amino acid decarboxylase (&#x02018;CeDdc&#x02019;, lanes 7 and 8), again with Ce-GRH-1 binding with apparently lower affinity. The various Ce-GRH-1 binding sites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg644f5">5</xref>D, upper panel) were then aligned and compared to an alignment of DNAs that were not bound (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg644f5">5</xref>D, lower panel), at least under our experimental conditions. Based on this small data set, we deduced that at least eight contiguous base positions are important for Ce-GRH-1 binding. A matrix was generated with the number of occurrences of each of the four nucleotides in each of these eight positions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg644f5">5</xref>D, middle panels indicating the matrix and the derived pictogram visualization). The preference for an adenine immediately upstream and three thymidines immediately downstream of the central C(A&#x0002f;C&#x0002f;T)(T&#x0002f;G)G is consistent with the lack of binding in DNAs where these positions exhibit transversions.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Ce-grh-1</italic> RNAi worms are embryonic lethal with defective cuticles</title><p>We examined the function of Ce-GRH-1 <italic>in vivo</italic> using RNAi analysis in <italic>C.elegans</italic>. A 1.6 kb region of double-stranded RNA corresponding to the full-length Ce-GRH-1 coding region was prepared and injected into N2 strain <italic>C.elegans</italic> L4 stage larvae. Upon reaching adulthood, these injected animals produced apparently normal numbers of embryos, however, greater than 95&#x00025; of these embryos failed to hatch. The remainder hatched and then died as L1 stage larvae. The embryos arrested development at the three-fold stage with well differentiated tissues and apparently normal motility within the egg. However, muscle contractions that would normally cause the body and cuticle of the animal to bend smoothly were instead observed to induce constrictions or puckering in the external cuticle (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg644f6">6</xref>A with B and C). All of the arrested embryos observed (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003e; 500) exhibited this phenotype, suggesting that the cuticles of the <italic>Ce-grh-1</italic> (RNAi) embryos are malformed and may lack the rigidity necessary for normal motility and hatching. However, further ultrastructural studies will be required to determine what, if any, specific defects exist in the cuticle architecture. Also consistent with the idea that a cuticle defect underlies the <italic>Ce-grh-1</italic> phenotype, we found that &#x0223c;8&#x00025; of the <italic>Ce-grh-1</italic> (RNAi) embryos exhibit ruptures in their cuticles resulting in the extrusion of cells from the bodies of the animals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg644f6">6</xref>B and C and data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We have undertaken the first comprehensive comparative genome analysis of the LSF&#x0002f;GRH transcription factor family, members of which play an important role in the cell cycle, growth, differentiation and development. We have sequenced two new family members, Ce-GRH-1 and Xl-LSF, and identified several other previously unrecognized members. mRNA of Ce-GRH-1, the novel <italic>C.elegans</italic> member, is expressed in at least five developmental stages and its mRNA is SL1 trans-spliced one base upstream of the codon representing the translation initiation site. Our protein sequence profile and phylogenetic analysis both reflect the dichotomy in the LSF&#x0002f;GRH family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c8">8</xref>). The DNA binding site preference of Ce-GRH-1 is consistent with its phylogenetic placement in the Grainyhead subfamily. Our findings are that (i) Ce-GRH-1 binds to the promoters of three genes involved in post-embryonic development that are homologous to Grainyhead-regulated genes and (ii) inhibition of <italic>Ce-grh-1</italic> by RNAi results in embryonic lethality. These strongly support the hypothesis that the GRH subfamily members are involved in development.</p><p>Our computational analysis of the expanded LSF&#x0002f;GRH family, together with the results of Wilanowski <italic>et al</italic>., suggest that the phylogenetic division into two subfamilies reflects significant differences in structure and function between them. Functionally, Grainyhead, the best studied protein in its subfamily, is mainly a regulator of developmental control genes in <italic>D.melanogaster</italic>, such as <italic>Ultrabithorax</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c1">1</xref>), <italic>dopa decarboxylase</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c2">2</xref>), <italic>tailless</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c3">3</xref>) and <italic>decapentaplegic</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c4">4</xref>). Fruit flies carrying <italic>grainyhead</italic> mutations display an embryonic lethal phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c2">2</xref>). Similarly, <italic>H.sapiens</italic> MGR (presumably the <italic>H.sapiens</italic> ortholog of <italic>grainyhead</italic>) binds to and can activate the promoter of <italic>engrailed</italic>, a gene involved in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c8">8</xref>). Ce-GRH-1, the putative <italic>C.elegans</italic> ortholog, binds the promoters of the gene encoding aromatic <sc>l</sc>-amino acid decarboxylase and genes involved in post-embryonic development, <italic>mab-5</italic> and <italic>dbl-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c10">10</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg644f5">5</xref>C). These genes are all homologs of <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> Grainyhead-regulated genes. It remains to be seen if Ce-GRH-1 regulates the transcription of these genes <italic>in vivo</italic>. <italic>Ce-grh-1</italic> phenotypic knockout worms generated by our RNAi analysis are late embryonic lethal and have cuticles apparently defective in rigidity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg644f6">6</xref>). The observed cuticle rupturing in these RNAi worms suggests that their cuticles are too weak to maintain structural integrity. These phenotypes are strikingly similar to the phenotypes of <italic>grainyhead</italic> mutant fruit flies, which also die at the end of embryogenesis, have granular head skeletal structures and misshapen, weak cuticles that manifest distended bulges and rupture easily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c2">2</xref>). In addition, Ce-GRH-1 binds to the promoter of the gene encoding aromatic <sc>l</sc>-amino acid decarboxylase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg644f5">5</xref>C), the <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> homolog of which is involved in cuticle hardening and is regulated by Grainyhead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c2">2</xref>). These findings suggest that Grainyhead and Ce-GRH-1 regulate genes in the embryonic epidermis involved in cuticular morphogenesis pathways and that these developmental pathways have been conserved during the course of evolution. Such conservation of developmental gene regulatory networks across evolution has been found previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c29">29</xref>). Specifically, there is phylogenetic evidence for the existence of a monophyletic clade (Ecdysozoa) of moulting animals including arthropods and nematodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c30">30</xref>), suggesting that the moulting process arose once and that related molecular mechanisms are common to these species.</p><p><italic>Homo sapiens</italic> and <italic>M.musculus</italic> LSF&#x0002f;CP2, on the other hand, bind to promoters of genes such as DNA polymerase &#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c31">31</xref>), thymidylate synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c7">7</xref>), c-fos (R.Misra, H.-C.Huang, M.Greenberg and U.Hansen, unpublished data), ornithine decarboxylase (J.Volker, A.P.Butler and U.Hansen, unpublished data), &#x003b1;-globin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c5">5</xref>) and IL-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c6">6</xref>), involved in a wide variety of processes, including the cell cycle, growth and differentiation.</p><p>Although the protein sequence profiles representing the two family divisions show conservation in the DNA binding-associated region as mapped by deletion analysis, they show no commonality in the oligomerization-associated region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg644f3">3</xref>). Further, there is no protein&#x02013;protein interaction observed between proteins belonging to different subfamilies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c26">26</xref>). Structurally, Grainyhead binds to a &#x02018;single&#x02019; DNA site as a dimer while LSF binds two direct repeat DNA sites as a tetramer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c32">32</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest fundamental differences in the quaternary DNA binding protein structure between the two subfamilies.</p><p>Our analysis of <italic>Ce-grh-1</italic> is consistent with this family dichotomy, based both on phylogenetic and experimental data. We have demonstrated that the binding site preference for Ce-GRH-1 is identical to that of Grainyhead, although our data set is statistically small. In addition to competition analyses using mutated DNA binding sites, comparison of sequences of DNAs that bound Ce-GRH-1 versus those that did not (at least under our binding conditions) indicated contiguous base positions important for interaction with Ce-GRH-1; these agree with the base preferences estimated in the DNA binding site count matrix.</p><p>Among the known full-length proteins in the family, the <italic>H.sapiens</italic>, <italic>M.musculus</italic>, <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> and <italic>A.gambiae</italic> genomes have evolved members in both the GRH and LSF subfamilies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg644f4">4</xref>). Although there is only a single identified member each in <italic>X.laevis</italic> and <italic>G.gallus</italic> (both in the LSF subfamily), the dbEST database contains additional <italic>X.laevis</italic> EST sequences with greater than 85&#x00025; identity over their entire length to LBP-9 in the LSF subfamily and MGR in the GRH subfamily and a similar <italic>G.gallus</italic> EST corresponding to MGR (dotted lines in tree, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg644f4">4</xref>). There is also EST evidence for the existence of genes similar to LSF and MGR in <italic>D.rerio</italic> (zebrafish) (dotted lines in tree, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg644f4">4</xref>), reflecting a similar gene duplication event. The <italic>B.amphitrite</italic> BCS-3 protein groups with the GRH subfamily in the tree, and its cDNA is selectively expressed in the larval stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c33">33</xref>). Given its phylogenetic placement, we anticipate that there is at least one additional member belonging to the LSF subfamily in this genome.</p><p>Finally, the <italic>C.elegans</italic> genome apparently has a single member, which clusters with the GRH subfamily. Similarly, there is evidence for GRH subfamily members in other nematodes such as <italic>Caenorhabditis briggsae</italic> (contig FPC2032 from assembly cb25.agp8, derived from BLAST analysis of <italic>C.briggsae</italic> genomic contigs) and <italic>S.stercoralis</italic> (BLAST analysis of dbEST). However, there is no evidence for a nematode protein in the LSF subfamily in terms of additional products in our RT&#x02013;PCR assays performed across <italic>C.elegans</italic> developmental stages (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg644f2">2</xref>A), sequence similarities to nematode ESTs or sequence similarities to either the complete genome sequence of <italic>C.elegans</italic> or the available genome sequence of <italic>C.briggsae</italic>. Thus, the nematodes alone appear to have a representative from only one of these two subfamilies. The function of the other gene(s) may have been lost through the course of evolution in these genomes. There is precedent for gene loss in nematodes in the case of other gene families, including the HOX gene cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg644c18">18</xref>). An alternative hypothesis is that the LSF subfamily functions may have been subsumed by the GRH member in nematodes.</p><p>Our phylogenetic analysis, along with the known functions and quaternary structures of the LSF&#x0002f;GRH family members, suggests that the family underwent a major gene duplication event more than 700 million years ago (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg644f4">4</xref>), when the first multicellular organisms are thought to have evolved. (Consistent with this estimated time line, the only EST from fungi with even weak sequence similarity to proteins in the LSF&#x0002f;GRH family is an EST from <italic>C.coronatus</italic>, a multicellular fungus.) This gene duplication event may have resulted in a distinct functional and structural division among its members.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg644f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Bar representation of protein sequence profile-induced multiple alignments of the GRH and LSF subfamilies.
