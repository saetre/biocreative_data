The non-overlapping emission spectra of EYFP and ECFP make them ideal for double labeling studies in living tissues.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The Cre-<italic>loxP</italic> site specific recombination system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] is widely used for production of tissue-specific and conditional knockout alleles in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Recently, a Cre-dependent <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter strain (R26R) was produced by targeted insertion of a lacZ gene, preceded by a loxP-flanked (floxed) strong transcriptional termination sequence (tpA), into the ubiquitously expressed ROSA26 locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The <italic>R26R</italic> allele terminates transcription prematurely, but when the mice are crossed with Cre-expressing transgenic mice, the Cre-mediated excision of the floxed termination sequence leads to constitutive <italic>lacZ</italic> expression. Thus, these doubly transgenic animals express <italic>lacZ</italic> only in the cells that have expressed Cre, as well as in all of their daughter cells. Similar Cre reporter strains have been produced using different promoters to express <italic>lacZ</italic> [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]], Another variation on this theme has been the development of the Z/AP reporter strain, which switches from lacZ to alkaline phosphatase expression upon exposure to Cre recombinase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. All of these strains are useful for monitoring the expression of Cre recombinase, as well as for cell lineage tagging experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]].</p><p>Here, we describe the production of two similar Cre reporter alleles that express enhanced yellow or cyan fluorescent protein (EYFP or ECFP), two color variants of the green fluorescent protein (GFP). GFP and its variants are autofluorescent proteins that can be visualized in living cells, and are therefore particularly useful for monitoring gene expression in whole embryos, animals or cultured cells and organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. EYFP and ECFP were chosen because their emission spectra overlap minimally, so they can be distinguished when used simultaneously, whereas the emission spectra of EYFP and ECFP overlap to a greater extent with that of EGFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] http://www.clontech.com/gfp/pdf/LivingColors.pdf.</p><p>During the course of this work, three new Cre reporter strains that conditionally express EGFP were reported. Two transgenic strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] use the &#x003b2;-actin promoter/CMV enhancer to express EGFP following Cre-mediated excision of a stop sequence, and in one of these, lacZ is expressed prior to the Cre-mediated excision event. In the third strain, which is similar in principle to the YFP and CFP alleles reported here, EGFP was inserted at the <italic>ROSA26</italic> locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The availability of different Cre reporter strains will be valuable, not only because of the advantages of different reporter proteins, but also because the efficiency of Cre-mediated excision may be dependent on the target locus.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>Considering the utility of the <italic>ROSA26</italic> locus for expressing various sequences in a ubiquitous manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], we generated a generic targeting vector (pBigT), into which any sequence of interest can easily be inserted downstream of a floxed neo-tpA cassette, and then subsequently cloned into a plasmid with the <italic>ROSA26</italic> genomic flanking arms. <italic>ECFP</italic> or <italic>EYFP</italic> was inserted into pBigT, and the resulting sequence was inserted into a vector containing <italic>ROSA26</italic> genomic sequences to permit homologous recombination (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The targeting vector was electroporated into ES cells, and 27 G418-resistant colonies were analyzed for each construct. Three R26R-EYFP and two R26R-ECFP colonies carried the targeted allele, as determined by Southern blot hybridization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The targeted ES cells, originally derived from strain 129X1/SvJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], were injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts, and the resulting chimeric mice were bred to C57BL/6J females to pass the mutation through the germ line. Thus, the resulting mice were a mixture of strains 129X1/SvJ and C57BL/6J.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Targeting of the <italic>ROSA26</italic> locus.

However, when the reporter mice were crossed to &#x003b2;-actin-Cre transgenic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], which express Cre constitutively in most or all cells including those in the early embryo, the resulting doubly transgenic embryos displayed apparently ubiquitous expression of EYFP or ECFP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), indicating efficient excision of the floxed stop sequence. The expression of EYFP vs. ECFP could be clearly distinguished using appropriate filter sets (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This ubiquitous expression of EYFP or ECFP was heritably transmitted to the following generations (data not shown), resulting in ubiquitously expressing lines of mice that will be useful for lineage tracing in chimeric mice or embryos, analogous to the original ROSA26 lacZ promoter trap strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Ubiquitous expression of EYFP or ECFP in R26R E8.5 embryos carrying a <italic>&#x003b2;-actin-Cre</italic> transgene.

Isl1 is a LIM homeodomain transcription factor expressed in motor neurons and dorsal root and cranial sensory ganglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Isl1-Cre mice were produced by targeting <italic>Cre</italic> into the <italic>Isl1</italic> locus (see Materials and Methods). Heterozygous Isl1-Cre mice were viable and fertile, while homozygous mice died at E9-E10.5, as has been previously described with mice in which the exon encoding the second LIM domain of Isl1 had been deleted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> shows an experiment in which the R26R-YFP mice were crossed with the Isl1-Cre mice, resulting in expression of EYFP in motor neurons and dorsal root ganglia in the doubly transgenic offspring. Thus R26R-YFP mice faithfully report the cell-specific patterns of Isl1/Cre in subsets of neurons. As a control, the Isl-1/Cre mice were also mated to the original <italic>R26R lacZ</italic> allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], resulting in a similar pattern of expression of <italic>lacZ</italic>.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Specific expression of EYFP in R26R-EYFP mice carrying <italic>Isl1-Cre</italic>.

This is not surprising, given the higher quantum yield and extinction coefficient of EYFP as compared to ECFP, both of which result in higher fluorescence intensity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have constructed two reporter lines of mice that express EYFP or ECFP only in cells expressing the Cre recombinase, and their daughter cells, by targeting these cDNAs into the ubiquitously expressed ROSA26 locus, preceded by a <italic>loxP</italic> flanked "stop" sequence. Crosses with a general Cre expressing strain (&#x003b2;actin-Cre) and two tissue-specific Cre strains (Isl1-Cre and En1-Cre) showed that the reporter strains function as expected, based on their similarity to the well characterized R26R-lacZ strains. In contrast to <italic>lacZ</italic> expression, which cannot be easily detected in living tissue, the EYFP and ECFP reporter strains (together with the GFP reporter strains currently available) will be very useful for monitoring the expression of Cre in living tissues, or tracing the lineage of these cells and their descendants, in cultured embryos or organs. Furthermore, by using modified forms of Cre whose recombinase activity is inducible, one can use these reporter mice to perform detailed analysis on the lineage of cells at different time points during development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Sources of Plasmids</title><p>The components of the <italic>ROSA26</italic> targeting vectors were a gift from Philippe Soriano.

The XbaI site used for insertion into the <italic>ROSA26</italic> genomic locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] was replaced by a linker (PacI, SwaI, AscI), so that it could be digested with PacI and AscI, and receive the bigT sequence.</p><p>To make pBigT, plasmid pSA&#x003b2;geo was digested with ClaI and XbaI to remove the <italic>&#x003b2;geo</italic> and bpA sequence but leave behind the SA, the ends were Klenow filled and the plasmid self-ligated.
