Baker's yeast Pif1p is involved in the maintenance of mitochondrial, ribosomal and telomeric DNA and may also have a general role in chromosomal replication by affecting Okazaki fragment maturation. Here we investigate the substrate preferences for Pif1p. The enzyme was preferentially active on RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids, as seen by faster unwinding rates on RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids compared to DNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids. When using forked substrates, which have been shown previously to stimulate the enzyme, Pif1p demonstrated a preference for RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids. This preferential unwinding could not be correlated to preferential binding of Pif1p to the substrates that were the most readily unwound. Although the addition of the single-strand DNA-binding protein replication protein A (RPA) stimulated the helicase reaction on all substrates, it did not diminish the preference of Pif1p for RNA&#x02013;DNA substrates. Thus, forked RNA&#x02013;DNA substrates are the favored substrates for Pif1p <italic>in vitro</italic>. We discuss these findings in terms of the known biological roles of the enzyme.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Helicases are ubiquitous enzymes that harness the energy of nucleotide hydrolysis to translocate on a nucleic acid strand. Helicases participate in most transactions involving nucleic acids, including DNA replication, recombination, repair, transcription, protein synthesis and ribonucleoprotein assembly and remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Pif1p is the founding member of a DNA helicase family conserved from yeast to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The helicase was originally discovered by its effects on maintenance of yeast mitochondrial DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). In the absence of Pif1p, yeast cells lose mitochondrial DNA at high rates, which generates respiratory-deficient (petite) cells.</p><p>Pif1p was rediscovered by its nuclear role in the synthesis of telomeric DNA by telomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), the specialized reverse transcriptase that maintains chromosome ends in most eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). The nuclear and mitochondrial isoforms of Pif1p, which originate from the same mRNA, are generated by differential codon start usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The effects of the nuclear isoform of Pif1p on telomerase have been extensively studied, both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro. In vivo</italic>, Pif1p inhibits telomerase-mediated telomere lengthening and <italic>de novo</italic> telomere addition at double-strand breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). <italic>De novo</italic> addition is rare in wild-type cells, but is increased 600&#x02013;1000-fold in <italic>pif1</italic>&#x00394; cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Telomere length is inversely related to Pif1p levels: reduced Pif1p results in long telomeres, and Pif1p over-expression results in modest telomere shortening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The effects of Pif1p on telomere length and <italic>de novo</italic> telomere addition are telomerase dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), suggesting that Pif1p affects telomerase directly. In support of this possibility, <italic>in vitro</italic> assays show that Pif1p removes telomerase from DNA ends, which limits telomerase nucleotide addition processivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>The role of Pif1p in the nucleus is not limited to telomeres. <italic>PIF1</italic> deletion has a modest effect on ribosomal DNA (rDNA) replication by inhibiting fork movement past the replication fork barrier (RFB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Pif1p may have a more general role in chromosomal replication as its deletion suppresses the lethality associated with loss of the helicase/endonuclease Dna2p, which functions in Okazaki fragment maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Pif1p may also function to resolve recombination intermediates as Pif1p over-expression suppresses the Sgs1p-induced damage that occurs in the absence of the topoisomerase Top3p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>Understanding how Pif1p functions in the cell requires a detailed analysis of its enzymological properties. Several characteristics of the enzyme have already been reported. Using an enzyme purified from yeast mitochondria or a recombinant protein produced in insect or bacterial cells, Pif1p was shown to be a distributive 5'&#x02013;3' DNA helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), whose activity is stimulated by forked substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Pif1p is also able to unwind RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids if the substrates contain a 5' single-stranded DNA overhang but does not unwind RNA&#x02013;RNA hybrids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Here we show that Pif1p preferentially unwinds RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids, and that the enzyme is synergistically stimulated by the presence of a forked structure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Proteins</title><p>Recombinant Yeast RPA purified from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> was a generous gift from P.

In a recent study, we showed that Pif1p is able to displace short DNA or RNA strands, provided that the loading strand is made of DNA. This result, along with our demonstration that Pif1p inhibits telomerase <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) raised the possibility that Pif1p inhibits yeast telomerase by unwinding the RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrid formed between the telomerase RNA, TLC1 and the end of the TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> telomeric DNA. In order to compare the activity of Pif1p on RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids versus DNA&#x02013;DNA substrates, we first determined if Pif1p unwinding of these two types of substrates had the same optimal salt requirements. For this experiment, we used as a substrate a 40-mer DNA oligonucleotide to which was annealed a complementary 20-mer oligonucleotide made of either DNA or RNA, leaving a 20-nt 5&#x02032; single-stranded overhang (substrates D20 and R20, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>a). The experiments were conducted in conditions in which the enzyme was in excess, as significant unwinding was not observed if the substrates were present in excess or in the presence of a DNA trap (data not shown). Both DNA&#x02013;DNA (closed circles) and RNA&#x02013;DNA (open circles) hybrids were optimally unwound at 50 mM NaCl, and no activity was detected at 200 mM NaCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>b and c). Therefore, the optimal salt concentration for unwinding both RNA&#x02013;DNA and DNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids is 50 mM NaCl. At all salt concentrations, a larger fraction of the RNA&#x02013;DNA substrate compared to the DNA&#x02013;DNA substrate was unwound. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Pif1p unwinding activity as a function of NaCl concentration.

To characterize this preference more quantitatively, we designed a family of RNA&#x02013;DNA and DNA&#x02013;DNA substrates of various sizes. These substrates contain a 13-, 20- or 40-nt-long duplex region with the same 5' single-stranded 20-nt overhang (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>a). The different substrates were designed to have high G+C content but an otherwise random sequence and predicted not to form stable secondary structures at 35&#x000b0;C. Not only was the overhang identical on all of the substrates, but in addition, longer substrates contained the sequence of the shorter substrates at the 5&#x02032; end of the duplex region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>a). To ensure that the differences in unwinding rates were not due to differential stability of the substrates, we measured the thermal melting curves of all the substrates. RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids of high GC content are predicted to be more stable in solution than their DNA&#x02013;DNA counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). As expected, RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids were consistently as stable as or more stable than their DNA counterpart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>b).</p><p>The six substrates were incubated with ATP, 50 mM NaCl, and excess Pif1p (60:1 enzyme/substrate ratio), which corresponded to saturating amounts of the enzyme for these substrates (data not shown). The displacement of the <sup>32</sup>P-labeled top (short) strand of the substrate was monitored by electrophoresis in a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and quantified by phosphorImager analysis of the dried gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>a). Efficient unwinding was observed for each RNA&#x02013;DNA substrate. Even the longest RNA&#x02013;DNA substrate, R40, was 60% unwound by the 3-min time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>a and b). In contrast, only the 13-mer DNA substrates were fully unwound during the 60-min time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>a and b; D13). In each case, Pif1p unwound the RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrid more efficiently than its DNA&#x02013;DNA counterpart, and the difference in the amplitude of the reaction and in the turnover rate between the two types of substrates increased with the size of the hybrid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>c and d). Indeed, the difference in the turnover rates between the RNA&#x02013;DNA and DNA&#x02013;DNA substrates was respectively 2-fold for the 13-mer, 13-fold for the 20-mer and 75-fold for the 40-mer. Pif1p was almost completely unable to unwind the 40-mer DNA substrate in these conditions even after 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>a and b; D40). When the reactions were started in the presence of a single-strand DNA trap, none of the substrates was unwound at a quantifiable level, which made it impossible to measure single cycle kinetic rates on these substrates. Thus, although the activity of Pif1p is strongly stimulated by RNA&#x02013;DNA substrates, the enzyme is poorly processive on both DNA&#x02013;DNA and RNA&#x02013;DNA substrates. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Kinetics of unwinding by Pif1p of RNA&#x02013;DNA and DNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids of various sizes.

Here we determine if this stimulation is also observed with RNA&#x02013;DNA substrates. The substrates used for this experiment are based on the 20-mer hybrids D20 and R20 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>a). To generate forked substrates, a 10-mer poly(dA) segment was added to the 3' end of the labeled (top) strand of the D20 substrate to generate fD20. Similarly, a 10-mer poly(rA) was added to the 3' end of the top strand of the R20 substrate to generate fR20 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>a). At 35&#x000b0;C, fD20 and fR20 were rapidly and completely unwound (&#x0003c;20 s, data not shown). This result confirmed that Pif1p activity is stimulated by forked substrates, but in these conditions the unwinding of the substrates was too fast to allow quantitative analyses.

We then tested if the increased unwinding rate for forked substrates was accompanied by a change in the ability of the enzyme to unwind these substrates under single cycle condition. In the presence of a 500-fold excess of a 36-nt-long single-strand DNA trap, which prevents the enzyme from re-associating if it dissociates from the substrate during the course of the unwinding reaction, no unwinding of fD20 was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>b, fD20, left panel).

This result provides two mechanistic insights. First it indicates that, in contrast to what is observed with DNA&#x02013;DNA substrates, the enzyme is able to unwind the 20-mer forked RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrid without dissociating. Since no unwinding of the unforked substrates was observed in single turnover experiments (data not shown), this result also suggests that the presence of a RNA&#x02013;DNA fork helps stabilize the enzyme&#x02013;substrate complex upon binding and/or during the initial steps of unwinding.</p></sec><sec><title>Binding of Pif1p to DNA&#x02013;DNA and RNA&#x02013;DNA substrates</title><p>A possible explanation for the increased activity of Pif1p on RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids and on forked substrates could be that Pif1p binds preferentially to the substrates that are more easily unwound. Using a quantitative gel retardation assay, we compared the binding of Pif1p to forked and unforked substrates comprised of either DNA&#x02013;DNA or RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids in absence of nucleotide, in presence of AMP&#x02013;PNP, a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>) or in presence of the poorly hydrolyzable ATP analog ATP&#x003b3;S. In absence of nucleotide, Pif1p bound about as well to the fR20, fD20 and D20 substrates. The <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> for binding to these substrates was, respectively, 1.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup> M (D20), 1.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup> M (fD20) and 5.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> M (fR20). Pif1p bound most efficiently to the unforked RNA&#x02013;DNA R20 substrate (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 1.7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> M), although this was not the most readily unwound substrate. These data indicate that preferential binding in absence of nucleotide does not account for the preferential unwinding of forked substrates, at least not in a way that is measurable by gel retardation (compare squares to circles, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>a). However, Pif1p does show preferential binding to RNA&#x02013;DNA substrates compared to their DNA&#x02013;DNA counterparts, although this 2- to 5-fold preference is relatively small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>a, compare circles to circles and squares to squares). In presence of saturating amount of AMPPNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>b) or in presence of ATP&#x003b3;S (data not shown), the binding affinity decreased significantly by more than 10-fold for all substrates except for the forked DNA substrate fD20. Thus, under conditions containing nucleotide analogs, which are the most similar to conditions used for unwinding assays, a DNA&#x02013;DNA substrate had the highest binding affinity rather than the RNA&#x02013;DNA substrates that were more readily unwound. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Pif1p binding to forked and unforked substrates.

The mechanistic explanation for this effect is that SSB or RPA prevents the re-annealing of partially unwound substrates by trapping the unwound region of the substrate in single-strand form. If, during the unwinding reaction, the DNA strand of the DNA&#x02013;DNA substrate had a higher tendency than the RNA oligonucleotide to re-anneal to the opposite DNA strand, it would lead to an apparent slower unwinding rate for DNA&#x02013;DNA substrates. We carried out the unwinding reaction of the 40-mer substrate (1 nM) in the presence or absence of saturating amounts of yeast RPA (5 &#x003bc;M) at 30&#x000b0;C and 100 nM Pif1p. As seen for other helicases, Pif1p unwinding activity was stimulated by RPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). RPA stimulation of Pif1p was detected with both DNA&#x02013;DNA and RNA&#x02013;DNA substrates, although stimulation of unwinding of the RNA&#x02013;DNA substrate was relatively modest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>a and b). However, RPA did not alleviate the preference for RNA&#x02013;DNA unwinding. Therefore, the relative inefficiency of Pif1p for unwinding DNA&#x02013;DNA substrates is not due to a preferential re-annealing of the displaced DNA strand, but is due to an intrinsic lower processivity of the enzyme when unwinding DNA. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Pif1p activity is stimulated by yeast RPA.

This preference was manifest at several levels. First, the rate of unwinding of a given RNA&#x02013;DNA substrate was always faster than the rate of unwinding of the comparable DNA&#x02013;DNA substrate. In the case of the linear 40-mer substrates, the rate of unwinding of the RNA&#x02013;DNA substrate was almost two orders of magnitude higher than for the DNA&#x02013;DNA 40-mer substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Second, the fraction of RNA&#x02013;DNA substrate that was unwound was consistently higher. Indeed, Pif1p was able to unwind efficiently a 40-mer RNA&#x02013;DNA substrate, while &#x0003c;5% of a 40-mer DNA&#x02013;DNA substrate was unwound even in the presence of a 60-fold excess of Pif1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Third, even though the unwinding reactions for RNA&#x02013;DNA and DNA&#x02013;DNA substrates shared the same optimal salt concentration, the RNA&#x02013;DNA unwinding reaction was more resistant to increasing ionic strength in the physiological range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>The ability to unwind RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids has been reported for several DNA and RNA helicases, such as the <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA repair helicase UvrD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), the RNA helicase NPH-II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) and several replicative DNA helicases, including <italic>E. coli</italic> DnaB, the <italic>Methanothermobacter thermotrophicus</italic> MCM protein and the <italic>S. pombe</italic> MCM4, 6, 7 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). However, of these helicases, only UvrD also exhibits preferential unwinding of RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Therefore, the preference for unwinding this type of substrate does not appear to be a common property of helicases. Indeed, Pif1p's preference for RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids contrasts with the emerging view on the mechanism of unwinding for several helicases that suggests that most helicases are not particularly sensitive to the chemical identity of the displaced strand. For example, studies with the bacteriophage T4 Dda helicase, a 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; SFI superfamily member, show that the rate-limiting step for unwinding is relatively insensitive to the chemical nature of the displaced strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Similar conclusions have been reached for NPH-II, a 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; SFII RNA helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Therefore, the mechanism of nucleic acids recognition and/or unwinding by Pif1p are likely different from that of these prototypical SF1 and SF2 superfamily helicases.</p><p>Pif1p is also stimulated by forked substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Here we show that the stimulatory effect of the fork structure occurs with both DNA&#x02013;DNA and RNA&#x02013;DNA substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). At 35&#x000b0;C, both the forked RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids and the forked DNA&#x02013;DNA substrates were unwound very rapidly, in &#x0003c;20 s. In comparison, the unwinding of R20 was complete in 1 min under identical experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Therefore, we can estimate that the presence of the fork increases the apparent kinetic rate of unwinding by at least 5-fold. Since Pif1p binding to forked substrates was not significantly higher than its binding to conventional tailed substrates, both in absence of nucleotide and in presence of the nucleotide analog AMPPNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>) or ATP&#x003b3;S, this substrate specificity is probably not established by differential binding. However, it is possible that the fork structure increases the stability of the helicase&#x02013;substrate complex and/or triggers the transition between the binding form of the enzyme and the translocating form upon ATP binding. A detailed analysis of the effects of nucleotide binding on nucleic acids binding by Pif1p will be needed to address this question.</p><p>When the unwinding of the two forked substrates was done at 25&#x000b0;C, the unwinding of both forked substrates was slower, but the unwinding of fR20 was still nine times faster than unwinding of fD20. The stimulatory effect of the fork was observed with both DNA&#x02013;DNA and RNA&#x02013;DNA substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). This result indicates that the stimulation provided by the forked structure is additive to the stimulation provided by the top strand being made of RNA. The combined stimulatory effect of the forked structure and the RNA strand on Pif1p activity has an important consequence for Pif1p helicase activity as Pif1p was able to unwind the forked 20-mer RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrid in a single turnover reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Interestingly, the calculated rate of unwinding for the single turnover reaction was &#x0223c;3 times lower that the calculated rate for multiple cycle conditions (5.2 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> versus 18.3 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), which indicates that the rate-limiting step is likely to be different in the two reaction conditions. Pif1p is a poorly processive helicase <italic>in vitro</italic>. An intriguing possibility is that enzyme stalling and/or dissociation from substrates accounts for the low rate of unwinding in single cycle conditions. In multiple cycle conditions, alignment of multiple Pif1p monomers &#x02018;pushing&#x02019; each other forward along the substrate could have a stimulatory effect on the overall kinetic rate of the reaction. Increased activity when multiple helicases are bound to a substrate has been shown with the Dda helicase, another monomeric helicase, in a different experimental setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). A detailed study of Pif1p kinetic mechanism is necessary to resolve this question.</p><p>Since Pif1p does not bind RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), an interesting possibility is that during the unwinding of DNA&#x02013;DNA substrates, Pif1p interacts with both strands of the duplex. If the interaction with the upper DNA strand counteracts the unwinding reaction, whether it is achieved by translocation of the enzyme or another mechanism that remains to be identified, this interaction could result in lower unwinding rates for DNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids. This scenario could arise if the active form of Pif1p is a dimer with each monomer attached to a different DNA strand. However, we did not detect self-association of the protein <italic>in vitro</italic> even when the enzyme was incubated at 50 times the concentration that was used in helicase assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>), suggesting that nuclear Pif1p is active as a monomer. If Pif1p is active as a monomer and dissociates from the bottom strand, it could potentially re-associate with either the lower or the partially unwound upper strand if it is made of DNA, which would also slow down unwinding of the DNA&#x02013;DNA substrate.</p><p>Taken together, our results indicate that Pif1p is sensitive to both the structure of the duplex region of the substrate, preferring forked to linear duplexes, and to the chemical nature of the top strand, preferring to displace a RNA strand. How do these data inform our understanding of Pif1p function <italic>in vivo</italic>? The best studied function of Pif1p is its inhibition of telomerase lengthening of existing telomeres and telomere addition to double-strand breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12">10&#x02013;12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). The preference of Pif1p for unwinding forked RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids <italic>in vitro</italic> supports the hypothesis that Pif1p inhibits telomerase by unwinding the RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrid formed between telomerase RNA and the telomeric DNA end. Indeed, the TLC1-RNA annealed to the telomeric single-stranded DNA resembles a forked RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>a) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). <fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Hypothetical RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrid substrates for Pif1p.

An alternative hypothesis has been proposed for the role of Pif1p in Okazaki fragment processing that does not involve RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrid unwinding, in which Pif1p extends the DNA flap in front of the lagging strand polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkm613f8"/></fig></p><p>In addition to its telomeric functions, nuclear Pif1p helps maintain the RFB in the rDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).

Nuclear Pif1p also acts in cooperation with the helicase/endonuclease Dna2p. Dna2p is a helicase/nuclease that is required for Okazaki fragment maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>).

It has been proposed that Pif1p helps extend the DNA flap generated during Okazaki fragment maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), a proposal consistent with Pif1p's preference for forked substrates. Pif1p is also required in cells lacking topoisomerase III activity, and this requirement is dependent upon an active Sgs1p helicase and homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Again, this role can be explained by Pif1p acting on the non-linear DNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids that arise during recombinational repair. Finally, Pif1p is also important for maintenance of mitochondrial DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), especially in the presence of oxidative damage or the intercalating agent ethidium-bromide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32 B33 B34">32&#x02013;34</xref>). The increased mitochondrial DNA breakage detected in ethidium bromide treated <italic>pif1</italic> cells occurs at discrete sites, suggesting that Pif1p action is required only at specific loci in the mitochondrial genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>).</p><p>Pif1p might carry out its role at non-telomeric sites by unwinding forked DNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids. However, it is tempting to speculate from its <italic>in vitro</italic> substrate preferences that <italic>in vivo</italic> Pif1p acts primarily or even exclusively on RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids. One interesting possibility is that Pif1p participates in the removal of the RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids that form during transcription and which, if not removed, lead to the formation of R-loops, which can trigger replication arrest, fork breakage and recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Because replicative helicases from various organisms are able to unwind RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), in most situations, replicative helicases are likely able to remove most RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids that are present in front of the replication fork. Nonetheless, it is possible that particular sequences in the genome are prone to the formation of stable RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids that require a dedicated helicase like Pif1p for efficient processing. This model would reconcile the observation that Pif1p acts at discrete loci of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>) with its preference for RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids (this study). The fact that the enzyme is involved in maintenance of mitochondrial and rDNA, two loci that contain highly transcribed genes, is compatible with this hypothesis. Given the evolutionary conservation of the PIF1 family helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), it will be interesting to determine if other members of the family also act preferentially on RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids, as a first step to identify their <italic>in vivo</italic> substrates.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank P.
