Previously, an essential regulatory element PS4A was identified in the promoter region, and shown to bind at least three factors. To identify the transcription factor(s), we used a yeast one-hybrid screen and obtained a novel <italic>Sox6</italic> cDNA (SOX6D). When introduced into cells it strongly repressed activity from both an <italic>Fgf-3</italic> reporter gene as well as an artificial promoter containing three PS4A elements. <italic>In situ</italic> hybridisation analysis showed that <italic>Sox6</italic> and <italic>Fgf-3</italic> are co-expressed in the otic vesicle of E9.5 mouse embryos in a mutually exclusive pattern, consistent with a repression of <italic>Fgf-3</italic> transcription by SOX6. To characterise additional factor(s) involved in <italic>Fgf-3</italic> gene repression, a yeast two-hybrid screen was used with the N-terminal portion of SOX6D. Mouse <italic>CtBP2</italic> cDNA clones were isolated and shown to bind SOX6 in yeast and mammalian cells. Furthermore, mutational analysis of SOX6 showed that binding to CtBP2, and its responsiveness to this co-repressor, were dependent on a short amino acid sequence motif PLNLSS. Co-expression studies in NIH3T3 cells showed that SOX6 and CtBP2 co-operate to repress activity from the <italic>Fgf-3</italic> promoter through the enhancer element PS4A. These results show that SOX6 can recruit CtBP2 to repress transcription from the <italic>Fgf-3</italic> promoter.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Fibroblast growth factors (Fgfs) comprise a large family of related proteins that display a broad spectrum of biological activities <italic>in vitro</italic>. <italic>In vivo</italic>, several Fgfs have been implicated as intercellular signalling molecules in embryogenesis, homeostasis and tissue repair (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c5">5</xref>). <italic>Fgf-3</italic> is expressed at several locations in the mouse embryo suggesting multiple roles during development.

Using F9 cells as a model, we previously identified an essential complex regulatory element (PS4A) within the 5&#x02032; proximal region of the <italic>Fgf-3</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c15">15</xref>). At least three factors bind co-operatively to PS4A. One factor identified as GATA-4 mediates induction of transcription by retinoic acid and Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP. However, other proteins necessary for co-operative binding with GATA-4 have yet to be identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c16">16</xref>).</p><p> SOX proteins constitute a family of more than 25 transcription factors related by homology within their HMG-box DNA-binding domain to the mammalian testis determining factor SRY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c18">18</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c21">21</xref>). SOX proteins may bind directly to their target promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c26">26</xref>), or affect transcription indirectly by interacting with other components of the transcription machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c29">29</xref>). The SOX family of transcription factors are expressed in adult tissues as well as embryonic locations where they are often implicated in cell fate decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c20">20</xref>). For example, SOX1, 2, 3, 11 and SOXD have been implicated in neural development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c32">32</xref>), and SOX1, 2, 3 and 9 in lens development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c33">33</xref>). Recently, an unexpected interaction between SOX proteins and &#x003b2;-catenin has suggested that they may also modulate Wnt signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c34">34</xref>).</p><p> In addition to the inherent activating or repressing activities of transcription factors, promoter activity may also be modulated by the association of co-activators or co-repressors (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c35">35</xref>). A recently defined class of co-repressor identified by their interactions with the adenovirus E1A protein are the CtBP proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c36">36</xref>). A <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologue of human CtBP1 (dCtBP) was shown to interact with the transcriptional repressors Hairy, Knirps and Snail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c38">38</xref>). In addition, CtBP homologues were shown to associate and act as co-repressors with basic Kr&#x000fc;ppel-like factor, a zinc finger-homeodomain protein &#x003b4;EF1, and the vertebrate homologues of Polycomb proteins XPc and HPC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c41">41</xref>).</p><p> In this study we show that PS4A contains a SOX binding site. Using a yeast one-hybrid screen a splice variant of <italic>Sox6</italic> (SOX6D) was isolated and shown by transfection experiments to act as a repressor of <italic>Fgf-3</italic> transcription. Whole mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation analysis on early embryos identified the otic vesicle as a potential site of Fgf-3&#x0002f;SOX6 interaction <italic>in vivo</italic>. In a subsequent yeast two-hybrid screen using part of the SOX6 protein, we isolated mouse CtBP2 as a co-repressor that interacts with SOX6. Point mutation analysis showed that SOX6 interacts with CtBP2 through the sequence motif PLNLSS. Moreover, reporter assays confirmed that transcription of <italic>Fgf-3</italic> is negatively regulated through an interaction of SOX6 with CtBP2.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)</title><p>Experimental procedures and conditions were as previously described except that the non-specific competitor was poly(dG-dC):poly(dC-dG) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c16">16</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> transcribed and translated SOX6 proteins were synthesised from pCI-neo&#x0002f;Sox6 DNA (described below) using TnT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega).

Sequencing revealed an insert encoding <italic>Sox6</italic> cDNA.</p><p> A schematic representation of the previously described SOX6 isoforms and the variant that we have designated SOX6D is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke470f1">1</xref>A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c44">44</xref>). SOX6D most closely resembles SOX6C, but has 20 amino acids missing (S3) between the second potential coiled-coil domain and the HMG-box (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke470f1">1</xref>B). RT&#x02013;PCR was used to establish the presence of <italic>Sox6D</italic> mRNA in F9 cells. Primers flanking the&#x000a0;variable S2 region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke470f1">1</xref>A) produced two products corresponding to the size predicted for <italic>Sox6A</italic> (578 bp) and <italic>Sox6B&#x0002f;C&#x0002f;D</italic> (455 bp), respectively. Similarly, primers flanking the variable S3 region produced two products, a signature band of 159 bp for <italic>Sox6D</italic> and another of 219 bp indicative of <italic>Sox6A&#x0002f;B&#x0002f;C</italic> (data not shown). Hence, signature fragments for <italic>Sox6D</italic> and <italic>Sox6A</italic> were detected, confirming their expression in F9 cells. However, at present there is no evidence to suggest specific functional differences amongst the SOX6 isoforms.</p></sec><sec><title>Binding of SOX6 proteins to the central element of PS4A</title><p>To confirm SOX6 binding to PS4A, we initially used <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed and translated SOX6 protein in an EMSA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke470f2">2</xref>A). Several complexes with different mobilities were found associated with a PS4A probe (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke470f2">2</xref>A, lane 1). The complexes were absent (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke470f2">2</xref>A, lane 2) when a mutated probe (4AyM4) was used. This mutated probe has two base substitutions and was previously shown to abolish factor binding to PS4A, as well as to cause a complete loss of <italic>Fgf-3</italic> promoter activity in cell transfection assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c16">16</xref>). Inclusion of SOX6 antiserum in the EMSA shifted the SOX6 specific bands to the top of the gel confirming its presence in the complexes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke470f2">2</xref>A, lane 3). These results demonstrate the binding of SOX6 protein to the central element of PS4A. A non-specific band (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke470f2">2</xref>, asterisk) in the EMSA was identified by its appearance with rabbit reticulocyte lysate alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke470f2">2</xref>B, lane 2).</p><p> Full-length recombinant SOX6 protein binds PS4A poorly in an EMSA, unless accompanied by rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke470f2">2</xref>), indicating that efficient SOX6 binding is co-operative and requires other factors. This finding is consistent with our previous point mutation analysis showing co-operative binding to PS4A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c16">16</xref>). Moreover, others have shown that the coiled-coil domains of full-length SOX6 permit the formation of homo- or heterodimers with other SOX proteins. These bind to pairs of HMG-box motifs, and can interfere with SOX protein binding to a single HMG-box motif, as found in PS4A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c42">42</xref>). In confirmation of previous observations, recombinant full-length SOX6 was found to bind strongly to a HMG-box dimer motif (data not shown). Specificity of SOX6 binding was further demonstrated by using a truncated recombinant SOX6 protein (GST-SOX6DB) that lacks the coiled-coil domain implicated in dimer formation. Purified GST-SOX6DB was used in EMSA with a series of oligonucleotide probes, each containing a single base substitution across the central region of PS4A (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke470f2">2</xref>C). Mutations 4AM15, 4AyM6, 4AyM7 and 4AM16 severely diminished binding while 4AM14 and 4AyM5 significantly reduced it, from which (CT)ATTGT could be deduced as the core recognition sequence for SOX6 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke470f2">2</xref>D). This is similar to the previously determined recognition sequence for the central site in PS4A. The complementary strand of the identified core binding sequence is close to the consensus sequence (A&#x0002f;T)(A&#x0002f;T)CAA(A&#x0002f;T)G reported for several other SOX proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c20">20</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Repression of the <italic>Fgf-3</italic> promoter activity by SOX6</title><p>To determine whether SOX6 expression could affect transcription from the <italic>Fgf-3</italic> promoter, differentiated F9 cells were co-transfected with one of two luciferase reporter plasmids (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke470f3">3</xref>A), together in the presence or absence of a SOX6 expression plasmid (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke470f3">3</xref>B). The reporter constructs contained either three copies of the PS4A enhancer fused to a minimal <italic>tk</italic> promoter &#x0005b;p(4Ax3)tkLuc&#x0005d;, or a 1.7 kb fragment encompassing the <italic>Fgf-3</italic> proximal promoter region (pFgf-3&#x0002f;Luc) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c14">14</xref>). Co-transfection of a SOX6 expression plasmid had little effect on transcription from the control vector ptkLuc. However, transcription from the reporters p(4Ax3)tkLuc and pFgf-3&#x0002f;Luc was substantially reduced when co-expressed with SOX6, showing that SOX6 is able to repress transcription from an <italic>Fgf-3</italic> promoter. Similar results were also obtained in co-transfection experiments using undifferentiated F9, NIH3T3 and Cos7 cells, although the effect was less marked since these cell lines only express weakly from the <italic>Fgf-3</italic> reporter (data not shown). Although SOX6 is known to be an enhancer of transcription, these observations suggest that it can also function in gene repression, perhaps by recruiting a co-repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c35">35</xref>). As the SOX binding site in PS4A is essential for <italic>Fgf-3</italic> promoter activity, it is not possible using base mutations of the site to demonstrate a relief of the repression by SOX6.</p><p> Analysis of F9 cells using degenerate RT&#x02013;PCR showed the presence of <italic>Sox6</italic>, but also several other Sox transcripts (<italic>Sox2</italic>, <italic>Sox7</italic>, <italic>Sox13</italic>, <italic>Sox17</italic>) consistent with the pluripotential nature of F9 cells, and the role of SOX proteins in lineage determination (data not shown). Therefore, to provide evidence for a potential interaction between these proteins <italic>in vivo</italic>, we examined sites of <italic>Fgf-3</italic> and <italic>Sox6</italic> expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Co-expression of <italic>Sox-6</italic> and <italic>Fgf-3</italic> in the embryonic inner ear</title><p>Previous studies have reported that <italic>Fgf-3</italic> and <italic>Sox6</italic> are both expressed in the otic vesicle during early ear development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c46">46</xref>). Using embryos from embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5), we confirmed the otic vesicle as a site of expression for both these genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke470f4">4</xref>). To determine which cells were expressing <italic>Fgf-3</italic> and <italic>Sox6</italic> RNA, the stained embryos were sectioned for histological examination. <italic>Fgf-3</italic> RNA was found to be localised to the presumptive sensory epithelia, which forms the inner ear, as well as to the delaminating neuronal precursors that migrate to form the cochleovestibular ganglion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke470f4">4</xref>A and B). The otic vesicle at E9.5 was the only site of discernible <italic>Sox6</italic> expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke470f4">4</xref>D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c46">46</xref>). In contrast to the sites of <italic>Fgf-3</italic> expression, <italic>Sox6</italic> was associated with the inner epithelial layer of the otic vesicle. Hence, <italic>Sox6</italic> and <italic>Fgf-3</italic> were expressed in a mutually exclusive pattern, consistent with the idea that SOX6 could act to repress <italic>Fgf-3</italic> transcription within a sub-region of the otic vesicle epithelium.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of CtBP2 as a SOX6-binding protein</title><p>Previously, SOX6 was shown to act as an activator, rather than a repressor of transcription, suggesting that its regulatory activity may be dependent on its interaction with either a co-activator or co-repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c28">28</xref>). Therefore, we used a yeast two-hybrid screen to search for co-repressor proteins that could bind SOX6. As bait, a polypeptide of 523 amino acids from the N-terminal part of SOX6D was fused to a GAL4 DNA binding domain that served to replace the HMG-box DNA binding region. This vector was used to screen the same differentiated F9 cDNA-GAL library described above. Two positive clones were obtained after screening 4.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> transformants. Both clones were found to encode mouse CtBP2, a recently described co-repressor protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c39">39</xref>). The two clones were slightly shorter than the published sequence, and were extended using 5&#x02032; RACE to obtain a full-length coding sequence.</p><p> The amino acid sequence PLDLSL has been identified in some transcription factors to be a consensus motif for binding CtBP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c41">41</xref>). A similar sequence, PLNLSS, is present in SOX6D (amino acids 383&#x02013;388). Therefore, mutations were introduced into this motif to assess their effect on SOX6 binding to CtBP2 in a yeast two-hybrid system (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke470f5">5</xref>). Deletion of the complete motif PLNLSS abolished the interaction. This was shown by the lack of growth on His<sup>&#x02013;</sup> plates and the absence of &#x003b2;-galactosidase induction. Substitution of proline by alanine (P383A) had little effect, whereas substitution of the leucine by histidine (L386H) abolished the interaction. These results indicate that the PLNLSS sequence in SOX6 is required for interaction with CtBP2 in yeast cells.</p><p> To confirm that the binding between SOX6 and CtBP2 also occurs in mammalian cells, these proteins were co-expressed in Cos7 cells. Protein extracts derived from these cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke470f6">6</xref>). &#x000a0;&#x000a0;FLAG-tagged CtBP2 proteins were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG serum and then the His-tagged SOX6 was revealed by immunoblotting with an anti-HIS serum (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke470f6">6</xref>A, lane 1). Reciprocally, SOX6 proteins were immunoprecipitated with an anti-HIS serum and CtBP2 revealed by immunoblotting with the anti-FLAG serum (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke470f6">6</xref>B, lane 1). These experiments demonstrate that SOX6 and CtBP2 can form a complex in Cos7 cells. As anticipated, neither the SOX6 PLNLSS-deletion mutant nor SOX6 with the L386H substitution formed significant complexes with CtBP2 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke470f6">6</xref>A and B, lanes 2 and 4, respectively). Moreover, in this analysis the P383A mutant also failed to form a stable complex with CtBP2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke470f6">6</xref>A and B, lanes 3). These combined results demonstrate that in mammalian cells, the PLNLSS sequence is necessary for complex formation between SOX6 and CtBP2.</p></sec><sec><title>Repression by SOX6 by recruitment of CtBP2</title><p>As SOX6 is able to repress transcription from the native <italic>Fgf-3</italic> promoter or an artificial promoter containing three PS4A elements (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke470f3">3</xref>), we examined the effect of co-expressing CtBP2 on SOX6 activity. In differentiated F9 cells, the introduction of CtBP2 had little additional effect on <italic>Fgf-3</italic> promoter&#x000a0;activity above that of SOX6 alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke470f7">7</xref>A). However, subsequent northern blot analysis indicated that endogenous <italic>CtBP2</italic> is already expressed at very high levels compared with <italic>Sox6</italic> in these cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke470f7">7</xref>B). Hence, the normal level of CtBP2 is most likely in excess of that required for maximal repression by SOX6. Functional evidence for the interaction between SOX6 and CtPB2 in the repression of the <italic>Fgf-3</italic> promoter was evident from the behaviour of the Sox6del mutant lacking the PLNLSS motif in reporter assays (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke470f7">7</xref>C). The mutated SOX6 protein that was unable to bind CtBP2 was also unable to repress transcription. An EMSA using Sox6del showed that the loss of repression was not due to loss of binding activity for PS4A (data not shown).</p><p> The high endogenous level of CtBP2 in F9 cells makes them unsuitable to demonstrate a co-operative effect between co-expressed <italic>Sox6</italic> and <italic>CtBP2</italic>. Therefore we used NIH3T3 cells which were found to express very low levels of endogenous CtBP2. In this cell line the co-operative effect of co-expressing SOX6 and CtBP2 could be clearly demonstrated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke470f8">8</xref>). Thus the reporter assays using both dF9 and NIH3T3 cells clearly demonstrate that SOX6 must recruit CtBP2 to repress the activity of the <italic>Fgf-3</italic> promoter through the PS4A enhancer.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In a previous study we identified PS4A as an essential regulatory element proximally located in the <italic>Fgf-3</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c16">16</xref>). Here we show that SOX6 can bind to the central region of this essential regulatory element at the sequence motif ACAAT, a site that is similar to the published consensus for other SOX protein binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c20">20</xref>). Binding of SOX6 to the <italic>Fgf-3</italic> promoter, or a minimal artificial promoter containing three PS4A regulatory elements, results in a strong repression of transcription. Using a yeast one-hybrid screen, SOX6 was identified as an expressed protein in F9 cells. However, subsequent screening of F9 cells using RT&#x02013;PCR revealed several other SOX proteins which should also bind to the SOX consensus site. Therefore, to obtain evidence that SOX6 might act as a repressor of <italic>Fgf-3</italic> transcription <italic>in vivo</italic>, we used <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation analysis on early mouse embryos to look for their sites of expression. The otic vesicle was the one site of <italic>Sox6</italic> expression found in E9.5 embryos, and this was also a site for <italic>Fgf-3</italic> expression. The expression pattern of <italic>Sox6</italic> and <italic>Fgf-3</italic> is complementary and mutually exclusive, consistent with SOX6 acting as a repressor of the <italic>Fgf-3</italic> promoter. Interestingly SOX13, another group D SOX protein, is also expressed in the inner ear of mouse embryos at E13.5 but was not detected at E9.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c47">47</xref>; A.Murakami, unpublished results). The SOX13 sequence also encodes potential CtBP2 binding sites and will repress the <italic>Fgf-3</italic> promoter if over-expressed in F9 cells (A.Murakami, unpublished results). Hence it is possible that SOX13 may play a role in regulating Fgf-3 expression, but at a later stage of development. If <italic>Sox6</italic> null mice become available then this proposal might be readily tested. In this context, mice deficient for <italic>Fgf-3</italic> have been found to have an inner ear abnormality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c10">10</xref>), suggesting that likewise, a similar abnormality might occur in mice deficient for <italic>Sox6</italic>.</p><p> The collagen type II promoter (<italic>Col2a1</italic>) which is expressed in chondrocytes, is a recently identified target gene for SOX6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c28">28</xref>). But in this context, SOX6 functions as an activator of transcription rather than a repressor. It was shown to co-operate with SOX5 and SOX9 in the activation of <italic>Col2a1</italic> through binding at four HMG-like sites in the minimal enhancer region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c28">28</xref>). Based on the sequence of the HMG-box DNA-binding domain, SOX genes have been divided into several groups. For example SOX5, SOX6 and SOX13 belong to group D while SOX9 belongs to group E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c19">19</xref>). Hetero- and homodimerizaton between group D SOX proteins appears to be mediated by the coiled-coil domain located at their N-termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c28">28</xref>). In contrast to <italic>Col2a1</italic> that can accommodate SOX dimers, the <italic>Fgf-3</italic> promoter contains only a single consensus HMG site corresponding to the central PS4A element. From this, and an earlier study, this site shows co-operative protein binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c16">16</xref>). This must therefore involve SOX6 and a non-SOX protein.</p><p> Although the SOX protein family has been principally associated with the activation of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c26">26</xref>), there are now examples of their being involved in the repression of transcription. For instance, Oct-4 mediated activation of the <italic>OPN</italic> gene can be repressed by SOX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c48">48</xref>). In contrast to OPN promoter, the &#x003b4;<italic>1-crystallin</italic> promoter is activated by SOX2 as well as SOX1, and repressed by SOX14 and SOX21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c49">49</xref>). Thus, depending on the promoter context, SOX2, like SOX6, can act as both a repressor and activator of transcription.</p><p> To explain the repression of <italic>Fgf-3</italic> transcription by SOX6, we sought other proteins that could interact with this transcription factor, and identified mouse CtBP2. Binding was shown to require the amino acid motif PLNLSS which is similar to CtBP2 binding regions identified in other transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c41">41</xref>). Furthermore, co-expression studies showed that CtBP2 co-operates with SOX6 to repress transcription of <italic>Fgf-3</italic>, and this repression was dependent upon the integrity of the PLNLSS motif in SOX6. CtBP was first identified as a cellular protein (human CtBP) that bound the C-terminal region of the adenovirus E1A protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c36">36</xref>) and attenuated its ability to activate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c50">50</xref>). More recently, two mouse homologues, CtBP1 and CtBP2, were found to associate with, and repress transcriptional activation through the basic Kr&#x000fc;ppel-like factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c39">39</xref>). Both CtBP1 and CtBP2 enhance transcriptional repression by &#x003b4;EF1 and are widely expressed in developing embryos with different tissue preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke470c41">41</xref>).</p><p> Thus, depending on the context, SOX6 can act as an activator and repressor of transcription. This suggests a general mechanism where SOX family members recruit either co-activators or co-repressors to modulate transcription. Furthermore, a given promoter, such as &#x003b4;<italic>1-crystallin</italic> may be transcriptionally activated by one set of SOX proteins and yet repressed by other members of the same protein family. We have evidence that a similar situation pertains to the <italic>Fgf-3</italic> promoter. Preliminary data suggests that in F9 cells, SOX7 mediates activation of Fgf-3 transcription (A.Murakami, unpublished results), while from this study, in the otic vesicle SOX6 is a good candidate for its repression.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gke470f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Sequence comparison of SOX6 proteins.
