One clone in particular is 4.1 Kb long and originates from the larger (4.3 Kb) message. Sequence analysis of this clone has revealed that the N-ras gene consists of seven exons. A second clone deriving from the smaller (2 Kb) message shows that the difference between the two transcripts is a simple extension through the termination site of the 2 Kb transcript. Using S1 analysis, two transcriptional starts have been mapped, 10 bp apart. There is no obvious TATA box in the expected promoter region of the gene, though there are 4 GGGCGG sequences surrounding the start sites. The 5' untranslated sequence contains 2 ATGs upstream of the initiation codon.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0254-a" xlink:role="5260"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0257-a" xlink:role="5263"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0249.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5255"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0250.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5256"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0251.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5257"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0252.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5258"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0253.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5259"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0254.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5260"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0255.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5261"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0256.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5262"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0257.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5263"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0258.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5264"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0259.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5265"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0260.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5266"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0261.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5267"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0262.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5268"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
