Previously, we have studied the molecular properties of &#x003b2;igh3 in vitro and reported that &#x003b2;igh3 polymerizes to form a fibrillar structure and interacts with several extracellular matrix proteins including type I collagen. This study aimed to understand the role of elevated circulating levels of normal &#x003b2;igh3 in eye development and corneal diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We generated Alb-h&#x000df;igh3 transgenic mice that have liver-specific expression of human &#x003b2;igh3 (h&#x000df;igh3) under the control of the albumin (Alb) enhancer/promoter and investigated the influence of &#x003b2;igh3 overexpression in mouse eye. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genotyping, western blotting, and ELISA were performed to generate Alb-h&#x000df;igh3 transgenic mouse lines. To identify the ocular pathology, electron microscopy and histological staining were employed in Alb-h&#x000df;igh3 transgenic mice and wild-type mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Normal h&#x000df;igh3 was ectopically overexpressed in the liver, secreted into blood stream, and reached the cornea of Alb-h&#x000df;igh3 transgenic mice. Among transgenic mice, some mice had anterior segment defects including corneal opacity, disorganization of the collagen layers in the corneal stroma, and corneolenticular adhesion.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These results suggest that &#x003b2;igh3 may be involved in anterior segment morphogenesis and eye development in mice. In addition, this indicates that the level of normal &#x003b2;igh3 expression must be properly maintained during ocular development. The phenotype observed in Alb-h&#x000df;igh3 transgenic mice is similar to human eye disorders such as anterior segment dysgenesis and Peters' anomaly. Thus, this model provides a very useful tool to study human eye diseases and the control of proliferation and differentiation of neural crest-originated cells.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>GalleyStatus</meta-name><meta-value>Export to XML</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>&#x003b2;igh3 (keratoepithelin), also known as TGF&#x003b2;1, is a transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;)-induced extracellular matrix (ECM) protein that was first identified in human adenocarcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. &#x003b2;igh3 is strongly induced by TGF-&#x003b2; in several cell lines including human epithelial cells, keratinocytes, and fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>]. &#x003b2;igh3 is ubiquitously expressed in many normal human tissues such as the heart, liver, pancreas, and skin, suggesting that it may have an important function throughout the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. It has been reported that &#x003b2;igh3 is not only expressed in the cornea of the normal human eye but also in healing corneal wounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. During mouse development, expression of &#x003b2;igh3 in the cornea begins around embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5) and is sustained until E18.5 with localization in the corneal epithelium and stroma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>].</p><p>Mutations of &#x003b2;igh3 are responsible for 5q31-linked human autosomal dominant corneal dystrophies such as granular corneal dystrophy (GCD), Reis-B&#x000fc;ckler corneal dystrophy (RBCD), lattice corneal dystrophy (LCD) type I and IIIA, and Avellino corneal dystrophy (ACD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. These diseases are most often characterized by progressive accumulation of deposits in the cornea, resulting in a loss of transparency and severe visual impairment. Although mutations of &#x003b2;igh3 are well described in corneal dystrophy, the function of normal &#x003b2;igh3 in the eye is not well known. We recently reported that normal &#x003b2;igh3 mediates human corneal epithelial cell adhesion through &#x003b1;3&#x003b2;1 integrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>] and that &#x003b2;igh3 and its mutants polymerize to form a fibrillar structure and interact with type I collagen, laminin, and fibronectin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>].</p><p>TGF-&#x003b2; is a multifunctional cytokine that regulates cell growth and differentiation as TGF-&#x003b2; inhibits epithelial cell proliferation and stimulates the proliferation of smooth muscle cells and skin fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. TGF-&#x003b2; and its receptors are localized in the human anterior segment of the eye, including the cornea, and may regulate various pathophysiological responses in the anterior segment by controlling cell proliferation, differentiation, and ECM composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. Moreover, TGF-&#x003b2; highly induces &#x003b2;igh3, which associates with ECM molecules. Based on the expression of TGF-&#x003b2; and &#x003b2;igh3 in the eye and their correlation, &#x003b2;igh3 as well as TGF-&#x003b2; may be key molecules in the pathogenesis of ocular disorders or in the eye development.</p><p>In this study, to characterize the role of &#x003b2;igh3 responses in ocular development, we generated transgenic mice that have liver-specific expression of normal &#x003b2;igh3 under the control of the albumin (Alb) enhancer/promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>] and we investigated in the eyes of these mice the influence of overexpressed normal &#x003b2;igh3 secreted from the liver. The data from this study showed that the elevated levels of normal &#x003b2;igh3 caused corneal opacity and anterior segment dysgenesis. Therefore, these results had particular relevance for human fetal conditions characterized by ocular abnormalities such as anterior segment mesenchymal dysgenesis. The results established an experimental model in which overexpression of normal &#x003b2;igh3 resulted in the gross ocular pathophysiological characteristics of these conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>All procedures concerning animal experiments in the present study were conducted according to the guidelines of Kyungpook National University.

After insertion of h&#x000df;igh3, a 2.3 kb fragment of the albumin (Alb) enhancer/promoter (kindly provided by Dr. R. Palmiter, Seattle, WA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>], which is essential for expression in the liver, was cloned into the <italic>Not</italic>I/<italic>Sal</italic>I site at the 5&#x02032;-end of h&#x000df;igh3-IRES-LacZ-mp1 intron/polyA. The entire construct was cut with <italic>Not</italic>I and <italic>Nru</italic>I and the 8.8 kb transgene named Alb-h&#x000df;igh3 was purified. Purified Alb-&#x003b2;igh3 transgene was injected into the pronucleus of fertilized eggs of C57BL/6 embryos by Macrogen Inc. (Seoul, Korea). Two hundred animals were screened and seven founders were identified that exhibited integration of the Alb-h&#x000df;igh3 transgene by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genotyping. Transgenic founders were backcrossed to C57BL/6 or intercrossed. The transgenic mice and their wild-type control littermates were maintained under standard temperature and lighting.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of transgenic mice by genotype analysis</title><p>The transgene in Alb-h&#x000df;igh3 founders and offspring was identified by PCR analysis of genomic DNA obtained from tail biopsies. PCR was performed in 30&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l reaction mixtures, each containing 100 ng genomic DNA, 0.2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M each primer set, 1&#x000a0;mM dNTP mixture, 3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of 10X Taq buffer, and 1 unit of Taq polymerase.

Amplification was performed for 35 cycles in the following PCR conditions: one min at 95&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, one min at 48&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for h&#x000df;igh3 and at 58&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for LacZ, and one min at 72&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C using a GeneAmp PCR System 9600 (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). PCR products were then separated electrophoretically on 1% agarose gels and visualized after ethidium bromide staining.

Each sample was mixed with 2X sample buffer (100&#x000a0;mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 200&#x000a0;mM dithiothreitol, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromophenol blue, and 20% glycerol) and boiled for 10 min. Then, the samples were separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK). Blocking was performed with 5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h at room temperature (RT). The membrane was incubated for 2 h at RT with anti-human &#x003b2;igh3 antibody (diluted 1:1000 in PBS), and then reacted for 1 h at RT with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (diluted 1:3000 in PBS; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The blot was developed with Super Signal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Anti-&#x003b2;-actin antibody was used as a control on the same filter after deprobing.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry of human &#x003b2;igh3 in the liver and eye</title><p>To investigate transgenic expression, immunohistochemical staining of the mouse liver and eye was performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. Briefly, sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and blocked by incubation in 10% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> before blotting. The sections were then put in 1&#x000a0;mM Tris solution (pH 9.0) supplemented with 0.5&#x000a0;mM EGTA and heated in a microwave for 10 min to reveal the antigens. After blocking in PBS, supplemented with 1% BSA, 0.05% saponin, and 0.2% gelatin, sections were incubated overnight at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C with anti-human &#x003b2;ig-h3 antiserum in a humidified chamber. Sections were then washed three times and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) for 90 min at RT. The signal was visualized by incubating the sections with liquid diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) Chromogen (DAKO). Hematoxylin staining was used to counterstain sections.</p></sec><sec><title>Enzyme-linked immunoSorbent assay of human &#x003b2;ig-h3 in blood</title><p>The level of human &#x003b2;igh3 in mouse plasma was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Regen Biotech, Seoul, Korea). Blood was collected through the saphenous vein into potassium EDTA-coated Microvette tubes (Sarstedt, N&#x000fc;mbrecht, Germany). Recombinant human &#x003b2;igh3 proteins and the anti-human &#x003b2;igh3 antibody for ELISA were prepared as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. For ELISA, 96 well plastic flat microtiter plates (Corning, Lowell, MA) were coated overnight at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C with wild-type human &#x003b2;igh3 protein in 20&#x000a0;mM carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6) with 0.02% sodium azide. The coated plates were then washed with PBS with 0.05% Tween-20 (PBS-T). Mouse plasma samples were diluted in PBS-T and preincubated with anti-human &#x003b2;igh3 antibodies in 96 well plastic round microtiter plates for 90 min at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. The preincubated samples were then transferred to the precoated plates and incubated for 30 min at RT. Thereafter, the samples were incubated with the peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 90 min at RT, and the plates were washed as before. The assay was developed with a substrate solution of 0.1&#x000a0;mg/ml o-phenylenediamine and 0.003% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 60 min at RT in the dark. After stopping the reaction with 8 N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, the absorbance was read at 492 nm in a Bio-Rad model 550 microplate reader. The paired <italic>t</italic>-test was used to determine statistical significance with p&#x0003c;0.05 considered to denote statistical significance.

To capture cataracts, pupils were dilated with a drop of 1% Mydriacyl (Alcon Laboratories, Hemel Hempstead, UK) for 20&#x02013;30 min while the animals were under anesthesia.

The central portion of the cornea, including the opaque region, in Alb-h&#x000df;igh3 transgenic mice was removed, washed three times in 0.1 M PB, and post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M PB for 2 h at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. After rinsing with 0.1 M PB, the samples were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, immersed in propylene oxide, infiltrated with an Epon mixture, embedded in a Beem capsule, and polymerized for three days. Serial ultrathin sections were cut with an ultramicrotome, collected on Formvar film-coated single slot nickel grids, and counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate.

The full-length h&#x000df;igh3 was inserted into the plasmid with Alb enhancer/promoter, followed by IRES-LacZ-mp1 intron/polyA to detect &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity in the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). This <italic>Not</italic>I/<italic>Nru</italic>I transgene fragment was injected into fertilized eggs of C57BL/6 and then 200 animals from injected eggs were screened to select transgenic founders. Seven founder mice were identified and three of these lines showed high expression of the transgene. To maintain the lines, they were crossed with C57BL/6 and the offspring were identified by PCR genotyping of h&#x000df;igh3 and LacZ gene 10 days after birth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>). PCR results showed 202 bp and 500 bp PCR products for h&#x000df;igh3 and LacZ, respectively. To investigate ectopic expression of the h&#x000df;igh3 transgene, western blotting and immunohistochemistry were performed in the liver and eye of two-month-old mice using anti-human &#x003b2;igh3 antibody. High expression of h&#x000df;igh3 was detected by western blot analysis in the liver and in eye extracts of transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>). Transgenic mice also showed strong expression of the h&#x000df;igh3 transgene in liver hepatocytes and in corneal epithelium by immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B-D</xref> show representative data for h&#x000df;igh3 transgene expression in 28 transgenic mice.

A high level of h&#x000df;igh3 expression was also observed by western blot analysis in the plasma of transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1E</xref>). As the human &#x003b2;igh3 antibody partially cross-reacted with both mouse and human &#x003b2;igh3, the amount in wild-type mice likely represented the level of endogenous mouse &#x003b2;igh3 in tissue and blood. Finally, we generated Alb-h&#x000df;igh3 transgenic mice that overexpress h&#x000df;igh3 under the control of the Alb enhancer/promoter.

Internal organs such as the liver and kidney were phenotypically normal (data not shown) and there was no specific phenotype, even in the liver where ectopic normal &#x003b2;igh3 was produced under control of the albumin promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>). This was performed through systematic sampling and measurements in all wild-type and transgenic mice. Even though the bodyweight and the size of eyes were no different between wild-type and transgenic mice, various phenotypes with diverse defect sizes were investigated in the defective eye of transgenic mice that had a corneal opacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). The gross ocular phenotypes of Alb-h&#x000df;igh3 transgenic mice showed corneal opacification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). The opacity sometimes accompanied a cataract, which was investigated in the eye of transgenic mice after pupil dilatation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>). These anomalies were never seen in normal eyes of wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>). Corneal opacity was observed bilaterally with cataracts in Alb-h&#x000df;igh3 transgenic mice with eye defects. Among eight Alb-h&#x000df;igh3 transgenic mice with corneal opacity, bilateral defects with cataracts were observed in five mice and unilateral defect was shown in the remaining three mice. Electron microscopy showed that the collagen fibers and fibrils were disorganized with an irregular arrangement in the corneal stroma of the defected eye in transgenic mice compared to the stroma in wild-type mice, which were compact and well organized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Immunohistochemical studies show that &#x003b2;igh3 is strongly stained in pathologic deposits in all mutant &#x003b2;igh3-related corneal dystrophies and that, above all, high levels of normal &#x003b2;igh3 are detected in scarring cornea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>] as if TGF-&#x003b2; is present on the edge of wound healing in the cornea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. These data suggest that &#x003b2;igh3 as well as TGF-&#x003b2; would be key molecules in the pathogenesis of corneal opacification. In this study, we investigated whether &#x003b2;igh3 is essential to ocular development in vivo and whether it is pathologically important to corneal disorganization.</p><p>First, to study the function of &#x003b2;igh3 in eye, it is necessary to discover suitable methods or animal models that express ectopic or mutant &#x003b2;igh3. Many researchers have tried direct injections or eye drops of plasmid DNA or infection with an adenovirus vector in the eye. However, the difficulty of gene transfer into the cornea or the eye without inflammation prevents the study of certain protein's roles in these tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. Therefore, diverse methods to overcome this difficulty have been studied and reported. Several mouse model systems have been developed to observe the function of TGF-&#x003b2;, which is an inducer of &#x003b2;igh3 and has a critical role in the development of normal cornea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. Even though overexpression of TGF-&#x003b2;1 driven by the lens-specific &#x003b1;A-crystallin promoter does not cause a corneal phenotype in the embryonic mouse eye, cataract formation is observed in adult mice with ocular defects including corneal opacity and structural changes in the iris and ciliary body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]. Transgenic overexpression of TGF-&#x003b2;1 by lens-specific chicken &#x003b2;B1-crystallin promoter also revealed severe disruption of corneal and anterior chamber development from mouse embryonic day 13.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>]. These results suggest not only the importance of precise quantitative control of TGF-&#x003b2; but also of good transgenic model systems to study the role of TGF-&#x003b2; in eye development. However, TGF-&#x003b2; overexpression regulated by these specific promoters may cause an artificial and excessive phenotype that is restricted to a specific time and tissue in lens development.</p><p>Sakamoto et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>] constructed an adenoviral vector expressing a soluble TGF-&#x003b2; receptor fused to the Fc portion of human IgG and injected this construct into the skeletal muscle of mice. The soluble TGF-&#x003b2; receptor produced in the muscle reached the cornea by means of normal blood circulation, sequestered local TGF-&#x003b2;, and acted in the cornea but not in the lens. Based on this idea, we generated transgenic mice that overexpressed human &#x003b2;igh3 (h&#x000df;igh3) in blood through the liver-specific albumin (Alb) enhancer/promoter. Albumin, which is a major secretory protein of the liver, is induced in fetal liver and its expression is maintained in the adult liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>]. Since serum albumin is synthesized particularly by hepatocytes, the albumin promoter/enhancer is activated during liver development. Previously, it had also been reported that the most abundant water-soluble protein in the human cornea, serum albumin, can diffuse from peripheral blood vessels around the cornea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>]. &#x003b2;igh3 is a secretory protein and h&#x000df;igh3 ectopically expressed in liver under the control of Alb promoter was able to secrete into blood. Eventually, this secreted protein reached the cornea via blood vessels surrounding the limbal area of the cornea where it affected the anterior segment. In this model system, we can exclude possible artificial outcomes in the lens caused by using &#x003b1;A- or &#x003b2;B1-crystallin lens-specific promoters and explain the role of &#x003b2;igh3, which causes corneal diseases in human.</p><p>An exogenous transgene in the transgenic mouse model should be clearly distinct from an endogenous gene. For this, many researchers use specific marker genes or the same gene from different species. By using the human &#x003b2;igh3 transgene, exogenous transgene is easily distinguished from endogenous mouse &#x003b2;igh3. Since the nucleotide sequence of human &#x003b2;igh3 has high identity with mouse &#x003b2;igh3 and the amino acid sequence also has more than 91% identity with mouse, there were no undesirable phenotypes caused by using a transgene from a different species.</p><p>Here, we demonstrated that the Alb-h&#x000df;igh3 transgenic mouse had a serious failure in anterior segment development including an irregularity of the corneal epithelium, disorganization in collagen layer of the corneal stroma, and discontinuity of corneal endothelium following corneal opacity. Thickened corneal abnormality due to endothelial disruption was observed in the cornea of Alb-h&#x000df;igh3 transgenic mice with corneal opacity. Moreover, the attachment of the iris or lens to the cornea in some transgenic mice indicated that overexpression of &#x003b2;igh3 resulted in incomplete central migration of neural crest cells during ocular development. Cataract formation was also examined in defective eyes of Alb-h&#x000df;igh3 transgenic mice. In a previous paper, we showed that &#x003b2;igh3 expression greatly increased in lens epithelial cells from patients with anterior polar cataracts and in human lens epithelial cells treated with TGF-&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>]. Thus, cataract formation in transgenic mice was due to overexpression of &#x003b2;igh3 in their affected eyes. The bilateral phenotype with cataract in Alb-h&#x000df;igh3 transgenic mice was very similar to the clinicopathologic findings of Peters' anomaly that is a kind of anterior mesenchymal dysgenesis in human developmental anomalies. Most cases of Peters' anomaly are bilateral with lens abnormality and variable severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>]. However, mild unilateral cases are often observed in patients who do not have cataract. Additionally, even though h&#x000df;igh3 was overexpressed in the entire mouse body through the blood stream, the effect was observed only in the eye. This result corresponds exactly with the observation that mutant &#x003b2;igh3 in humans causes only corneal dystrophy in the eye and no other deformities in other organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>].</p><p>The anterior segment of the vertebrate eye is structurally defined by the cornea, iris, ciliary body, and lens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>]. Various anterior segment mesenchymal dysgenesis have been reported in humans and animals. In particular, anterior segment disorders in humans include autosomal dominant iridogoniodysgenesis anomaly, family glaucoma with goniodysgenesis, congenital endothelial dystrophy, and aniridia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>]. Although coordinated interactions between different cell types in these disorders are considered essential for proper spatial positioning and differentiation, the requisite intercellular signals and the proper animal model to verify these signals have not been well defined. One human anterior segment disorder, Peters' anomaly, is characterized by congenital corneal opacity with defects in the cornea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>]. By histological examination, Peters' anomaly in humans shows dense corneal opacity, iridocorneal adhesions, and occasional lens abnormality with direct adhesion to the posterior corneal surface. In addition, human Peters' anomaly accounts for a thickened cornea due to endothelial layer disruption. The histological views of Alb-h&#x000df;igh3 transgenic mice with corneal opacity are comparable to phenotypes observed in human Peters' anomaly. Likewise, a mouse model of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) has been reported to exhibit similar defects to Peters' anomaly with malformations in Descemet's membrane and corneal endothelium as well as delayed or failed separation of the lens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>]. Accordingly, Alb-h&#x000df;igh3 transgenic mice will be a practical model to study these eye disorders.</p><p>Though we have not examined the signaling pathway that is altered by overexpression of &#x003b2;igh3, these results sufficiently explain that &#x003b2;igh3 is involved in anterior segment morphogenesis and must be properly expressed for normal anterior segment development. This suggests that &#x003b2;igh3 may play an important role in the corneolenticular adhesion and the normal development of the cornea during ocular morphogenesis. Therefore, &#x003b2;igh3 may play a role in the normal formation of the anterior segment. Taken together, this study shows that &#x003b2;igh3 expression must be critically maintained during ocular development to avoid severe deformity, especially in the cornea. The Alb-h&#x000df;igh3 transgenic mice described in this study also provide a useful animal model for the study of anterior segment dysgenesis and of the control of proliferation and differentiation of neural crest-originated cells.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Dr. R.
