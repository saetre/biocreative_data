Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and SELEX, using mitochondrial protein extracts from cells induced to overexpress mTERF, revealed novel, weaker mTERF-binding sites, clustered in several regions of mtDNA, notably in the major non-coding region (NCR). Such binding <italic>in vivo</italic> was supported by mtDNA immunoprecipitation. Two-dimensional neutral agarose gel electrophoresis (2DNAGE) and 5&#x02032; end mapping by ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR) identified the region of the canonical mTERF-binding site as a replication pause site. The strength of pausing was modulated by the expression level of mTERF. mTERF overexpression also affected replication pausing in other regions of the genome in which mTERF binding was found. These results indicate a role for TERF in mtDNA replication, in addition to its role in transcription. We suggest that mTERF could provide a system for coordinating the passage of replication and transcription complexes, analogous with replication pause-region binding proteins in other systems, whose main role is to safeguard the integrity of the genome whilst facilitating its efficient expression.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The mitochondrial genome of animals is organized in a highly compact manner, with virtually no non-coding information between or within its 37 genes. The circular genome is transcribed by a phage-type RNA polymerase into polycistronic transcripts which, in mammals, encompass the entire genome on both strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Production of these transcripts depends upon a set of closely spaced promoters located in the major non-coding region (NCR). The primary transcripts are then processed to mature mRNAs, rRNAs and tRNAs via a series of enzymatic steps requiring the tRNA-processing endonucleases RNase P and tRNAse Z, as well as other enzymes. The major coding strand (informationally the L-strand, but for the purposes of transcription conventionally referred to by the name of the template, H-strand) is transcribed from two distinct initiation sites at the heavy-strand promoter (HSP), P<sub>H1</sub> and P<sub>H2</sub>, separated by &#x0223c;100 bp. The P<sub>H2</sub>-derived precursor transcript covers virtually the entire genome and can give rise to all of the transcription products of the heavy-strand except tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>, whose coding sequence overlaps the P<sub>H2</sub> initiation site. The P<sub>H1</sub> initiation site gives rise to a truncated transcript encompassing just the rRNAs (plus two tRNAs) and thus defines a distinct mitochondrial rDNA transcription unit.</p><p>Termination at the 3&#x02032; end of the rDNA is brought about by a transcription termination factor, mTERF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5 B6">3&#x02013;6</xref>), which has also been proposed to interact with the RNA polymerase in initiation site selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Recent data suggest that this involves formation of a DNA loop in which RNA polymerase complexes are recycled around the rDNA segment of the genome after terminating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). mTERF binds sequence specifically with high affinity to a sequence element within the coding sequence of tRNA<sup>Leu(UUR)</sup>, located immediately downstream of the rDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Current evidence indicates that mTERF interacts with its asymmetric-binding site as a monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), although the tertiary structure of the protein and the structural basis of its interaction with DNA are unknown.</p><p>mTERF belongs to a recently identified superfamily of proteins whose functions are largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11">9&#x02013;11</xref>). Homologues in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and in sea urchins have variously been implicated in transcriptional termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14">12&#x02013;14</xref>), regulation of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) and even mitochondrial protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The sea urchin mTERF homologue mtDBP (D-loop-binding protein) has recently been shown to terminate transcription in a polar manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), analogous with the activity of mTERF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). However, mtDBP is also a contrahelicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), and has been proposed to play a role in regulating the expansion of the short D-loop of sea urchin mtDNA and thus the initiation of productive replication of the genome.</p><p>Transcription and replication of mtDNA have long been regarded as interlinked processes. The primer for initiation of DNA replication has been assumed to be a product of transcription by the mitochondrial RNA polymerase. However, there is no consensus concerning the mechanism by which 3&#x02032; ends are generated for extension by DNA polymerase, variously proposed to be RNA processing by endonuclease MRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) or protein-independent termination at one of the conserved sequence blocks of the NCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The exact site of replication initiation is also unclear, and may vary between cell-types. A prominent cluster of 5&#x02032; ends in H-strand DNA, designated as O<sub>H</sub>, is generally regarded as the major origin of (unidirectional) replication. However, there is no direct experimental evidence that it functions thus, and bidirectional initiation clearly occurs in some molecules at sites downstream of O<sub>H</sub>, both in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), especially when recovering from drug-induced mtDNA depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), and in solid tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). In a minority of molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) these initiation sites can encompass the entire genome (in birds) or almost the entire genome (in mammals).</p><p>Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was for over 25 years assumed to replicate by a unique, strand-asynchronous mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). However, more recent analysis of mtDNA replication intermediates (RIs) by two-dimensional neutral agarose gel electrophoresis (2DNAGE) failed to detect the extensively single-stranded products of such a replication mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19 B20 B21 B22">19&#x02013;22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24 B25 B26">24&#x02013;26</xref>) and instead revealed two classes of double-stranded RIs. One class consists of the predicted products of conventional strand-coupled replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>); the other contains extended RNA segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) encompassing the entire lagging strand (RITOLS, &#x02018;RNA incorporation throughout the lagging strand&#x02019;, 19). Maturation of the lagging strand to DNA appears to occur with different kinetics and distinct sites of initiation in different organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), and some RIs of the first class could be interpreted as molecules in which lagging-strand DNA synthesis has effectively caught up with the advancing fork, as a result of replication pausing. The mechanism by which the RNA lagging strand is created is unknown.</p><p>mtDNA replication also depends on the HMG-box protein TFAM, named for its essential role as a cofactor for efficient and specific transcriptional initiation. TFAM is required for mtDNA maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) and appears to have several distinct roles in mtDNA metabolism. It is a major structural protein of the mitochondrial chromosome, but also influences mtDNA replication in ways connected with transcription. Overexpression of TFAM leads to a drop in mitochondrial transcript levels and a pronounced shift toward conventional, strand-coupled RIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). This could represent either a general slowing or stuttering of fork advance, attributable to a decreased availability of RNA to form the lagging strand (i.e. in which lagging-strand maturation frequently catches up with fork advance) or else a programmed switch to standard DNA synthesis.</p><p>As a factor affecting the outcome of mitochondrial transcription, mTERF might be expected also to have some influence over mtDNA replication if, as suggested, replication is intimately connected with transcription. We therefore embarked on a series of experiments to document the effects on mtDNA replication of modulating the expression of mTERF in cultured human cells. To this end, we set out initially to characterize better the binding specificity of mTERF, especially given recent reports of possible additional binding sites for mTERF <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) using mitochondrial protein extracts from cells induced to overexpress mTERF revealed additional, though weaker mTERF-binding sites clustered in strategically important regions of the mitochondrial genome. 2DNAGE and lagging strand 5&#x02032; end mapping by ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR) identified the canonical mTERF-binding site as a replication pause site, with the frequency of pausing subject to the expression level of mTERF. Replication pausing in other regions of the genome, notably the NCR, was also affected by mTERF overexpression. These results indicate a role for mTERF in mtDNA replication, in addition to its role in transcription.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cells and cell culture</title><p>Human embryonic kidney-derived HEK293T cells, Flp-In&#x02122; T-Rex&#x02122;-293 cells (Invitrogen), 143B osteosarcoma, Jurkat and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Sigma) containing 4.5 g/l of <sc>d</sc>-glucose, 10% foetal calf serum (Sigma), 50 &#x003bc;g/ml uridine (Sigma) and 2 mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine (BioWhittaker/Cambrex) at 37&#x000b0;C in an incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in air.

In contrast to earlier studies using purified, bacterially expressed mTERF, this tests the effects of altered mTERF expression level on protein&#x02013;DNA interactions in the mitochondrial milieu, in which other mitochondrial proteins, including TFAM, are present and may influence binding.</p><p>Using EMSA with probes covering the previously identified, canonical mTERF-binding site in the tRNA<sup>Leu(UUR)</sup> gene, we confirmed that overexpression of natural mTERF, whether by transient or stable transfection (data not shown), or under tetracycline induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>c), leads to a large increase in sequence-specific binding activity. The protein complex formed from the Myc epitope-tagged protein migrated slightly slower than the complex formed by endogenous or overexpressed natural mTERF, and was supershifted by an anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>c), but not by other antibodies (e.g. anti-FLAG, Supplementary Figure 1b). The anti-Myc antibody did not supershift the complex formed by endogenous or overexpressed natural mTERF (Supplementary Figure 1b).</p><p>These properties next allowed us to test other regions of the mitochondrial genome for specific binding of mTERF to DNA, using EMSA. Using overlapping fragments of &#x0223c;150 bp, we scanned the major NCR and its flanking sequences, the minor NCR (O<sub>L</sub>), its surrounding tRNA gene cluster, the region extending from O<sub>L</sub> to the canonical mTERF-binding site in the tRNA<sup>Leu(UUR)</sup> gene, the ATPase 6 gene and its junction with the COIII gene and several other segments of the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, Supplementary Figures 2 and 3). We estimated relative binding affinities using competition EMSA against the tRNA<sup>Leu(UUR)</sup> gene fragment and vice versa. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> and Supplementary Figure 2, we identified a cluster of four moderately strong mTERF-binding sites within the ND1 coding sequence and the adjacent IQM tRNA gene cluster (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>e for summary). Competition EMSA indicated that the binding to fragment ND1.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>b) was between one and two orders of magnitude weaker than to the canonical binding site in tRNA<sup>Leu(UUR)</sup>. Binding to the ND1.1 fragment was tested further, using shorter, overlapping fragments (Supplementary Figure 2d). The results suggest that fragment ND1.1 contains two distinct binding sites. We also identified a binding site adjacent to O<sub>H</sub> (fragment OH1) at least two orders of magnitude weaker than the canonical binding site, based on competition EMSA data (data not shown), as well as four other binding sites in the D-loop portion of the NCR and one at O<sub>L</sub>, plus a possible site at the HSP (fragment OH5, see Supplementary Figure 2e). <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>EMSA and mIP analysis of alternate mTERF-binding sites in human mtDNA.

Supershifting with the anti-Myc monoclonal antibody was performed for the lanes indicated. Supershifted complexes are denoted by arrows. Although the supershifted complex is minor in some cases, the main complex is always efficiently removed by the antibody, confirming the presence of mTERF-MycHis. Other antibodies tested (e.g. anti-FLAG) gave no supershifting and did not inhibit the formation of these complexes.

Amplification of immunoprecipitates alongside corresponding input DNAs used the same primer pairs as were employed to generate the corresponding fragments for EMSA (see Supplementary Table 1), Samples were from Flp-In&#x02122; T-REx&#x02122;-293 cells induced for mTERF-MycHis expression, except for fragment Leu, where extracts from uninduced cells were also tested.

The regions of the genome which were probed are reproduced from part (a) of the two figures, plus the ND5-ND6 gene junction which was probed using a dsDNA oligonucleotide. Binding is denoted as strong (filled circles), moderate (grey circles), weak (open circles), questionable (dotted circle, fragment OH5, as discussed in the text and legend to Supplementary Figure 2) or absent (no circles). Our inference of binding is based on the fact that EMSA signals were enhanced by induction of expression of both mTERF and mTERF-MycHis, that the complexes migrated at slightly different positions consistent with the presence of the epitope tag in the latter case, and that the complexes formed by mTERF-MycHis were supershifted by the anti-Myc antibody. The assertion that binding is strong, moderate or weak is based either on actual competition experiments (OH1 and ND1.1), or simply on the strength of the EMSA signal. Where the above criteria were not fulfilled, binding was scored as negative. In summary, the ND1 coding region and following IQM tRNA cluster contain at least four weak binding sites for mTERF. The NCR contains three weak binding sites, as well as three additional sites which showed very weak or questionable mTERF binding, as shown. A weak binding site was also found in the vicinity of O<sub>L</sub>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkm676f2"/></fig></p><p>Alignment of the sequences of these binding sites suggested a consensus which was verified by SELEX (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).

Of 28 control clones analysed, subjected to the same number of amplification cycles but without antibody selection, none matched this consensus.

This produced a reciprocal effect on mtDNA replication pausing at the canonical mTERF-binding site. We first tested several different mTERF-directed siRNAs in transient transfection assays, using cells stably transfected with the mTERF-MycHis expression construct, enabling us to evaluate knockdown at the protein level by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>a).

In addition, based on studies <italic>in vitro</italic> (EMSA, SELEX) and supported by findings <italic>in vivo</italic> (mIP), we identified novel sites of mTERF binding, elsewhere in the genome. Binding at these sites was weaker than in the tRNA<sup>Leu(UUR)</sup> gene, but replication pausing in these regions was nevertheless influenced by mTERF overexpression. The data support a role for mTERF as a modulator of replication, especially at its canonical binding site. Close parallels with the properties of replication pause-region binding proteins in bacteria and eukaryotic nuclei provide some intriguing hypotheses which we now discuss.</p></sec><sec><title>mTERF binding to additional sites in human mtDNA</title><p>The present study revealed novel sites of mTERF binding in the NCR and ND1 gene. mIP assays were consistent with binding at least at some of these sites by overexpressed mTERF <italic>in vivo</italic>. mTERF homologues in invertebrates, such as DmTTF in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) or DBP in sea urchins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>), also have diverse and multiple binding sites, typically demarcating the 3&#x02032; ends of oppositely transcribed gene clusters. Although mTERF binding to the novel binding sites appeared weaker than at the canonical binding site, many of them are clustered, suggesting that cooperative binding might promote site occupancy <italic>in vivo</italic>, consistent with the results of mIP. The binding we observed <italic>in vivo</italic> might also depend on other mitochondrial nucleoid proteins, including TFAM, as well as possible post-translational modifications.</p><p>The effects of mTERF overexpression on mtDNA RIs from the NCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>c and d), suggest that mTERF may interact with this region <italic>in vivo</italic> to promote fork arrest at the replication terminus. The termination zone for mtDNA replication appears not to be a single point (O<sub>H</sub>), but an extended region of the NCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>c). mTERF overexpression resulted in increased stalling of replication forks as they approach O<sub>H</sub> from the &#x02018;cytochrome <italic>b</italic> side&#x02019;. It also appeared to elevate the abundance of 7S DNA (Supplementary Figure 4f) and of S1 nuclease-sensitive species probably equivalent to the classical D-loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>c), consistent with increased pausing in the TAS region. Protein-binding sites within the TAS region were previously mapped by <italic>in vivo</italic> footprinting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>) and by EMSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>), and mTERF might be one of the proteins involved. The D-loop remains enigmatic. DNA synthesis arrest at TAS might be a switching mechanism relevant to copy number control, or may have other purposes, such as mitochondrial nucleoid organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> Tus protein, which regulates the termination of chromosomal DNA replication, may represent a useful paradigm for mTERF. Tus binds multiple copies of the <italic>Ter</italic> sequence flanking the terminator region, and acts directionally as a contrahelicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>) to trap replication forks in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). The sea urchin mTERF homologue DBP has also been shown to function as a contrahelicase <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Like Tus, mTERF binding to sites on both sides of the replication terminus region might regulate the entry of oppositely moving replication forks into the region, facilitating their orderly synopsis. Increased mTERF expression resulted in elevated levels of persistent H-strand 5&#x02032; ends in the NCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>d), an expected signature of delayed resolution if fork passage through rDNA is more restricted. The orientation of potential mTERF-binding sites in the genome appears highly non-random. Taking the simplified sequence GG(N<sub>8</sub>)GG as the minimal binding site, its 12 occurrences in the NCR all bear the same orientation. The same applies to the cluster of seven such sites in the 3&#x02032; portion of ND1 and the adjacent tRNA gene cluster. In contrast, the canonical binding site shows the opposite orientation, although is flanked on each side by two oppositely oriented copies of the minimal binding site (Supplementary Figure 6).</p><p>Although we detected only ambiguous mTERF binding <italic>in vitro</italic> in the H-strand transcriptional initiator region, (Supplementary Figure 2e, EMSA probe OH5), mIP findings suggest that the site is efficiently bound <italic>in vivo</italic> by overexpressed mTERF. The latter is consistent with previous findings that recombinant mTERF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) binds only weakly to this site, whereas partially purified, endogenous mTERF binds more strongly and establishes a DNA loop required for efficient rDNA transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). This may require a post-translational modification or limiting accessory factor found only <italic>in vivo</italic>. mTERF exists in multiple isoforms with distinct properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>), and has been reported to convert to an inactive trimeric form <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). The initiator fragment also contains binding sites for TFAM, which may promote binding but may also interfere with the interpretation of the EMSA assay (see Supplementary Figure 2e).</p></sec><sec><title>Regulated passage of replication and transcription complexes</title><p>The role of mTERF as a transcriptional terminator is well established from <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, and DmTTF also functions thus <italic>in vivo</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). However, there is no compelling evidence that mTERF regulates mitochondrial RNA levels physiologically. The disparity in relative abundance between mRNAs and rRNAs in mammalian mitochondria can largely be accounted for by post-transcriptional regulation, notably differences in half-life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>) and RNA processing efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>).

Moreover, manipulation of mTERF levels <italic>in vivo</italic> by overexpression or RNA interference has remarkably little effect on steady-state mitochondrial RNA levels (Hyv&#x000e4;rinen <italic>et al.</italic>, manuscript in preparation). The observation that mTERF also modulates mtDNA replication pausing suggests a different physiological meaning for its action as a transcriptional terminator, i.e. it coregulates replication and transcription.</p><p>The unregulated collision of oppositely moving transcription and replication complexes drastically inhibits DNA replication and provokes genomic instability in both bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>) and yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>).

Passage of a transcription complex from the permissive direction relieves the block on DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>) by provoking the dissociation of bound Tus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>). The mouse TTF-I protein binds at the 3&#x02032; end of the rDNA transcription unit, where it terminates transcription by RNA polymerase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>) and arrests replication forks arriving from the other direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>), via its polar contrahelicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>). This organization of the rDNA locus is relatively conserved throughout eukaryotes, although in some species the TTF-I homologue co-operates with or depends upon other proteins to maintain the replication fork barrier (RFB), including Sap1p and Reb1p in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68 B69 B70">68&#x02013;70</xref>), with involvement of Swi1p and Swi3p to stabilize the stalled forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>), or Fob1p in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>), with Sir2p regulating recombination at the stalled forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>).</p><p>The entry of replication forks into the mtDNA termination zone around O<sub>H</sub> requires traversal of the heavily transcribed rDNA region in the antisense direction, with potentially catastrophic consequences if a transcription complex is encountered. By binding at the rDNA boundary, mTERF may thus serve a function related to those of both Tus and TTF-I, facilitating the regulated passage of oppositely moving transcription and replication machineries, and regulating fork access to the termination zone.</p><p>The passage of a transcriptional complex in the permissive direction may also serve a regulatory role, such as hypothesized for mtDBP in relieving the block on D-loop expansion in sea urchins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>mTERF overexpression enhanced X-like species in fragments where the canonical mTERF-binding site was centrally located (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>b, Supplementary Figure 4a), whereas mTERF knockdown by RNA interference depleted such species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>d). Although these may be recombination intermediates (see below), they might also comprise termination complexes centred on the mTERF-binding site. If increased mTERF activity enhances rDNA transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), it may also restrict the entry of replication forks into rDNA in the antisense direction and perhaps even shift the resolution site in some molecules from the NCR to the tRNA<sup>Leu(UUR)</sup> gene. However, this must be a very minor fraction of molecules, since we did not see a complete Y-arc in O<sub>H</sub>-containing fragments.</p></sec><sec><title>Transcription termination and the bootlace model</title><p>Previous studies of vertebrate mtDNA replication indicated that, in the majority of molecules, the lagging strand is initially laid down in the form of extended RNA segments which are subsequently converted to DNA via a maturation step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). We hypothesized that the RNA lagging-strand may arise via either of two highly unorthodox mechanisms: either via a primase capable of synthesizing extended RNA primers, or by the hybridization of preformed L-strand RNA with the displaced H-strand in a 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; direction as the replication fork advances, the so-called bootlace model.</p><p>mTERF-dependent replication pausing may be construed as circumstantial evidence supporting the bootlace model. Transcriptional termination by mTERF adjacent to a paused replication complex would provide a 3&#x02032; end capable of priming lagging-strand DNA synthesis, at the same time as delivering a fresh RNA bootlace to enable the replication fork to proceed in the forward direction. The mTERF-dependent enhancement of lagging strand 5&#x02032; DNA ends near the canonical (and some other) mTERF-binding sites, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>), supports this idea. In sea urchin mtDNA, the major replication pause-region, which interacts with at least two DNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>), also appears to be a major lagging-strand origin, as well as a site of transcriptional termination and/or RNA processing.</p><p>The effect of overexpression of mTERF is much more site-specific than that produced by overexpression of TFAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), by treatment with mtDNA replication inhibitors such as dideoxycytidine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), or by expression of dominant-negative versions of the mtDNA helicase Twinkle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Unlike these treatments, mTERF overexpression did not cause a general slowing of replication, and did not alter globally the ratio of strand-coupled and RITOLS type RIs. By facilitating lagging-strand maturation, mTERF may serve merely to minimize the extent of the region of mtDNA maintained in the more vulnerable RNA-DNA hybrid form, thus contributing to genome stability.</p></sec><sec><title>Recombination at the mTERF-binding site</title><p>An alternate interpretation of the X-like molecules centred on the tRNA<sup>Leu(UUR)</sup> gene region, which were enhanced by mTERF overexpression and depleted by mTERF knockdown, is that they represent true recombination intermediates. Such forms would be expected to arise if persistent mTERF binding and consequent prolonged pausing entrain fork collapse, requiring either a double-strand break or fork regression to generate a recombinogenic end for restart of replication. We previously noted that the canonical mTERF-binding site was a frequent break-point in rearranged mtDNA molecules (&#x02018;sublimons&#x02019;) detectable at a low level in all cell-types, but especially prominent in human heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>), and also in mice expressing a disease-equivalent version of the Twinkle helicase(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>) associated with autosomal dominant external ophthalmoplegia (PEO). It is tempting to ascribe such molecules to aberrant recombination following pausing and fork collapse at the tRNA<sup>Leu(UUR)</sup> gene.</p><p>In yeast, double-strand breaks at the site of the RFB in rDNA, giving rise to low-level genomic rearrangements implicated in ageing, are evident even in wild-type strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). However, in strains defective for the DNA helicase Rrm3p, which is required for the processing of paused replication forks at sites of protein binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>), the frequency of such events is greatly increased. If the balance between the pause-inducing and pause-processing machineries is disturbed, recombinational mechanisms must be employed to restart replication, with the concomitant risk of genomic instability. Thus, even though replication pausing systems such as mTERF may have evolved to limit genomic instability by preventing collisions of the replication and transcription machineries, their dysregulation, including by overexpression, could itself lead to instability. It follows that mTERF is a candidate gene for involvement in those cases of genetic disorders mediated by mtDNA rearrangements (e.g. PEO), whose genetic basis has not yet been elucidated.</p><p>In some cases replication pausing is merely a signature of defective replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>). In others it is clearly a programmed event which facilitates other processes and preserves genome stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>). As indicated by our findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), the phenomenon of pausing in human mtDNA is not confined to just one cell-type, nor is it an <italic>in vitro</italic> artefact seen only in cultured cells. The fact that it exhibits differences between cell-types and tissues strengthens the proposition that it is of physiological significance. The involvement of mTERF in modulating mtDNA replication pausing in human mtDNA, and the analogies with programmed replication pausing in other systems, support the idea that mTERF represents a system for safeguarding the integrity of the mitochondrial genome, whilst facilitating its efficient expression.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkm676_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_gkm676_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by funding from the Academy of Finland, Tampere University Hospital Medical Research Fund, the UK Medical Research Council, the UK Muscular Dystrophy Campaign, the Juselius Foundation and the European Union EUMITOCOMBAT and MitEURO projects.
