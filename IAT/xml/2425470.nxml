Cleavage factor I<sub>m</sub> is an oligomer composed of a small 25 kDa subunit (CF I<sub>m</sub>25) and a variable larger subunit of either 59, 68 or 72 kDa. The small subunit also interacts with RNA, poly(A) polymerase, and the nuclear poly(A)-binding protein. These protein&#x02013;protein interactions are thought to be facilitated by the Nudix domain of CF I<sub>m</sub>25, a hydrolase motif with a characteristic &#x003b1;/&#x003b2;/&#x003b1; fold and a conserved catalytic sequence or Nudix box. We present here the crystal structures of human CF I<sub>m</sub>25 in its free and diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap<sub>4</sub>A) bound forms at 1.85 and 1.80 &#x000c5;, respectively. CF I<sub>m</sub>25 crystallizes as a dimer and presents the classical Nudix fold. Results from crystallographic and biochemical experiments suggest that CF I<sub>m</sub>25 makes use of its Nudix fold to bind but not hydrolyze ATP and Ap<sub>4</sub>A. The complex and apo protein structures provide insight into the active oligomeric state of CF I<sub>m</sub> and suggest a possible role of nucleotide binding in either the polyadenylation and/or cleavage steps of pre-messenger RNA 3&#x02032;-end processing.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Pre-messenger RNA 3&#x02032;-end processing in eukaryotes is a two-step reaction consisting of endonucleolytic cleavage of the pre-mRNA followed by addition of a poly(A) tail at the 3&#x02032; end of the upstream cleavage product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). The coupling of these processing reactions relies on multiple protein&#x02013;protein and protein&#x02013;RNA interactions. The factors that are necessary and sufficient to reconstitute cleavage and polyadenylation in a mammalian <italic>in vitro</italic> system are poly(A) polymerase (PAP), cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF), cleavage stimulation factor (CstF), cleavage factor I<sub>m</sub> (CF I<sub>m</sub>), cleavage factor II<sub>m</sub> (CF II<sub>m</sub>) and the nuclear poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABPN1). The recruitment of the mammalian polyadenylation machinery to the pre-mRNA relies on the recognition of conserved sequence elements, such as the highly conserved hexamer AAUAAA recognized by CPSF and a U-rich sequence downstream of the cleavage site recognized by CstF. Additionally a set of UGUA elements, a third sequence element found upstream of the cleavage site and not as universally conserved, is recognized by CF I<sub>m</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Upon completion of the processing steps the mRNA can be efficiently transported out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm. Homologs of CF I subunits are also found in cDNA databases of <italic>Caenorabditis elegans</italic>, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and plants.</p><p>CF I<sub>m</sub> is an oligomer composed of a small 25 kDa subunit (CF I<sub>m</sub>25, also referred to as CPSF5 or NUDT21) and a larger subunit of either 59, 68 or 72 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The three larger subunits share substantial sequence homology. They are encoded on two different genes and the 72 kDa subunit is a splice variant of the 68 kDa polypeptide. CF I<sub>m</sub> can be reconstituted <italic>in vitro</italic> from the 25- and 68 kDa subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). CF I<sub>m</sub>, in addition to having a role in regulation of poly(A) site recognition, is also involved in stabilizing CPSF at the conserved hexamer, enhances the rate of poly (A) site cleavage <italic>in vitro</italic>, and has been shown to interact with PAP and PABPN1 via its 25 kDa subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Furthermore CF I<sub>m</sub> also interacts with splicing factors, indicating a role in communicating between different RNA-processing complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p><p>Much of what we know about complex formation of processing factors on the pre-mRNA and its regulation has been investigated biochemically. Structural characterization of individual and multicomponent processing factors will elucidate the domain interactions important for the 3&#x02032; pre-mRNA processing mechanism that cannot be deciphered by biochemical means. The structure of the 25 kDa subunit of CF I<sub>m</sub> (CF I<sub>m</sub>25) will help further define the domains important for substrate and protein interactions.</p><p>The structure of CF I<sub>m</sub>25 will also allow us to investigate the function of a Nudix domain present in this protein. The first Nudix protein to be characterized enzymatically and structurally was <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> MutT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Nudix proteins are generally characterized as housekeeping enzymes due to their role in hydrolysis of substrates described as <bold>nu</bold>cleoside <bold>di</bold>phosphate linked to another moiety <bold>X</bold>, many of which are potentially toxic molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Nudix proteins have a conserved Nudix fold consisting of an &#x003b1;/&#x003b2;/&#x003b1; sandwich. Within the Nudix fold the consensus sequence of the Nudix box is GX<sub>5</sub>EX<sub>7</sub>REUXEEXGU, where U is a hydrophobic residue and X is any residue, and folds into a loop&#x02013;&#x003b1; helix&#x02013;loop structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Interestingly, the Nudix box in CF I<sub>m</sub>25 lacks two of the four conserved glutamate residues, three of which were shown to be important for catalysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Sequence alignment of CF I<sub>m</sub>25 with Nudix proteins.

CF I<sub>m</sub>25 crystallizes as a dimer, which is also the oligomeric state of the protein in solution. The CF I<sub>m</sub>25 structure presents the classic Nudix &#x003b1;/&#x003b2;/&#x003b1; fold and harbors residues outside of the Nudix core that could potentiate ligand binding. Structural and biochemical evidence suggests that CF I<sub>m</sub>25 binds, but does not hydrolyze, mono and di-adenosine nucleotides.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Protein purification</title><p>The construction of the plasmid expressing the 25 kDa subunit of human cleavage factor I<sub>m</sub> (CF I<sub>m</sub>) with an N-terminal 6xHis tag was previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The cDNA of CF I<sub>m</sub>25 was subsequently cloned into a Gateway&#x000ae; vector with a dual 6xHis-maltose binding protein (MBP) affinity tag provided by Dr David S. Waugh (National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). The following primers were used in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR): 5&#x02032;-GAG AAC CTG TAC TTC CAG GGT ATG TCT GTG GTA CCG CCC-3&#x02032;, 5&#x02032;-GGG GAC CAC TTT GTA CAA GAA AGC TGG GTT ATT AGT TGT AAA TAA AAT TGA A-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-GGGG ACA AGT TTG TAC AAA AAA GCA GGC TCG GAG AAC CTG TAC TTC CAG-3&#x02032;. CF I<sub>m</sub>25 (227 amino acids) was then expressed in Rosetta (DE3) pLysS cells (Novagen) and grown in LB medium for 24 h at 25&#x000b0;C following induction with 0.4 mM IPTG. The protein was purified on Nickel NTA beads (Qiagen), followed by a Tobacco etch virus (Tev) protease cleavage step, and cation exchange on a Resource S column (GE Healthcare): Cells were lysed at 4&#x000b0;C by sonication in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, and a protease inhibitor tablet (Roche). The lysate was centrifuged at 12 000 &#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> and incubated with Ni-NTA beads (Qiagen) for 1 h at 4&#x000b0;C. Protein was eluted with lysis buffer containing 100&#x02013;500 mM imidazole. Pooled fractions were dialyzed into 10% (v/v) glycerol, 20 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 7.5 and 50 mM KCl. CF I<sub>m</sub>25 was cleaved from the MBP tag by the addition of equimolar amounts of Tev protease. MBP and Tev were then separated from CF I<sub>m</sub>25 by elution with a 50 mM&#x02013;1 M KCl gradient at pH 7.5 on a Resource S column (GE Healthcare). The selenomethionyl protein was produced by inhibiting methionine biosynthesis in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) and purified as described earlier. Proteins were concentrated to about 6&#x02013;20 mg/ml (Millipore Amicon Ultra-15), flash frozen and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>Crystallization</title><p>CF I<sub>m</sub>25 crystals were initially obtained with the sitting drop method in a 96-well tray format. Sitting drops were set up with a 925 PC Workstation (Gilson) by mixing 0.6 &#x000b5;l of protein (16 mg/ml) with 0.6 &#x000b5;l reservoir solution (25% w/v PEG 3350, 0.2 M MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 M Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 8.5) (Hampton Research Index Screen, condition 85) and equilibrated against 160 &#x000b5;l reservoir buffer. Subsequently, crystals were obtained by streak seeding hanging drops with a protein concentration of 6 mg/ml. Hanging drops were set up by mixing 1 &#x000b5;l of protein with 1 &#x000b5;l of reservoir solution under the same crystallization conditions. Trigonal crystals grew to a maximum length of 200 &#x000b5;m in space group P3<sub>1</sub>21 (P3<sub>2</sub>21) with unit cell parameters <italic>a</italic> = <italic>b</italic> = 80.11 &#x000c5;, <italic>c</italic> = 72.21 &#x000c5; and &#x003b3; = 120&#x000b0;. There is one molecule per asymmetric unit with an estimated solvent content of 52%. Crystals of the complex with Ap<sub>4</sub>A were obtained with the hanging drop method. The hanging drops were set up manually by mixing 1 &#x000b5;l of protein with 1 &#x000b5;l of reservoir solution (25% w/v PEG 3350, 0.025 M MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 M Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 7.5). The drops were streak seeded after a 24 h incubation period. When the crystals reached at least 100 &#x000b5;m, Ap<sub>4</sub>A at a final concentration of 44 mM was added directly to the drop. After 6 h the soaked Ap<sub>4</sub>A crystals were cryoprotected by the addition of 1 &#x000b5;l of 25% (w/v) PEG 3350 and 50% (v/v) glycerol to the 2 &#x000b5;l hanging drop prior to flash cooling in liquid nitrogen.</p></sec><sec><title>Crystallographic data collection</title><p>Multiple wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) data were collected at beamline 23-ID-D (Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory) on a MAR m300 CCD detector. One complete selenomethionyl MAD dataset was collected on one crystal at the peak, inflection and high-energy remote wavelengths to a maximum resolution of 1.85 &#x000c5;. Data were collected at 1.80 &#x000c5; resolution on the Ap<sub>4</sub>A complex at beamline X12B (National Synchrotron Light Source) on a Quantum-4 CCD (ADSC) detector.

CF I<sub>m</sub>25 elutes as a dimer in gel exclusion chromatography with an apparent molecular weight of &#x0223c;53 kDa (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn079/DC1">Supplementary Figure</ext-link>). The dimeric state of CF I<sub>m</sub>25 has also been confirmed by dynamic light scattering. In the crystal structure, dimer formation relates two monomers by a 2-fold crystallographic axis. The Nudix domain is located in the middle of the protein and spans residues 77&#x02013;202 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The Nudix fold comprises two mixed &#x003b2; sheets flanked by two helices (&#x003b1;2 and &#x003b1;3). The Nudix box is located in helix &#x003b1;2 (residues 109&#x02013;131) and the preceding loop. The region immediately preceding the Nudix domain (residues 21&#x02013;76) folds into two distinct segments: residues 21&#x02013;32 form an extended loop structure that projects away from the globular domain of the protein (residues 1&#x02013;20 are not visible in the electron density map). The extended loop is stabilized via crystal-packing interactions with a symmetry-related monomer and this region, which has been shown to participate in RNA binding, is likely to adopt a different fold <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Lys23 has previously been shown to undergo acetylation, a modification which modulates the interaction of CF I<sub>m</sub>25 with PAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). The second segment of the N-terminal region (residues 33&#x02013;76) contributes two short &#x003b2; strands and a long helix. Within this region an additional modification, this time phosphorylation, was reported for Tyr40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). We do not see either modification because the protein was expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>. The C-terminal region (residues 203&#x02013;227) is composed of two helices (&#x003b1;4 and &#x003b1;5) and a short beta strand (&#x003b2;10) comprising the final four residues. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Domain organization of CF I<sub>m</sub>25.

The buried surface is extensive and represents 13% of the surface of the homodimer. The dimer interface is maintained by approximately 20 residues per monomer, which participate in both hydrogen bonding and non-polar contacts. The monomer interactions are facilitated by the amino terminal extension (residues 21&#x02013;32) and by helix &#x003b1;5, the loop preceding helix &#x003b1;5, helix &#x003b1;6, beta strand &#x003b2;6, the loop linking &#x003b2;6 and &#x003b2;7 and beta strand &#x003b2;10.</p><p>The main hydrogen-bonding contributions are between the amino terminal extension, beta strand &#x003b2;6 and beta strand &#x003b2;10.

The loop preceding helix &#x003b1;5 and the loop between &#x003b2;6 and &#x003b2;7 contribute to dimer formation through hydrophobic contacts involving residues Pro159 and Tyr160 from chain A and Tyr202 and Phe199 from chain B. Additional interactions are provided by stacking helix &#x003b1;5 from one monomer on to strand &#x003b2;6 of the opposing monomer in a tail-to-tail fashion allowing hydrogen bonding between residues in the loop following helix &#x003b1;5. These hydrogen-bonding interactions include Arg221 and its symmetry mate and the carboxyl group of Ser220 with Asn147 from the opposing monomers.</p></sec><sec><title>Metal binding</title><p>CF I<sub>m</sub>25 is missing the second and fourth conserved glutamates of the Nudix box (residues 124 and 128), which are replaced by a leucine and isoleucine, respectively. These glutamate residues are very often involved in metal binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). We therefore set out to investigate whether CF I<sub>m</sub>25 was still capable of binding metal via the two remaining carboxylates. Although the CF I<sub>m</sub>25 crystals were obtained in the presence of 200 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, there was no identifiable Mg<sup>2+</sup> bound in the electron density map. Magnesium is a light atom, which is usually not easily identifiable in electron density maps and can often be mistaken for a water molecule. We therefore used metals that are more electron dense such as MnCl<sub>2</sub> and GdCl<sub>3</sub> to identify putative metal site(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Mn<sup>2+</sup> and Gd<sup>3+</sup> present the added advantage that they are anomalous scattering atoms, which should allow unambiguous identification of metal sites. We were unable to identify binding of either metal, regardless of whether the metal was co-crystallized or soaked into pre-existing crystals. Since Nudix enzymes require a divalent cation for catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), these experiments suggested that it is unlikely that CF I<sub>m</sub>25 functions as a hydrolase. This finding called for further investigation of CF I<sub>m</sub>25's binding to potential substrates (see below).</p></sec><sec><title>Enzymatic assays and substrate binding</title><p>We next set out to investigate whether CF I<sub>m</sub>25 binds a substrate. We used three different methods: a colorimetric assay to measure the release of inorganic phosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), co-crystallization/crystal soaking with putative substrates and steady-state tryptophan fluorescence experiments.</p><p>A colorimetric assay to measure the release of inorganic phosphate, and thus the potential hydrolytic activity of CF I<sub>m</sub>25 on nucleotides, was performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). The following putative substrates were tested: ATP, Ap<sub>4</sub>A and the 7mG(5&#x02032;)ppp(5&#x02032;)G cap analog. Ap<sub>4</sub>A was chosen because the two enzymes found to be most structurally similar to CF I<sub>m</sub>25 bind Ap<sub>4</sub>A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). ATP and the cap analog were tested because of their prominent role in RNA processing. The assay indicated that, within the limits of detection of the assay, none of the putative substrates tested were hydrolyzed.</p><p>Although CF I<sub>m</sub>25 does not seem to possess a hydrolytic activity, it could still bind nucleotides. Several putative ligands were either co-crystallized or soaked into the crystals: ATP, GTP, ADP, GDP, diadenosine triphosphate (Ap<sub>3</sub>A), Ap<sub>4</sub>A, AMP, 7mG(5&#x02032;)ppp(5&#x02032;)G cap analog, NAD+ and GDP-mannose. In addition to testing these nucleotides, which are known substrates for Nudix enzymes, we also attempted to co-crystallize CF I<sub>m</sub>25 with a 21mer RNA derived from the PAP &#x003b3; cDNA sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Of all the putative ligands tested, only Ap<sub>4</sub>A bound to the crystal (see later). The original crystallization conditions contained 200 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350. Because nucleotides can precipitate in the presence of high concentrations of PEG and magnesium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), care was taken to modify the crystallization conditions so as to decrease or completely eliminate MgCl<sub>2</sub> and therefore lessen the risk of the nucleotide precipitating out of solution. Conditions with NaCl or even no salt could be used in lieu of MgCl<sub>2</sub> to grow unliganded crystals. Even when the divalent cation was omitted from the crystallization solution crystals did not form with any of the ligands tested (with the notable exception of Ap<sub>4</sub>A), demonstrating that the lack of binding was not due to the nucleotide falling out of solution.</p><p>Binding studies were then performed employing the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence properties of CF I<sub>m</sub>25. The following Nudix ligands were tested: ATP, GTP, Ap<sub>4</sub>A, inositol hexaphosphate (IP6), 7mG(5&#x02032;)ppp(5&#x02032;)G cap analog, ADP and AMP.

The Ap<sub>4</sub>A co-crystal structure was determined by using the phases from the unliganded structure.

Variations between these two structures arise from an extension in the loop linking &#x003b2;6 and &#x003b2;7, a shortening of the loop following &#x003b2;4 and an additional &#x003b1;-helix (helix &#x003b1;1) in the CF I<sub>m</sub>25 structure. The additional &#x003b1;-helix in CF I<sub>m</sub>25 plays a role in sequestering the substrate binding pocket from solvent exposure. When comparing the positions of the bound nucleotides between CF I<sub>m</sub>25 and DR1025 we also see variations in substrate fit. Superposition of the ATP bound in DR1025 on to the CF I<sub>m</sub>25 structure shows that both the base and phosphate tail would clash with protein residues in helix &#x003b1;1 and beta strand &#x003b2;5 in the CF I<sub>m</sub>25 structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>).

The dimeric structure of CF I<sub>m</sub>25 suggests that the active form of CF I<sub>m</sub> may be a heterotrimer composed of a CF I<sub>m</sub>25 homodimer and either the 59, 68 or 72 kDa subunit. This is consistent with interaction studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (DIP interaction database accession DIP:25083N) where the CF I<sub>m</sub>25 homolog (Uniprot accession Q93716) was found to interact with itself and with the CF I<sub>m</sub>68 homolog (Uniprot accession Q18937). Alternatively, the complex with the larger subunit of CF I<sub>m</sub> could be a heterotetramer. A third possibility is that CF I<sub>m</sub>25 monomerizes upon binding the larger subunit.</p><p>The Nudix box of CF I<sub>m</sub>25 lacks two of the four glutamates important for catalytic function and metal binding. Our structural and biochemical characterization suggests that CF I<sub>m</sub>25 is able to bind but not hydrolyze nucleotide substrates. In the dinucleotide bound CF I<sub>m</sub>25 structure, the dinucleotide is found outside of the Nudix box and lies deeper within the active site compared to ATP in DR1025. The fluorescence-binding data for CF I<sub>m</sub>25, indicate a binding affinity in the low micromolar range for Ap<sub>4</sub>A indicative of a potential role as a signaling molecule and a weak, albeit physiologically relevant, binding affinity for ATP. Even though CF I<sub>m</sub>25 binds both Ap<sub>4</sub>A and ATP, we have so far only been able to obtain a co-crystal complex with Ap<sub>4</sub>A. It is entirely possible that the crystallization conditions we have explored to date for the protein&#x02013;ATP complex are not compatible with the formation of a crystal lattice and that further exploration of the crystallization space might yield the desired conditions. We note that pre-formed crystals of CF I<sub>m</sub>25 dissolve upon addition of ATP, indicating a possible conformation change upon binding of the nucleotide.</p><p>To our knowledge, CF I<sub>m</sub>25 is the first example of a Nudix protein binding and not hydrolyzing a nucleotide substrate. This loss of function/gain of a regulatory role is not unprecedented in evolution. A similar loss of function was reported for the <italic>Lactobacillus lactis</italic> ATP phosphoribosyl transferase (ATP-PRT) regulatory subunit, His Z (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). ATP-PRT functions to initiate the biosynthesis of histidine and requires both the HisZ subunit and HisG, the catalytic subunit, for activity. The regulatory subunit, HisZ, resembles the catalytic domain of functional histidyl-tRNA synthetases (HisRS) and utilizes its fold, not for catalysis, but for binding of histidine to monitor histidine levels. Although there were no metals evident in either the free or bound structures of CF I<sub>m</sub>25 and no identifiable hydrolytic activity in our colorimetric assay it remains possible that the Nudix box of CF I<sub>m</sub>25 could potentiate hydrolysis of Ap<sub>4</sub>A and ATP upon interaction of CF I<sub>m</sub>25 with one of the larger CF I<sub>m</sub> subunits or additional binding partners.</p><p>Ap<sub>4</sub>A belongs to the family of diadenosine oligophosphates, Ap<sub>n</sub>A, which were first discovered 40 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Ap<sub>4</sub>A is composed of two adenosines and four phosphates linked in 5&#x02032; to 5&#x02032;-phosphodiester linkages. The role of Ap<sub>n</sub>As in higher eukaryotes has remained elusive. Recently, Ap<sub>n</sub>As have been suggested to play a role as putative extra- and intracellular signaling molecules. Ap<sub>4</sub>A itself is involved in the cellular stress response, inhibition of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, stimulation of DNA replication and repair, as well as influencing other essential cellular processes in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Presently, the only link between Ap<sub>4</sub>A and 3&#x02032;-end processing was described in yeast where stimulation of primer independent synthesis by yeast poly(A) polymerase was observed in the presence of dinucleoside polyphosphates, including Ap<sub>4</sub>A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). There is no CF I<sub>m</sub>25 homolog in yeast but this observation still suggests a potential role for dinucleoside polyphosphates as signaling molecules during RNA-processing events. The concentration of ATP and Ap<sub>4</sub>A can fluctuate within the cell in response to cellular stress or growth. Preliminary experiments on the role of Ap<sub>4</sub>A during the polyadenylation step of 3&#x02032;-end processing resulted in a non-competitive inhibition of polyadenylation in a poly (A) extension assay with mammalian PAP (results not shown). This suggests that under conditions of high concentrations of Ap<sub>4</sub>A such as stress, Ap<sub>4</sub>A can bind to a site in PAP, other than the ATP binding site, to inhibit polyadenylation.</p><p>The residues 81&#x02013;160 of the Nudix domain play a dual role, binding RNA and stabilizing protein&#x02013;protein interactions. Additionally, the amino terminus (1&#x02013;76) participates in RNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). A stable interaction between CF I<sub>m</sub>25 and CF I<sub>m</sub>68, unlike that involving PAP or PABPN1, requires the entire CF I<sub>m</sub>25 protein. CF I<sub>m</sub>68 must contact regions outside of the known RNA-binding region of CF I<sub>m</sub>25 to promote complex formation and stimulate pre-mRNA 3&#x02032;-end processing. Interestingly, CF I<sub>m</sub>25 has a patch of negatively charged surface residues that runs the length of the dimer interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). This charged region is composed of residues primarily from beta strand &#x003b2;3 and helix &#x003b1;4 and could potentiate protein&#x02013;protein interactions with CF I<sub>m</sub>25's other binding partners, possibly CF I<sub>m</sub>68. Also intriguing is the observation that a binding interaction between the substrate RNA and the 25 kDa subunit occurs in the absence of a putative RNA-binding domain. This suggests another mechanism of RNA recognition, possibly through homodimer formation. A CF I<sub>m</sub>25 homodimer may enhance the binding potential to the RNA substrate compared to a monomer interaction by increased surface area interactions. A definite answer regarding the oligomeric state of the 25 kDa subunit and the RNA-binding mechanism will have to await a CF I<sub>m</sub>25 structure with RNA bound.</p><p>The results reported here suggest that CF I<sub>m</sub>25 is unable to hydrolyze nucleotides or dinucleotides even though it harbors a classic Nudix fold. The Nudix domain of CF I<sub>m</sub>25 may instead facilitate protein&#x02013;protein interactions, as suggested by the large distribution of charged residues in the electrostatic surface representation of the Nudix domain. This charge distribution of the Nudix domain correlates well with results from pull-down experiments with PAP and PABPN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>The interaction of CF I<sub>m</sub> with the RNA substrate and with PAP stimulates the rate of polyadenylate tail synthesis. This may be facilitated by the binding of ATP to CF I<sub>m</sub>25. Preliminary data (S. Dettwiler and W. Keller, unpublished) showed that CF I<sub>m</sub>25 interacts with hClp1, a protein shown to bind ATP which is involved in 3&#x02032;-pre-mRNA processing and tRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). This observation, in conjunction with the fact that hClp1 has recently been shown to function as an siRNA kinase and a kinase that phosphorylates the 5&#x02032;-end of the 3&#x02032;-splicing product in human tRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>), suggests a possible link between CF I<sub>m</sub>25's binding of ATP and protein&#x02013;protein cross talk. Recently, CF I<sub>m</sub>25 has also been shown to be associated in a large RNP complex with Rae1, an mRNA export protein, in the nucleation and stabilization of microtubules during spindle assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). This interaction is via CF I<sub>m</sub>25 association with an RNA component of the RNP complex and suggests a role for CF I<sub>m</sub>25 in mRNA export via direct RNA association that may be influenced by the concentration of intracellular nucleotides or dinucleotides.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn079/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="gkn079_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="gkn079_nar-02422-r-2007-File009.jpg"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by National Institutes of Health grant GM62239 to SD and a Department of Energy Experimental program to Stimulate Competitive Research predoctoral fellowship to M.C.
