Here, we have studied the effects of HIF-1&#x003b1; on apoptosis by modulating HIF-1&#x003b1; gene expression in A549 cells through both siRNA knock-down and over-expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>A549 cells were transfected with a HIF-1&#x003b1; siRNA plasmid or a HIF-1&#x003b1; expression vector. Transfected cells were exposed to a normoxic or hypoxic environment in the presence or absence of 25 mM HEPES and 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) (5 mM). The expression of three key genes of the glycolysis pathway, glucose transporter type 1(GLUT1), phosphoglycerate kinase 1(PGK1), and hexokinase 1(HK1), were measured using real-time RT-PCR.

These effects of HIF-1&#x003b1; on glycolysis, pH of the medium, and apoptosis were reversed by treatment with the glycolytic inhibitor, 2-DG.

Tissue hypoxia caused by inadequate blood supply occurs very early during tumor development, usually when the tumor diameter is just a few millimeters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Therefore, over-expression of hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1 (HIF-1), a "master" gene in the hypoxic response, is a frequent occurrence in many tumor cells, including NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However, the role of HIF-1 in NSCLC remains controversial. The HIF-1 complex is a heterodimer consisting of a constitutively expressed HIF-1&#x003b2; subunit and a HIF-1&#x003b1; subunit, which is highly transcriptionally regulated, as well as being susceptible to oxygen-dependent degradation of the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Giatromanolaki et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] reported that HIF-1&#x003b1; over-expression is common in NSCLC, and that this is related to the up-regulation of various angiogenic factors and associated with poor prognosis. They also suggested that HIF pathway might be an important therapeutic target for NSCLC. However, these results are at odds with those of Volm et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], who demonstrated that NSCLC patients with HIF-1&#x003b1;-positive carcinomas had significantly longer median survival times than patients with HIF-1&#x003b1;-negative carcinomas. Yet another group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] confirmed that down-regulation of HIF-1 abrogates hypoxia-induced cell growth arrest. More recently, Yu et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] reported that HIF-1&#x003b1; exerted an anti-apoptotic role in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) under anoxic stress. As apoptosis is one of the most important mechanisms mediating cancer remission, investigation into the role of HIF-1&#x003b1; in apoptosis of lung cancer may provide useful information for the resolution of these controversies.</p><p>As a key mediator of the hypoxic response in animal cells, HIF-1 plays an important role in controlling the glycolysis pathway when cells are exposed to low oxygen tension. During hypoxia, cells shift to a primarily glycolytic metabolic mode by up-regulating HIF-1-dependent glycolytic genes, such as glucose transporter type 1(GLUT1), phosphoglycerate kinase 1(PGK1), hexokinase 1(HK1), etc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In addition, intracellular pH decreases as a result of lactate acid accumulation caused by accelerated glycolysis. Because intracellular acidosis triggers apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], blocking increased glycolytic activity by down regulating HIF-1&#x003b1; may reduce apoptosis of the hypoxic cells.</p><p>We investigated whether controlling HIF-1&#x003b1; expression regulated apoptosis of the lung adenocarcinoma cell line, A549, during hypoxia, and whether this effect of HIF-1&#x003b1; was dependent upon glycolysis. The research presented in this report addresses these fundamental questions about the role of HIF-1 in the pathophysiology of NSCLC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>siRNA plasmid vectors were constructed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].

Forty micrograms of protein were separated per lane by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). After electrophoretic transfer of proteins to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, Bedfordshire, United Kingdom), HIF-1&#x003b1; specific bands were detected by reaction with a rabbit antibody against HIF-1&#x003b1; (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham, Freiburg, Germany). Immunoblots were stripped using mild antibody stripping solution and re-probed with an anti-actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.).

Consistent with a role for HIF-1&#x003b1; in this process, transfection with siRNA specific for this gene significantly restored normal pH and decreased lactate levels compared to a scrambled siRNA control. However, under normoxia, over-expression of HIF-1&#x003b1; in A549 cells led to decreased pH and increased lactate concentration in the culture medium (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Under hypoxic conditions, addition of 2-DG prevented both acidification of the medium and the accumulation of lactate induced by over-expression of HIF-1&#x003b1;.

In contrast, siRNA-mediated suppression of HIF-1&#x003b1; expression rescued A549 cells from apoptotic death induced by hypoxia (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). The pro-apoptotic activity of HIF-1&#x003b1; was effectively countered by the glycolytic inhibitor, 2-DG (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>), as well as by increasing the buffering capacity of the culture medium (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>HIF-1&#x003b1; is a "master" gene controlling the hypoxic response in mammalian cells and thus plays an important role in tumor growth. In this study, we demonstrated that modulating the expression level of HIF-1&#x003b1; was able to increase or decrease apoptosis of a tumor cell line, A549, under hypoxic stress. Furthermore, this effect of HIF-1&#x003b1; was dependent upon the glycolysis pathway and pH changes of the culture medium, both of which appear to be regulated by HIF-1&#x003b1; during hypoxia.</p><p>During hypoxia, transportation of glucose into the cell and glycolytic enzyme activity are enhanced. Consistent with previous studies, we also found that hypoxia up-regulated expression of two key genes in the glycolysis pathway, HK1 and PGK1, as well as a glucose transportation gene, GLUT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. These genes were responsive to the level of HIF-1&#x003b1;, as down-regulation of HIF-1&#x003b1; with siRNA decreased their expression, while up-regulation of HIF-1&#x003b1; with an expression vector similarly increased expression of GLUT1, HK1, and PGK1. Taken together, our results indicate that the expression of key genes controlling glucose transportation and glycolysis are under the control of HIF-1&#x003b1; during hypoxia. Furthermore, over-expression HIF-1&#x003b1; in hypoxic A549 cells resulted in increased accumulation of lactate and decreased pH in the culture medium. When HIF-1&#x003b1; expression was inhibited with siRNA during hypoxia in the converse experiment, lactate levels instead decreased, accompanied by a restoration of normal pH in the culture medium. As lactate is the final product of glycolysis, increased glycolysis is expected to lead to acidosis of cell culture medium during hypoxia. Therefore, lactate accumulation and acidic pH may be an indicator of increased glycolytic activity. Thus, based on the result showing that HIF-1&#x003b1; regulates the expression of genes involved in both glucose transportation and glycolysis described above, we conclude that HIF-1&#x003b1; regulates the glycolysis pathway of A549 cells during hypoxia.</p><p>It is important to note that in another model, hypoxic rat cardiomyocytes, glucose-uptake and metabolism was found to be protective against hypoxia-induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In that study, glycolysis was shown to account for the protective effects, but other metabolic substrates provided no such protection from apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In contrast to this, the study presented here found that HIF-1&#x003b1; contributes to up-regulation of the glycolysis pathway of A549 cells during hypoxia. Furthermore, this increased metabolic activity leads to hypoxia-induced apoptosis in this lung cancer cell line. Although HIF-1&#x003b1; was found to be protective against hypoxia-induced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes, we instead found that increased HIF-1&#x003b1; expression further exacerbated apoptosis in A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells. We also found that inhibition of glycolysis with 2-DG attenuated HIF-1&#x003b1;-induced apoptosis in these cells during hypoxia. Both increased glycolysis and the resulting apoptosis could be inhibited by knocking-down HIF-1&#x003b1; expression with siRNA. Together, our results strongly implicate HIF-1&#x003b1; in the hypoxia-induced apoptosis of A549 cells, which depends on the glycolysis pathway and acidosis of the culture medium.</p><p>Despite examples to the contrary, this effect is not entirely unprecedented. In another relevant study, Schmaltz et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] reported that apoptosis in hypoxic cultures was primarily due to decreased pH of the culture medium, most likely caused by lactic acidosis. Here, we also observed that decreased pH triggered apoptosis in A549 cells. We were able to partially inhibit HIF-1&#x003b1;-induced apoptosis by increasing the buffering capacity of the medium to reduce acidosis. Further pointing to a role for HIF-1&#x003b1; in these processes, siRNA-knockdown of HIF-1&#x003b1; significantly blocked by the decrease of pH and apoptosis induced by hypoxia.</p><p>Consistent with our results, Krick et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] recently reported that hypoxia suppressed alveolar epithelial cell proliferation and enhanced alveolar type II cell apoptosis through activation of the HIF-1&#x003b1;/HRE axis and BNIP3, but they did not further investigate the role of acidosis in the action of BNIP3. Kubasiak et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], however, demonstrated that BNIP3 protein accumulated more rapidly under acidic pH and peaked at a significantly higher level than at neutral pH when cells were exposed to hypoxia. Acidosis was found to increase binding of BNIP3 to mitochondrial membranes, leading to apoptosis of hypoxic cells.</p><p>Taken together, when the cells are exposed to hypoxia, up-regulated expression of HIF-1&#x003b1; accelerates the glycolysis, which leads to the intracellular acidosis. Intracellular acidosis may activate the BNIP3 and promoted the hypoxic cell apoptosis. But this mechanism of HIF-1&#x003b1; on the hypoxia induced cell apoptosis needs further studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings indicate that HIF-1&#x003b1; plays a role in hypoxia-induced A549 apoptosis, and that this influence is dependent upon up-regulation of the glycolysis pathway and the resultant drop in pH of the culture medium.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>FML conceived of the experiments, carried out all experiments and prepared the manuscript.

A549 cells were cultured on cover slides and transfected with different plasmids. Cells were allowed to recover in regular culture medium for 20 h after transfection, then exposed to normoxic or hypoxic atmosphere for 24 h with or without HEPES (25 mM) or the glycolytic inhibitor, 2-DG (5 mM) (n = 5 in each group). Only occasional normoxic cells were positive for TUNEL staining, (A). Hypoxia increased the amount of apoptosis of A549 cells, (D). Over-expression of HIF-1&#x003b1; further increased this pro-apoptotic effect of hypoxia, (F). However, siRNA suppression of HIF-1&#x003b1; expression rescued A549 cells from hypoxia-induced apoptosis, (C); but scrambled siRNA did not have this effect, (E). The pro-apoptotic effect of HIF-1&#x003b1; was also inhibited by the glycolytic inhibitor, 2-DG, (G). Increasing the buffering capacity of the culture medium with HEPES also inhibited the pro-apoptotic effect of HIF-1&#x003b1;, (H). Shown are representative photomicrographs from five independent experiments. Figure 9 was statistics of the five independent experiments. <italic>siRNA: A549 cells transfected HIF-1&#x003b1; siRNA vector, Mock: mock-transfected, HIF: A549 cells transfected with HIF-1&#x003b1; expression plasmid, HIF+2-DG: Cells transfected with HIF-1&#x003b1; expression plasmid and cultured with 2-DG, HIF+HEPES: Cells transfected with HIF-1&#x003b1; expression plasmid and cultured with medium containing HEPES.
