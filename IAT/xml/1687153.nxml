The conclusion that SPF45 functions in the DNA-repair pathway is strengthened by finding both genetic and physical interactions between SPF45 and RAD201, a previously uncharacterized member of the RecA/Rad51 protein family.

In this article, Chaouki and Salz focus on SPF45, a protein that, at first glance, appears to break this rule. Although the sequence of SPF45 is highly conserved, in animals cells SPF45 functions as a splicing factor, but in plant cells it functions as a DNA repair protein. This functional discrepancy is resolved here through the demonstration that, in <italic>D. melanogaster,</italic> SPF45 is a bifunctional protein with independent functions in DNA repair and splicing. Support for this conclusion includes the observation that mutant animals lacking SPF45 function display defects in both splicing and DNA repair. In addition, the authors show that SPF45 associates with two distinct groups of proteins; those that participate in RNA splicing and those that participate in DNA repair. The finding that the <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> protein is bifunctional suggests that the human protein may also have more than one function.

While for the most part the convergence of information from multiple systems points to a single function, occasionally this information leads to disparate cellular roles. Without additional functional studies, it is difficult to establish whether the conservation of sequence through evolution reflects mechanistic conservation, implying that the protein has more than one purpose, or, alternatively, that there has been significant divergence of function over time. One particularly interesting example is SPF45, because although its protein sequence shows significant conservation between plants and animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020178-g001">Figure 1</xref>), its function is not thought to be conserved. In animals, SPF45 is identified as a splicing protein, while in plants it is labeled as a DNA-repair protein. The similarity in sequence between humans, flies, and plants is especially striking within the G-patch domain and the RNA-recognition motif (RRM). These two domains are often, but not exclusively, found in proteins that function in RNA processing. Indeed, the specificities of these domains appear to be quite diverse, with RNA-, single-stranded&#x02013;DNA-, and protein-binding capabilities &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020178-b001">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020178-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, while the SPF45 protein contains domains that are considered canonical hallmarks of an RNA-binding protein, the actual substrate diversity of these domains is consistent with the possibility that SPF45 has two independent functions.</p><p>The classification of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Arabidopsis thaliana</named-content> SPF45 protein (originally called DRT111) as a DNA-repair protein is based on its ability to rescue the mutagen-sensitive phenotype of the <italic>Escherichia coli recG</italic> mutant &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020178-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;.

Although the mechanism by which expression of the nonhomologous SPF45 gene can functionally complement <italic>recG</italic> is not known, this ill-defined function is likely to have appeared very early in eukaryotic evolution, because the more distantly related SPF45 counterpart from the protozoan parasite <named-content content-type="genus-species">Toxoplasma gondii</named-content> is also capable of restoring function to the same <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> mutant strain &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020178-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. Interestingly, while proteins with homology to SPF45 are present in several different protozoans, SPF45 counterparts are not identifiable in the genomes of the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> or the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe,</italic> raising questions about its evolutionary history.</p><p>There have been no studies to date linking the metazoan SPF45 protein to DNA repair, but there is a substantial body of evidence that suggests a role in RNA splicing. The link between SPF45 and splicing was first made when the protein was identified as a component of the human spliceosome by mass spectrometry &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020178-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;.

Many of these subcomplexes have been purified and a detailed description of the proteomic composition of the spliceosome as it assembles is now available &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020178-b014">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020178-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. In these studies, SPF45 was identified as one of a small group of proteins that associates with the 17S U2 snRNP early in spliceosome assembly &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020178-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;, but then dissociates from the complex as the spliceosome matures and becomes catalytically active &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020178-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020178-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. Consistent with its identity as a U2 snRNP protein, functional studies carried out in HeLa cell extracts have shown that SPF45 plays a role in 3&#x02032; splice&#x02013;site utilization &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020178-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>SPF45&#x02032;s function in splicing is likely to be conserved from humans to flies because studies in <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> tissue-culture cells have suggested that SPF45 plays a role in controlling the alternative splicing of the <italic>Sex-lethal (Sxl)</italic> pre-mRNA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020178-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;.

In males, where <italic>Sxl</italic> must remain off, no full-length protein is produced because the third exon containing translational stop codons is included in the mRNA. In females, where <italic>Sxl</italic> activity is essential, the third exon is skipped, resulting in protein-producing mRNAs. There is considerable genetic and biochemical evidence supporting a model in which <italic>Sxl</italic> negatively regulates splicing of its own pre-mRNA by interrupting the process of spliceosome assembly through interactions with the U1 snRNP on the 5&#x02032; side of the male exon and the U2AF heterodimer on the 3&#x02032; side of the male exon &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020178-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. Although not yet confirmed by genetic studies, SPF45&#x02032;s role in this process appears to be significant, as depletion of SPF45 by RNAi has a negative impact on the efficiency of male-exon skipping in tissue-culture cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020178-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;.

Thus, we estimate that at a minimum <italic>Df(2Lh)D1</italic> deletes 80 kb of DNA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020178-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>Df(2Lh)D1</italic> also fails to complement <italic>l(2)40Fd</italic>, <italic>l(2)40Ff,</italic> and <italic>l(2)40Fe,</italic> three previously identified lethal mutations that have not yet been linked to specific coding sequences &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020178-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. To saturate the region for lethal alleles, we carried out an additional screen for lethal mutations that fail to complement <italic>Df(2Lh)D1.</italic> In our screen of &#x0223c;9,000 EMS-treated chromosomes, we identified seven additional alleles of <italic>l(2)40Fd</italic> and one additional allele of <italic>l(2)40Ff,</italic> but no novel lethal-complementation groups. Thus, we conclude that the genomic region deleted in <italic>Df(2Lh)D1</italic> contains three genes that mutate to lethality. None of the three complementation groups, however, is likely to correspond to SPF45, because 1) they do not contain mutations within the SPF45-coding sequence, 2) the lethal phenotypes are not rescued by <italic>P&#x0007b;spf45&#x0002b;&#x0007d;</italic>, a transgene carrying 3.1 kb of genomic DNA that contains only the <italic>spf45</italic> transcription unit, and 3) each lethal allele complements both the mutagen sensitivity and <italic>Sxl</italic> splicing defective phenotypes of <italic>spf45<sup>J23</sup></italic> described below (unpublished data). Together, these data lead us to the tentative conclusion that loss of <italic>spf45</italic> function does not result in lethality.</p><p>To continue investigating the function of SPF45, we focused our analysis on <italic>spf45<sup>J23</sup>,</italic> a viable and fertile allele that retains 1 kb of the <italic>P-element</italic> insertion located within the coding sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020178-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Based on its sequence, <italic>spf45<sup>J23</sup></italic> is predicted to encode a truncated protein of 37 kD, containing the first 312 amino acids of SPF45 followed by an additional three amino acids of novel sequence. As predicted, we find that on Western blots the wild-type protein migrates at about 45 kD and the SPF45<sup>J23</sup> migrates at about 37 kD in extracts made from adult flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020178-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Unlike the wild-type protein, the truncated SPF45<sup>J23</sup> protein could only be detected in adult extracts and not in extracts made from embryos (unpublished data).</p><p>The truncated SPF45<sup>J23</sup> protein is missing the majority of its conserved RRM-like motif, a domain that can mediate protein&#x02013;protein interactions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020178-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. We therefore tested whether this motif can mediate the interaction with U2A&#x02032; in the yeast two-hybrid assay. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020178-g002">Figure 2</xref>D, we find that expression of the RRM-like motif alone (amino acids 304&#x02013;403) is sufficient to mediate the interaction with U2A&#x02032; and that a partial deletion of this region (identical to the endogenous SPF45<sup>J23</sup> protein) abolishes the interaction. To investigate whether the association between SPF45<sup>J23</sup> and the U2 snRNP is compromised in vivo, we asked whether the endogenous wild-type or mutant SPF45 protein could associate with the core U2 snRNP protein, SNF, in extracts made from wild-type and <italic>spf45<sup>J23</sup></italic> mutant embryos. In these co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we failed to detect an interaction between SPF45<sup>J23</sup> and SNF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020178-g002">Figure 2</xref>E). While it is possible that the relatively low abundance of the mutant protein in embryonic extracts could explain why an interaction is not detected, given the sensitivity of the assay, we think it more likely that without an intact RRM-like motif, SPF45<sup>J23</sup> does not form a stable association with the U2 snRNP.</p><p>Our genetic studies, described in more detail below, also suggest that this truncated protein is likely to be nonfunctional, because in all cases the mutant phenotype of <italic>spf45<sup>J23</sup>/Df(2Lh)D1</italic> was no more severe than the phenotype of <italic>spf45<sup>J23</sup></italic> homozygous mutant animals. Together, these studies lead us to conclude that <italic>spf45<sup>J23</sup></italic> eliminates <italic>spf45</italic> function and that the loss of <italic>spf45</italic> function does not cause lethality. Given that the U2 snRNP is integral to the splicing reaction, our finding that <italic>spf45<sup>J23</sup></italic> mutant animals are viable and fertile argues that SPF45 is not essential for the role of U2 snRNP in general splicing. While it remains possible that disruption of the functions attributed to SPF45 from in vitro splicing assays and cell-culture studies are simply not important in the animal, we suggest instead that the impact of depleting SPF45 on its physiologically important targets does not lead to lethality. Support for this view comes from our more detailed analysis of the <italic>spf45</italic> mutant phenotype, described below.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>SPF45 Influences the Efficiency of <italic>Sxl</italic> Male Exon Skipping</title><p>Previous studies in <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> tissue-culture cells have established that a reduction in <italic>spf45</italic> levels has a dramatic effect on the efficiency of <italic>Sxl</italic> male exon skipping &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020178-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. We therefore anticipated that <italic>spf45</italic> mutations might have a significant effect on the efficiency of <italic>Sxl</italic> male exon skipping in a genetically sensitized background. We have previously shown that embryos heterozygous for the normally recessive null allele of <italic>Sxl</italic> (<italic>Sxl<sup>f1</sup>/&#x0002b;</italic>) provide a sensitized background in which to assay for splicing defects &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020178-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020178-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;. Our studies have shown that <italic>Sxl<sup>f1</sup>/&#x0002b;</italic> heterozygous embryos are particularly sensitive to the supply of specific splicing proteins deposited into the egg by the mother. If maternally provided SPF45 protein is important for <italic>Sxl</italic> male exon skipping, then we would expect a reduction in exon skipping and protein production in the <italic>Sxl<sup>f1</sup>/&#x0002b;</italic> daughters of <italic>spf45<sup>J23</sup></italic> homozygous mutant mothers. Because we expect that a major reduction in <italic>Sxl</italic> male exon skipping will result in female lethality, we first assayed the survival rate of <italic>Sxl<sup>f1</sup>/&#x0002b;</italic> daughters of <italic>spf45<sup>J23</sup></italic> homozygous mutant mothers compared with controls. As expected, we found a significant impact on survival, with only 4&#x00025; of the expected <italic>Sxl<sup>f1</sup>/&#x0002b;</italic> daughters surviving (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020178-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). Restoration of female viability by the genomic rescue construct, <italic>P&#x0007b;spf45&#x0002b;&#x0007d;</italic>, indicates that this female-lethal synergistic interaction is due to the loss of <italic>spf45</italic> function.</p><p>To determine whether this synergistic female lethality is correlated with an increase in <italic>Sxl</italic> male exon inclusion, we assayed <italic>Sxl</italic> splicing using an X-linked reporter construct that is known from previous studies to faithfully reproduce the endogenous splicing pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020178-g003">Figure 3</xref>B) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020178-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020178-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. Linkage to the X chromosome allows us to produce a population of embryos in which females carry the reporter construct and males do not. For example, when RNA is isolated from embryos collected from <italic>spf45<sup>J23</sup></italic> homozygous mutant females crossed to males carrying the X-linked reporter construct, only the female <italic>Sxl</italic>-reporter spliced product is detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020178-g003">Figure 3</xref>C, lane 3). In sharp contrast to the above results, when embryos are collected from the same <italic>spf45<sup>J23</sup></italic> mothers crossed to males carrying the X-linked <italic>Sxl<sup>f1</sup></italic> null allele and the reporter construct, the vast majority of the spliced products that are detected contain the male-specific exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020178-g003">Figure 3</xref>C, lane 4). The female lethality and switch in splicing pattern observed in this sensitized background indicate that <italic>spf45</italic> contributes to the efficiency of <italic>Sxl</italic> male exon skipping.</p><p>Based on these studies, we conclude that <italic>Sxl</italic> is a physiologically important target of SPF45, in agreement with the conclusions drawn from RNA-interference knock-down experiments in tissue-culture cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020178-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. By carrying out this analysis in <italic>D. melanogaster,</italic> we were able to establish that depletion of <italic>spf45</italic> in an otherwise wild-type background does not have an impact on survival of the animal, and only becomes essential when the pathway leading to male exon skipping is otherwise compromised.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>SPF45 Is Required for DNA Repair</title><p>Having provided definitive evidence that <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> SPF45 plays a role in pre-mRNA splicing, we wanted to test whether the other function ascribed to this protein is also conserved. A role for SPF45 in DNA repair was suggested by the observation that expression of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. thaliana</named-content> SPF45 protein in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> partially rescues the mutagen sensitivity of the <italic>recG</italic> mutant strain &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020178-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. The <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> RecG protein is a helicase that functions in recovery from DNA damage by resolving the Holliday-junction structures generated during the repair process. In studies that parallel those of Pang et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020178-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;, we find that expression of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> SPF45 protein in <italic>E. coli recG</italic> mutants confers a moderate, but statistically significant, resistance to the DNA alkylating agent, MMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020178-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). Furthermore, we found expression of the mutant SPF45<sup>J23</sup> protein in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> fails to provide any protection, indicating that the SPF45<sup>J23</sup> mutant protein is nonfunctional in this assay. Thus, in a manner analogous to the plant protein, <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> SPF45 either functionally replaces or somehow allows for bypass of the function provided by the RecG helicase.</p><p>The finding that SPF45 is capable of functional rescue in a heterologous system begs the question of relevance. To ascertain whether SPF45 is required for DNA repair in <italic>D. melanogaster,</italic> we tested whether the loss of SPF45 function rendered the flies sensitive to DNA damage induced by feeding MMS to mutant larvae. Previous studies have shown that while wild-type larvae can cope with the damage induced by low levels of MMS, animals mutant for genes required for DNA repair fail to recover and die &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020178-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020178-g004">Figure 4</xref>B, we found that in contrast to control animals, <italic>spf45<sup>J23</sup></italic>-mutant animals did not survive exposure to MMS. Importantly, the MMS-sensitive phenotype of these animals is rescued by the genomic rescue construct, <italic>P&#x0007b;spf45&#x0002b;&#x0007d;,</italic> indicating that the mutagen sensitivity is in fact due to the loss of <italic>spf45</italic> function. Based on these observations, we conclude that <italic>spf45</italic> function is required to promote DNA repair.</p><p>To further establish this point, we tested whether <italic>spf45</italic> is required to repair the damage created during transposition of a <italic>P-element</italic> transposable element. Since the failure to repair damaged DNA can lead to cell death, we expect the loss of <italic>spf45</italic> function to adversely affect the recovery of animals that have successfully repaired the break caused by <italic>P-element</italic> transposition. We tested this prediction using a recently described assay in which the fate of a single X-linked <italic>P&#x0007b;w<sup>a</sup>&#x0007d;</italic> transposable element can be followed by changes in eye color &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020178-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. In this assay, the recovery of red-eyed female progeny is diagnostic of successful DNA repair by a homologous recombination mechanism called synthesis-dependent strand-annealing. In our wild-type background, 7&#x00025; (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 827) of the progeny have red eyes. Progeny with yellow eyes, on the other hand, indicate the use of other repair pathways, including nonhomologous end joining or incomplete synthesis-dependent strand-annealing repair. In our wild-type background, 3&#x00025; of the female progeny (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 827) had yellow eyes. In contrast to our control studies, only 2.4&#x00025; of the female progeny from <italic>spf45</italic> mutants had red eyes and 1.2&#x00025; had yellow eyes (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 1156). Thus, in the <italic>spf45</italic> mutant, the overall rate of recoverable events is reduced from 10&#x00025; to 3.6&#x00025;, suggesting that the defective protein abrogates effective repair of the DNA breaks induced during transposition.</p><p>Programmed DNA breaks and their subsequent repair are a necessary part of meiotic recombination, thus raising the question of whether <italic>spf45</italic> also functions in the resolution of meiotic recombination intermediates. To answer this question, we measured the frequency of X-chromosome nondisjunction, because recombination is part of the mechanism that ensures the accurate segregation of homologous chromosomes, and mutations that interfere with recombination also display high levels of chromosome nondisjunction. In this assay, however, <italic>spf45<sup>J23</sup></italic>-mutant animals have an &#x0223c;0.3&#x00025; level of nondisjunction, which is no higher than the level observed in wild-type animals (unpublished data). Based on these data, we conclude that SPF45 does not play a role in repairing the breaks generated during meiotic recombination.</p><p>Based on these studies, we conclude that <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> SPF45 plays a significant role in the pathway leading to repair of exogenously induced DNA damage, without being essential for repair of programmed DNA damage.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Genetic and Physical Interactions between SPF45 and RAD201, a RecA/Rad51 Family Member</title><p>Given that mutations in <italic>spf45</italic> have a classical mutagen-sensitive phenotype, we wondered whether additional <italic>spf45</italic> mutant alleles might be found in collections of viable, mutagen-sensitive mutations that map to the second chromosome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020178-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. We therefore carried out complementation tests with representative alleles of 18 different second-chromosome genes with MMS-sensitive mutant phenotypes. Mutations in only one gene, <italic>rad201,</italic> failed to complement the mutagen-sensitive phenotype of <italic>spf45<sup>J23</sup></italic> (unpublished data). Upon further analysis, we found nothing unusual about this interaction; the failure to complement is not dependent on which allelic combinations are used, and the addition of the <italic>P&#x0007b;spf45&#x0002b;&#x0007d;</italic> genomic construct fully rescues the mutagen-sensitive phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020178-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). Nevertheless, it seemed unlikely that <italic>rad201</italic> was a bona fide mutant allele of <italic>spf45</italic> for three reasons. First, previous studies had mapped <italic>rad201</italic> to the right arm of Chromosome 2 (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.flybase.org">http://www.flybase.org</ext-link>), whereas SPF45 maps to the left arm. Second, sequencing of the <italic>rad201<sup>1</sup></italic> and <italic>rad201<sup>ZII670</sup></italic> mutant strains did not identify any mutations in the <italic>spf45</italic> coding sequence (unpublished data). Third, <italic>rad201</italic> mutations, by themselves, or in combination with <italic>spf45<sup>J23</sup></italic>, have no impact on female viability, even in a sensitized background, suggesting that <italic>rad201</italic> does not contribute to the efficiency of <italic>Sxl</italic> male exon skipping (unpublished data).</p><p>We conclude, therefore, that we have uncovered an example of intergenic or second-site noncomplementation. This interaction is quite specific; mutations in other splicing factors, such as <italic>snf, U2A</italic>&#x02032;, <italic>U2AF38,</italic> and <italic>U1-70K</italic>, all complement the mutagen-sensitive phenotype of <italic>rad201<sup>1</sup></italic> (unpublished data). Finding that mutations at two different loci fail to complement each other in an allele-independent manner, as is the case here, raises the possibility that both genes have functions that impact on a common pathway, i.e., DNA repair.</p><p><italic>rad201</italic> maps close to CG2412, a member of the RecA/Rad51 protein family. The possibility that RAD201 might belong to a RAD51/RECA protein family is particularly intriguing, because all members of this protein family have clear, albeit distinct, roles in repairing DNA damage, and others have in fact suggested that <italic>rad201</italic> might be encoded by CG2412 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020178-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020178-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;, even though <italic>rad201</italic> was initially reported to correspond to the adjacent gene, CG8016 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.flybase.org">http://www.flybase.org</ext-link>). We therefore sequenced the open reading frames of both genes in <italic>rad201<sup>1</sup></italic> homozygotes. Whereas we did not detect any mutation causing base-pair changes in CG8016, we did identify a single nucleotide substitution in CG2412 that resulted in the conversion of proline to leucine at position 95 (CCC&#x02192;CTC, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020178-g005">Figure 5</xref>B), a region of the protein that is highly conserved between <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila pseudoobscura</named-content>. Although no mutations were identified in <italic>rad201<sup>ZII670</sup></italic>, we are confident that <italic>rad201</italic> corresponds to CG2412, because, as we show below, the protein encoded by CG2412 interacts with SPF45. We shall therefore refer to CG2412 as <italic>rad201</italic>.</p><p>What is the molecular basis of intergenic noncomplementation? Given that SPF45 is a component of the spliceosome, we first considered the possibility that mutations in <italic>spf45</italic> might have a detrimental effect on <italic>rad201</italic> gene expression by reducing the efficiency of splicing for one or both introns. To investigate this possibility, we analyzed the RNA products of the <italic>rad201</italic> gene in <italic>spf45<sup>J23</sup></italic> mutants using RT&#x02013;PCR followed by sequence analysis. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020178-g005">Figure 5</xref>B, we detected no differences in <italic>rad201</italic> splicing between wild-type and <italic>spf45</italic> mutant animals. The failure of <italic>spf45</italic> to complement <italic>rad201</italic> mutants therefore is unlikely to arise from a reduction in <italic>rad201</italic> gene expression caused by a splicing defect.</p><p>Other examples of intergenic noncomplementation have been described between mutations in genes whose products function within the same multiprotein complex (e.g., &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020178-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;). To explore this possibility, we asked whether the RAD201 and SPF45 proteins are capable of forming a complex in whole-cell extracts. Since antibodies against the fly RAD201 protein are not available, complex formation was assayed by pull-down experiments in which a GST::RAD201 fusion protein was expressed in bacteria, bound to glutathione sepharose beads, and incubated with protein extracts made from embryos. The presence or absence of SPF45 in the complexes formed on the beads was assayed by Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020178-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). In control studies, we used a GST::U2A&#x02032; fusion protein, since it is known to form a complex with SPF45. Using this assay, we found that GST::RAD201, but not GST alone, was capable of selecting SPF45 out of extracts as efficiently as its known partner protein, GST::U2A&#x02032;. Furthermore, even though GST::U2A&#x02032; can select SNF from extracts, the formation of a GST::RAD201/SNF complex is not detectable, suggesting that RAD201 does not interact with SPF45 in the context of the spliceosome. To further establish this point, we carried out these experiments in the presence of RNase to digest the snRNAs present in the extract. This treatment disrupts the SNF-U2A&#x02032; interaction, but RAD201 and SPF45 were found to interact in an RNA-independent manner. Thus, it is clear that there are both genetic and physical interactions between SPF45 and RAD201. Collectively, these findings further support the conclusion that SPF45 is a bifunctional protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Concluding Remarks</title><p>The repair of damaged DNA and splicing of newly transcribed RNA both require the cooperative functions of many different proteins for the selection and positioning of the nucleic-acid substrate for enzymatic processing. Thus, one might imagine that there will be proteins that function in both pathways, and we would suggest that SPF45 is such a protein. While studies directly investigating whether the vertebrate SPF45 protein also functions in DNA repair have not been carried out, recent gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies in human cancer&#x02013;cell lines are suggestive. In these studies, a reduction in SPF45 expression in A2780 cells, an ovarian carcinoma cell line, resulted in chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020178-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;.

This analysis revealed a discrepancy between our placement of the intron/exon boundaries and the electronically annotated gene structure of the Berkeley <italic>Drosophila</italic> Genome Project (Annotation Release Version 4.3). Our data indicate that the open reading frame begins in exon 1 (sequence coordinates: 4,677,548&#x02013;4,677,798), continues through exon 2 (4,677,858&#x02013;4,678,372), and ends in exon 3 (4,678,435&#x02013;4,678,679).
