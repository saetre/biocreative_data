For instance, tri-methylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4) strongly correlates with transcriptional activity and is regulated by the Bur1/2 kinase complex. We found that the evolutionarily conserved Ccr4-Not complex is involved in establishing H3K4 tri-methylation in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. We observed synthetic lethal interactions of Ccr4-Not components with <italic>BUR1</italic> and <italic>BUR2</italic>. Further analysis indicated that the genes encoding the Not-proteins are essential for efficient regulation of H3K4me3, but not H3K4me1/2, H3K36me2 or H3K79me2/3 levels. Moreover, regulation of H3K4me3 levels by <italic>NOT4</italic> is independent of defects in RNA polymerase II loading. We found <italic>NOT4</italic> to be important for ubiquitylation of histone H2B via recruitment of the PAF complex, but not for recruitment or activation of the Bur1/2 complex. These results suggest a mechanism in which the Ccr4-Not complex functions parallel to or downstream of the Bur1/2 kinase to facilitate H3K4me3 via PAF complex recruitment.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Efficient transcription in eukaryotes requires interplay between the RNA polymerase II (pol II) transcription machinery and factors regulating modification of the chromatin (reviewed in: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Tri-methylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4) occurs co-transcriptionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) and is strongly correlated with transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). H3K4 methylation is mediated by the Set1p histone methyltransferase (HMT) complex in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6 B7">4&#x02013;7</xref>). In recent years, several factors required for this modification have been identified. It is now apparent that ubiquitylation of histone H2B is necessary for methylation of H3K4 by Set1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) and of H3K79 by Dot1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). H2B ubiquitylation is mediated by the Bre1p-Rad6p E3-E2 pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>The Bur1/2 kinase complex is involved in transcription elongation. This CDK&#x02013;cyclin pair can phosphorylate the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of pol II <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), but it does not seem to contribute to CTD phosphorylation <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). This kinase complex is required for H2B ubiquitylation and H3K4 tri-methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), which may involve direct phosphorylation of Rad6p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Interestingly, mono- and di-methylation of H3K4 are not affected by <italic>BUR1/2</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Like the Bur1/2 complex, the PAF complex is implicated in transcription elongation and is essential for efficient H2B ubiquitylation and H3K4 methylation, but not for recruitment of Rad6p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The PAF complex consists of five subunits (Paf1p, Rtf1p, Ctr9p, Leo1p and Cdc73p) and interacts with pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). <italic>BUR2</italic> is required for efficient PAF complex recruitment to chromatin, but the mechanism by which this occurs remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p><p>The evolutionarily conserved Ccr4-Not complex is composed of nine core subunits and is implicated in various steps of mRNA production and processing (reviewed in: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). The genes encoding the Not-proteins (<italic>NOT1-5</italic>) were initially identified as negative regulators of transcription initiation. Support for such a role was provided by the observation that several mutations in <italic>NOT</italic> genes suppress a temperature-sensitive allele of <italic>SRB4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), which encodes an essential subunit of the mediator co-activator complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). However, various reports also indicate a positive role for the Ccr4-Not complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25 B26 B27">25&#x02013;27</xref>). For example, this complex is required for transcription of <italic>RNR</italic> genes following DNA damage or replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Genetic and physical interactions of Ccr4-Not complex components with transcription initiation and elongation factors have been described (reviewed in: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Besides this, Ccr4p and Caf1p represent the major mRNA deadenylases in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).</p><p>To further investigate the role of the Ccr4-Not complex, we performed a genome-wide screen to find non-essential gene deletion mutants that display synthetic genetic interactions with a deletion of <italic>NOT4</italic>. Here, we describe genetic interactions of components of the Ccr4-Not complex with <italic>BUR2</italic> and <italic>BUR1</italic>. We found that the <italic>NOT</italic> genes are required to specifically facilitate tri-methylation, but not mono- or di-methylation, of H3K4. Deletion of <italic>NOT4</italic> reduced both histone H2B ubiquitylation and PAF complex recruitment, but did not affect Bur1/2 activation or recruitment. Taken together, our results show a novel role for the Ccr4-Not complex in chromatin modification and suggest a mechanism by which it contributes to positive regulation of transcription.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast genetics, media and plasmids</title><p>The yeast strains used in this study and their relevant genotypes are indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.

We identified several interactions with genes implicated in transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II (K.W.M., A.I. and H.T.M.T., submitted for publication). Most striking was the interaction between <italic>NOT4</italic> and <italic>BUR2</italic>. Subsequent tetrad analysis of double deletions of <italic>BUR2</italic> and Ccr4-Not components showed additional synthetic lethal interactions with <italic>NOT2</italic> and <italic>CCR4</italic>, but not with <italic>NOT3, CAF40</italic> and <italic>CAF130</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Notably, deletion of the gene encoding Bur1p, the cyclin-dependent kinase partner of Bur2p, results in a strong growth defect and this strain was not represented in the library used for the genetic screen. To test a genetic interaction between <italic>NOT4</italic> and <italic>BUR1</italic> in a direct manner, we introduced a plasmid-based WT or temperature-sensitive mutant of <italic>BUR1</italic> (<italic>bur1-23</italic>) into either <italic>NOT4</italic> or <italic>not4</italic>&#x00394; strains in which the sole copy of <italic>BUR1</italic> was expressed from a <italic>URA3</italic> plasmid (pRS316). Plasmid-shuffle analysis demonstrated synthetic lethality between a deletion of <italic>NOT4</italic> and <italic>bur1-23</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). </p><p>Considering that the Bur1/2 complex was found to play a role in transcription elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), <italic>not4</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>bur2</italic>&#x00394; strains were first tested for sensitivity to 6-AU. In agreement with observations linking the Ccr4-Not complex to transcription elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), cells lacking <italic>NOT4</italic> or <italic>BUR2</italic> were 6-AU sensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). Strikingly, a strict correlation was observed between the 6-AU sensitivity of Ccr4-Not gene deletions and synthetic lethality with <italic>BUR2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). This suggests that this synthetic lethality may be due to defects in transcription elongation. To extend these observations, we investigated requirement of <italic>NOT4</italic> for transcription of a long and GC-rich reporter gene. This experimental setup has previously been used to study transcription elongation defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D shows that in cells lacking <italic>NOT4</italic>, the <italic>GAL1</italic>-promoter-driven LacZ reporter gene was inefficiently transcribed, whereas the endogenous <italic>GAL1</italic> gene was expressed to WT levels. Taken together, these experiments show that Ccr4-Not complex components genetically interact with both <italic>BUR2</italic> and <italic>BUR1</italic> and confirm a role for this complex in transcription elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Efficient H3K4 tri-methylation is dependent on the Ccr4-Not complex</title><p>The Bur1/2 complex is implicated in the regulation of tri-methylation of H3K4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). The genetic interactions between <italic>NOT4, BUR2</italic> and <italic>BUR1</italic> prompted us to investigate the involvement of the Ccr4-Not complex in this process by analyzing global levels of H3K4me1, H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 using specific antibodies. Strains deleted for <italic>NOT4</italic> or <italic>NOT5</italic> displayed a strong reduction of H3K4 tri-methylation, but not of mono- or di-methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). However, deletion of <italic>NOT3, CCR4</italic> or any of the Ccr4-associated factors (<italic>CAF</italic>s) did not give rise to this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). It is worth noting that several <italic>CCR4-NOT</italic> gene deletion phenotypes are not evident in <italic>not3</italic>&#x00394; cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A and data not shown).</p><p>To extend these observations, two mutant alleles of the essential <italic>NOT1</italic> gene and deletions of the other <italic>NOT</italic> genes were analyzed in a different genetic background. Under permissive conditions, both <italic>not1</italic> alleles displayed a clear decrease in overall H3K4me3 levels (50&#x02013;70% reduction as shown by quantification of the results), whereas growth of these cells was not affected. Moreover, deletion of <italic>NOT2, NOT4</italic> or <italic>NOT5</italic> reduced H3K4me3 levels (86&#x02013;94% reduction; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). In contrast, only a slight decrease in H3K4me2 levels was observed in these strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B).

We found that deletion of <italic>NOT4</italic> or <italic>NOT5</italic> resulted in H3K4me3 levels comparable to deletion of <italic>SPP1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). In addition, H3K79me2 and H3K79me3 levels in extracts of <italic>CCR4-NOT</italic> deletion strains were essentially not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D), although a minor decrease in H3K79me2 in cells lacking <italic>NOT5</italic> was observed. As expected, deletion of <italic>RAD6</italic> led to a severe decrease in H3K79me2 and H3K79me3 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>These results suggest a specific requirement for the <italic>NOT</italic> genes for efficient H3K4 tri-methylation.

Dot1p, the HMT specific for methylation of H3K79 plays an important role in silencing of genes near telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>).

This is consistent with the notion that H3K4me3 is not required for telomeric silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>) and our observation that <italic>NOT4</italic> is specifically required for tri-methylation of H3K4.</p><p>Taken together, these results show that the <italic>NOT</italic>-module of the Ccr4-Not complex is essential for efficient H3K4 tri-methylation but not for H3K79 methylation or telomeric silencing.</p></sec><sec><title>H3K4 tri-methylation on the <italic>PYK1</italic> locus is affected by deletion of <italic>NOT4</italic></title><p>To investigate the role of <italic>NOT4</italic> in the regulation of histone H3 methylation on active genes, ChIP experiments on the constitutively active and highly expressed <italic>PYK1</italic> gene were performed using extracts of WT and <italic>not4</italic>&#x00394; cells. Using specific antibodies H3K4me3, H3K4me2, H3K36me2 and H3K79me2 levels at the 5&#x02032; and the middle region of the <italic>PYK1</italic> ORF were examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A&#x02013;E). <italic>Not4</italic>&#x00394; cells displayed a clear decrease in the level of H3K4me3&#x02009;at the 5&#x02032; end of the <italic>PYK1</italic> ORF compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B), whereas H3K4me2 levels were much less affected by deletion of <italic>NOT4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). Further analysis showed that H3K36me2 and H3K79me2 levels were not decreased in <italic>not4</italic>&#x00394; cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D and E). In addition, pol II occupancy was determined using antibodies against the CTD of Rpb1p as a measure for transcriptional activity. In parallel, <italic>PYK1</italic> and <italic>TUB1</italic> mRNA levels were measured by quantitative RT-PCR in WT and <italic>not4</italic>&#x00394; cells. Both pol II association to the <italic>PYK1</italic> ORF and <italic>PYK1</italic> transcript levels were diminished in the absence of <italic>NOT4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>F and G). Extending on these results, we determined the H3K4 methylation status of cells deleted for <italic>NOT2</italic>. Indeed, examination of <italic>not2</italic>&#x00394; cells confirmed a requirement for <italic>NOT2</italic> in the regulation of H3K4me3 specifically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>H and I). Notably, essentially identical results were obtained when analyzing the <italic>PGK1</italic> locus (data not shown), in line with a broader role for <italic>NOT4</italic> in regulating H3K4me3 levels. </p><p>To assess the direct involvement of Not4p in the regulation of <italic>PYK1</italic> expression, ChIP analysis using a chromosomally expressed tagged form of <italic>NOT4</italic> was performed. The encoded protein (Not4p-mycAVI) was biotinylated <italic>in vivo</italic> by co-expression of the <italic>E. coli</italic>-derived BirA biotin ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Phenotypic analysis indicated that the Not4p-mycAVI fusion protein was fully functional (data not shown). Streptavidin-coated beads were used to capture the biotinylated Not4 proteins from chromatin extracts of cells containing either a plasmid expressing BirA or an empty vector. Interestingly, Not4p was detected on the 5&#x02032; end of the <italic>PYK1</italic> ORF and the region spanning the TATA box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>J), coinciding with the region targeted for tri-methylation by the Set1p complex (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B and H). Taken together, these ChIP experiments confirm the specificity of the H3K4me3 defect and indicate that Not4p is physically present on the 5&#x02032; region of the <italic>PYK1</italic> ORF. In addition, deletion of <italic>NOT4</italic> resulted in decreased pol II occupancy and transcript levels, suggesting direct regulation of <italic>PYK1</italic> expression by Not4p through tri-methylation of H3K4.</p></sec><sec><title>Decreased H3K4me3 levels in cells deleted for <italic>NOT4</italic> does not strictly correlate with a decrease in RNA polymerase II association</title><p>The exact mechanism of recruitment of the Set1 complex to transcribing polymerase is not fully understood. However, it has been suggested that phosphorylation of serine 2 and 5 of the hepta-peptide repeat of the CTD of RNA pol II is important for this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). In this light, the global decrease of H3K4me3 in cells lacking <italic>NOT4</italic> could be a consequence of a global loss of RNA pol II CTD phosphorylation. Immunoblot analysis using antibodies against phosphorylated serine 2, serine 5 or total RNA pol II (H5, H14 and 8WG16, respectively) did not reveal a decrease of phosphorylation of these residues in extracts from WT and <italic>not4</italic>&#x00394; cells (data not shown). This indicates that the role of <italic>NOT4</italic> in regulating H3K4me3 levels is independent of RNA pol II phosphorylation. Arguably, the loss of H3K4 tri-methylation could be a consequence, rather than a cause, of decreased RNA pol II recruitment. To address this issue we investigated the <italic>HSP104</italic> gene, which allowed determination of the level of H3K4me3 on a gene that is not decreased in transcription in <italic>not4</italic>&#x00394; cells (data not shown). We observed a decrease of H3K4 tri-methylation of the promoter region of <italic>HSP104</italic>, albeit less pronounced than what was observed for <italic>PYK1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). In addition, we found a small increase in RNA pol II occupancy, which is in line with a slightly increased transcription rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A and data not shown). Indeed, previous observations suggest that H3K4 methylation is not a critical determinant of <italic>HSP</italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). In conclusion, this result shows that a decrease in H3K4me3 in <italic>not4</italic>&#x00394; cells is not a consequence of decreased RNA pol II association <italic>per se</italic>. </p><p>To further investigate the role of H3K4me3 in transcription, we compared the levels of H3K4me3 on the <italic>PYK1</italic> locus in WT, <italic>not4</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>spp1</italic>&#x00394; cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, this modification is decreased by deletion of <italic>NOT4</italic> or <italic>SPP1</italic> to comparable levels. In addition, deletion of <italic>SPP1</italic> gave rise to a decrease in mRNA levels reminiscent of deletion of <italic>NOT4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). Similar reductions of mRNA levels were observed for the <italic>PGK1</italic> gene (data not shown). This suggests that the diminished <italic>PYK1</italic> and <italic>PGK1</italic> mRNA levels are a consequence of decreased H3K4 tri-methylation. Taken together, these experiments show that the reduction of H3K4me3 levels in <italic>not4</italic>&#x00394; cells is not a direct result of reduced RNA pol II association.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>NOT4</italic> is not required for HMT activity of the Set1p complex</title><p>The observed effect on H3K4me3 levels in <italic>not4</italic>&#x00394; cells could be the result of <italic>NOT4</italic> being required for transcription of genes encoding factors essential for Set1p complex integrity or activity. For instance, deletion of <italic>SPP1</italic> results in the formation of a Set1p complex that is unable to tri-methylate H3K4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). We investigated this by purifying the Set1p complex from WT and <italic>not4</italic>&#x00394; strains via a TAP-tagged version of the Bre2p subunit. In addition, we tested mRNA expression levels of Set1p complex subunits by northern blot analysis in strains containing or lacking <italic>NOT4</italic>. This indicated that neither transcript levels of its subunits nor composition of the Set1p complex are significantly affected by deletion of <italic>NOT4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A and B). Notably, the additional bands present in the purification from <italic>not4</italic>&#x00394; cells were found to be non-specific lysosomal proteins (data not shown), which probably relates to differences in protein concentration between the extracts from WT or <italic>not4</italic>&#x00394; cells. Using soluble histones as substrate in an <italic>in vitro</italic> HMT assay, no intrinsic defect in the methylation activity of Set1p complexes purified from <italic>not4</italic>&#x00394; cells could be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). In addition, (pre-methylated) synthetic peptides were used to determine whether Set1 complexes purified from <italic>not4</italic>&#x00394; cells were active in tri-methylation of a di-methylated substrate. Notably, Set1 complexes from WT and <italic>not4</italic>&#x00394; cells were equally efficient in modifying this synthetic peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D). </p><p>Taken together, these experiments show that the mechanism underlying the H3K4me3 defect in <italic>not4</italic>&#x00394; cells is distinct from deregulation of the Set1p complex at the level of transcription, composition or intrinsic activity and specificity.</p></sec><sec><title>Deletion of <italic>NOT4</italic> reduces ubiquitylation of histone H2B and recruitment of the PAF complex</title><p>H2B ubiquitylation is required for efficient H3K4 methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). To investigate the role of Not4p in ubiquitylation of H2B, plasmid-based FLAG-tagged H2B was expressed in <italic>not4</italic>&#x00394; cells. Ubiquitylated H2B could be detected in logarithmically growing WT cells, but H2B-ubiquitin levels were significantly decreased in cells lacking <italic>NOT4</italic>. As expected, ubiquitylated H2B could not be detected in cells expressing FLAG-tagged H2B-K123R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Interestingly, Not4p contains a RING-finger motif and displays ubiquitylation activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (K.W.M., A.I. and H.T.M.T., submitted for publication). Therefore, the H3K4me3 status was determined in cells expressing an inactive (L35A) mutant of Not4p as a measure for H2B ubiquitylation. The H3K4me3 defect of <italic>not4</italic>&#x00394; cells was fully complemented by the L35A mutant of Not4p, suggesting that its RING-finger is not required for ubiquitylation of H2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). In addition, <italic>in vitro</italic> ubiquitylation assays indicated that H2B does not serve as a substrate for Not4p (data not shown). </p><p><italic>In vivo</italic>, H2B ubiquitylation is dependent on recruitment of the PAF complex to chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). To assess the role of Not4p in the recruitment of the PAF complex, strains expressing HA-tagged Ctr9p and containing or lacking <italic>NOT4</italic> were constructed. Ctr9-HA was expressed to equal levels in the two strains, whereas H3K4me3 levels were reduced in the <italic>not4</italic>&#x00394; cells as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C). Extracts were prepared from exponentially growing cells and subjected to ChIP analysis. Whereas Ctr9-HA was readily detected in the ORFs of <italic>PYK1</italic> and <italic>PGK1</italic> in WT cells, binding was severely reduced in cells lacking <italic>NOT4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D and E). Taken together, these results show a requirement for <italic>NOT4</italic> in H2B ubiquitylation and a role in the regulation of PAF complex recruitment to the <italic>PYK1</italic> and <italic>PGK1</italic> genes to facilitate tri-methylation of H3K4.</p></sec><sec><title>The Ccr4-Not complex functions parallel to or downstream of the Bur1/2 kinase</title><p>Chromatin association of the PAF complex depends on the Bur1/2 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). The requirement for <italic>NOT4</italic> for efficient PAF complex recruitment places the Ccr4-Not complex in the pathway containing the Bur1/2 kinase. To investigate this further, strains expressing HA-tagged Bur1p or Bur2p, containing or lacking <italic>NOT4</italic>, were constructed to determine occupancy of Bur1p and Bur2p. Expression of the HA-tagged versions of Bur1p and Bur2p was equal between WT and <italic>not4</italic>&#x00394; cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). ChIP analysis with these strains showed that both Bur1p and Bur2p were found to associate with the <italic>PYK1</italic> and <italic>PGK1</italic> loci with similar efficiencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B and C). In addition, <italic>NOT4</italic> is not required for the activation of the Bur1p kinase since the active phosphorylated form of Bur1p is readily detected in cells lacking <italic>NOT4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). These results place the Ccr4-Not complex parallel to, or downstream of the Bur1/2 kinase and upstream of the PAF complex in a pathway leading to H3K4 tri-methylation. </p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The Ccr4-Not complex is involved in mRNA biogenesis at different levels (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Here, we show that the <italic>NOT</italic> genes, in contrast to <italic>CCR4</italic> and the <italic>CAF</italic> genes, are required for global and gene-specific tri-methylation of H3K4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). In addition, we found that the Ccr4-Not complex is functionally linked to the Bur1/2 kinase complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), which is also specifically required for H3K4 tri-methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). The mechanism by which the Ccr4-Not complex is involved in this histone modification is independent of direct regulation of the Set1p histone methyltransferase complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Instead, the Ccr4-Not complex functions parallel to or downstream of Bur1/2p at the level of PAF complex recruitment, resulting in decreased ubiquitylation of H2B, in cells lacking <italic>NOT4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). Taken together, our results provide a detailed study of the role of the Ccr4-Not complex in the regulation of global H3K4 tri-methylation. Further, they confirm a functional distinction between the cytoplasmic deadenylase activity of the Ccr4p-Caf1p module and the nuclear function of the Not-proteins of the Ccr4-Not complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). </p><sec><title>Cooperation between the Bur1/2 and Ccr4-Not complexes in establishing H3K4 tri-methylation</title><p>The Bur1/2 complex was shown to be required for H3K4 tri-methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) and this involves phosphorylation of Rad6p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). The genetic interactions between genes encoding Ccr4-Not complex subunits (<italic>NOT2, NOT4</italic> and <italic>CCR4</italic>) and <italic>BUR1</italic> and <italic>BUR2</italic>, suggest a role for this complex in transcription elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Interestingly, deletions of several Ccr4-Not components were shown to exhibit 6-AU sensitivity, suggesting such a role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Notably, a strict correlation between the published 6-AU sensitivity for Ccr4-Not components and synthetic lethality with <italic>BUR2</italic> was observed. Since the Bur1/2 complex was shown to be involved in the regulation of H3K4me3 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), we determined the levels of various histone H3 lysine methylation marks in cells lacking genes encoding Ccr4-Not components. In contrast to the <italic>NOT</italic>-gene deletion strains, decreased H3K4me3 levels were not observed in <italic>ccr4</italic>&#x00394; cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), suggesting that Ccr4p and the Not-module contribute to transcription elongation by distinct mechanisms. An alternative explanation could be that deletion of Ccr4-Not components and <italic>BUR2</italic> results in partial loss of subsequent activities within the same pathway, ultimately resulting in the observed synthetic lethality.</p><p>Insight into the mechanism by which the Not-proteins function in the pathway leading to H3K4 tri-methylation comes from the observations that PAF complex recruitment and subsequent efficient ubiquitylation of H2B, but not Bur1/2 complex recruitment, are dependent on the presence of <italic>NOT4</italic>. However, other modifications such as H3K4 mono- and di-methylation or H3K79 di- and tri-methylation were not affected by deletion of <italic>NOT4</italic>. These results suggest a model in which the pathways leading to H3K4 and H3K79 methylation bifurcate upstream of the Ccr4-Not complex and are in agreement with a recent report showing that <italic>BUR2</italic> is only required for H3K4 tri-methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Alternatively, the residual degree of ubiquitylated H2B that is observed in cells lacking <italic>NOT4</italic> may be sufficient to sustain H3K79me2/3 and H3K4me2, but not H3K4me3 levels. Support for this hypothesis comes from the observation that cells deleted for <italic>PAF1</italic> show significant levels of H3K4 di-methylation but not tri-methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>, data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Regulation of H3K4 tri-methylation by the Ccr4-Not complex and involvement of the PAF complex</title><p>The Set1p complex (or COMPASS) represents the sole HMT for H3K4 in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6">4&#x02013;6</xref>). The observation that transcription, subunit composition, activity and specificity of the Set1p complex are not affected by Not4p suggests that the Ccr4-Not complex functions further upstream in a pathway regulating H3K4 tri-methylation. The finding that Not4p is physically present at the 5&#x02032; region of the <italic>PYK1</italic> ORF, coinciding with the H3K4 tri-methylation mark and the PAF complex, suggests a direct role for the Ccr4-Not complex in the regulation of this modification. Possibly, recruitment of the Ccr4-Not complex to this region aids localization of the H3K4me3 mark. Another important insight into the mechanism by which the Ccr4-Not complex controls H3K4me3 levels comes from the observation that PAF complex recruitment is severely decreased in the absence of <italic>NOT4</italic>, whereas Bur1p and Bur2p recruitment and activation are not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). The Bur1/2 kinase is known to act upstream of PAF complex recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Thus, the Ccr4-Not complex could either act downstream of the Bur1/2 kinase, or in a parallel pathway to regulate PAF complex recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). It is interesting to note that both Not3p and Not5p are phospho-proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>), but the connection with Bur1/2 complex remains unexplored. In the parallel pathway, the Bur1/2 and Ccr4-Not complexes would act independently of each other in the recruitment of the PAF complex to chromatin. Strikingly, deletion of <italic>BUR2</italic> or <italic>NOT4</italic> results in only a partial loss of H2B ubiquitylation, PAF complex recruitment and subsequent H3K4 tri-methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).</p><p>Previous experiments have physically linked the PAF complex and Ccr4p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). However, we and others have failed to detect PAF complex members or Bur1p/2p in Ccr4-Not purifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>, data not shown). In addition, deletion of <italic>PAF1</italic> gives rise to an HU-sensitive phenotype and deregulation of <italic>RNR</italic> gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Intriguingly, this was also observed for deletions of <italic>CCR4-NOT</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) and deletion of <italic>BUR2</italic> (data not shown), suggesting a functional interplay between these complexes. Alternatively, alteration of other components of the histone code might also contribute to the regulation of H3K4me3 levels by the Ccr4-Not complex. Irrespective of this, it is clear that further experiments are required to elucidate the connections between the Ccr4-Not and PAF complexes.</p></sec><sec><title>Positive and negative regulation of transcription by the Ccr4-Not complex</title><p>Our results support a global role for the Ccr4-Not complex in the positive regulation of transcription. In addition, mutation of components of this complex results in derepression of a variety of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). These seemingly contradicting observations may be reconciled by recent findings of recognition of H3K4-methylated histones by PHD finger containing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49 B50 B51">49&#x02013;51</xref>). These domains are believed to recruit chromatin-modifying complexes, like NURF and the mSin3a-HDAC1 complex to H3K4-methylated chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). Yeast contains 15 PHD fingers residing in a variety of chromatin-modifying complexes and these motifs display different relative affinities for H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). Specific loss of H3K4 tri-methylation could therefore shift the balance of chromatin regulatory complexes at particular genes. It is unlikely that the sole function of the Ccr4-Not complex is regulation of H3K4 tri-methylation via recruitment of the PAF complex. Besides the well-documented role of the Ccr4p and Caf1p subunits in mRNA deadenylation, multiple observations indicate that the Not-proteins can directly affect TFIID function (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). This suggests that the Ccr4-Not complex integrates several steps of mRNA expression. The functional consequences of Ccr4-Not gene deletions are likely to be gene specific as suggested, for example, by our results on the <italic>PYK1</italic> and <italic>HSP104</italic> genes. Taken together, these findings provide an explanation for the observation that the Ccr4-Not complex can have both negative and positive effects on gene transcription.</p><p>In summary, we have identified a role for the Ccr4-Not complex in the regulation of H3K4 tri-methylation levels by acting parallel to or downstream of the Bur1/2 kinase to facilitate PAF complex recruitment and subsequent H2B ubiquitylation. These results provide a connection between the role of the Ccr4-Not complex in the regulation of transcription and histone methylation marks.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Drs M.
