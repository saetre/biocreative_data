At least five human RecQ-related genes exist: RecQ1, BLM, WRN, RecQ4 and RecQ5. Mutations in BLM, WRN and RecQ4 are associated with Bloom, Werner and Rothmund-Thomson syndromes, respectively, involving a predisposition to malignancies and a cellular phenotype that includes increased chromosome instability. RecQ5 is small, containing only a core part of the RecQ helicase, but three isomer transcripts code for small RecQ5&#x003b1; (corresponding to the original RecQ5 with 410 amino acids), new large RecQ5&#x003b2; (991 amino acids) and small RecQ5&#x003b3; (435 amino acids) proteins that contain the core helicase motifs. By determining the genomic structure, we found that the three isoforms are generated by differential splicing from the RecQ5 gene that contains at least 19 exons. Northern blot analysis using a RecQ5&#x003b2;-specific probe indicates that RecQ5&#x003b2; mRNA is expressed strongly in the testis. Immunocytochemical staining of three N-terminally tagged RecQ5 isomers expressed in 293EBNA cells showed that RecQ5&#x003b2; migrates to the nucleus and exists exclusively in the nucleoplasm, while the small RecQ5&#x003b1; and RecQ5&#x003b3; proteins stay in the cytoplasm. Immunoprecipitation and an extended cytochemical experiment suggested that the nucleoplasmic RecQ5&#x003b2;, like yeast Sgs1 DNA helicase, binds to topoisomerases 3&#x003b1; and 3&#x003b2;, but not to topoisomerase 1. These results predict that RecQ5&#x003b2; may have an important role in DNA metabolism and may also be related to a distinct genetic disease.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>DNA helicases have important roles in cellular DNA events, such as replication, recombination, repair and transcription, by unwinding the duplex DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c3">3</xref>). Multiple DNA helicase families with seven consensus motifs have been found and members within each helicase family also share sequence homologies between motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c4">4</xref>). The RecQ helicase family includes helicases that have extensive amino acid sequence homologies to the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> DNA helicase RecQ implicated in double-strand break repair and suppression of illegitimate recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c6">6</xref>). The human RecQ DNA helicase gene family has five members, RecQ1 (also referred to as RecQL), BLM, WRN, RecQ4 and RecQ5, located on human chromosomes 12p12, 15q26.1, 8p12&#x02013;11.2, 8q24.3 and 17q25.2&#x02013;25.3, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c10">10</xref>). Mutations in BLM, WRN and RecQ4 cause Bloom syndrome (BS), Werner syndrome (WS) and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c11">11</xref>), genetic disorders that increase the rate of generation of genetic instability in patient cells, resulting in a predisposition to cancer and premature aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c12">12</xref>).</p><p>RecQ-type helicases from other organisms are SGS1 of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and rqh1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> of <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c14">14</xref>). Like <italic>E.coli</italic>, these unicellular organisms contain a single species of RecQ-type helicase. The Sgs1 protein exists in the nucleolus when the cells are young and migrates to the nucleoplasm as the cells senesce and the nucleolus fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c15">15</xref>). Mutation of SGS1 suppresses the slow growth phenotype of mutant yeast cells with a mutation in the topoisomerase 3 gene and causes missegregation of the chromosome during meiosis and mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c16">16</xref>). Biochemically, the Sgs1 protein binds to topoisomerases 2 and 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c16">16</xref>). The rqh1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> gene of <italic>S.pombe</italic> was cloned by complementation of the UV sensitivity of a rqh1-h2 mutant; rqh1<sup>&#x02013;</sup> cells arrested by hydroxyurea in S phase are unrecoverable because of high recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c14">14</xref>).</p><p>Human WRN, BLM and RecQ4 DNA helicases and their disease-causing defective mutations have been extensively characterized by us and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c12">12</xref>). The DNA helicase RecQ5, however, has not been characterized for its gene structure, biochemical nature of the encoded helicase, subcellular localization nor the disease caused by mutation. Our previous phylogenetic study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c10">10</xref>) on the sequence of the helicase domain indicated that the product of the RecQ5 gene is evolutionarily close to the small helicase RecQ1, which is characterized as a human progenitor of the RecQ family helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c7">7</xref>), but has no known relation to human disease. We noted that two size classes of the RecQ helicase family exist, large and small helicases: the large helicases are BLM, WRN and RecQ4 in the nucleus, which contain 1417, 1432 and 1208 amino acids, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c10">10</xref>); the small helicases are RecQ1 and RecQ5, which contain 649 and 410 amino acids, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c10">10</xref>).</p><p>Extended studies have been mostly with the large helicase members of the RecQ family whose mutation causes disease phenotypes in humans. We and others found that: (i) all three helicases exist in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c19">19</xref>); (ii) their mutation causes the genomes of patient cells to become cytogenetically unstable, but differentially: defective BLM increases the rate of sister chromatid exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c20">20</xref>), while defective WRN results in variegated translocation mosaicism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c21">21</xref>) and defective RecQ4 (RTS) causes trisomerization, although a limited number of case reports exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c22">22</xref>); (iii) notable down-regulation of mRNAs and helicase proteins occurs in patient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c24">24</xref>), due perhaps to early termination codon-mediated regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c25">25</xref>); (iv) only WRN contains exonuclease activity in its N-terminus, whereas its 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; or 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; directionality remains to be unequivocally defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c29">29</xref>); (v) WRN unwinds DNA&#x0002f;RNA heteroduplexes in addition to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c30">30</xref>); (vi) intact BLM and WRN partially suppress hyper-recombination in yeast sgs1 mutant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c31">31</xref>). These findings suggest that the three disease-causing helicases have different functions in cellular DNA metabolism that cannot be complemented by each other, although the molecular mechanisms behind each helicase reaction need to be clarified.</p><p>In this paper we describe the genomic structure of RecQ5, a candidate for the fourth disease-causing RecQ-type helicase gene, regarding new cDNA genes generated by differential splicing and the biochemical nature of proteins coded for by the three gene isoforms. The RecQ5 reported previously by us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c10">10</xref>) corresponds to RecQ5&#x003b1; in this paper.

Previously, we showed that RecQ5 mRNA consists of two transcripts having different sizes of 3.6 and 3.8 kb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c10">10</xref>). Our further studies that cloned new RecQ5 cDNAs from human testis mRNAs and determined the sequences, showed that at least three different transcripts code for RecQ5 DNA helicases of different sizes. The original RecQ5 gene (referred to hereafter as RecQ5&#x003b1;) that we reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c10">10</xref>) was the largest subset of transcripts (3715 bases) among the three RecQ5 transcript species, consisting of exons 1&#x02013;7, but encoded a small polypeptide RecQ5&#x003b1; of 410 amino acids (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd270f1">1</xref>a and b). The second largest transcript, RecQ5&#x003b2; (3703 bases), formed by exons 1&#x02013;7a and 8&#x02013;19, coded for the largest polypeptide RecQ5&#x003b2; of 991 amino acids (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd270f1">1</xref>a and b). The third transcript, RecQ5&#x003b3;, was the smallest in size (1749 bases), formed by exons 1&#x02013;7a and exon 7b and coded for the small polypeptide RecQ5&#x003b3; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd270f1">1</xref>a and b). The protein structures of all three polypeptides predicted from the defined genomic sequence share seven motifs conserved for DNA helicases (darkened areas in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd270f1">1</xref>b).

A comparison of the amino acids sequences of dRecQ5a and human RecQ5&#x003b2; showed that these two polypeptides share considerable homology, particularly in the N-terminal helicase domain and the C-terminal region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd270f2">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Northern blot analysis of the RecQ5&#x003b2; mRNA in human tissues</title><p>Our previous studies using a DNA probe prepared from the helicase domain of RecQ5&#x003b1; showed that: (i) the profile of RecQ5 expression in human tissues largely resembles that of RecQ1, ubiquitously expressed in all tissues examined, with a notably strong expression in the pancreas and testis, similar to some extent to that of WRN; (ii) at least two major isomer transcripts of 3.6 and 3.8 kb exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c10">10</xref>). To determine whether the expression profile of the new large RecQ5&#x003b2; mRNA differs from that of the original RecQ5 (now renamed RecQ5&#x003b1;), we prepared a DNA probe from the 3&#x02032;-terminus (exons 14&#x02013;19) of RecQ5&#x003b2; and carried out northern blot analysis for expression in various tissues under highly stringent conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd270f3">3</xref>). Again, RecQ5&#x003b2; was expressed in all the tissues and organs examined, with strong expression in the testis. The expression profile was, however, distinct from that of RecQ5&#x003b1;, with reduced expression in the pancreas and increased expression in the kidney. Two major transcripts of 3.6 and 3.8 kb were detected, consistent with our previous findings, but there were other small and large RecQ5&#x003b2;-related RNA species found in the placenta and kidney (indicated by asterisks). These results suggest that the tissue-specific expression of RecQ5&#x003b2; is by selective exon use and perhaps other unidentified RecQ5&#x003b2;-related transcripts exist in the placenta and kidney.</p></sec><sec><title>Nuclear localization of RecQ5&#x003b2; helicase but not of RecQ5&#x003b1; and RecQ5&#x003b3; helicases</title><p>BLM, WRN and RecQ4 helicases migrate to and localize in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c19">19</xref>), while RecQ1 helicase localizes in the nucleus and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c33">33</xref>). To understand the subcellular localization of the three RecQ5 helicase isomers, we expressed the genes N-terminally tagged with epitope sequence (YPYDVPDYASL) of influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) repeated six times in 293EBNA cells. As our preliminary experiments showed that expressed RecQ5&#x003b2; migrates into the nucleus, we also expressed a part of the C-terminus (246 amino acids, referred to as RecQ5&#x003b2;c) to locate the nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd270f4">4</xref>a shows structures of the expressed proteins. A total of four recombinant proteins were expressed with the sizes confirmed by western blot analysis using a HA-specific antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd270f4">4</xref>b). The molecular weights of the individual proteins were estimated as 53, 140, 60 and 49&#x000a0;kDa for RecQ5&#x003b1;, RecQ5&#x003b2;, RecQ5&#x003b3; and RecQ5&#x003b2;c, respectively. The subcellular locations of the expressed proteins were next examined by immunocytochemical staining using the HA-specific antibody and a biotinylated antibody to rabbit immunoglobulin and the expressed proteins were stained green with streptavidin-conjugated FITC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd270f5">5</xref>). To locate the position of the nuclei, the same cells were stained with DAPI, which stains duplex DNA blue. The data clearly show that RecQ5&#x003b1; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd270f5">5</xref>a and b) and RecQ5&#x003b3; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd270f5">5</xref>e and f) are localized in the cytoplasm. In contrast, RecQ5&#x003b2; migrates to the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd270f5">5</xref>c and d), suggesting that RecQ5&#x003b2; is a nuclear helicase. RecQ5&#x003b2;c also migrated exclusively into the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd270f5">5</xref>g and h), indicating that the NLS of the RecQ5&#x003b2; protein is within this small C-terminal fragment.</p></sec><sec><title>RecQ5&#x003b2; protein interacts with topoisomerases 3&#x003b1; and 3&#x003b2;</title><p>The high sequence homology to <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ DNA helicase and a clear biochemical nature to localize in the nucleus strongly predict that RecQ5&#x003b2; is most probably a helicase involved in DNA unwinding. Although such a DNA helicase activity of the RecQ5&#x003b2; protein remains to be substantiated using the purified protein, we examined whether the expressed RecQ5&#x003b2; protein interacts with type I topoisomerases that cooperate with helicases. <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> Sgs1 DNA helicase, for example, binds to topoisomerase 3 and the two enzymes cooperate to suppress hyper-recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c13">13</xref>), and sgs1 mutant cells have a poor growth rate in a topoisomerase 1-defective background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c34">34</xref>). To determine whether RecQ5&#x003b2; is capable of binding to human type&#x000a0;I topoisomerases, we carried out a series of co-expression experiments using human topoisomerases 1, 3&#x003b1; and 3&#x003b2; in 293EBNA cells. In this experiment the RecQ5&#x003b2; protein was expressed as a form N-terminally tagged with influenza virus HA (6xHA&#x02013;RecQ5&#x003b2;). Topoisomerases were expressed individually as N-terminal Flag-tagged forms (Flag&#x02013;Top1, Flag&#x02013;Top3&#x003b1; or Flag&#x02013;Top3&#x003b2;). After co-expression with individual topoisomerases, RecQ5&#x003b2; protein bound to the topoisomerases and co-immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody was analyzed by western blot analysis using anti-HA antibodies. In these co-expression experiments, 6xHA&#x02013;RecQ5&#x003b2; and the three topoisomerase proteins were expressed at their expected sizes in 293EBNA cells, as measured by western blot analysis using antibodies specific to HA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd270f6">6</xref>a) and to Flag (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd270f6">6</xref>b). Individual topoisomerases in the cell extracts were then immunoprecipitated by anti-Flag antibody-conjugated agarose beads, eluted by Flag peptide and the 6xHA&#x02013;RecQ5&#x003b2; protein potentially bound to each topoisomerase was analyzed by western blot analysis using anti-HA antibodies. The results clearly show that 6xHA&#x02013;RecQ5&#x003b2; was co-immunoprecipitated with Flag&#x02013;Top3&#x003b1; and Flag&#x02013;Top3&#x003b2;, but not with Flag&#x02013;Top1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd270f6">6</xref>c), suggesting that RecQ5&#x003b2; helicase binds specifically to topoisomerases 3&#x003b1; and 3&#x003b2;.</p></sec><sec><title>Co-localization of RecQ5&#x003b2; and topoisomerases 3&#x003b1; and 3&#x003b2; in the nucleoplasm</title><p>To confirm that the interactions between RecQ5&#x003b2; and topoisomerases 3&#x003b1; and 3&#x003b2; also occur in cells, we examined the subcellular localization of expressed proteins by immunocytochemical staining using fluorescence-conjugated anti-HA and anti-Flag antibodies. The expressed 6xHA&#x02013;RecQ5&#x003b2; was visualized as red by staining with Texas red dye and Flag&#x02013;Top3&#x003b1; and Flag&#x02013;Top3&#x003b2; proteins were visualized as green by staining with FITC dye (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd270f7">7</xref>); Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd270f7">7</xref>a shows the staining profiles of 6xHA&#x02013;RecQ5&#x003b2; and Flag&#x02013;Top3&#x003b1;, and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd270f7">7</xref>b shows those of 6xHA&#x02013;RecQ5&#x003b2; and Flag&#x02013;Top3&#x003b2; in the same cells. These data strongly indicate that 6xHA&#x02013;RecQ5&#x003b2; exists in the nucleoplasm of 293EBNA cells, co-localizing with Flag&#x02013;Top3&#x003b1; and Flag&#x02013;Top3&#x003b2;. This apparent co-localization was confirmed by merging the stained profiles of 6xHA&#x02013;RecQ5&#x003b2; and Flag&#x02013;Top3&#x003b1;, and 6xHA&#x02013;RecQ5&#x003b2; and Flag&#x02013;Top3&#x003b2;, both of which produced matching yellow staining (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd270f7">7</xref>a and b, right).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this paper we have defined the exon&#x02013;intron structures of the RecQ5 gene, and we show that three RecQ5 helicase isomers, RecQ5&#x003b1;, RecQ5&#x003b2; and RecQ5&#x003b3;, are generated as a result of differential splicing of the RecQ5 gene transcript. Two of these isomer gene products, RecQ5&#x003b1; and RecQ5&#x003b3;, are small and localize in the cytoplasm, while RecQ5&#x003b2; migrates into the nucleus and exists in the nucleoplasm, like other human RecQ helicases (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd270f5">5</xref>). Our amino acid homology search indicated that a potential NLS with the sequence <underline>KRPR</underline>SQQENPESQPQ<underline>KRPR</underline> exists in the C-terminus (residues 854&#x02013;872 amino acids) of RecQ5&#x003b2;, which is absent from both RecQ5&#x003b1; and RecQ5&#x003b3;. A similar bipartite NLS motif comprising two arrays of basic amino acids with a spacer region of any 10 amino acids between them has been found in many nuclear proteins, including nucleoplasmin, p53 and topoisomerases (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c35">35</xref>). Previously, we identified the NLS as having an array of basic amino acids, <underline>RKRKK</underline>MPASQRS<underline>KRRK</underline> (residues 1334&#x02013;1349) and <underline>KRR</underline>CFPGSEEICSSS<underline>KRSK</underline> (residues 1371&#x02013;1389), in the C-termini of BLM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c17">17</xref>) and WRN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c18">18</xref>), respectively, and found that most mutations generate truncated helicases lacking the NLS, causing WRN and BLM not to be transported to the nucleus, where the DNA helicases are presumed to function. Importantly, this finding clearly explains why WS and BS patients show a set of similar clinical phenotypes no matter what type of mutation they carry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c18">18</xref>). More recently, we showed that WRN helicase can exist not only in the nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c36">36</xref>) but also in the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c19">19</xref>), confirming the previous data of Marciniak <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c37">37</xref>).</p><p>The expression profile of RecQ5&#x003b2; is largely the same as that we previously reported for RecQ5&#x003b1;, although stronger expression of RecQ5&#x003b2; in the testis was noted in this study. These data predict that a mutation in RecQ5&#x003b2; may cause a disease that shows the phenotypes shared by BS, WS and RTS, although whether RecQ5&#x003b2; is a disease-causing gene remains to be investigated. Our studies using immunoprecipitation showed that the expressed RecQ5&#x003b2; binds to topoisomerases 3&#x003b1; and 3&#x003b2;, but not to topoisomerase 1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd270f6">6</xref>). Although the results should be confirmed by the endogenous proteins and their specific antibodies, the data of this study at least support the view that overexpressed RecQ5&#x003b2; shows preferential binding to overexpressed topoisomerases 3&#x003b1; and 3&#x003b2;, similar to yeast Sgs1, which binds to overexpressed topoisomerases 2 and 3 in two-hybrid analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c16">16</xref>). The fact that the expressed RecQ5&#x003b2; failed to bind to overexpressed topoisomerase 1 suggests that the apparent preferential binding to topoisomerases 3&#x003b1; and 3&#x003b2; is unlikely to be mediated simply by DNA. Further immunocytochemical double staining of expressed RecQ5&#x003b2; and topoisomerases 3&#x003b1; or 3&#x003b2; in 293EBNA cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd270f7">7</xref>) was consistent with this conclusion. Gangloff <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c13">13</xref>) showed that the N-terminus of yeast Sgs1 helicase binds to topoisomerase 3. Whether the interaction between RecQ5&#x003b2; and the two topoisomerases is also mediated by the RecQ5&#x003b2; N-terminus remains to be studied.</p><p>Topoisomerases remove positive and&#x0002f;or negative superhelicity from DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c38">38</xref>). The SV40 T antigen, a viral DNA helicase, binds to topoisomerase 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c39">39</xref>) and yeast Sgs1 binds to topoisomerases 2 and 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c16">16</xref>), perhaps to cooperatively regulate the superhelicity and relax the distorted DNA structure generated as a result of DNA unwinding. Consistent with this, Harmon <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd270c40">40</xref>) recently showed that <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ helicase specifically stimulates topoisomerase 3 to fully catenate double-stranded DNA molecules by unwinding a covalently closed DNA, proposing that these two proteins functionally interact and control cellular recombination. In the absence of cooperation between helicase and topoisomerases, an imbalance may occur, yielding potential recombinogenic lesions. It is thus intriguing that RecQ5&#x003b2; is capable of binding to topoisomerases 3&#x003b1; and 3&#x003b2;. This finding strongly supports the view that RecQ5&#x003b2; is probably an active DNA helicase and is involved in nucleoplasmic DNA metabolism, but this remains to be clarified.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd270f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Structures of RecQ5 genes and the encoded RecQ5 proteins.
