These LHI closely resemble LBHI/Ast-HI in patients with SOD1-linked FALS. LHI and LBHI/Ast-HI share the following features: 1) eosinophilic staining with a pale core, 2) SOD1, ubiquitin and ER resident protein (KDEL) positivity and 3) the presence of approximately 15&#x02013;25 nm granule-coated fibrils, which are morphological hallmark of mutant SOD1-linked FALS. Moreover, in spinal cord neurons of L84V SOD1 transgenic mice at presymptomatic stage, we observed aberrant aggregation of ER and numerous free ribosomes associated with abnormal inclusion-like structures, presumably early stage neuronal LBHI. We conclude that the LBHI/Ast-HI seen in human patients with mutant SOD1-linked FALS may arise from ER dysfunction.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder in which both upper and lower motor neurons begin to degenerate in middle-aged persons.

SOD1 is an abundant protein of approximately 153 amino acids that accounts for approximately 1&#x00025; of total cytosolic protein. More than 100 different SOD1 mutations have been reported as risk factors in association with FALS.</p><p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is responsible for the synthesis, initial post-translational modification, and proper folding of proteins, as well as for their sorting export and delivery to appropriate cellular destinations. A variety of conditions, such as loss of the intraluminal oxidative environment or loss of calcium homeostasis, can cause accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER. To cope with such accumulation, there are three possible responses in eukaryotes. The first response is known as the unfolded protein response (UPR), in which IRE1&#x003b1; and ATF6 recognize aberrant proteins and increase the expression of ER-resident chaperones such as GRP78/BiP and GRP94 to promote proper protein folding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001030-Forman1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001030-Kaufman1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. The second response involves suppression of translation mediated by the serine/threonine kinase PERK, which phosphorylates and inactivates the translation initiation factor eIF-2&#x003b1; to reduce the production of misfolded proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001030-Tirasophon1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001030-Wang1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. The third response is ER-associated degradation (ERAD), in which misfolded proteins are expelled from the ER and targeted for degradation by cytoplasmic proteasomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001030-Bonifacino1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001030-Travers1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

Neuronal LBHI and Ast-HI are ultrastructually identical and share various features, with both consisting of 15&#x02013;25 nm granule-coated fibrils, both showing immunoreactivity for SOD1, ubiquitin, and copper chaperone for SOD (CCS), and both appearing late in the course of the disease (i.e. at &#x0223c;10 to 30 years of age in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001030-Kato1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001030-Hirano1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>).

Induced neuroblastoma LHI furthermore consisted of 15&#x02013;25 nm granule-coated fibrils, a hallmark of mutant SOD1-linked FALS, raising the possibility that these acutely induced aggregations represent a precursor to LBHI/Ast-HI seen in advanced FALS. In support of this possibility, we observe abnormal ER and numerous free ribosomes aggregated in the peri-nuclear region neuroblastoma cells expressing L84V SOD1 under ER stress condition and in spinal cord neurons in presymptomatic transgenic mice expressing L84V SOD1. Taken together, these findings suggest a model for early events in FALS cellular pathology, in which ER stress promotes the aggregation of mutant SOD1 and is involved in the development of LBHI/Ast-HI in patients with mutant SOD1 linked FALS.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Result</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Aggregation and ubiquitination of mutant SOD1 under ER stress</title><p>To identify conditions which lead to the aggregation of mutant SOD1, we generated SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma cell lines that stably expressed FLAG-tagged human SOD1 encoding a leucine to valine substitution mutation (L84V) associated with FALS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001030-Aoki1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.

GRP78/BiP is molecular chaperone protein induced by IRE1 in response to aberrant protein folding and promotes proper protein folding.

In this study, we present three lines of evidence for the involvement of ER stress in early events in LBHI/Ast-HI formation. First, ER stress in neuroblastoma cells expressing mutant SOD1 results in SOD1- and ubiquitin-immunopositive LHIs, compatible with LBHI/Ast-HI, composed of granule-coated fibrils approximately 15&#x02013;25 nm in diameter and granular materials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001030-g005">Figs. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001030-g006">6</xref>). Secondly, we observed similar structures in the spinal cord of L84V SOD1 transgenic mice at presymptomatic stages, including abnormal electron dense, i.e. stressed, ER and numerous free ribosomes. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001030-g004">Figs. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001030-g007">7</xref>). Third, positive staining against anti-KDEL antibody, which recognizes ER resident proteins such as calreticulin, GRP 94, PDI and GRP78/BiP, were observed in both the LHI and Ast-HI of L84V SOD1 transgenic mice at symptomatic stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001030-g006">Fig. 6E&#x02013;H</xref>). These findings support the hypothesis that ER stress induces LBHIs/Ast-HIs creation in FALS patients with mutant SOD1. Taken together, these observations suggest that LHI in neuroblastoma cells and LBHI/Ast-HI in FALS patients might develop through similar processes.</p><p>In this study, we presented evidences that ER stress causes aggregates of mutant SOD1 and formation of LHI which is compatible with LBHI/Ast-HI. However, other questions arise from these results. 1) Why did same stress induce the different outcome of mutant SOD1 aggregation in the neuroblastoma? 2) Are the smaller aggregates competent to develop to LHIs? To answer these questions, we sought without success to identify the origin of the granule coated fibrils or SOD1 containing filamentous structure (e.g. less densely coated fibrils) in the smaller SOD1 aggregates localized to ER in L84V SOD1 expressing cells. Nevertheless, we found common features between the small aggregates in L84V SOD1 expressing SK-N-SH cells and neuronal LBHI-precursor in L84V transgenic mice, including regions of abnormal ER aggregation surrounded by abundant free ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001030-g004">Fig. 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001030-g007">Fig 7C</xref>). Furthermore, LHI and Ast-HI were immunopositive for the KDEL peptide present in ER-resident proteins, suggesting the involvement of ER itself in formation or development of LBHI/Ast-HI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001030-g006">Fig. 6E&#x02013;H</xref>). We suggest that aberrant SOD1 fibril might be produced by cooperative activity of ER and ribosomes. To answer the questions, careful observation of LHI with time lapse analysis is needed.</p><p>It remains unclear why the major symptoms of ALS in patients with mutant SOD1-linked FALS do not develop until middle age, but we speculate that age-dependent changes in responses to ER stress might provide an answer. Under normal conditions, newly synthesized and misfolded proteins are refolded by chaperons such as GRP78, 94, calnexin, and calreticulin. This UPR response may be more robust in younger FALS patients and might be the reason the proteins aggregates are not observed in young patients even though mutant SOD1 is expressed. However, a decrease in protein folding or chaperone capability may occur with aging, and accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER lumen may gradually lead to ER stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001030-Bassik1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>.

Prolonged ER stress associated with insufficient degradation of misfolded proteins would subsequently activate apoptotic pathways.
