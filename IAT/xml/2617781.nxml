Since NO is thought to be involved in the regulation of both sleep and circadian rhythms, we analyzed these two processes in mice deficient for cGMP-dependent protein kinase type I (PRKG1) in the brain. <italic>Prkg1</italic> mutant mice showed a strikingly altered distribution of sleep and wakefulness over the 24 hours of a day as well as reductions in rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS) duration and in non-REM sleep (NREMS) consolidation, and their ability to sustain waking episodes was compromised. Furthermore, they displayed a drastic decrease in electroencephalogram (EEG) power in the delta frequency range (1&#x02013;4 Hz) under baseline conditions, which could be normalized after sleep deprivation. In line with the re-distribution of sleep and wakefulness, the analysis of wheel-running and drinking activity revealed more rest bouts during the activity phase and a higher percentage of daytime activity in mutant animals. No changes were observed in internal period length and phase-shifting properties of the circadian clock while chi-squared periodogram amplitude was significantly reduced, hinting at a less robust oscillator. These results indicate that PRKG1 might be involved in the stabilization and output strength of the circadian oscillator in mice. Moreover, PRKG1 deficiency results in an aberrant pattern, and consequently a reduced quality, of sleep and wakefulness, possibly due to a decreased wake-promoting output of the circadian system impinging upon sleep.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Life evolved in an environment of periodic recurrence of light and darkness. These steady changes have led to the incorporation of daily biological rhythms in order to schedule biochemical processes to their optimal phase during the 24 hours of a day. In mammals, the day can roughly be divided into an activity phase, during which physical activity is predominant, and a rest phase, during which repair mechanisms are activated and brain function alters into a state of sleep. Sleep is mainly controlled by two mechanisms: A homeostatic component regulates need and intensity of sleep according to the time spent awake or asleep, whereas a circadian component schedules sleep and wakefulness to the appropriate times within one day <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Borbely1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. For the homeostatic process, a reliable index is provided by the amplitude and prevalence of delta (1 to 4 Hz) oscillations in the EEG of NREMS, also termed delta power. Delta power is high at the onset of sleep and consecutively decreases as animals rest. Sleep deprivation induces a predictable increase in delta power during subsequent sleep. For the circadian process in rodents, reliable information on the internal period length of the autonomous clock mechanism and the ability of the clock to adapt to changes in lighting schedules can be obtained by recording wheel-running activity. However, deciphering the molecular base of sleep is difficult because the contributions of the homeostatic and circadian processes are not easy to separate.</p><p>Increasing evidence hints at an involvement of NO signaling in the regulation of sleep, especially in that of NREMS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Cudeiro1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Stenberg1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> and sleep homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Kalinchuk1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Ribeiro1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.

Moreover, NO and cGMP have been suggested to be involved in the modulation of circadian rhythmicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Gillette1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. We therefore decided to investigate whether the NO-cGMP signaling pathway is involved in sleep regulation.</p><p>Many effects of NO in the nervous system are mediated via cGMP, which may act through various intracellular receptors, among them a family of serine/threonine kinases, the cGMP-dependent protein kinases (PRKG, also abbreviated cGK or PKG; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Hofmann1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>). PRKGs in mammals are encoded by two genes, <italic>Prkg1</italic> and <italic>Prkg2</italic>. Whereas PRKG<italic>2</italic> has been reported to play a role in night-to-day progression and phase shifting of the circadian clock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Oster1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Tischkau1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, PRKG1 has been implicated in synaptic plasticity and learning (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Feil1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>). Interestingly, PRKG1 is also expressed in brain regions that are involved in the regulation of sleep and circadian rhythms, such as the suprachiasmatic and other hypothalamic nuclei <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Revermann1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Feil2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, overexpression of <italic>egl-4</italic>, a gene encoding for a cGMP-dependent protein kinase, caused adult animals to stop moving and feeding, whereas a lack of <italic>egl-4</italic> reduced behavioral quiescence in these animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Raizen1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. These results suggest that cGMP-PRKG signaling promotes lethargus, a sleep-like state, in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>To characterize the influence of PRKG1 on sleep and circadian rhythmicity in mammals, we analyzed two different mouse models lacking functional PRKG1 in the brain. We observed an altered pattern of sleep and reduced delta power under baseline conditions, indicating decreased sleep need in <italic>Prkg1</italic> mutants. After sleep deprivation, the difference in delta power disappeared, while the rebound in sleep time was increased in mutant mice. Furthermore, they displayed increased daytime activity and slower adaptation to alterations of the light-dark cycle pointing at a weak circadian oscillator. Taken together, our findings indicate that cGMP signaling via PRKG1 plays an important role in mammalian sleep regulation and timing of physical activity over the 24 hours of a day.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>A complete <italic>Prkg1</italic> knock-out leads to premature death at approximately 6 weeks of age, presumably due to smooth muscle dysfunction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Pfeifer1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

We therefore analyzed theta activity (4&#x02013;8 Hz) in the waking EEG, which is characteristic of exploratory behavior. No differences between genotypes were observed in the frequency or peak amplitude of EEG theta activity during the last 6 h of the baseline dark period or in the duration and distribution of wakefulness with distinct theta activity (i.e., theta-dominated wakefulness; data not shown). One parameter that greatly differed between the two genotypes was, however, waking episode duration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004238.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). <italic>Prkg1<sup>SMr</sup></italic> mice spent more of their waking time in shorter waking episodes (with durations between 16 s and 2 min) and substantially less time in long waking episodes.

As a consequence of this, EEG delta power, calculated over the entire delta frequency range (1&#x02013;4 Hz), might reflect sleep need less accurately. We therefore analyzed the sleep-wake dependent dynamics of EEG delta power for slow and fast delta frequencies separately (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004238.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). For both genotypes the changes in the faster delta frequencies clearly respond more precisely to the changes in sleep and waking. This is especially obvious in the dark periods, when relative power in the slow delta frequencies was importantly lower than in the faster delta frequencies. Also during recovery from sleep deprivation, both the positive and subsequent negative rebound in EEG activity in the fast delta frequencies were lacking in the slow frequencies in control mice. Despite these changes, sleep deprivation affected EEG activity in the two delta bands similarly in the two genotypes, and the altered NREMS EEG spectra observed for <italic>Prkg1<sup>SMr</sup></italic> mice during baseline were present also after sleep deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004238-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>, see also the fast-to-slow delta power ratio in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004238.s003">Fig. S3B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>The amplitude of circadian rhythmicity is decreased in <italic>Prkg1</italic> mutant mice</title><p>Since re-distribution of sleep might be influenced by the circadian clock, we monitored wheel-running activity of <italic>Prkg1<sup>SMr</sup></italic> and <italic>Prkg1<sup>BKO</sup></italic> mutants as well as their respective controls under different lighting conditions.

Under constant conditions (DD and LL), the two strains also showed comparable onset errors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004238-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). Because of the differences in onset errors in LD, we tested how <italic>Prkg1<sup>BKO</sup></italic> mutant and control mice reacted to chronic jet lag (4 hour advance every 2 days). Under these conditions, a constant re-adaptation to the changes in lighting schedule is required, which is very stressful for animals with a weak oscillator. Interestingly, total activity of mutants was reduced directly after chronic jet lag, which might be a sign of a higher stress level caused by the irregular lighting schedule, but went back up to control levels when the mice were kept again in a regular LD cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004238-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>), consistent with a recovery under steady conditions. These observations suggest that <italic>Prkg1<sup>BKO</sup></italic> mutant mice are not able to determine light-dark transitions as precisely as control animals, and that this has behavioral consequences in a jet lag protocol.</p><fig id="pone-0004238-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004238.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title><italic>Prkg1<sup>BKO</sup></italic> have a weakened circadian oscillator.</title><p>(A) Onset errors of control and <italic>Prkg1<sup>BKO</sup></italic> mutant mice kept in LD 12&#x02236;12 of the indicated intensities, DD and LL were determined from the actograms.

These results could be confirmed independently using two different mouse models, one in which <italic>Prkg1</italic> expression was abolished selectively in the nervous system and one in which it was restricted to smooth muscle cells. Moreover, mutants displayed less REM sleep and a more fragmented NREMS, a phenotype that has also been observed in a rat model of sleep fragmentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-McKenna1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, as well as a drastic decrease in delta power under baseline conditions.</p><p>Although not all parameters were determined in both strains, those analyses performed in parallel indicate that their phenotype is largely identical: Neither of the mutants showed an altered internal period length in DD, and the differences observed in chi square periodogram amplitude as well as in drinking behavior were the same for both mutant strains compared to their respective controls. Furthermore, results for sleep and circadian rhythms were in good accordance. There was no difference in the total amount of sleep, wakefulness, drinking or wheel-running activity, only their distribution over the 24 hours of a day was changed in a way that indicates more activity, or wakefulness, during the day and more sleep, or rest, during the night.</p><p>Previous findings about the involvement of NO and cGMP in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness and sleep homeostasis are not fully conclusive and partly contradictory. NO has been reported to promote sleep in rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Hars1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, and injection of an NO donor caused an increase in NREMS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Kapas1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>; in cats, however, it also appears to be required for arousal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Marino1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.

The specific neuronal NOS (nNOS) inhibitor, 7-nitro-indazole, has been demonstrated to decrease REMS exclusively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Burlet2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, to reduce both REMS and NREMS as well as EEG amplitude <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Dzoljic1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, or to have most of all an effect on NREMS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Cavas1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, respectively. Inhibition of soluble guanylyl cyclase, which generates cGMP upon activation by NO, promoted NREMS and suppressed REMS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Ribeiro2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Divergent findings might be due to variances in times of treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Ribeiro3">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref> and/or drug dose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Kapas1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Cavas1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, it is important to note that not all effects of NO must be mediated via cGMP and PRKGs. For instance, NO can signal in a cGMP-independent manner via S-nitrosylation of target proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Hess1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. In any case, two of our main observations in mice deficient in PRKG1 in the brain, namely reduced REM sleep and EEG amplitude, have been made before in animals with impaired NO signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Kapas2">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Dzoljic1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, implicating that the NO-cGMP-PRKG1 pathway might indeed be involved in sleep regulation. Further support for this hypothesis comes from a study in mutant mice, which revealed that abolition of nNOS, but not inducible NOS (iNOS), reduced REMS in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Chen1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Given that under normal conditions, iNOS is not expressed in the brain (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Nathan1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>), a sleep-regulating pathway involving both nNOS and PRKG1 might be envisaged.</p><p>Delta power under baseline conditions was reduced in <italic>Prkg1<sup>SMr</sup></italic> mice, which also has been described previously after L-NAME treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Ribeiro3">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. At the same time, more short NREMS episodes were observed in the mutants. The prevalence of EEG delta oscillation is thought to reflect the depth of NREMS and therefore to correlate negatively with sleep fragmentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Franken2">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Marked increases in the relative contribution of fast oscillations (39.0&#x02013;60.25 Hz) to the NREMS EEG, as those observed in <italic>Prkg1<sup>SMr</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004238.s001">Fig. S1</xref>), have also been associated with a more disturbed sleep and higher levels of cortical arousal during sleep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Perlis1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Based on delta power, sleep homeostasis does not appear to be altered in <italic>Prkg1<sup>SMr</sup></italic> mice because the drastic reduction in delta power present under baseline conditions was no longer seen after sleep deprivation. However, the marked increase in rebound sleep (both REMS and NREMS), which was especially pronounced immediately after sleep deprivation, suggests a role for PRKG1 in these aspects of homeostatic sleep regulation.</p><p>Inhibition of NO signaling in the brain has been reported to have the opposite effect, namely a decrease in sleep rebound, in rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Kalinchuk1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Ribeiro1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>; for mice, however, no data is available. It is conceivable that the contrasting observations in mice and rats reflect species-specific differences. Alternatively, the reduced capacity of <italic>Prkg1<sup>SMr</sup></italic> mice to sustain long bouts of wakefulness might contribute to the lower levels of EEG delta power reached in these mice because sleep need does not substantially accumulate when sleep is initiated after only a few minutes of wakefulness. Thus, the considerable differences in delta power under baseline conditions might be caused not by changes in the sleep homeostat, but by changes in wake consolidation, which are also confirmed by the circadian data, namely the observation that there are more long rest bouts during the activity phase.</p><p>Inhibition of PRKGs has been shown to abolish phase advances or to cause spontaneous phase delays in hamster and rat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Tischkau2">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Ferreyra1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. However, these effects appeared to be mediated by PRKG2 rather than PRKG1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Tischkau1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. The absence of a resetting phenotype in <italic>Prkg1</italic> mutant mice might also be explained by species-specific differences. Mice deficient for nNOS or endothelial NOS (eNOS), e.g., the two NOS species expressed in the brain under non-pathological conditions, were found to display normal phase shifts and an internal period length comparable to their respective controls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Kriegsfeld1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Kriegsfeld2">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. NO signaling appears to have a stabilizing effect on the oscillator, though, because treatment with NO donors has been shown to revert the aging-induced decline of circadian rhythms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Kunieda1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. In agreement with this, treatment of mice with sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor which causes sustained cGMP-mediated signaling, improves adaptation after jet lag <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Agostino1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. These results parallel our observations that, in the absence of PRKG1, mice do not tolerate chronic jet lag as well as control animals.</p><p>The sleep data indicates that, in the absence of PRKG1, both sleep and wakefulness are more fragmented and that their distribution over the 24 hours of a day is altered. In accordance with the sleep phenotype, wheel-running and drinking analysis revealed increased activity of <italic>Prkg1</italic> mutants during the day, when rodents are usually not active. A higher fragmentation could also be observed for the activity distribution during the active phase in that <italic>Prkg1<sup>BKO</sup></italic> animals showed more long rest bouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004238-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>). This is in agreement with the accumulation of more REM sleep in mutant mice in the first half of the dark phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004238-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>), a period during which mice are normally active most of the time and the biggest part of their total wheel-running activity is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004238-g004">Fig. 4A, C</xref>).</p><p>It has recently been shown that alterations of the dynamics of the sleep homeostat can also alter the distribution of sleep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Mongrain1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. As discussed above, the reduced levels of EEG delta power during baseline might be a consequence of the changes in the distribution of sleep in <italic>Prkg1</italic> mutant mice. The fact that we did observe differences in the compensatory rebound in sleep time after sleep deprivation, however, suggests that PRKG1 also affects at least some aspects of sleep homeostasis. The contribution of this effect to the pronounced reduction in sleep and wake quality observed during baseline remains to be quantified.</p><p>Taken together, we present evidence that abolition of PRKG1 in the nervous system distinctly alters the sleep-wake or rest-activity distribution in mice. The reduction in the diurnal amplitude of these overt behaviors is likely to be due to a reduction of the circadian output strength, a hypothesis that is supported by the effects of <italic>Prkg1</italic> deficiency on circadian rhythm amplitude under constant conditions.

The recovery time course for sleep time lost during the sleep deprivation was calculated by contrasting the hourly values of NREMS and REMS observed during recovery (30&#x02013;48 h) to the values observed during the corresponding baseline hours (6&#x02013;24 h). The recovery-baseline differences were accumulated to examine the recovery time course. NREMS quality during baseline was assessed by determining its fragmentation. For the number of NREMS episodes &#x0003c;1 min (i.e., 15 or less consecutive 4-s epochs scored as NREMS) and &#x0003e;1 min were calculated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Franken1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Both variables were expressed per hour of NREMS to correct for eventual individual differences in time spent in this state.</p><p>EEG frequency content was analyzed using the DFT. For each behavioral state an EEG spectral profile (0.75&#x02013;45 Hz) was constructed by averaging all artifact free 4-s epochs scored as that state. An additional inclusion criteria was that the 4-s epoch under consideration should be immediately preceded and followed by a 4-s epoch that was of the same state and equally artifact free. Spectra were calculated as absolute values, in units of micro-volts square per 0.25 Hz, or as relative values to correct for inter-individual differences in the absolute EEG level. The latter analysis quantifies the relative contribution of each frequency to the overall EEG signal during each of the three behavioral states. All values are expressed relative to the weighted mean average of total EEG power in all vigilance states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Franken3">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>EEG delta power during NREM sleep was calculated by averaging power density in the frequency bins from 1 to 4 Hz. Values were individually normalized by expressing them as a percentage of the mean delta power over 4-s epochs scored as NREMS in the last 4 h of the baseline light period; i.e., a time at which the lowest average levels are reached during baseline. The time course of EEG delta power in NREMS was assessed by dividing the 12 h light and dark periods into 12 (baseline light period; 0&#x02013;12 h), 8 (recovery light 30&#x02013;36 h and dark period 36&#x02013;48 h), or 6 (for the baseline dark period; 12&#x02013;24 h) intervals to which an equal number of 4-s epoch scored as NREMS contributed within individual mice (i.e., percentiles). The same analysis was performed to assess the dynamics of EEG power in NREMS in the 1.0&#x02013;2.25 Hz and 2.5&#x02013;4.0 Hz frequency ranges and for the 1.0&#x02013;2.25/2.5&#x02013;4.0 Hz power ratio.</p><p>All statistical analyses were done using SAS (SAS Institute Inc.; version 9.1).

Briefly, for the analysis of free-running rhythms, animals were entrained to LD 12&#x02236;12 and subsequently released into constant darkness (DD) or constant light (LL). Internal period length (&#x003c4;) was determined from a regression line drawn through the activity onsets of 10 days of stable rhythmicity under constant conditions. Total and daytime activity as well as activity distribution profiles and chi square periodograms were calculated using the respective inbuilt functions of the ClockLab software. Onset errors were determined manually from the actograms and refer to the difference between lights off and the actual onset of activity in LD and to the deviation of the actual onset from a regression line drawn through 10 consecutive onsets in LL/DD. Length and frequency of rest bouts during the activity phase were also evaluated manually from the actograms of animals kept in LD 12&#x02236;12. For chronic jet-lag, animals were subjected to a lighting schedule mimicking a 4 h-forward shift every 2 days for 18 days. Phase shifts were determined according to the Aschoff Type II protocol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004238-Aschoff1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. Animals were entrained to LD 12&#x02236;12, subjected to a light pulse (15 min, 400 lux) at Zeitgebertime (ZT) 14 and subsequently released into DD for 14 days. They were again entrained to LD12&#x02236;12 and the procedure was repeated for a light pulse at ZT22. To monitor the effect of a simple LD-DD-transition, animals were entrained to LD 12&#x02236;12 and released into DD without prior adminstration of a light pulse. For the calculation of phase shifts, a regression line was drawn through 10 consecutive onsets in DD; the first 2 days in DD were regarded as transition and not taken into account. Phase shifts were expressed as the differences between the regression lines (and thus the hypothetical onsets of activity) on the first day of DD after a normal LD-DD transition and after a light pulse.
