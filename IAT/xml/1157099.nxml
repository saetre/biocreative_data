In DNA methylated by MNNG, MMR action is the result of MutS recognition of O<sup>6</sup>-methylguanine base pairs. MutS and Ada methyltransferase compete for the MNNG-induced O<sup>6</sup>-methylguanine residues, and MMR-induced cytotoxicity is abrogated when Ada is present at higher concentrations than normal. To test the hypothesis that MMR sensitization is due to decreased recombinational repair, we used a RecA-mediated strand exchange assay between homologous phiX174 substrate molecules, one of which was methylated with MNNG. MutS inhibited strand transfer on such substrates in a concentration-dependent manner and its inhibitory effect was enhanced by MutL. There was no effect of these proteins on RecA activity with unmethylated substrates. We quantified the number of O<sup>6</sup>-methylguanine residues in methylated DNA by HPLC-MS/MS and 5&#x02013;10 of these residues in phiX174 DNA (5386 bp) were sufficient to block the RecA reaction in the presence of MutS and MutL. These results are consistent with a model in which methylated DNA is perceived by the cell as homeologous and prevented from recombining with homologous DNA by the MMR system.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Methylating agents are found in the environment and are also used in cancer chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). These agents and laboratory versions, such as <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<italic>N&#x02032;</italic>-nitro-<italic>N</italic>-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), can react with DNA to create a variety lesions acted upon by different DNA repair pathways; such lesions include <italic>N</italic>7-methylguanine (7-meG) and O<sup>6</sup>-methylguanine (O<sup>6</sup>-meG), the latter being the subject of this investigation. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, two methyltransferases can use O<sup>6</sup>-meG as a substrate: the constitutively produced Ogt protein and the inducible Ada protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). In order to demethylate an O<sup>6</sup>-meG, the Ada protein binds directly to the base, flips it out of the helix and into its substrate binding pocket, transferring the methyl group from the base to an internally located cysteine residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). The Ada protein also has a regulatory function to induce itself and other genes of the <italic>ada</italic> regulon, including <italic>alkA</italic>, <italic>alkB</italic> and <italic>aidB</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>).</p><p>O<sup>6</sup>-meG paired with cytosine or thymine is also a substrate for the MutS protein of the <italic>E.coli</italic> DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). The Dam-directed MMR system of <italic>E.coli</italic> acts to preserve the fidelity of the genome by removing base mismatches that arise as a result of replication (mutation avoidance) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). During replication, the parental DNA strand is methylated at all adenines in the sequence GATC by the product of the <italic>dam</italic> gene. The newly synthesized strand is not yet methylated, due to a lag between replication and methylation by Dam, which leaves a hemi-methylated DNA state behind the replication fork. The MMR system exploits the hemi-methylated state of the DNA by allowing it to distinguish the new strand from the old strand for repair. When mismatches arise in the hemi-methylated region of DNA, they are first bound by the MutS protein. MutS then recruits MutL and MutH to form a ternary complex, which activates the latent endonuclease activity of MutH. Incision by MutH occurs at a nearby GATC sequence on the unmethylated strand, followed by exonucleolytic digestion to remove the mismatch. The gap produced by exonuclease action is re-synthesized by the replicative polymerase, DNA polymerase III, which restores the correct nucleotide sequence and the remaining nick is sealed by DNA ligase. Subsequently, the repaired strand will be methylated by the Dam methyltransferase at GATC sequences, and this methylation step prevents further action by the MMR system.</p><p>In <italic>E.coli</italic> mutant in the <italic>dam</italic> locus, both strands of DNA are unmethylated and the directionality of MMR is lost, allowing MutH to incise the daughter or parental DNA strands during repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). Thus, MutH endonuclease action can occur in both replicating and non-replicating DNA, anywhere in the chromosome, unlike in wild-type cells where MMR is tightly regulated to the region trailing the replication fork. MutH action can occur either at the same GATC on opposite strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>) or by replication fork collapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). These actions result in the formation of double-strand breaks (DSBs), which require recombination to restore genomic integrity, as mutations in genes encoding recombination proteins in combination with <italic>dam</italic> results in a lethal phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>).</p><p>MMR also plays an important role in preventing recombination between similar but non-identical (homeologous) DNA sequences, a function termed anti-recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium and <italic>E.coli</italic> share an 83% sequence identity, and genetic crosses between them are sterile unless a mutation in the <italic>mutS</italic> or <italic>mutL</italic> genes is present in the recipient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Recombination is increased by at least 1000-fold in recipients where MMR is inactivated and chimeras containing DNA from both species are formed. Biochemical experiments using homeologous DNA from the closely related M13 and fd phages (3% sequence divergence) showed that the addition of MutS and MutL protein block the progression of the RecA-mediated strand exchange reaction <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). There was no effect of MutS and MutL when homologous M13&#x02013;M13 substrates were used. The genetic and biochemical results imply that MMR impedes or actively reverses recombination intermediates with the former having experimental support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>).</p><p><italic>E.coli dam</italic> mutants are more susceptible to the cytotoxic action of MNNG and other chemical agents than wild-type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Mutations inactivating MMR (<italic>mutS</italic>, <italic>mutL</italic>) in a <italic>dam</italic> background confer a level of resistance to MNNG similar to wild-type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). This indicates that MMR can act on chemically modified substrates through MutS binding specifically to O<sup>6</sup>-meG base pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). MMR action at these base pairs may lead to the formation of nicks or gaps, which are converted to DSBs requiring recombination to repair them. We hypothesize that inhibition of recombinational repair by MMR would ensue because the homologous methylated DNA is perceived as homeologous DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). Persistent unrepaired DSBs would eventually produce lethality. We have advanced a similar hypothesis to explain MMR sensitization of <italic>dam</italic> cells exposed to cisplatin in which dose- and MMR-dependent DSBs accumulate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). MutS prevents RecA-mediated strand transfer with substrate DNAs containing platinated intrastrand crosslinks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). In this work, we demonstrate a similar result with O<sup>6</sup>-meG base pairs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains, media and chemicals</title><p>The <italic>E.coli</italic> K-12 strains used in this study are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.

HPLC was performed using a Rheos microgradient pumping system (Leap Technologies, Inc.) with a 150 &#x000d7; 1 mm ID BetaBasic-18 (3 &#x003bc;m particle size, 150 &#x0212b; pore, Keystone Scientific, Inc.) in the isocratic mode with 2% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid as the mobile phase at 50 &#x003bc;l/min. The column outlet was directly connected to the Z-Spray&#x02122; ion source on a Quattro-II triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Waters). Optimal MS conditions for each analyte were determined by adjustment of conditions during infusion of solutions of each analyte in mobile phase with the capillary at 2.4 kV and collision cell argon pressure at 1 mBar.

The double mutants, <italic>dam mutS</italic>, <italic>dam mutL</italic> and <italic>dam mutH</italic>, have a level of resistance equivalent to wild type. These results confirm previous data where inactivation of MMR by presumed base substitution mutations <italic>mutS</italic> and <italic>mutL</italic> in a <italic>dam</italic> background results in drug resistance. In contrast to a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>), we find that the <italic>dam mutH</italic> strain is as resistant to MNNG as wild type.</p></sec><sec><title>The effect of Ada protein on cell survival</title><p>We also examined the role of the Ada protein on <italic>dam</italic> cell survival by using strains in which it was overproduced from a multicopy plasmid or was absent due to an <italic>ada</italic> gene deletion. The <italic>dam ada</italic> double mutant is more sensitive to MNNG than <italic>dam</italic> alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), but overexpression of the Ada protein in both these strains results in a wild-type level of resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), indicating that Ada methyltransferase can prevent MMR-induced cytotoxicity. The survival of Ada overproducing wild-type and <italic>dam mutS</italic> strains was not significantly different from the Ada-oveproducing strains shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> (data not shown). We conclude that these results are consistent with competition between Ada and MutS for substrate, which we assume is O<sup>6</sup>-meG base pairs.</p><p>The increased sensitivity of the <italic>dam ada</italic> double mutant compared with the <italic>dam</italic> strain alone suggests an <italic>ada</italic>-dependent mechanism of sensitization distinct from that caused by MMR. Further evidence for this idea is that the survival of the <italic>dam ada mutS</italic> triple mutant is less than that for the <italic>dam mutS</italic> double (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

The first four lanes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> show the reaction with methylated DNA but the identical result was obtained with unmethylated DNA (data not shown), indicating that methylated bases do not interfere with RecA action at any concentration of MNNG used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In the absence of MutS, the reaction is complete within 45 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) by measuring the appearance of nicked circle (NC) product. Over time, there is also an increase in slowly migrating intermediate (I) structures, the step which precedes the formation of the NC product. Inclusion of MutS in the reaction with unmodified substrates has no significant effect on the rate or yield of the reaction up to concentrations of 250 nM (data not shown). At higher concentrations, MutS begins to bind nonspecifically to DNA, causing a slight inhibition of the reaction.</p></sec><sec><title>The addition of MutS to the RecA strand exchange reaction</title><p>As described above, no change in rate or yield of product is observed upon the addition of MutS to a strand transfer reaction between unmethylated substrates. In contrast, inhibition of strand transfer occurs when MutS is added to a reaction where the linear duplex substrate contains methylated bases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, 25 &#x003bc;M MutS). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, addition of 25, 125 and 250 &#x003bc;M MutS results in a concentration-dependent inhibition of strand exchange, when the linear duplex substrate is modified by 150, 300 or 600 &#x003bc;M MNNG corresponding to between 5&#x02013;10, 10&#x02013;20 and 20&#x02013;40 O<sup>6</sup>-meG residues, respectively. At higher concentrations of MNNG, the binding of MutS to the substrate is saturated, as the percent NC formation is equal to that of the 600 &#x003bc;M modified substrate (data not shown). At modifying concentrations of MNNG below 150 &#x003bc;M, the binding of MutS has no effect on product formation and is analogous to that of the unmodified substrate as measured by product formation (data not shown). Note that phiX174 RFI DNA treated with 150 &#x003bc;M MNNG shows no reduction in plaque formation in transfection assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) but a reduction was seen at 300 and 600 &#x003bc;M MNNG-treated DNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Addition of MutL to the reaction</title><p>Previous studies with homeologous substrates (M13 and fd DNA) have shown that MutL stimulates MutS binding to mismatches during strand exchange when MutS is at sub-optimal concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>).

With cisplatin, we have shown that it promotes dose- and MMR-dependent DSB formation in <italic>dam</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). Genetic studies indicate that recombination is required for the repair of such breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>) and the initiation of recombination by RecA-mediated strand transfer is inhibited by MutS if one of the recombining partners contains platinated diguanosyl intrastrand crosslinks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). MMR anti-recombination with platinated DNA occurs because such DNA is recognized as homeologous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>) in the same manner as that formed between <italic>E.coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>, which are 17% divergent in sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). MMR-mediated inhibition of DSB repair should lead to lethality since even a single unrepaired DSB is expected to be lethal.</p><p>The results reported in this study begin to form a unified hypothesis explaining why cisplatin and MNNG, compounds that produce damage acted upon by different repair systems, cause a similar sensitization by MMR in <italic>dam</italic> cells. MutS prevents RecA strand transfer when one of the substrates is either methylated or platinated. Since cisplatin has been shown to induce DSB formation in <italic>dam</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>), we predict that MNNG will do so as well and experiments to test this prediction are in progress. If, indeed, this is the case, then inhibition of DSB repair by anti-recombination underlies MMR sensitization.</p><p>The data reported here and for cisplatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>) begin to answer how much modification in <italic>E.coli</italic> homologous DNA is required before it is converted to homeologous DNA. Currently, it is known that 192 mismatches, or 3% divergence, between M13 and fd (6407 nt) are sufficient for recognition as homeologous DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> show that 5&#x02013;10 O<sup>6</sup>-meG residues in the 5386 bp phiX174 molecule (1&#x02013;2 modified bases per 1000 bp) are sufficient to provoke MutS and MutL inhibition of strand exchange. With cisplatin, 4&#x02013;8 platinated intrastrand crosslinks in phiX174 are sufficient for a substantial MutS inhibitory effect although, unlike the case with O<sup>6</sup>-meG mismatches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), intrastrand crosslinks reduce the ability of RecA to perform strand transfer. With this caveat in mind, the number of lesions required to effect MutS inhibition of strand transfer is about the same (&#x0223c;1&#x02013;2 per 1000 bp).</p><p>The strand transfer experiments show that MutS must recognize O<sup>6</sup>-meG paired with cytosine confirming the binding to synthetic oligonucleotides containing such a base pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). MutS affinity for O<sup>6</sup>-meG mismatches was at least 2-fold lower than for G/T base pairs. We wish to emphasize that even though MutS has a lower affinity for DNA containing O<sup>6</sup>-meG/C mismatches, it is sufficient to produce a striking reduction in strand transfer when a low number of such mismatches are present. This argument also holds for platinated DNA where platinated GG/CC crosslinks must be the adducts recognized by MutS and which have lower affinity for MutS than GG/CT crosslinks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>E.coli dam</italic> mutant was shown to be more sensitive than wild type to MNNG, but not dimethylsulfate, suggesting that O<sup>6</sup>-meG was the lesion recognized by MMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). Subsequently, it was shown that MutS was able to bind specifically to O<sup>6</sup>-meG base pairs <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Overexpression of Ada methyltransferase abrogates MMR sensitization of <italic>dam</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and in its absence, the sensitization is enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). A simple explanation for these results is that the two proteins compete for the same substrate. Given that Ada methyltransferase acts on O<sup>6</sup>-meG residues (among others) and that MutS can also bind to O<sup>6</sup>-meG base pairs, it is reasonable to assume that this is the modified base in question and which is recognized <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Mammalian cells are sensitive to the cytotoxic action of MNNG and cisplatin but MMR-deficient cell lines derived from them are resistant to the action of these agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>), although this association for cisplatin has recently been questioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). The MutS protein from human cells specifically recognizes the platinated GG intrastrand crosslink and O<sup>6</sup>-meG-cytosine and thymine base pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). The sensitization by MMR to cisplatin or MNNG has been proposed to occur by several models, including futile repair cycles by MMR at lesions followed by DSB formation and subsequent signaling for cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). An alternative model posits a direct link between lesion recognition by MutS and a signal transduction cascade leading to cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). Insofar as the work reported here with <italic>E.coli</italic> can be extrapolated to human cells, our results would favor the DSB model.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank all those investigators listed in Table 1 for providing bacterial strains and Bruce Demple for the gift of plasmid pBAR.
