Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), however, remains a significant and potentially life-threatening complication even after HLA-identical unrelated HCT. The MHC harbors more than 400 genes, but the total number of transplantation antigens is unknown.

GVHD can affect all parts of the body, and, if severe (grade III to IV out of a scale of IV), can lead to the death of the transplant recipient. GVHD or rejection of the graft occurs when there are differences in specific proteins involved in the immune response (known as HLA antigens) between donor and recipient that stimulate the immune reaction. GVHD and graft rejection occur most often in people who receive transplants from unrelated donors because, although when donors are matched to recipients matching is done for the most important HLA antigens known to be involved, it has not technically been possible to match for all possible antigens. However, the human genome is organized into segments or blocks of closely linked genetic variants that are inherited as &#x0201c;haplotypes&#x0201d; on the same DNA strand of a chromosome. Most of the genes that code for HLA antigens are physically located together in one part of the human genome, known as the MHC region. Currently three HLA markers from this region (HLA-A, -B, -DRB1) are matched when matching donors and recipients. If it were possible to better map the structure of this region, it would be possible to better match recipients and donors (especially unrelated donors) for the unidentified transplantation antigens and reduce the chance of recipients getting GVHD or rejecting their grafts.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>Current strategies to define MHC haplotype blocks look at, on average, a length of only 18,000 base pairs and hence cannot define extended MHC haplotypes. Previously, this group of researchers developed a method of defining the <italic>HLA-A, B, DR</italic> haplotypes in recipients and their HLA-matched unrelated transplant donors using high-quality DNA containing 2 million base pairs across the MHC region. They wanted see if using this technique might provide a way to better assess the risk recipients have of developing GVHD or of having recurrent disease.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>They studied 246 HCT recipients and their donors who had been matched for HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DQB1 by current techniques. The recipients were having HCT for a variety of hematological cancers: acute lymphoid leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome. They found that, using the new technique, 22&#x00025; of the donor&#x02013;recipient pairs were haplotype-mismatched. Taking various other factors into account, including age, and patient and donor gender, MHC haplotype mismatching was associated with an approximately four times greater risk of severe acute GVHD but with a lower risk of disease recurrence. The lower risk of recurrence is believed to be because transplanted cells do not only replace abnormal cancerous cells but also react against them and therefore decrease the chance of the cancer recurring; mismatched cells are known to be more stimulated to react against the cancerous cells.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>The results here suggest that this new haplotype matching method can provide a way to assess the risk of GVHD after HCT from unrelated donors, and in future could be considered as a technique to match donors and recipients.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040008">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040008</ext-link>.</p><p>&#x02022;&#x02002;<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/stemcellsandstemcelltransplantation.html">Medline Plus</ext-link> has a page of information on stem cell transplantation, including HCT</p><p>&#x02022;&#x02002;<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.anthonynolan.org.uk/">The Anthony Nolan Trust</ext-link> holds one of the largest databases of unrelated donors in the world</p><p>&#x02022;&#x02002;The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Therapy/bone-marrow-transplant">National Cancer Institute</ext-link> has a page of questions and answers on HCT</p><p>&#x02022;&#x02002;The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cibmtr.org/">Center for International Blood &#x00026; Marrow Transplant Research</ext-link> describes outcomes research in transplantation</p><p>&#x02022;&#x02002;The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nmdp.org/">National Marrow Donor Program</ext-link> describes how HLA-typed unrelated donors are identified</p><p>&#x02022;&#x02002;The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.worldmarrow.org/">World Marrow Donor Association</ext-link> is involved in facilitating stem cell donation across international boundaries</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Petersdorf EW, Malkki M, Gooley TA, Martin PJ, Guo Z (2007) MHC haplotype matching for unrelated hematopoietic cell transplantation.

In summary, conventional grading of acute GVHD incorporates the presence of the disease and its peak severity, which is related to the efficacy of treatment. Grade 0 indicates that the prophylactic immunosuppressive regimen administered after the transplant was sufficient to prevent clinical manifestations of GVHD. Grades I, II, III, and IV indicate that the immunosuppressive regimen was not sufficient to prevent clinical manifestations, and higher grades indicate increasing peak severity. Grade I GVHD indicates that manifestations were limited to the skin with less than 50&#x00025; body surface involvement, and in most cases, the GVHD resolved spontaneously. Grade II GVHD indicates limited involvement of the gastrointestinal tract or liver, or more severe involvement of the skin, and in most cases, additional immunosuppressive treatment was sufficient to control disease. Grade III GVHD indicates more severe involvement of the gastrointestinal tract or liver, and in many cases, additional treatment did not readily control the disease. Grade IV GVHD indicates that GVHD was a major contributing cause of death. Transplant-related mortality and overall mortality are significantly higher among patients with grades III or IV acute GVHD compared to those with grades 0, I, or II GVHD. For these reasons, grades III&#x02013;IV GVHD has been used as clinically meaningful endpoint in association analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>We used logistic regression to evaluate the association of MHC haplotype mismatching with grades III&#x02013;IV acute GVHD. Cox regression was used to compare the hazards of recurrent malignancy, chronic GVHD, mortality, and transplant-related mortality. In addition to haplotype matching, all regression models contained variables for disease risk, patient age at transplantation, year of transplantation, patient/donor gender (female donor for male patient versus all other combinations), and presence of mismatching at <italic>HLA-DPB1</italic>. A test for interaction between number of common haplotypes and haplotype mismatching was performed by including the term &#x0201c;number &#x000d7; mismatch&#x0201d; in the regression model for GVHD, where &#x0201c;number&#x0201d; represents the number of common haplotypes modeled as a continuous linear variable, and &#x0201c;mismatch&#x0201d; is an indicator variable for haplotype mismatching. This amounted to testing if there was a linear increase (or decrease) in the odds ratios (ORs) of acute GVHD for haplotype mismatching compared to haplotype matching as the number of common haplotypes ranged from 0 to 2. All reported <italic>p-</italic>values are two-sided and were estimated from the Wald test, with no adjustments for multiple comparisons. Estimates of overall survival were calculated using the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method, and cumulative incidence estimates were used to summarize the probabilities of recurrent malignancy and transplant-related mortality. Death without recurrent malignancy was considered a competing risk for recurrent malignancy, and recurrent malignancy was considered a competing risk for transplant-related mortality.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title><italic>HLA-A, -B, -DRB1</italic> Linkage</title><p>A total of 246 <italic>HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DQB1</italic> allele-matched transplants were evaluated in this study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0040008-t001">Table 1</xref>).

For these three groups, the proportion of haplotype-matched donor&#x02013;recipient pairs was 33/45 (73&#x00025;), 102/130 (78&#x00025;), and 42/54 (78&#x00025;), respectively.

Since haplotype mismatched pairs share certain HLA alleles and differ for others, the effect of haplotype mismatching could differ depending on the degree to which the mismatching haplotypes share conserved regions within the MHC. To address this question, we examined the association between haplotype mismatching and the probability of GVHD according to the number of common haplotypes.

These results indicate that the HLA haplotype can serve as a proxy for GVHD risk. The advent of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay in the 1980s ushered in the HLA molecular typing era and provides the basis for current criteria for donor selection in support of unrelated HCT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.worldmarrow.org">http://www.worldmarrow.org</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nmdp.org">http://www.nmdp.org</ext-link>). Although locus-by-locus matching of donor and recipient HLA alleles can reduce risks of graft failure and GVHD &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040008-b028">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040008-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;, HLA-identical transplant recipients still suffer from potentially life-threatening GVHD. Since HLA-matched unrelated donors and recipients are not identical by descent, we hypothesized that some donor&#x02013;recipient pairs have identical MHC haplotypes of physically linked HLA alleles, while others have different haplotypes. Given the strong LD across the MHC &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040008-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040008-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040008-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040008-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040008-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;, MHC haplotype matching may predict similarity for the more than 400 immune-related MHC-resident genes that could cause GVHD. Since it would not be feasible to assess each MHC polymorphism individually, we applied classical concepts of LD mapping to measure haplotype-associated risk &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040008-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040008-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040008-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Family studies are not available for unrelated transplant donors. Population statistics for individual haplotype inference may be inaccurate &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040008-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;, and previously available laboratory techniques could not be used to define haplotypes across large distances within the MHC &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040008-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040008-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. Application of our new method uncovered haplotype mismatching in 20&#x00025; of HLA allele-matched unrelated pairs. The increment in GVHD risk associated with haplotype mismatching was at least comparable in magnitude, if not greater than the increment associated with a single HLA mismatch among related HCT recipients &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040008-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. Since the patients and donors had identical <italic>HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1,</italic> and <italic>-DQB1</italic> alleles, GVHD could not have been caused by disparity for these classical HLA genes. Furthermore, the magnitude of the effect associated with haplotype mismatching was similar among patients matched and mismatched at <italic>HLA-DPB1,</italic> indicating that <italic>HLA-DPB1</italic> cannot explain the association of haplotype mismatching with GVHD. These results support the concept that the MHC harbors additional genes that encode transplantation antigens. Morbidity from GVHD after HCT might be lowered not only by matching the individual HLA alleles of the donor and recipient, but also by matching their extended MHC haplotypes.</p><p>The current study was not designed to examine any of the many genes outside the MHC that could cause GVHD &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040008-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. Since these genes are not HLA linked, it is unlikely that they could have affected the association between MHC haplotype mismatching and risk of GVHD observed in the current study. Included among the many potential non-MHC variants that could contribute to GVHD are minor histocompatibility antigens such as those encoded by the Y chromosome when female donors are used for male recipients, or minor antigens associated with common HLA alleles such as <italic>HLA-A&#x0002a;0201</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040008-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. Notably, the frequency of <italic>HLA-A&#x0002a;0201</italic> and the proportion of gender-mismatched pairs were similar in the haplotype-matched and haplotype-mismatched groups; furthermore, gender mismatching was included in the regression models. Therefore, any contribution to GVHD from these minor antigens would not be expected to influence the impact of haplotype mismatching on GVHD risk in the study population. Finally, <italic>HLA-B</italic> and <italic>-C</italic> determinants are known to serve as ligands for natural killer (NK) cell receptors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040008-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. Since all study pairs were <italic>HLA-B</italic> and <italic>-C</italic> allele matched, and since the distributions of NK ligands in the haplotype-matched and haplotype-mismatched groups were similar (unpublished data), NK ligands cannot explain our findings.</p><p>Mortality after HCT may be caused by transplant-related complications or by recurrent malignancy. The lack of a statistically significant association of MHC haplotype matching with overall survival was unexpected but may reflect the association of haplotype mismatching predominantly with clinically severe (grade III) GVHD rather than lethal (grade IV) GVHD. Even if the use of HLA-matched haplotype-matched unrelated donors does not improve overall survival, the effort to avoid or decrease the frequency of severe acute GVHD could provide clinical benefit. Donor&#x02013;recipient haplotype matching may provide a novel strategy to decrease morbidity from GVHD and may be especially useful for patients who, because of medical reasons or advanced age, would not tolerate severe GVHD due to organ toxicity or prolonged immunosuppressive therapy. The patients in this study received T-replete unrelated donor grafts. Whether haplotype matching can further reduce GVHD risk after T cell&#x02013;depleted transplantation remains to be determined. Further studies are warranted to define potential differences in the risk of mortality associated with grade III acute GVHD in haplotype-matched and haplotype-mismatched patients and to determine whether haplotype mismatching is associated with adverse outcomes after HCT with other preparative regimens, sources of stem cells, and immunosuppressive regimens.</p><p>Among haplotype-mismatched recipients, the increased risk of GVHD was offset by a lower risk of recurrent malignancy. Whether the lower risk of recurrent malignancy among haplotype-mismatched patients can be attributed to an increased risk of GVHD (through graft-versus-leukemia effects) or to causes that do not involve GVHD remains to be addressed in a larger transplant population &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040008-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;. At present, additional pharmacologic or immunotherapeutic strategies may be necessary in order to optimize overall transplant outcome if haplotype-matched donors are selected as a way of decreasing morbidity and mortality from GVHD in patients at high risk of recurrent malignancy after HCT.</p><p>The determinants that contribute to GVHD risk after haplotype-mismatched transplantation could be located anywhere within the gene-rich MHC, and the effects could arise from either disparity between the donor and recipient haplotype-linked variation or from the direct effects of the variation itself. Previous studies have delineated the sequence of several well-known common HLA haplotypes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040008-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040008-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040008-b019">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040008-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. Haplotypes that share the same alleles at a given HLA locus also share highly conserved segments or blocks of sequences in strong LD with the HLA allele. Thus, the degree of similarity between haplotype-mismatched combinations could vary considerably, and certain regions within the MHC may contribute different levels of GVHD risk associated with haplotype mismatching. If common haplotypes are more highly conserved for undetected variation in certain regions of the MHC than others, then the effect of haplotype mismatching on GVHD among patients with common haplotypes might be greater than the effect among patients with no common haplotypes, as suggested by our current results. If future studies with larger numbers of patients validate this hypothesis, the results would suggest that efforts to identify haplotype-matched donors would provide the greatest level of protection against GVHD in the subpopulation of patients with two common haplotypes.</p><p>An important question is whether transplant outcomes can be improved by matching for selected regions of HLA haplotypes that contribute the highest risk of GVHD. Additional technology will be needed to allow all haplotype-associated MHC genes to be tested for their individual contributions to GVHD risk, and a very large cohort will be needed to answer this question. At present, the similarity of GVHD probabilities in patients whose haplotypes differed from <italic>HLA-B</italic> to <italic>HLA-A</italic> and from <italic>HLA-B</italic> to <italic>HLA-DRB1</italic> suggests that GVHD-risk genes are located both telomeric and centromeric to <italic>HLA-B</italic>. Furthermore, among the 191 haplotype-matched pairs, only four differed in linkage from <italic>HLA-B</italic> to <italic>HLA-C</italic>, and no cases differed in linkage from <italic>HLA-DRB1</italic> to <italic>HLA-DQB1</italic> (unpublished data). These results suggest that nearly all haplotype-matched pairs had identical five-locus haplotypes and that <italic>HLA-C</italic> and <italic>HLA-DQB1</italic> provide additional markers for narrowing the potential regions of interest. Candidates include any gene-encoding polymorphic determinants that can function as transplantation antigens &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040008-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040008-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040008-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040008-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040008-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. If only a few genes contribute to the increased risk of GVHD in haplotype-mismatched patients, refinement of our haplotyping method to include informative MHC class I, II, and III markers could be used to narrow the boundaries of GVHD-risk regions, allowing smaller regions to be examined at a higher level of genomic discrimination &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040008-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040008-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040008-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040008-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Specific regions of mismatching between the donor and recipient MHC haplotypes might also have different effects on the risk of recurrent malignancy. In the current study, the limited numbers of class I and class II haplotype-mismatched patients precluded any informative analysis of the association of recurrent malignancy with class I versus class II haplotype mismatching. Information from future studies showing differences in the risk of recurrent malignancy associated with haplotype mismatching for specific MHC regions could facilitate development of an immunogenetic approach toward decreasing the risk of acute GVHD while preserving graft-versus-leukemia effects.</p><p>Regardless of the number, nature, and location of GVHD-risk genes within the MHC, the results of the current study demonstrate that the three-locus <italic>HLA-A, -B, -DRB1</italic> haplotype can serve as a proxy for GVHD risk. The ease of our haplotyping technique focused on only three genetic markers could provide clinicians with a simple tool for GVHD risk assessment and a means to decrease GVHD-associated morbidity after unrelated HCT. In the future, more refined mapping of GVHD-risk determinants will provide important information as to whether matching for certain regions of haplotypes will be clinically important.</p><p>Currently, patients with common HLA alleles in strong LD have the highest chances of identifying HLA allele-matched donors. We were interested in addressing whether the presence of common haplotypes in a recipient could be used as a predictor of haplotype matching, since this information has practical implications in the search for unrelated donors. Among the entire study population, the rate of haplotype matching was 78&#x00025; for patients with two common haplotypes, 80&#x00025; for those with one, and 71&#x00025; for those with none (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0040008-t002">Table 2</xref>). Although the number of study participants was limited, these data suggest that allele frequency is only one parameter of successful donor haplotype matching.</p><p>Strong positive LD between low-frequency alleles increases the chance that a haplotype-matched donor might be identified for a given patient. For the 55 haplotype-mismatched patients in our study, a repeated search of the Bone Marrow Donors Worldwide database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bmdw.org">http://www.bmdw.org</ext-link>) identified between four and 1,777 (median: 65) potential <italic>HLA-A, -B, -DRB1</italic>-matched donors per patient. For the 45 patients of Northern European descent with two uncommon haplotypes, a repeated search identified up to 321 (median: 14) potential <italic>HLA-A, -B, -DRB1</italic>-matched donors per patient. One patient had a single donor, and only one patient had no other potential donors. These observations suggest that most five-locus-matched Northern European patients have several potential donors who could be prospectively haplotyped.

This method offers the potential for disease-association mapping without the need for individual tagSNP selection. Previous studies have been confounded by strong LD, which makes it difficult to determine whether disease susceptibility is conferred by the marker gene itself or by another gene in LD with the marker gene. Our haplotyping method will not surmount the problem of strongly linked genes, but it could be used to clarify physical linkages that differ between cases and controls and permit the measurement of independent effects. The ability to isolate high-quality intact genomic DNA for extended haplotyping provides an approach for screening causative variants even if the full extent of human haplotype diversity and structure are yet to be uncovered.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed-0040008-sd001"><label>Alternative Language Abstract S1</label><caption><title>Translation of the Abstract into German by H.
