It is well established that whereas EGF binding leads to lysosomal degradation of EGFR, transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x003b1; causes receptor recycling. TGF-&#x003b1; therefore leads to continuous signalling and is a more potent mitogen than EGF. In addition to EGF and TGF-&#x003b1;, five EGFR ligands have been identified. Although many of these ligands are upregulated in cancers, very little is known about their effect on EGFR trafficking.</p><p>We have compared the effect of six different ligands on endocytic trafficking of EGFR. We find that, whereas they all stimulate receptor internalization, they have very diverse effects on endocytic sorting. Heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor and Betacellulin target all EGFRs for lysosomal degradation. In contrast, TGF-&#x003b1; and epiregulin lead to complete receptor recycling. EGF leads to lysosomal degradation of the majority but not all EGFRs. Amphiregulin does not target EGFR for lysosomal degradation but causes fast as well as slow EGFR recycling. The Cbl ubiquitin ligases, especially c-Cbl, are responsible for EGFR ubiquitination after stimulation with all ligands, and persistent EGFR phosphorylation and ubiquitination largely correlate with receptor degradation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>amphiregulin</kwd><kwd>betacellulin</kwd><kwd>endocytic trafficking</kwd><kwd>epidermal growth factor</kwd><kwd>epidermal growth factor receptor</kwd><kwd>epiregulin</kwd><kwd>heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor</kwd><kwd>transforming growth factor-&#x003b1;</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in normal cellular growth and differentiation as well as in the pathogenesis of cancer. Seven different EGFR ligands have been identified: EGF, transforming growth factor-&#x003b1; (TGF-&#x003b1;), heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), betacellulin (BTC), amphiregulin (AR), epiregulin (EPI), and epigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). Several of the ligands are found in increased concentrations in human cancers, where they engage in auto- and paracrine signalling stimulating tumour progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>).</p><p>Endocytic sorting is an important mechanism regulating EGFR signalling. Upon ligand-binding, EGFR is internalized and trafficked to endosomes. From endosomes, the receptor is either recycled to the cell surface, or it is transported to lysosomes for degradation (recently reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>)). The sorting to lysosomes is regulated by ubiquitination of the receptor, which in turn is dependent on the pH sensitivity of the ligand-binding. The EGF binding to EGFR is relatively stable at the pH of endosomes, so upon EGF binding EGFR is continuously ubiquitinated by the Cbl ubiquitin ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>) and transported to lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). In contrast, TGF-&#x003b1; rapidly dissociates from the receptor when exposed to the low pH of endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>), and the receptor becomes de-ubiquitinated and is therefore recycled back to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>).</p><p>Whether EGFR is degraded in lysosomes or recycled to the plasma membrane is vital for the duration of the EGFR signal. Following receptor degradation, the EGFR signal will be diminished until the number of EGFRs at the plasma membrane has been reestablished by protein synthesis. In contrast, following receptor recycling, the cell is immediately able to undergo an additional round of full EGFR activation. In accordance with this, TGF-&#x003b1; is a more potent mitogen than EGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). At present, very little is known about how the remaining EGFR ligands affect endocytic sorting and degradation of EGFR, although several studies have shown that they differ substantially in their oncogenic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>).</p><p>In this study we have compared the effects of six different EGFR ligands on EGFR endocytosis, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, degradation, and recycling. All of the ligands stimulate EGFR endocytosis. However, their effects on intracellular trafficking of EGFR vary significantly, from complete recycling to complete lysosomal degradation. Whether EGFR is recycled or degraded after stimulation with the various ligands correlates well with persistent receptor phosphorylation and also with persistent Cbl ubiquitin ligase-dependent receptor ubiquitination and pH sensitivity of ligand-binding.</p><p>Based on our results and the current knowledge about the role of EGFR ligands in the pathogenesis of cancer, we propose that the oncogenic potential of the various EGFR ligands in part depends on their ability to induce receptor recycling rather than degradation.</p><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>EGFR ligands differentially induce receptor internalization and recycling</title><p>To compare the ability of the different EGFR ligands to induce internalization of EGFR, we used the common approach of pre-binding ligand on ice, thereby looking at a synchronized wave of receptor internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). We initially determined the incubation time necessary to obtain maximal ligand-binding. First,<sup>125</sup>I-EGF binding to HEp2 cells as a function of time was tested, and in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref> it is seen that the equilibrium is reached after only 15 min. To investigate the binding kinetics of the other ligands to EGFR, cells were incubated with unlabelled ligand on ice for up to 2 h. Thereafter, cells were briefly washed followed by binding of <sup>125</sup>I-EGF for 30 min. The level of <sup>125</sup>I-EGF binding reflects unbound EGFRs. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref> it is seen that all ligands have reached maximal binding well before 1 h. Thus, to investigate EGFR internalization, HEp2 cells were incubated with increasing ligand concentrations on ice for 1 h followed by washing and 15 min chase at 37&#x000b0;C. Subsequently, the amount of EGFR present at the cell surface was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1A</xref>, all six ligands induced EGFR internalization. However, the degree of internalization varied between the ligands. HB-EGF and BTC were very efficient at inducing EGFR internalization. At saturating concentrations of ligand, 70&#x02013;80% of cell surface EGFR was internalized upon the 15 min chase. EGF and TGF-&#x003b1; both induced internalization of approximately 50% of the receptors at saturating concentrations of ligand. In case of EPI and AR, the internalization did not reach saturation with the ligand concentrations used. This is in accordance with the fact that these two ligands have a lower affinity for EGFR compared with the other ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>EGFR ligands differentially affect EGFR endocytosis and recycling</title><p>A) EGFR internalization following stimulation with increasing concentrations of various EGFR ligands.

If a ligand induces a substantial amount of EGFR recycling to the cell surface, it will clear the cell surface for EGFR less efficiently than a ligand that does not induce receptor recycling. Such recycling can best be detected with pulse-chase experiments, because continuous incubation with ligand will cause recycled receptors to repeatedly undergo endocytosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S2</xref>). Thus, to investigate recycling, HEp2 cells were incubated with a fixed concentration of ligand on ice for 1 h, washed, and subsequently chased for the indicated period of time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1B</xref>). At the end of the chase, the amount of cell surface EGFR was quantified by FACS analysis. In case of EGF, TGF-&#x003b1;, HB-EGF, and BTC, 10 n<sc>m</sc> of ligand was used because this concentration induced a close to maximal EGFR internalization in the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1A</xref>. For the lower affinity ligands EPI and AR, a concentration of 100 n<sc>m</sc> was used. Although the <italic>in vivo</italic> ligand concentrations have not been determined for all of the investigated ligands, it is conceivable that the concentrations used here are physiologically and pathophysiologically relevant (see discussion).</p><p>As can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1B</xref>, very little EGFR is recycled to the cell surface following stimulation with HB-EGF or BTC. In contrast, close to 100% of the receptors is recycled following stimulation with either TGF-&#x003b1; or EPI. EGF and AR give intermediary responses, and induce recycling of approximately 50% of the internalized receptors. Thus, the six EGFR ligands have very different effects on EGFR trafficking.</p></sec><sec><title>All ligands induce EGFR transport to EEA1-positive endosomes</title><p>It is known that EGFR is transported through EEA1 positive endosomes after stimulation with EGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). To further test trafficking and intracellular localization of EGFR after stimulation with the other ligands, we investigated the association of EGFR with EEA1 positive endosomes.

They were subsequently fixed and labelled for EGFR and EEA1. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2A</xref> shows images of EGFR and EEA1 following 15 min of internalization.

Cells were stimulated with ligand for 1 h on ice, washed, and chased for 0&#x02013;8 h in the presence of cycloheximide to inhibit <italic>de novo</italic> EGFR synthesis. The cells were subsequently lysed, and the amount of EGFR determined by ELISA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S3</xref>). Alternatively, to avoid the use of cycloheximide, cells were pulse-labelled with <sup>35</sup>S-methionine, stimulated with ligand for 1 h on ice, washed, and incubated for 2 or 6 h at 37&#x000b0;C. EGFR was subsequently immunoprecipitated and the amount of <sup>35</sup>S-labelled EGFR quantified by PhosphorImaging of an SDS-PAGE gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3</xref>). As can be seen, stimulation with TGF-&#x003b1;, EPI, or AR does not lead to significant degradation of EGFR. Stimulation with either EGF or HB-EGF leads to degradation of 40&#x02013;60% of the cellular EGFR, whereas stimulation with BTC leads to degradation of approximately 70% of the cellular EGFR.</p><fig id="fig03" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>EGFR ligands differentially stimulate EGFR degradation</title><p>Cells were incubated with <sup>35</sup>S-methionine/cysteine for 1&#x02013;2 h followed by unlabelled medium for 3 h.

Interestingly, stimulation with AR does not lead to significant degradation for up to 6 h of EGFR in spite of the fact that only half of the internalized receptors are recycled within the time of the recycling experiment. One possible explanation for this is that EGFR is recycled more slowly after stimulation with AR compared with other ligands. To investigate this, we incubated cells with either EGF or AR for 1 h on ice, washed, and chased for 6 h at 37&#x000b0;C, 3 h longer than the recycling experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1B</xref>. We subsequently measured the amount of EGFR present at the cell surface by FACS analysis. Six hours after EGF stimulation, 60% of the initial amount of EGFR was present at the cell surface whereas 6 h after AR stimulation, the amount of EGFR on the cell surface was 80% of the initial level. This indicates that there may be some additional, slow recycling after stimulation with AR compared with EGF.</p></sec><sec><title>EGFR ligands differentially induce transport of EGFR to Lamp1-positive endosomes</title><p>We next investigated which ligands that target EGFR to lysosomes. Cells were incubated with ligand on ice for 1 h, washed, and further incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for different time periods. They were subsequently fixed and labelled for EGFR and Lamp1, and imaged by confocal microscopy. As can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figure 4A</xref>, after 60 min of stimulation with TGF-&#x003b1; or EPI a substantial amount of EGFR is present at the cell surface, which correlates well with the lack of degradation and complete recycling seen after stimulation with these ligands. Stimulation with HB-EGF, BTC, or EGF for 60 min results in some colocalization of EGFR with lysosomes. However, because the receptor is rapidly degraded once it has reached lysosomes, it is difficult to quantify the amount of EGFR trafficked to lysosomes. Indeed, when lysosomal function was inhibited by bafilomycin, most EGFR could be found in lysosomes after 120 min of stimulation with HB-EGF or BTC (not shown and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figure 4B</xref>). Following 60 min of AR stimulation, a substantial amount of EGFR appears to be located to non-lysosomal vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figure 4A</xref>). Taking into account the relatively lower colocalization with EEA1-positive compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2B</xref>) and the slow recycling of EGFR after AR stimulation (see above), these data indicate that AR leads to sorting of a small fraction of EGFR to an intracellular compartment which is distinct from EEA1- and Lamp-1-positive compartments and from which EGFR slowly recycles. To further characterize this compartment, we investigated colocalization of EGFR with Rab-4 and Rab-11, which are markers of recycling endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Following 60 min of AR stimulation, EGFR partially colocalizes with both Rab-4 and Rab-11 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Figure S4</xref>). This is in agreement with a recent paper showing colocalization between EGFR and Rab-11 after AR stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>).</p><fig id="fig04" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>EGFR localization to lysosomes following ligand stimulation</title><p>A) HEp2 cells were incubated on ice with 10 n<sc>m</sc> (EGF, TGF-&#x003b1;, HB-EGF, and BTC) or 100 n<sc>m</sc> (AR and EPI) of ligand, washed, and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 60 min.

We therefore further investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying these differences.</p></sec><sec><title>AR, HB-EGF, and BTC bind to EGFR even at very low pH</title><p>It is generally accepted that TGF-&#x003b1; leads to EGFR recycling because the ligand dissociates from the receptor in the acidic environment in endosomes. In contrast, EGF binding to EGFR is more resistant to low pH and thus EGF leads to degradation of the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). To investigate whether there is a general correlation between receptor recycling/degradation and pH dependence of ligand-binding, cells were incubated with ligand on ice for 4 h and then briefly washed with buffers of varying pH followed by binding of <sup>125</sup>I-EGF. The amount of <sup>125</sup>I-EGF bound to the cells reflects the number of EGFRs from which ligand has been removed during the acid wash (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5</xref>). As expected, TGF-&#x003b1; dissociates from the receptor at pH 6.5, whereas EGF dissociates at a slightly lower pH 5.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). AR, BTC, and HB-EGF are highly acid-resistant and remain bound to the receptor at physiologically relevant pH values. It was not possible to measure the pH dependence of EPI because of the low affinity of the ligand. The data show that for EGF, TGF-&#x003b1;, HB-EGF, and BTC the pH sensitivity of ligand-binding correlates well with the level of receptor recycling/degradation. Surprisingly, AR binding showed high acid resistance despite the fact that this ligand induces recycling and negligible degradation of EGFR.</p><fig id="fig05" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>EGFR binding of HB-EGF, BTC, and AR is acid-resistant</title><p>HEp2 cells were incubated with 10 n<sc>m</sc> (EGF, TGF-&#x003b1;, HB-EGF, and BTC) or 100 n<sc>m</sc> (AR) of unlabelled ligand on ice for 6 h followed by a brief wash with buffers of various pH.

We therefore investigated to what degree the different EGFR ligands induce EGFR ubiquitination. Cells were incubated with ligand on ice for 1 h, washed, and chased for 5 min at 37&#x000b0;C. Subsequently, EGFR was immunoprecipitated and ubiquitination detected by western blotting. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6A</xref>, all ligands induce ubiquitination of EGFR, albeit to a varying extent. To investigate the kinetics of EGFR ubiquitination, cells were chased for 0 to 20 min at 37&#x000b0;C. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Figure S5</xref> it is seen that all ligands induce 85&#x02013;100% of maximal ubiquitination after 5 min. After this time-point, ubiquitination persists to different degrees depending on the ligand. HB-EGF and in particular BTC give strong and/or persistent EGFR ubiquitination. In contrast, TGF&#x003b1; and EPI give low ubiquitination that is quickly lost. AR gives a strong initial EGFR ubiquitination which, however, is quickly lost. Compared with the ubiquitination seen after HB-EGF and BTC, the level of EGF-stimulated EGFR ubiquitination is low, but it is more persistent than seen after TGF&#x003b1;, AR and EPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Figure S5</xref>).

To investigate how the different EGFR ligands affect recruitment of c-Cbl to activated EGFR, cells were incubated with ligand on ice for 1 h, washed, and chased at 37&#x000b0;C for 0&#x02013;15 min. Cells were lysed in co-immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer, EGFR immunoprecipitated, and the immunoprecipitate analysed by western blotting for EGFR, c-Cbl, and Grb2. As can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6B,C</xref>, all ligands stimulate c-Cbl binding to EGFR, but the association is more prolonged after EGF and BTC stimulation than the remaining ligands. In particular, AR stimulates a transient c-Cbl binding to EGFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6B</xref>). Based on the high ubiquitination level seen after HB-EGF, it is surprising that we found a low c-Cbl binding to EGFR after this ligand (see discussion). Like c-Cbl, Grb2 bound EGFR more efficiently following EGF or BTC stimulation for 15 min compared with the other EGFR ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6C</xref>). This fits well with the reports that c-Cbl primarily binds EGFR via Grb2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>).</p><p>Recruitment of c-Cbl to the EGFR and ubiquitination of the receptor does not correlate after stimulation with AR and HB-EGF, and this could indicate that c-Cbl is not decisive for the ubiquitination of EGFR after stimulation with all ligands.</p></sec><sec><title>Cbl ubiquitin ligases are important for EGFR ubiquitination after stimulation with all ligands tested</title><p>To further investigate the role of Cbl ubiquitin ligases in EGFR ubiquitination, we transfected cells with small interfering RNA (siRNA) against c-Cbl and/or Cbl-b, another ubiquitin ligase reported to ubiquitinate EGFR after EGF stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>), and tested how this affected ubiquitination of EGFR after stimulation with the various ligands. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Figure 7</xref>, EGFR ubiquitination is partly dependent upon c-Cbl for all the investigated ligands. Knock down of Cbl-b alone does not diminish EGFR ubiquitination, but double knock down of both ubiquitin ligases does in some cases inhibit ubiquitination slightly more efficiently than c-Cbl knock down alone. This shows that Cbl ubiquitin ligases, in particular c-Cbl, are involved in EGFR ubiquitination after stimulation with all ligands.</p><fig id="fig07" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Ubiquitination of EGFR is Cbl ubiquitin ligase-dependent for all ligands</title><p>HEp2 cells were transfected with scrambled siRNA or c-Cbl and/or Cbl-b siRNA twice with 48 h interval.

In spite of this, very little is known about how ligands other than EGF and TGF- &#x003b1; affect EGFR internalization, recycling, and degradation. We show here that six different EGFR ligands differ substantially in their effects on EGFR trafficking and degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig09">Figure 9</xref>).</p><fig id="fig09" position="float"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><title>Model for EGFR trafficking after stimulation with the six ligands</title><p>The model shows how EGFR is either recycled or transported to lysosomes after stimulation with the different ligands. See discussion for further details. PM, plasma membrane.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="tra0010-1115-f9"/></fig><p>An interesting question is whether EGFR trafficking following stimulation with the six different ligands occurs as predicted by the current model of how this is regulated, a model based solely on results of experiments with EGF and TGF-&#x003b1;(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). Our data show that the behaviour of EPI and BTC fits well with the model for endocytic sorting of EGFR. Accordingly, EPI stimulates endocytosis of EGFR followed by complete recycling to the cell surface, and all of the parameters measured are in accordance with this including low levels of EGFR Tyr1045 phosphorylation and low levels of EGFR ubiquitination. BTC stimulates EGFR degradation and in accordance with this, BTC leads to EGFR Tyr1045 phosphorylation, persistent c-Cbl recruitment, and EGFR ubiquitination. In contrast, the behaviour of EGFR after stimulation with HB-EGF or AR cannot be fully explained by the current model of EGFR sorting.</p><p>HB-EGF causes very efficient EGFR Tyr1045 phosphorylation, abundant EGFR ubiquitination, and EGFR degradation. However, there is only low and transitent c-Cbl recruitment to EGFR following HB-EGF stimulation in spite of the heavy Tyr1045 phosphorylation. This is surprising, since it is believed that phosphorylated Tyr1045 is an important binding site for c-Cbl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). Interestingly, c-Cbl is recruited to EGFR in the early phases following HB-EGF stimulation, and our c-Cbl knock down experiments show that this ubiquitin ligase is necessary for full HB-EGF induced EGFR ubiquitination. This shows the necessity of testing receptor ubiquitination at a range of time-points, including very early time-points.</p><p>AR stimulation for 5 min leads to profound EGFR ubiquitination, but no receptor degradation. The lack of degradation is most likely because of the fact that the ubiquitination is rapidly lost, and therefore the receptor is not targeted to lysosomal degradation, as has previously been shown for TGF-&#x003b1;(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). In case of TGF-&#x003b1;, the quick loss of ubiquitination is believed to be because of the high pH sensitivity of this ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). This is not the case for AR, which is a highly acid-resistant ligand. However, AR has a much lower affinity for EGFR than EGF, TGF-&#x003b1;, HB-EGF, and BTC. We therefore hypothesize that the ligand is released from EGFR in endosomes not because of pH sensitivity, but rather because of a high off-rate causing the ligand to rapidly dissociate from the receptor irrespective of the pH changes encountered during trafficking of EGFR.</p><p>Although the <italic>in vivo</italic> ligand concentrations have not been determined for all of the investigated ligands, it is conceivable that the concentrations used here are physiologically and pathophysiologically relevant. In case of EGF, concentrations vary strongly between different body fluids, reaching up to 8&#x02013;80 n<sc>m</sc> in bile, urine, milk and prostate fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). Normally, epithelia prevent these fluids from reaching EGFRs which are expressed basolaterally, but when the tight junctions of the epithelia become leaky, e.g. as a result of premalignant neoplasia, high concentrations of EGF will reach and activate EGFRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). Furthermore, elevated levels of EGFR ligand have been found in several cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). Although an exact ligand concentration has not been measured in tumours, due to the auto- and paracrine nature of the system, local EGFR ligand concentrations in the tumour microenvironment may reach very high levels as well.</p><p>The clinical significance of over-expression of EGFR in a multitude of cancers has been heavily investigated, and many studies have reported that high expression of EGFR in tumours is a marker of poor clinical outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). Until now, the expression levels of the EGFR ligands have not been investigated to the same extent. Considering their very diverse effects on the behaviour of EGFR, it is of great importance to investigate which combinations of EGFR ligands are expressed by a tumour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). In bladder cancer, HB-EGF, EPI, AR, and TGF-&#x003b1; have been associated with a lower overall survival than has BTC and EGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Interestingly, apart from HB-EGF, the EGFR ligands associated with poor survival are the ligands which do not stimulate EGFR degradation and therefore allow repeated activation of EGFR.</p><p>EGFR is a well-established drug target, with several EGFR-targeting drugs on the market as well as in clinical development. However, several studies have shown that these drugs are effective on only a subset of cancer patients. One of the most important challenges is to identify the patients who will benefit from EGFR-targeting drugs prior to initiation of therapy. EGFR levels in the tumour do not appear to correlate well with clinical efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). In this context, it will be of great interest to investigate whether there is a correlation between EGFR ligand expression profile and sensitivity towards EGFR-targeting drugs, and whether the potential of the ligands to induce EGFR degradation correlates with clinical efficacy of EGFR-targeting drugs. In support of this hypothesis, two recent studies showed that cancer patients with tumours expressing either AR or EPI have a better response to treatment with EGFR-targeting drugs compared with patients with tumours not expressing AR or EPI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). Indeed, one may envision that tumours relying heavily on EGFR signalling will tend to express ligands that do not induce EGFR degradation, and that these tumours therefore will be more sensitive to EGFR-targeted treatment. This highlights the role of ligand-induced EGFR degradation in limiting EGFR signalling, and emphasizes the importance of expanding our knowledge of how these processes are regulated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Unless otherwise stated, reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.</p><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>HEp2 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS (Biosera), 2 m<sc>m</sc> glutamax (Invitrogen), 1 m<sc>m</sc> sodium pyruvate, 200 U/mL penicillin, and 50 ng/mL streptomycin.

Lysates were counted in a gamma-counter. The graph shows the increase in bound <sup>125</sup>I-EGF. Data points represent mean +/&#x02212; SEM for five independent experiments. B): HEp2 cells were incubated on ice with unlabelled ligands for 0&#x02013;120 min and washed. The number of unoccupied EGFRs following the unlabelled ligand incubation was determined by incubation with 125IEGF. The graph shows the increase in unlabelled ligands bound. This indirect method of measuring ligand-binding was used because some of the EGFR ligands also bind to ErbB4, and it is therefore not possible to separately analyse binding to EGFR using directly labelled ligands.Maximal <sup>125</sup>I-EGF binding was set to 0% and no <sup>125</sup>I-EGF binding to 100%.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><media xlink:href="tra0010-1115-SD1.tif" xlink:type="simple" id="d32e2691" position="anchor" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material><p><bold>Figure S2: EGFR trafficking after ligand stimulation is best monitored by pulse-chase experiments.</bold> Time-course of EGFR internalization and recycling following stimulation with EGF or TGF-&#x003b1; either as a pulse or continuously.
