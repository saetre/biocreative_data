Androgen receptors (ARs) are expressed in several testicular cell types, but continuing uncertainty exists over which cell type mediates androgen control of spermatogenesis. Androgen signaling <italic>via</italic> Sertoli cells (SCs) is essential for complete spermatogenesis, but the role for androgen signaling <italic>via</italic> peritubular myoid (PTM) cells is contentious. To address this controversy, we generated PTM-specific AR-knockout (PTM-ARKO) mice in which gross reproductive development was normal, but all PTM-ARKO males were azoospermic and infertile. Testis weight was reduced beyond puberty, and in adulthood there was an 86% reduction in germ cells, compared with wild-type littermates. These changes were not explained by any deficits in testosterone, luteinizing hormone, or follicle-stimulating hormone concentrations. SC function was impaired in PTM-ARKO males, indicated by reduced seminiferous tubule fluid production and reduced expression of some androgen-dependent SC genes. Androgen action <italic>via</italic> PTM cells is therefore essential for normal testis function, spermatogenesis, and fertility in males. This study also provides the first direct evidence for the importance of androgen-driven stromal-epithelial interactions underpinning the regulation of spermatogenesis; PTM-ARKO mice will enable identification of the new molecular pathways involved.&#x02014;Welsh, M., Saunders, P.

AR is expressed in several testicular cell types, but continuing uncertainty exists over which of these cell types mediates androgen control of spermatogenesis. Germ cells (GCs) lacking AR mature normally <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">(5)</xref>; therefore, testosterone is believed to regulate spermatogenesis <italic>via</italic> AR expression in testicular somatic cells, namely the Sertoli cells (SCs), the peritubular myoid (PTM) cells, or LCs themselves. SCs have long been considered the prime candidates because of their intimate contact with the developing GCs <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">(6)</xref>. This theory has been investigated directly by ablating <italic>AR</italic> in SCs (SCARKO mice) using the Cre/lox system, and it was shown that these mice are infertile because the GCs fail to complete meiosis <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">(7</xref><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">, 8)</xref>. However, in other androgen-dependent tissues, such as the prostate gland, AR signaling <italic>via</italic> the stromal cells has a profound influence on organ development and epithelial cell function <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">(9</xref><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">, 10)</xref>. If the same stromal-epithelial interactions apply in the testis, we would expect the stromal PTM cells to play a pivotal role in mediating effects of androgens on epithelial SC function and spermatogenesis.</p><p>PTM cells surround the seminiferous tubules and express AR from fetal life through to adulthood, unlike the SCs, which only become androgen responsive postnatally <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">(11)</xref>. Despite many years of research, surprisingly little is known about the role for PTM cells in male fertility. It has been shown <italic>in vivo</italic> that loss of PTM cells results in abnormal spermatogenesis <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">(12)</xref>, and 2 decades ago it was postulated that PTM cells might mediate androgenic control of spermatogenesis <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">(13)</xref> as they interact intimately with SCs, for example, in laying down the basement membrane that surrounds the seminiferous tubules <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">(14</xref><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">, 15)</xref>. Furthermore, <italic>in vitro</italic> evidence shows that androgens can stimulate PTM cells to secrete factors that modulate SC function and thus GC development <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">(13</xref><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">, 16)</xref>. Unfortunately, these PTM-derived secretory factors remain unidentified <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">(16</xref><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">, 17)</xref>. More recently, Cre/lox technology was used in mice to delete AR from PTM cells, and although this resulted in reduced sperm production, it did not result in male infertility <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">(18)</xref>. This result initially suggested that androgen action <italic>via</italic> PTM cells was not essential for spermatogenesis. However, an independent study <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">(19)</xref> later reported that the SM22-Cre line used in these experiments to ablate AR functioned poorly in the testis, whereas, in contrast, Cre recombinase was highly expressed in the testis in smMHC-Cre mice. This raises the possibility that the mild phenotype reported by Zhang <italic>et al.</italic> in their PTM cell AR knockout (KO) <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">(18)</xref> might not truly reflect the importance of androgen action <italic>via</italic> PTM cells.</p><p>The aim of our studies, therefore, was to compare the ability to ablate AR signaling <italic>via</italic> testicular PTM cells using both of these Cre mouse lines to provide definitive evidence for the role for AR signaling <italic>via</italic> PTM cells in male fertility.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Breeding of transgenic mice</title><p>Mice in which the AR has been selectively ablated from the PTM cells were generated using Cre/<italic>loxP</italic> technology. PTM cells are smooth muscle cells; therefore, to delete AR from these cells, male mice heterozygous for Cre recombinase under the control of a smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (MH) <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">(20)</xref> or a smooth muscle 22&#x003b1; (SM) as used by Zhang <italic>et al.</italic><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">(18)</xref>, on an identical strain background <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">(21)</xref> promoter were mated to female mice homozygous for a floxed AR <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">(8)</xref>. The <italic>Cre</italic>-positive (<italic>AR</italic><sup><italic>flox</italic></sup>-positive) male offspring from these matings are termed MHAR KO (later termed PTM-ARKO) and SMAR KO, respectively, whereas the <italic>Cre</italic>-negative, <italic>AR</italic><sup><italic>flox</italic></sup>-positive littermates were used as controls (termed WT). Mouse nomenclature is summarized in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. <italic>Cre</italic>-positive, <italic>AR</italic><sup><italic>flox</italic></sup>-negative mice were also generated by mating MH or SM <italic>Cre</italic>-positive stud males to C57BL/6J females to confirm that expression of <italic>Cre</italic> alone did not induce a phenotype. Sex and genotype ratios were all identified at the expected Mendelian ratios. Complete androgen receptor knockout (ARKO) mice were generated as published previously <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">(22)</xref>. All mice were bred under standard conditions of care and use under licensed approval from the UK Home Office.</p></sec><sec><title>PCR genotyping of mice</title><p>Stud male MH or SM mice were identified by genotyping from ear or tail DNA for the presence of <italic>Cre</italic> using standard PCR (http://jaxmice.jax.org/pub-cgi/protocols/protocols.sh?objtype&#x0003d; protocol&#x00026;protocol_id&#x0003d;288). Females homozygous for <italic>AR</italic><sup><italic>flox</italic></sup> were identified using primers for <italic>AR</italic> exon 2 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">(7)</xref>; these primers revealed bands of 1142, 1072, and 612 bp, relating to mice with a floxed, WT, or excised allele of the AR, respectively. All MHAR and SMAR male offspring were genotyped for the presence of <italic>Cre</italic> using the primers detailed above; all male offspring were hemizygous for X-linked <italic>AR</italic><sup><italic>flox</italic></sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation of fertility</title><p>To investigate fertility, postnatal day (d)50 and 100 MHAR KO and WT males were each housed with an adult C57BL/6J female for 4 days. This process was repeated with 3 subsequent WT females per male. Female mice were monitored for 25 days for litters to be born.</p></sec><sec><title>Recovery of reproductive tissues</title><p>Male mice were culled at various postnatal ages (d12&#x02013;140) by inhalation of carbon dioxide and subsequent cervical dislocation. Body weight and anogenital distance were measured, and mice were examined for any gross abnormalities of the reproductive system. Testes, seminal vesicles, and ventral prostates were removed from the mice and weighed, whereas epididymides and vas deferens were recovered but not weighed. To collect fetal testes, dams were culled at embryonic day (e)17.5, and fetuses were recovered, decapitated, and placed in ice-cold PBS (Sigma, Poole, UK). Testes were collected from male fetuses and weighed. Tissues were either snap-frozen for subsequent RNA analysis or fixed in Bouin&#x02019;s fixative for 6 h. Bouin&#x02019;s-fixed tissues were processed and embedded in paraffin wax, and 5-&#x003bc;m sections were used for histological analysis as reported previously <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">(23)</xref>. Sections of testis and epididymis were stained with hematoxylin and eosin using standard protocols and examined for histological abnormalities.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of testicular cell composition</title><p>Standard stereological techniques involving point counting of cell nuclei were used as described <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">(8)</xref> to determine the nuclear volume per testis of SCs, GCs, and the relative volumes of interstitium, seminiferous epithelium, and seminiferous tubule lumen. In brief, cross sections of testes from 4 to 6 MHAR KO or WT mice at d12, 21, 50, and 100 were examined using a Leitz 363 plan apo objective lens (&#x000d7;63) fitted to a Leitz Laborlux microscope and a 121-point eyepiece graticule (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). For each animal, 32&#x02013;64 microscopic fields were counted, and values for percent nuclear volume were converted to absolute nuclear volumes per testis by reference to testis volume (&#x0003d;weight). SC and LC nuclear size and seminiferous tubule diameter were determined using an Olympus Optical BH-2 microscope (Olympus Optical Co., Tokyo, Japan) fitted with a Prior automatic stage (Prior Scientific Instruments, Cambridge, UK) and Image-Pro Plus (version 4.5.1) with Stereologer-Pro 5 plug-in software (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD, USA). Data were used to determine the relative contribution of seminiferous epithelium and lumen to the testis volume, the average seminiferous tubule diameter, the nuclear volumes of and number of SCs and LCs per testis at d100, and the nuclear volume per testis of each type of GC.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemical analysis</title><p>In addition to PCR genotyping, mice were examined by immunohistochemistry for the presence of <italic>Cre</italic> and absence of AR in PTM cells, identified by immunoexpression of smooth muscle actin (SMA). AR expression in SCs and LCs was confirmed by fluorescent costaining of AR with WT-1 or 3&#x003b2;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/&#x00394;<sup>5</sup>-&#x00394;<sup>4</sup> isomerase (3&#x003b2;HSD), respectively. Single colorimetric immunohistochemistry was also performed for desmin, to demonstrate the smooth muscle layer; laminin, to highlight the basement membrane; WT-1, to demonstrate the location of SC nuclei; &#x003b2;-tubulin isotype III (Tubb3) expression in SCs; and luteinizing hormone (LH) receptor expression in LCs.</p><p>Sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and antigen retrieved before blocking of nonspecific binding sites, as detailed previously <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">(23)</xref>. Sections were incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with the primary antibody diluted accordingly (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Immunostaining was detected using the secondary antibody and detection system specified in <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Diaminobenzidine immunostained slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted with Pertex (Histolab, Gothenburg, Sweden), and images were captured using a Provis microscope (Olympus) equipped with a Kodak DCS330 camera (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY, USA). Fluorescent immunostained sections were mounted in Mowiol mounting medium (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA), and fluorescent images were captured using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta Axiovert 100M confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Ltd., Welwyn, UK). To ensure reproducibility of results, representative testes from &#x02265;3 animals at each age were used, and sections from PTM-ARKO and WT littermates were processed in parallel on the same slide on &#x02265;2 occasions. Appropriate negative controls were included to ensure that any staining observed was specific. The antibody for Cre recombinase results in GC staining, even in mice genotyped as <italic>Cre</italic>-negative; this staining was considered nonspecific. All other antibodies used showed only minor nonspecific staining.</p></sec><sec><title>Hormone analysis</title><p>Immediately after culling, blood was collected from mice by cardiac puncture. Sera were separated and stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C until assayed.

Intratesticular testosterone concentrations were measured as published previously <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">(26)</xref>. All samples from each mouse were run in a single assay for each hormone, and the within-assay coefficients of variation were all &#x0003c;10%.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA extraction and reverse transcription</title><p>RNA was isolated from frozen testes from MHAR KO or WT mice using the RNeasy Mini extraction kit with RNase-free DNase on the column digestion kit (Qiagen, Crawley, UK) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. For quantitative RT-PCR, 5 ng of luciferase mRNA (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) was added to each testis sample before RNA extraction as an external standard <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">(27)</xref>. RNA was quantified on a Thermo Scientific NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA). Random hexamer primed cDNA was prepared using the Applied Biosystems TaqMan reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of deletion of AR exon 2</title><p>RT-PCR was performed using BioMix Red <italic>Taq</italic> polymerase (Bioline, London, UK) on cDNA synthesized from testes from PTM-ARKO mice and WT littermates using primers for <italic>AR</italic> exons 1 and 3 (forward AAGCAGGTAGCTCTGGGACA; reverse CGTTTCTGCTGGCACATAGA); these primers revealed bands of 765 and 613 bp, relating to mice with a WT and or excised exon 2 allele of <italic>AR</italic>, respectively. A weak central band was also identified; this was confirmed to be an artifact by repeating the RT-PCR for <italic>AR</italic> exon 2 using gel-purified combined <italic>AR</italic> exon 2 PCR products from ARKO and WT mice as a template (<italic>i.e.</italic>, no genomic DNA was included in the reaction, yet the central band was present).</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative analysis of gene expression</title><p>Quantitative PCR was performed for the genes listed in <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, using an ABI Prism 7500 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) and the Roche Universal ProbeLibrary (Roche, Welwyn, UK), according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions.

All MHAR and SMAR males were hemizygous for X-linked <italic>AR</italic><sup><italic>flox</italic></sup>, whereas &#x0223c;50% of these males also carried the <italic>Cre</italic> transgene (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></bold></xref>, KO); the <italic>AR</italic><sup><italic>flox</italic></sup>-positive <italic>Cre</italic>-negative male littermates were used as WT controls.</p><p>To confirm that Cre recombinase was functioning in these mice, we assayed for the deletion of exon 2 of the <italic>AR</italic> in testes from MHAR and SMAR males by RT-PCR. MHAR and SMAR WT testes only expressed the full-length (WT) band whereas ARKO testes only expressed the smaller KO band, confirming that exon 2 of the <italic>AR</italic> had been deleted from all cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>). Testes from MHAR and SMAR KOs expressed both the WT and the KO band, as expected, demonstrating that <italic>AR</italic> had been deleted only from a proportion of cells within the testis (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>). Note that the weak central band was confirmed to be a PCR artifact (data not shown).</p><p>Immunohistochemical analysis was therefore undertaken to identify which cells in the testes expressed Cre recombinase. MHAR WTs showed no specific testicular Cre recombinase immunoexpression at d100, whereas both the PTM cells and the smooth muscle cells around the blood vessels stained positively for Cre recombinase in MHAR KO mice (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>). Variation was seen in the proportion of PTM cells staining positively for Cre recombinase both between and within different mice (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>). The average proportion of Cre recombinase-positive PTM cells was 40% (ranging between 24 and 82%). SMAR WTs also showed no specific testicular Cre recombinase immunoexpression at d100, whereas the smooth muscle cells around the blood vessels immunostained for Cre recombinase in SMAR KO mice (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>). No Cre recombinase immunostaining was seen in PTM cells in any SMAR <italic>Cre</italic>-positive KO mice (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>). Immunohistochemical analysis for AR, costained with SMA and Cre recombinase (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref>), showed that, as expected, AR and Cre recombinase were never coexpressed in the same cell (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref>). AR was detected in all PTM cell nuclei in MHAR WT (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref>), SMAR WT (data not shown), and SMAR KO (data not shown) testes at d100. Conversely, AR was absent from many, but not all, PTM cells in MHAR KO testes (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref>). AR was also absent from the blood vessel smooth muscle cells in both MHAR KO and SMAR KO testes (data not shown).</p><p>As we have conclusively shown that the PTM cells do not express Cre recombinase and continue to express AR in <italic>Cre</italic>-positive SMAR mice, further analysis was only undertaken in MHAR mice. From this point, MHAR KO mice will be referred to as PTM-ARKO.</p></sec><sec><title>Onset of Cre recombinase expression in PTM-ARKO testes</title><p>PTM-ARKO testes at e17.5&#x02013;d100 were assayed for the deletion of exon 2 of the <italic>AR</italic> by RT-PCR of cDNA, as used in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>.

Therefore, AR has been deleted from PTM cells around the age at which AR is normally first expressed.</p></sec><sec><title>Characterization of the reproductive system in PTM-ARKO mice</title><p>Body weight was not significantly different between PTM-ARKO and WT males at any age (data not shown).

In PTM-ARKOs, testes were normally descended in adults but were obviously smaller than those in the WT littermates (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref> and inset).

We show that cross-breeding AR<sup>flox</sup> female mice with the SM22-Cre line does not alter AR expression in testicular PTM cells, whereas the smMHC-Cre line does delete AR from a proportion of PTM cells; both lines deleted AR from smooth muscle cells surrounding testicular blood vessels. This differential effectiveness of these Cre lines is consistent with the demonstration that Cre recombinase is poorly expressed in testes from SM22-Cre mice <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">(19)</xref> yet highly expressed in testes from smMHC-Cre mice <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">(19)</xref> and explains the very different testicular phenotypes we observed when these mouse lines were used to ablate AR. Namely, using the SM22-Cre line (<italic>i.e.</italic>, deleting AR from blood vessels) did not affect fertility, as reported previously using the same Cre line <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">(18)</xref>, whereas using the smMHC-Cre line (resulting in PTM-ARKO mice) abolished sperm production and fertility, despite the fact that not all PTM cells are AR-negative. Note that any potential confounding effects resulting from additional ablation of AR in the blood vessels in PTM-ARKO mice can be accounted for by the phenotype induced by the blood vessel-specific SM22-Cre line <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">(18)</xref>. Our results are therefore the first <italic>in vivo</italic> demonstration that androgen action on PTM cells is essential for normal spermatogenesis and fertility.</p><p>In contrast with ARKO mice <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">(8)</xref>, reproductive tract formation and testes descent were normal in PTM-ARKO males. However, the testes were almost 70% smaller in PTM-ARKO adult males than in their WT littermates, with almost no sperm production. Interestingly, at d12 there was no reduction in testis weight in PTM-ARKO males, and the testes were histologically comparable to WT testes with no reduction in GCs. Cre recombinase was expressed in the PTM cells from e17.5; this finding may imply that PTM-mediated AR signaling is not essential before puberty. However, in our PTM-ARKO mice, AR is not deleted from all PTM cells. Therefore, the lack of an obvious phenotype at d12 may reflect patchy AR deletion and the fact that the remaining AR-positive PTM cells are sufficient to enable normal early testis development; this theory requires further investigation. Despite the patchy AR deletion from PTM cells, all PTM-ARKO males were infertile, and spermatogenesis was severely impaired. This finding demonstrates a crucial role for PTM-dependent AR signaling in male fertility.</p><p>PTM-ARKO mice were azoospermic with a significant reduction in all types of GCs. This reduction in GCs in PTM-ARKO mice became progressively worse from d21 onward, with almost no elongate spermatids in adults. Indeed, the reduction in both spermatocyte and spermatid number is greater than that reported in SCARKO mice <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">(8)</xref>. Because of the structure of the seminiferous epithelium and the presence of inter-SC tight junctions, any effect on postmeiotic GCs must be mediated <italic>via</italic> the SCs; this result therefore suggests that the reduction in postmeiotic GCs in PTM-ARKO mice is likely to be mediated <italic>via</italic> interactions with and effects on SCs. As in ARKOs <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">(8)</xref>, spermatogonial numbers were reduced in PTM-ARKO mice, unlike in SCARKO mice in which spermatogonial numbers are normal and there is a specific block in GC maturation at meiosis <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">(8)</xref>. Our data suggest that spermatogonial number may be regulated by androgens acting <italic>via</italic> PTM cells; this is perhaps not surprising because PTM cells are in intimate contact with these basally located GCs. In their studies on SM22-AR<sup>&#x02212;/y</sup> mice, Zhang <italic>et al</italic><italic>.</italic><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">(18)</xref> reported a 25% reduction in GC number, but no change in GC ratio, therefore confirming that the 85% reduction in GCs and spermatogonial loss in our PTM-ARKOs is due to ablation of AR from PTM cells not from the smooth muscle surrounding the blood vessels. This reduction in spermatogonia in PTM-ARKO mice may be due to alterations to the basement membrane and so reduced attachment. The reduction in GCs in PTM-ARKO mice is similar to that reported in rats with reduced testicular androgen concentrations <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">(1</xref><xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">, 31)</xref>. This finding suggests that the phenotype reported in these androgen-deficient rats may be due in part to PTM cell-mediated effects and not just to altered androgen-dependent SC signaling, which has previously been the primary focus. Although our results in PTM-ARKO mice demonstrate an essential role for AR signaling <italic>via</italic> PTM cells in GC maturation, it is also important to consider what effect this has on other cell types, namely the SCs (<italic>via</italic> stromal-epithelial interactions) and LCs.</p><p>It has long been recognized that stromal-epithelial interactions play a vital role in mediating androgen action throughout the male reproductive tract, but there is little <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence for this role in the testis. In mice, SC proliferation occurs during late fetal and early neonatal life <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">(32)</xref> and is believed to be mediated in part by androgens, possibly acting <italic>via</italic> PTM cells because the SC number is dramatically reduced in ARKO mice but only slightly reduced in SCARKO mice <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">(27)</xref>. However, in our studies, no reduction in SC number was found in PTM-ARKO mice at d100, unlike in ARKOs <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">(33)</xref>. This finding could suggest that SC number is not determined by AR signaling <italic>via</italic> PTM cells. However, as AR was not ablated from all PTM cells in our PTM-ARKOs, residual PTM AR signaling may have been sufficient to allow normal SC proliferation; this theory merits further investigation. Based on several key criteria, SCs mature normally in PTM-ARKO testes and express AR, suggesting that these processes are not dependent on AR signaling <italic>via</italic> PTM cells and that any changes in SC function cannot be attributed to any gross alteration in maturation or AR expression in SCs themselves. However, in PTM-ARKO testes, each SC supported fewer GCs than in WT littermates and seminiferous tubule diameter and lumen volume were both reduced, similar to the phenotype reported in ARKO and SCARKO testes <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">(8)</xref>. The presence of a lumen reflects production of seminiferous tubule fluid by SCs, which has previously been shown to be dependent on FSH <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">(34</xref><xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">, 35)</xref> during puberty and on androgens later in life <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">(6</xref><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">, 8)</xref>. Thus, our results demonstrate that SC function is altered in PTM-ARKO testes, even though the SCs continue to express AR and FSH levels are elevated. This important new finding highlights an indirect role (<italic>via</italic> PTM cells) for AR signaling in mediating SC function and may offer some explanation for the reduced GC development and infertility seen in PTM-ARKO mice. For example, reduced seminiferous tubule fluid production will affect nutrient transport to the GCs <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">(6)</xref> and would impair spermatogenesis. This new <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence for androgen-dependent stromal (PTM)-epithelial (SC) interactions in the testis parallels the androgen-driven mechanisms reported to mediate development and function of the rest of the male reproductive tract <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">(9</xref><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">, 10)</xref>.</p><p>Despite many years of study, exactly how androgens regulate spermatogenesis is not known. Studies in SCARKO mice have identified changes in SC gene expression, which could affect spermatogenesis <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">(27</xref><xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">, 28)</xref>. Reductions in expression of three of these androgen-dependent SC-specific genes, <italic>Rhox5</italic>, <italic>Tubb3</italic>, and <italic>Eppin</italic>, were identified in PTM-ARKO testes at d100, providing further evidence for altered SC function. Conversely, expression of <italic>ABP</italic>, another SC-specific gene, was not significantly altered in PTM-ARKO testes, unlike in SCARKO testes in which <italic>ABP</italic> was increased <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">(27)</xref>. These results suggest that genes previously reported to be dependent on androgen action in SCs <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">(27</xref><xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">, 28)</xref>, may also be affected by androgens acting <italic>via</italic> PTM cells and that a complex dynamic exists between PTM and SCs that may affect their ability to respond to hormones. This observation highlights possible mechanisms <italic>via</italic> which spermatogenesis could be affected in PTM-ARKO mice. These changes in gene expression provide further <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence that altered AR signaling <italic>via</italic> the stromal PTM cells has &#x0201c;knock-on&#x0201d; effects on the function of the epithelial SCs and thereafter on GC development. <italic>WT-1</italic> gene expression was also reduced in PTM-ARKO testes, yet WT-1 protein could still be detected by immunohistochemistry. This result merits further investigation into the implications on SC function; however, it has been shown that <italic>WT-1</italic> heterozygous KO mice are fertile <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">(36)</xref>, suggesting that this reduction in <italic>WT-1</italic> mRNA in PTM-ARKO mice may not affect fertility.</p><p>PTM cells in mice are normally arranged in a single layer surrounding the seminiferous tubules, but in ARKO mice, PTM cells form multiple layers <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">(8)</xref>. PTM cell layering was normal in both PTM-ARKO and SCARKO testes <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">(8)</xref>, which could suggest that neither PTM nor SC AR signaling regulates PTM cell layering. However, because AR has not been ablated from all PTM cells in our PTM-ARKO mice, the residual PTM AR signaling could be sufficient to maintain PTM cells in a normal single layer. It is believed that this single layer of PTM cells contract to help with transport of mature sperm through the seminiferous tubules <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">(37)</xref>. In PTM-ARKO testes, a progressive decrease was noted in the immunoexpression of desmin and SMA in PTM cells but not in the smooth muscle cells surrounding the blood vessels. This reduction in smooth muscle protein expression in PTM cells may reflect an androgen-dependent loss of a smooth muscle phenotype, resulting in an impaired ability to contract. This possible androgen dependency of PTM cell contractility has been reported previously <italic>in vitro</italic><xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">(38)</xref> and merits further study.</p><p>PTM cells are also involved in laying down the basement membrane, which not only gives the seminiferous tubule structural support but is also thought to be important for communication with and effects on SCs. Disruption to the basement membrane surrounding the seminiferous tubules in PTM-ARKOs is likely to impair cell communication particularly with the neighboring SCs and spermatogonia. This finding may have implications for maintaining spermatogonia within their niche attached to the basement membrane, which permits their movement laterally along the basement membrane (reviewed in ref. <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) and merits further investigation in PTM-ARKO testes. The seminiferous epithelium appeared disorganized in PTM-ARKO testes, with SC nuclei often displaced from their normal basal location, suggesting that these SCs may also be losing their attachment to the damaged basement membrane, similar to that reported in SCARKO testes <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">(40)</xref>. This disorganization and apparent lack of polarity observed in PTM-ARKO testes is likely to have implications for SC function and is probably due to altered signaling from the PTM cells as well as the reduction in spermatogonial number, as it has been shown that the presence of GCs plays a role in maintaining SC size and organization within seminiferous tubules <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">(41</xref><xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">, 42)</xref>. These data highlight an important role for androgen signaling <italic>via</italic> PTM cells in maintaining normal seminiferous tubule structure and function and may offer a possible mechanism for impaired GC development and infertility in PTM-ARKOs.</p><p>LC AR expression was normal in PTM-ARKO testes, implying that any effect on LC function must be due to deletion of AR from PTM cells and/or the smooth muscle cells around the blood vessels. LC number per testis was also unchanged in PTM-ARKO testes at d100, compared with WT testes. This result is in contrast to the decrease in LC number seen in ARKO, SCARKO, and FSHRKO testes in adulthood <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">(43</xref><xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">, 44)</xref> and is in agreement with the belief that SCs and not the PTM cells regulate LC number <italic>via</italic> both FSHR and AR signaling <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">(43</xref><xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">, 44)</xref>. It is less clear what regulates adult LC size, with a reduction reported in ARKO testes <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">(43)</xref>, an increase in SCARKO testes <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">(43)</xref>, and no change in PTM-ARKO testes. The primary function of the LC is to produce testosterone and in PTM-ARKO adult males serum testosterone concentrations were unaltered whereas intratesticular testosterone (ITT) and serum LH were both elevated. This elevation was not due to any obvious deficiencies in LHR expression in LCs but is indicative of compensatory LC failure, which may be the result of impaired transport of the testicular testosterone out into the bloodstream and so reduced negative feedback to the pituitary. The hormone profile reported here in PTM-ARKO mice is similar to that reported in ARKO mice, whereas no increase in serum LH or testosterone levels was observed in SCARKO adult mice <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">(43)</xref>. Furthermore, no change in serum testosterone or LH was reported by Zhang <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">(18)</xref> with SM22-Cre to ablate AR expression. Taken together, these results suggest that the changes in hormone concentrations reported here in PTM-ARKO mice are specifically due to ablating AR from the PTM cells and not to deletion of AR from the blood vessel smooth muscle cells. High ITT is associated with spermatogonial arrest <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">(45)</xref>; therefore, the high ITT in PTM-ARKO mice might also offer some explanation for the reduced GC numbers.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>We have successfully generated a PTM-ARKO mouse model that demonstrates the essential role <italic>in vivo</italic> for AR signaling <italic>via</italic> the PTM cells in normal spermatogenesis and male fertility.
