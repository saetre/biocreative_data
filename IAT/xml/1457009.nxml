During that period, we identified all breast cancer cases at diagnosis through the six regional cancer registries in Sweden, to which reporting of all malignant tumours is mandatory. We randomly selected controls from the Swedish Registry of Total Population that matched the cases in 5-y age strata. Of the eligible cases (3,979) and controls (4,188), 3,345 (84&#x00025;) cases and 3,454 (82&#x00025;) controls participated in the initial questionnaire-based study providing detailed information about menopausal hormone use, reproductive history, and other lifestyle factors. </p><p>From this initial study, we randomly selected 1,500 cases and 1,500 age-frequency matched controls among the postmenopausal participants without any previous malignancy (except carcinoma in situ of the cervix or nonmelanoma skin cancer). With the intention of increasing statistical power in subgroup analyses, we further selected all remaining cases and controls (191 cases and 108 controls) who had used menopausal hormones (oestrogen only or any combination of oestrogen and progestin) for at least 4 y, and all (110 cases and 104 controls) with self-reported diabetes mellitus. Additionally, 345 controls that were shared between the initial breast cancer study and an endometrial cancer study with same inclusion criteria were added to our control sample. In total, we selected 1,828 cases and 2,057 controls.</p><p>Upon providing informed consent, participants donated whole blood. We collected archived paraffin-embedded, non-cancerous tissue samples for deceased breast cancer cases as well as for those breast cancer cases that declined to donate blood but consented to our use of the tissue. We obtained blood samples and archived tissue samples for 1,321 and 275 breast cancer patients, respectively, and blood samples from 1,524 controls. Reasons for nonparticipation included a lack of interest in research or a negative attitude towards genetic research, old age, and severe disease or death. For deceased cases and cases that consented to our access to tissue, the major reason for nonparticipation was unwillingness or lack of time at the respective pathology departments to retrieve the tissue. Population-based participation rates (taking into account the proportion that did not participate in the questionnaire study) for cases and controls were 73&#x00025; and 61&#x00025;, respectively.</p><p>This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards in Sweden and at the National University of Singapore.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>DNA Isolation</title><p>DNA was extracted by the Swegene laboratories in Malm&#x000f6; (Sweden) from 4 ml of whole blood using the QIAamp DNA Blood Maxi Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, California, United States) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

SNPs were genotyped using the Sequenom primer extension-based assay (San Diego, California, United States) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, multiplex primer extension assays were designed with the SpectroDesigner software. As template, 5 ng of genomic DNA was used in a multiplex PCR reaction. The PCR product was further purified before the primer extension reaction to generate allele-specific base extension products. The base-extension products were detected in the MassARRAY time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) system (Sequenom) to determine genotypes. All genotyping results were generated and checked by laboratory staff unaware of case-control status. Only SNPs for which more than 85&#x00025; of the samples gave a genotype call were used in further analyses. We genotyped 200 randomly selected SNPs in the 92 control samples using both the Sequenom system and the BeadArray system from Illumina (San Diego, California, United States). The genotype concordance was over 99.5&#x00025;, suggesting high genotyping accuracy. </p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Linkage Disequilibrium Characterization and TagSNP Selection</title><p>To characterize the linkage disequilibrium (LD) pattern, we calculated pairwise <italic>D</italic>&#x02032; and <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> values using two-SNP haplotypes inferred via the EH plus program &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030168-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. We reconstructed haplotypes using the PLEM algorithm &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030168-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d; implemented in the <italic>tagSNPs</italic> program &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030168-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;, and selected tagSNPs based on the <italic>R</italic><sub>h</sub><sup>2</sup> coefficient. <italic>R</italic><sub>h</sub><sup>2</sup> is the squared correlation between true haplotype dosage (number of copies of a haplotype) and the haplotype dosage predicted by tagSNPs. We chose tagSNPs so that common SNP genotypes and common haplotypes were predicted with an <italic>R</italic><sub>h</sub><sup>2</sup> value of 0.8 or higher &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030168-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. In order to evaluate our tagSNP performance in capturing unobserved SNPs within <italic>CHEK2,</italic> and to assess whether we needed a denser set of markers, we performed the SNP-dropping analysis &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030168-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;. In brief, each of the 14 genotyped SNPs was dropped in turn, and tagSNPs were selected from the remaining 13 SNPs so that their haplotypes predicted the 13 SNPs with an <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> value of 0.9 &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030168-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. A slightly more stringent value of 0.9 was used here, as we were predicting only SNPs and not haplotypes with our tagSNPs. We then estimated how well the tagSNP haplotypes of the remaining 13 SNPs predicted the dropped SNP, an evaluation that can provide an unbiased and accurate estimate of tagSNP performance &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030168-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;. This method assumes the markers to be a random selection of the polymorphisms in the gene. However, some intervals between adjacent genotyped SNPs exceeded 5 kb. We therefore employed additional tests for these intervals. If the tagSNPs selected using only the set of SNPs on one side of the interval predicted the individual SNPs on the other side sufficiently well, then we judged the coverage to be adequate. We had five intervals greater than 5 kb, thus ten sets of predictions. One of these ten was ignored, as there were only two SNPs to the left of the gap. </p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>We first conducted the haplotype-based association analysis, since the tagSNPs were chosen primarily such that their haplotypes can accurately predict common SNPs in the gene. Our testing strategy was to first fit a single model and to assess for each stratum the haplotype-trait association as a global likelihood ratio test (on 7 degrees of freedom). The global test corresponds to carrying out seven tests on 1 degree of freedom each, and applying a correction for multiple hypothesis testing. Only if the global test was significant did we proceed to testing individual haplotype contrasts, adjusting for multiple testing &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030168-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;. We first computed expected haplotype dosage using haplotype frequencies estimated for cases and controls combined, assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). We then included the haplotype dosage as a covariate in a logistic regression model conditioned on the variables used for sampling: age (5-y age groups), menopausal oestrogen only use (never, &#x0003c; 4 y, or &#x02265; 4 y), menopausal oestrogen and progestin use (never, &#x0003c; 4 y, or &#x02265;&#x02009;4&#x02009;y) and self-reported diabetes mellitus (yes or no). The appropriateness of the approach, which in imputing haplotypes does not condition on disease status and the nonrandom ascertainment scheme, is argued for by Stram et al. &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030168-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. That is, when <italic>R</italic><sub>h</sub><sup>2</sup> values are high, as is the case here, point and interval estimates obtained by this approach will be reasonably accurate. Confounding has been defined as the presence of a common cause to the exposure and the outcome &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030168-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;, and we believe that the lifestyle and reproductive breast cancer risk factors, shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0030168-t001">Table 1</xref>, are unlikely to cause genetic variation in <italic>CHEK2</italic>. However, to assess whether the risk factors could be intermediates in the causal pathway between <italic>CHEK2</italic> and breast cancer, we tested whether there was an association between the tagSNPs and any of the risk factors among the randomly sampled controls using a Kruskal-Wallis test. We also assessed the associations between groups of haplotypes and breast cancer risk. Since there is no biological reason to cluster haplotypes on the basis of their frequency, we employed a Bayesian association mapping approach &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030168-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d; that clusters haplotypes according to their allelic similarity. </p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Study Population</title><p>Selected characteristics of the participants in the parent questionnaire study and the current genetic study are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0030168-t001">Table 1</xref>.

However, no significant differences in genotype frequencies were evident between cases who participated via blood or tissue samples (unpublished data). Furthermore, genotype frequencies were similar between tumours cm or smaller in diameter without lymph node involvement and tumours larger than 2 cm or with spread to regional lymph nodes (unpublished data). </p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>LD Pattern and Coverage Estimation</title><p>Of 34 successfully genotyped SNPs in <italic>CHEK2,</italic> 23 were polymorphic ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030168-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0030168-t002">Table 2</xref>), but five of them showed a significant deviation ( <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) from HWE and were therefore excluded from further analyses. The five problematic SNPs were all located within the shared region between <italic>CHEK2</italic> and several homologous pseudogenes &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030168-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d;. Of the remaining 18 polymorphic SNPs, 14 were common (here defined as having a minor allele frequency &#x0005b;MAF&#x0005d; of at least 0.03) and were therefore used to characterize the LD pattern and haplotype structure within <italic>CHEK2</italic>. The 14 SNPs spanned 52 kb of the gene, which yielded a mean and median density of one SNP per 4 kb and 3.2 kb, respectively. The D&#x02032; pattern ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030168-g001">Figure 1</xref>) suggested strong LD across <italic>CHEK2</italic> without extensive recombination, and we therefore treated the whole gene as a single haplotype block in our subsequent haplotype reconstruction. We identified a total of 31 haplotypes from the 14 SNPs, six of which were common (i.e., had an estimated population frequency of at least 0.03) and accounted for 81&#x00025; of the chromosomes ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0030168-t003">Table 3</xref>). We selected six tagSNPs from the 14 common SNPs ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030168-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0030168-t002">Table 2</xref>) that could efficiently and accurately predict the eight remaining common SNPs and the six common haplotypes within <italic>CHEK2</italic> with an average <italic>R</italic><sub>h</sub><sup>2</sup> of 0.94. </p><p>Four of the 34 typed <italic>CHEK2</italic> SNPs were nonsynonymous coding polymorphisms ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0030168-t002">Table 2</xref>). None of these polymorphisms were common and, except for the <italic>1100delC</italic> mutation, were not analyzed further. </p><p>Since one cannot assume that tagSNPs capture nongenotyped SNPs as efficiently as genotyped SNPs &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030168-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d;, we used the SNP dropping method &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030168-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d; to evaluate tagSNP performance. We found that the dropped SNPs were captured with an average <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> of 0.93, with 13 of the 14 dropped SNPs (93&#x00025;) having an <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> greater than 0.75. Therefore, the six selected tagSNPs could efficiently capture not only all the genotyped but also unobserved common SNPs within <italic>CHEK2</italic>. Some intervals between adjacent SNPs exceeded 5 kb. We found the average proportion of the variance on one side of the intervals captured by tagSNPs chosen from the other side was at least 0.68 and averaged 0.75. This is likely to be an underestimate, as the markers considered were a much greater distance apart than the polymorphisms in the intervals of interest. Thus we consider such gaps to present little problem and conclude that our gene is sufficiently densely genotyped and that our tagSNPs effectively capture the common variation present in the gene. </p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Association Analyses</title><p>We successfully genotyped the six tagSNPs in 1,577 breast cancer cases and 1,513 controls. All six tagSNPs were in HWE among the controls (unpublished data). We assessed, among the randomly selected controls, whether any of the tagSNPs were associated with the lifestyle and reproductive breast cancer risk factors shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0030168-t001">Table 1</xref>. <italic>TAG2</italic> and <italic>TAG4</italic> were statistically associated with parity ( <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.029 and <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.009, respectively), which showed a statistically significant trend for allelic dose ( <italic>TAG2, p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.006; <italic>TAG4, p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.0002). </p><p>We identified 19 rare ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st001">Table S1</xref>) and seven common haplotypes from the six tagSNPs ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0030168-t004">Table 4</xref>). The 19 rare haplotypes were collapsed into a single group in the association analyses. One additional common haplotype was identified in the full set of controls, which was not identified in the preliminary 92 controls. A global test of association, including all common haplotypes and the 19 rare haplotypes as one group in the model, was not statistically significant (likelihood ratio test, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.19). <xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0030168-t004">Table 4</xref> presents odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (CIs) for tagSNP haplotypes using the most common haplotype (haplotype 1) as reference. None of the common haplotypes increased the risk of breast cancer, but the comparison between the group of 19 rare haplotypes against the reference showed a slight association with breast cancer risk (OR 1.24; 95&#x00025; CI, 1.02&#x02013;1.51), which did not, however, carry over to the global test, in which multiple testing has been formally accounted for. After excluding the <italic>1100delC</italic> carriers ( <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 28) from the analysis, this association decreased (OR 1.20; 95&#x00025; CI, 0.98&#x02013;1.47), whilst the odds ratios for the common haplotypes remained unchanged. Comparing carriers to noncarriers of each haplotype, instead of using haplotype 1 as reference, did not substantially affect the results (unpublished data). Considering only breast cancer cases eventually diagnosed with a second breast cancer ( <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 72) similarly did not provide any convincing association ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st002">Table S2</xref>). These findings remained unaltered after restricting the analyses to the randomly selected cases and controls or after including other breast cancer risk factors, including parity, as covariates in the logistic regression models. </p><p>We stratified the haplotype analysis by several breast cancer risk factors: first-degree family history, body mass index, age at first birth, menopausal hormone use, and parity ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st003">Tables S3</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st007">S7</xref>, respectively). None of the stratified analyses yielded a significant (&#x003b1; &#x0003d; 0.05) global test of association. </p><p>The 19 rare haplotypes accounted for approximately 20&#x00025; of the chromosomes.

The deletion was slightly more common in the cases (0.7&#x00025;) than in the controls, and the corresponding age- and sampling scheme-adjusted odds ratio for carriers versus noncarriers was 2.26 (95&#x00025; CI, 0.99&#x02013;5.15) ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0030168-t005">Table 5</xref>). The <italic>1100delC</italic> was exclusively carried on rare haplotypes, which may explain the marginally significant association between the group of 19 rare haplotypes and breast cancer risk ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0030168-t004">Table 4</xref>). </p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our extensive linkage disequilibrium mapping association study did not provide support for an association between common variations in <italic>CHEK2</italic> and breast cancer risk. The <italic>1100delC</italic> mutation was more common in cases than in controls in our study population, but the difference was not statistically significant. The genotype frequencies were similar to those reported in other populations, thus confirming that our study population is representative of other Northern European populations. </p><p>The population on which our study was based is relatively large, well defined, and genetically homogenous. We were able to cover the majority of common variations in the <italic>CHEK2</italic> gene by genotyping a relatively dense map of markers. We had detailed information about hormone-related risk factors for breast cancer that allowed us to explore gene-environment interactions. We also assessed the statistical power of our study. Until now, the power evaluations of <italic>CHEK2</italic> genetic studies have been carried out under the assumption that the genetic risk allele is being directly tested &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030168-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. This approach misleadingly overestimates power, because the susceptibility allele is rarely tested directly. Our detailed understanding of the LD pattern across <italic>CHEK2</italic> allowed us to overcome these limitations and estimate power more accurately. To estimate power we used a method described by Chapman et al. &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030168-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;, which assumes codominant effects at an unobserved locus (assuming 80&#x00025; power, an &#x003b1;-value of 0.05, and <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> &#x0003d; 0.9 for the ability of haplotypes to predict the allele count at the causal locus). We estimate that our study should be able to detect a disease susceptibility locus with an odds ratio of 1.23 if its MAF is 0.5, of 1.25 if MAF &#x0003d; 0.35, of 1.32 if MAF &#x0003d; 0.15, or of 1.55 if MAF &#x0003d; 0.05. Therefore, given the comprehensive coverage of common genetic variants within <italic>CHEK2</italic> by our tagSNP approach, it is unlikely that any common disease allele of at least moderate effect was missed in our study. </p><p>Selection bias could have arisen in this study, as nonparticipation was related to severe disease or death. However, <italic>CHEK2</italic> genotype frequencies were not significantly different between cases donating tissue samples, representing more ill or deceased patients, and cases donating blood samples. This nonparticipation thus affected only the generalizability of our study. </p><p>The <italic>1100delC</italic> variant has not previously been studied in the Swedish population. The variant is rare &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030168-b015">15</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030168-b021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030168-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;, except in a few Northern European populations such as Finland and the Netherlands, where moderate frequency of 1&#x00025; or above has been observed &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030168-b011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030168-b012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030168-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. The low population frequency of <italic>1100delC</italic> in the Swedish population is therefore generally in line with previous data. Furthermore, the corresponding odds ratio for carriers versus noncarriers was 2.26 (95&#x00025; CI, 0.99&#x02013;5.15), which is also consistent with the results from other Northern European populations &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030168-b022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030168-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. Taken together, the results of our <italic>1100delC</italic> analysis confirm that our case-control sample is representative of a Northern European population. </p><p>A few pathogenic variants have been identified by sequencing <italic>CHEK2</italic>, examples of which are <italic>1100delC</italic> and <italic>I157T</italic> &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030168-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. Association analyses of these variants in various different populations suggest that these variants are associated with moderate risk for breast cancer and have a low population frequency &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030168-b015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030168-b023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030168-b024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030168-b026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030168-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. The pathological effect of <italic>1100delC</italic> was suggested to be due to haploinsufficiency caused by the lost function of the <italic>1100delC</italic> truncated protein &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030168-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d;. In contrast, by introducing a nonconservative amino acid change into the forkhead-associated domain of CHEK2, <italic>I157T</italic> may produce a dominant-negative effect by forming heterodimers with wild-type CHEK2 protein &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030168-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. The <italic>I157T</italic> mutation could also have a pathological effect by producing a defective protein for binding and phosphorylating its downstream target, Cdc25A, and for binding p53 and BRCA1 &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030168-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. Given the fact that CHEK2 plays a central role in the DNA damage checkpoint and apoptosis pathways &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030168-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d;, the modest effect of the <italic>CHEK2</italic> pathogenic variants is surprising. It is however most likely due to the functional redundancy in the crucial DNA damage checkpoint pathway and thus the compensation of defect in CHEK2 function by other members of the pathway. This mechanism was suggested in a recent study showing that the normal degradation of Cdc25A is was shown to be maintained in the carriers of the <italic>1100delC</italic> variant &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030168-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d;. Our association study supports other reports &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030168-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d; indicating that, besides the known pathogenic coding variants, it is unlikely that other common coding or noncoding variants play a significant role in a predisposition to breast cancer. This is consistent with the notion discussed by Cybulski et al. &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030168-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d; that there are three classes of risk genes for breast cancer: a class of genes in which mutations are rare but confer a very high relative risk (including <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic>); a class in which variants are common but confer only modest risk (few if any such genes have been confirmed to date); and a class (including <italic>CHEK2</italic>) in which mutations are rare but associated with only modest risk. Although the idea is speculative, <italic>CHEK2</italic> may exercise a pleiotropic effect as a central player in the DNA damage checkpoint and apoptosis pathways on other biological processes than its role in carcinogenesis, and this may provide necessary selection pressure to maintain its functional variants at a low population frequency. </p><p>To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive evaluation of the association between the genetic variation within <italic>CHEK2</italic> and postmenopausal breast cancer risk. However, despite the role of the <italic>CHEK2</italic> gene in breast cancer aetiology, we conclude that common variations in <italic>CHEK2</italic> do not affect breast cancer risk, at least not in the Swedish population. On the other hand, our study cannot exclude the possible influence of rare genetic variants in <italic>CHEK2,</italic> such as the <italic>CHEK2</italic>&#x0002a; <italic>1100delC,</italic> on breast cancer risk. Investigation of such rare risk alleles in a population-based design requires a much larger sample size than the one utilized in the present study. </p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"

id="sb1a"><title>Background.</title><p>Approximately 5&#x00025; of breast cancer patients have a strong familial risk for the disease. In these families, multiple family members are usually affected, often at an early age (before they are 35). Rare inherited variants in two genes, <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2,</italic> are responsible for the high breast cancer risk in most of these &#x0201c;breast cancer families.&#x0201d; Among the other 95&#x00025; of women with breast cancer who are not known to have inherited one of these high-risk variants, there may still be some inherited susceptibility to the disease: about 10&#x00025; of women have a &#x0201c;moderate&#x0201d; family history of breast cancer. The inherited genetic factors that are responsible for the more common but weaker susceptibility to breast cancer are so far mostly unknown. These factors could, for example, be common variants in many different genes, each of which on their own cause only a moderately raised risk (although more common variants of the <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> genes do not seem to be associated with breast cancer). </p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p><italic>CHEK2</italic> is another gene that has been associated with familial breast cancer. In some breast cancer families without mutations in <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2,</italic> a specific variant of <italic>CHEK2</italic> (called <italic>1100delC,</italic> indicating a deletion at position 1100) occurred frequently in patients with breast cancer. The association between this particular <italic>CHEK2</italic> variant and an increased risk of breast cancer was confirmed in a large study that looked at approximately 10,000 patients with breast cancer and 10,000 controls. However, the <italic>1100delC</italic> variant of <italic>CHEK2</italic> is rare, and scientists want to know whether more common variants of the gene were associated with breast cancer. A number of previous studies that looked at two common variants of <italic>CHEK2</italic> had not given consistent results. This study used six common variants to predict all common variants of <italic>CHEK2</italic> in a group of postmenopausal Swedish women and tested whether any of the six variants were associated with the women having breast cancer. </p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>They identified the six common variants by analyzing the DNA of the <italic>CHEK2</italic> gene in 92 Swedish women. They then compared the frequency of these common variants between approximately 1,500 women with breast cancer and 1,500 women of the same age and similar lifestyles without breast cancer. They found no association between any of the common variants and the likelihood of the women having breast cancer. </p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>This study suggests that Swedish women (or those of Northern European descent who have a similar genetic inheritance) who have any of the common variants of the <italic>CHEK2</italic> gene do not have a raised risk of getting breast cancer. However, this finding might not apply in other populations. As in previous studies, this study also found a raised risk of breast cancer for women who carried the rare <italic>1100delC</italic> variant, but the study was too small to test whether there are other rare variants that might also predispose to breast cancer. Overall, scientists have not yet found many common gene variants that increase the risk of getting cancer. But, to test conclusively for associations between genetic variants, both common and rare, and cancer, very large studies will be needed. Understanding how a person's genetic make-up and their environment and lifestyle influence their risk for certain cancers remains a challenge. </p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0030168">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0030168</ext-link>. </p><p>&#x02022;&#x02002; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/content/CRI_2_4_2X_What_are_the_risk_factors_for_breast_cancer_5.asp">Risk factors for breast cancer from the American Cancer Society</ext-link></p><p>&#x02022;&#x02002; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=gene%7B%7Bamp%7D%7Dcmd=Retrieve%7B%7Bamp%7D%7Ddopt=Graphics%7B%7Bamp%7D%7Dlist_uids=11200">Summary of information on the CHEK2 gene from the US National Center for Biotechnology Information</ext-link></p><p>&#x02022;&#x02002; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/cancerstats/types/breast/molecularbiologyandgenetics">Information on Breast Cancer molecular biology and genetics from Cancer Research UK</ext-link></p><p>&#x02022;&#x02002; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phgu.org.uk/info_database/diseases/cancer/breast.html">Information on breast cancer genetics from the UK Public Health Genetics Unit</ext-link></p></sec></sec></boxed-text></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to all the women who took the time and effort to participate in this study.
