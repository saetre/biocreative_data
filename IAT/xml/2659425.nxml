Indeed, during late stages of spermatogenesis, protein synthesis relies on the appropriate storage of translationally inactive mRNAs in transcriptionally silent spermatids. The factors and cellular compartments regulating mRNA storage and the timing of their translation are still poorly understood. The chromatoid body (CB), that shares components with the P. bodies found in somatic cells, has recently been proposed to be a site of mRNA processing. Here, we describe a new component of the CB, the RNA binding protein HuR, known in somatic cells to control the stability/translation of AU-rich containing mRNAs (ARE-mRNAs).</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Using a combination of cell imagery and sucrose gradient fractionation, we show that HuR localization is highly dynamic during spermatid differentiation. First, in early round spermatids, HuR colocalizes with the Mouse Vasa Homolog, MVH, a marker of the CB. As spermatids differentiate, HuR exits the CB and concomitantly associates with polysomes. Using computational analyses, we identified two testis ARE-containing mRNAs, <italic>Brd2</italic> and <italic>GCNF</italic> that are bound by HuR and MVH. We show that these target ARE-mRNAs follow HuR trafficking, accumulating successively in the CB, where they are translationally silent, and in polysomes during spermatid differentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Our results reveal a temporal regulation of HuR trafficking together with its target mRNAs from the CB to polysomes as spermatids differentiate. They strongly suggest that through the transport of ARE-mRNAs from the CB to polysomes, HuR controls the appropriate timing of ARE-mRNA translation. HuR might represent a major post-transcriptional regulator, by promoting mRNA storage and then translation, during male germ cell differentiation.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Spermatogenesis is a highly regulated process whereby the spermatogonial stem cells at the basal side of the seminiferous tubules divide and differentiate to give rise ultimately to spermatozoa. Once meiosis has taken place in spermatocytes, the newly formed haploid round spermatids will elongate and differentiate to spermatozoa by a process referred to as spermiogenesis. A remarkable event occurs during spermiogenesis, long before spermatids complete their differentiation into spermatozoa: histones are replaced by protamines, causing the compaction of the chromatin and a concomitant cessation of transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004900-Meistrich1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004900-Hecht1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, whilst proteins continue to be made. Thus, in contrast to most somatic tissues, where transcription and translation are concomitant, mRNA transcription and protein synthesis are temporally disconnected in the male germ cells. Consequently, late-stage specific protein synthesis relies on the appropriate storage of translationally inactive mRNAs in transcriptionally silent germ cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004900-Steger1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Among them, many encode RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004900-Iguchi1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, arguing that regulated mRNA storage, stabilization and translation are needed to ensure stage-specific protein synthesis.</p><p>The discovery that mRNPs are localized in various discrete cytoplasmic granules and cycle between different subcellular compartments has opened up new areas of research on mRNA fate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004900-Parker1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. In somatic cells, mRNA storage/decay takes place in specific cytoplasmic granules, in particular, Stress Granules (SGs) and Processing Bodies (P. Bodies). While P.

However, the germ cells of many organisms contain a perinuclear cytoplasmic cloud-like structure called &#x0201c;germ plasm&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;nuage&#x0201d;, characterized by the expression of VASA, an ATP-dependent DEAD-box RNA helicase, required for embryonic patterning, germ plasm assembly and germ cell functions in <italic>Drosophila</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004900-Johnstone1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.

No data are yet available on ARE-mRNA expression during spermatogenesis. To gain insight into this question, we analyzed the expression of ARE-transcripts in male germ cells. We first listed all murine and human ARE-mRNAs from the ARED Organism database (ARED 3.0: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://brp.kfshrc.edu.sa/ARED/">http://brp.kfshrc.edu.sa/ARED/</ext-link> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004900-Halees1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

Most mouse ARE-mRNAs (78&#x00025;) were detected in testis, some being exclusively (6&#x00025;, no exception) or preferentially (13&#x00025;, one exception in the normal non-testicular tissues) expressed in this tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004900-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004900.s005">Table S2</xref>). Almost one third of these specifically or preferentially expressed transcripts were only detected in meiotic (spermatocytes) and post-meiotic (spermatids) germ cells, and were not found in somatic (Sertoli) or mitotic (spermatogonia) testicular cells. Similar results were observed when the ARE-transcriptome of human germ cells was analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004900-g001">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004900-Bakheet1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>). ARE-mRNAs were enriched for several Gene Ontology (GO) terms, including reproduction (p value &#x0003c;0.001).

Signals observed with hnRNPC1 in NE preparations indicate that the nuclear preparations were contaminated with cytoplasmic components. B, C, D. Comparative sucrose gradient analysis of cytoplasmic extracts from P23, P28 and P40 testes. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from a pool of 8&#x02013;10 testes of the indicated age and loaded on a 15&#x02013;50&#x00025; sucrose density gradient. Eleven fractions were collected from each gradient and absorbance tracing at 260 nm was measured. For a given tracing, each point is represented as a percentage of total recovered absorbance. Tracings were superimposed to show that translation efficiency increases with age. The data shown are representative of two independent experiments. The direction of sedimentation (top to bottom of the gradient) and the components of the translational machinery in each fraction are indicated: no ribosome component, corresponding to RNPs, small and large ribosomal sub-units and monosome (Rib. Sub.U) and polysomes. Proteins were extracted from each fraction and expression profiles of control ribosomal sub-unit S6 and &#x003b1;-tubulin (C), HuR, MVH and Dcp1a (D) in P23, P28 and P40 cytoplasmic germ cell extracts were analyzed by Western blot. The graphs represent the percentage of the intensity of the signal in a given fraction expressed relative to the sum of the intensities found in the 11 fractions, considered as 100&#x00025;. HuR sedimentation with polysomes was tested by treating P40 cytoplasmic extract with <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> nuclease (MNase), which cleaves mRNA between polysomes. HuR initially sedimenting in both RNPs and polysomes containing fractions switches to low density fractions after MNase treatment.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0004900.g004"/></fig><p>To find out whether HuR associates with polysomes, we fractionated germ cell cytoplasmic extracts on sucrose gradients. In addition to P23 and P40, we used P28 testis extract, which is enriched in late round spermatids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004900-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). As shown by Western blot analysis, in the early phase of spermatid maturation (P23), HuR is predominantly found with low-density fractions, corresponding to RNPs, and ribosomal sub-units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004900-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). According to Grivna and collaborators, the CB sediments in the RNP fractions, as two of its components, GW182 and MVH, distribute in RNPs of P24 sucrose gradients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004900-Grivna1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Using DCP1a as another recognized marker of the CB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004900-Kotaja3">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, we confirmed that the CB accumulates in RNPs at the early stage of differentiation (P23) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004900-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Combined with data presented above, this result strongly suggests that the signal of HuR in low density fractions corresponds to CB-associated HuR. Remarkably, at later stages of spermatid maturation (P28 and P40), while DCP1a stays concentrated in RNP fractions, a portion of HuR and MVH sediments into denser regions of the gradients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004900-g004">Figure 4C</xref>), suggesting that a fraction of these two RNA binding proteins leaves the CB and associates with polysomes while differentiation proceeds. To validate this hypothesis, we treated P40 cell extracts before sedimentation with micrococcal nuclease, which dissociate polysomes. This treatment resulted in a shift of HuR and MVH (not shown) to low density fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004900-g004">Figure 4C</xref>, MNase and data not shown), indicating that these two RNA-binding proteins associate with polysomes at late stages of spermatid differentiation.</p><p>Comparison of RNA absorbance profiles between P23, P28 and P40 extracts shows a slight but reproducible increase in the amount of polysomes with increasing age, accompanied by a reduction in the monosome-containing fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004900-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). We also observed a shift of the small ribosomal sub-unit protein S6 from fractions 3 and 4 in the P23 gradient to denser fractions in the P28 and P40 gradients, while the content of tubulin, taken as an internal control, in a given fraction is similar in the three gradients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004900-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). All together, our results show that HuR translocates from the CB to polysomes while spermatids mature and that HuR and MVH association with polysomes correlates with a weak but significant increase of mRNA translation in late germ cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>HuR-target mRNAs are dynamically localized during spermatid differentiation</title><p>The transfer of HuR from the CB to polysomes suggests that HuR may regulate storage and translation of mRNAs during spermiogenesis.

There, it participates in the storage of long-lived mRNAs and their protection from degradation. However the constant &#x0201c;feeding&#x0201d; of the CB with mRNAs could also favor a rapid shuttling of a small fraction of mRNAs to polysomes, resulting in translation of HuR-target mRNAs at a low level. After step V spermatids, HuR translocates from the CB to polysomes with its associated ARE-mRNAs, where, together with MVH, it contributes to their translation. Due to loss of HuR from the CB, the HuR-targets remaining in this structure are no longer protected from degradation and are consequently destroyed by degradation enzymes and miRNA-mediated processing. Subsequently, in elongated spermatids, transcription has ceased. Most mRNAs have been either degraded or translated at earlier stages of spermiogenesis. The pool of mRNAs remaining at these late stages is restricted to those, such as <italic>protamine</italic> mRNA, required for the ultimate steps of spermiogenesis.

As a part of MVH is also found in polysomes and binds HuR-target mRNAs, our data do not exclude the contribution of MVH to ARE-mRNA trafficking.
