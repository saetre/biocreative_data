Both proteins have the characteristic domain structure of the Hsp70 family consisting of a conserved N-terminal nucleotide binding domain and a C-terminal substrate binding domain. Kar2p is a canonical Hsp70 whose substrate binding activity is regulated by cochaperones that promote either ATP hydrolysis or nucleotide exchange. Lhs1p is a member of the Grp170/Lhs1p subfamily of Hsp70s and was previously shown to function as a nucleotide exchange factor (NEF) for Kar2p.

Analysis of the nucleotide requirement of these functions demonstrates that nucleotide binding to Lhs1p stimulates the interaction with Kar2p and is essential for NEF activity. In contrast, Lhs1p holdase activity is nucleotide-independent and unaffected by mutations that interfere with ATP binding and NEF activity. <italic>In vivo</italic>, these mutants show severe protein translocation defects and are unable to support growth despite the presence of a second Kar2p-specific NEF, Sil1p.

Kar2p is a canonical Hsp70 that plays an important role in ER protein folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>), the import of proteins into the ER membrane via the membrane-embedded Sec61p complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) and in the export of misfolded proteins via the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). It has the two-domain structure that is characteristic of Hsp70s, consisting of a highly conserved N-terminal nucleotide binding domain (NBD) and a C-terminal substrate binding domain. Substrate binding by Hsp70s is regulated by nucleotide-dependent conformational changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) that are in turn modulated by cochaperones. An Hsp40/DnaJ-like protein promotes ATP hydrolysis inducing strong substrate interaction, whereas a nucleotide exchange factor (NEF) resets the ATPase cycle leading to substrate release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Kar2p has two known nucleotide exchange factors, Lhs1p and Sil1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>Lhs1p is a member of the Grp170/Lhs1p subfamily of Hsp70 chaperones, whose distinguishing features include an extended substrate binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) and subfamily-specific motifs in the nucleotide binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). In the absence of Lhs1p, cells show defects in ER protein translocation and folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14 B15 B16">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and require the Ire1p-dependent induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR) for survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Although Lhs1p has NEF activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) it cannot be excluded that Lhs1p might play additional roles in the ER lumen. For example, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have shown that the mammalian Lhs1p homologue, Grp170, not only functions as a NEF for the mammalian Kar2p homologue BiP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), but is also able to prevent heat-induced aggregation of substrate proteins without the assistance of other chaperones or cofactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). This suggests that in addition to its NEF activity, Grp170 can function as a BiP-independent chaperone. So far, the relative contribution of these two functions to ER protein folding and translocation has not been determined.</p><p>Most sequence similarity between Lhs1p and other members of the Hsp70 superfamily is found in its NBD, but although the residues implicated in nucleotide binding and hydrolysis are highly conserved, Lhs1p does not have a detectable endogenous ATPase activity like canonical Hsp70s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Recent studies suggest that divergent Hsp70s can have different requirements for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis. The cytosolic yeast Hsp110 Sse1p is a member of a different Hsp70 subfamily than Lhs1p, but has a similar function as an Hsp70 NEF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Sse1p has been reported to hydrolyze ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), but ATP hydrolysis is not essential for NEF activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). For the activity of the ribosome-associated atypical Hsp70 Ssz1p, nucleotide binding is dispensable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). These observations suggest that the NBD might play diverse functions in the different Hsp70 subfamilies.</p><p>In this study we analyzed the requirement of nucleotide binding for Lhs1p function. Although Lhs1p holdase activity is nucleotide-independent, nucleotide binding to wild-type Lhs1p stimulates interaction with Kar2p. Mutations that interfere with nucleotide binding abolish NEF activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, cause severe protein translocation defects <italic>in vivo</italic>, and are lethal in a &#x00394;<italic>ire1</italic> strain.

However, binding of radiolabeled nucleotide to purified Lhs1p proved surprisingly inefficient (see below). The apparent failure of Lhs1p to bind nucleotide under these conditions might reflect the intrinsic properties of the protein but could also be explained if Lhs1p had been purified in a nucleotide bound state. Indeed, when the nucleotide content of purified Lhs1p was analyzed in a bioluminescence assay, a significant amount of ATP was detected, corresponding to at least 28.4 &#x000b1; 0.2% occupancy. The actual occupancy is probably higher, as later findings demonstrate this method significantly underestimates the percentage of bound nucleotides (see below).</p><p>Several studies have reported on the presence of tightly bound nucleotides in the nucleotide binding pocket of members of the Hsp70 and Hsp110 subfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Methods to remove these nucleotides include incubation with excess AMP-PNP followed by dialysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) or dialysis in the presence of alkaline phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). These approaches, which both depend on spontaneous release of bound nucleotides, did not improve binding of radiolabeled ATP to Lhs1p (data not shown). We therefore examined the potential of the reversible denaturant, 5 <sc>m</sc> guanidine HCl, to release bound nucleotide. Purified Lhs1p was incubated in 5 <sc>m</sc> guanidine HCl (GdnHCl), 2 m<sc>m</sc> EDTA for 1 h at room temperature and then dialyzed overnight to remove the GdnHCl and any released nucleotides. After GdnHCl treatment, the ATP content of Lhs1p, as detected in our bioluminescence assay, was reduced to 4.2 &#x000b1; 1.3%, demonstrating that GdnHCl treatment of Lhs1p dissociated a substantial proportion of the bound ATP. GdnHCl treatment did not affect the activity of Lhs1p, as stimulation of ATPase activity upon addition of limiting concentrations of GdnHCl-treated Lhs1p to Kar2p and its Sec63-J partner was indistinguishable from untreated Lhs1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). However, the GdnHCl-treated Lhs1p exhibited a striking increase in [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP binding activity as shown by TLC analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic>) and filter binding experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>B</italic>). To determine the efficiency of nucleotide binding, Lhs1p was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with increasing concentrations of [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP. Lhs1p [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP complexes were captured on polyvinylidene difluoride filters, the amount of bound [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP was determined by scintillation counting, and the data were fitting to a one-site saturation binding model (SigmaPlot) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>C</italic>). Using 3.5 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> apoLhs1p we observed a maximal binding of 2.1 &#x000b1; 0.02 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> ATP with an affinity of 13.6 &#x000b1; 0.5 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>. However, as the Lhs1p&#x000b7;ATP complex is essentially non-dissociating (see below), the true equilibrium affinity of Lhs1p for ATP is probably much higher. The maximal binding corresponds to &#x0223c;60% occupancy, which is considerably higher than the amount of nucleotide found associated with purified Lhs1p in our original bioluminescence assay. The bioluminescence assay measures only the ATP that is released from Lhs1p following methanol precipitation. When [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP&#x000b7;Lhs1p complexes were subject to the same precipitation conditions we regularly found only 50% of the available counts to be released into the supernatant (data not shown). These results suggest that the proportion of GdnHCl-treated Lhs1p, which binds ATP appears similar to that of the original purified protein. The observation that a substantial fraction of Lhs1p is purified in a nucleotide bound form suggests that dissociation is rather slow. To explore this possibility we analyzed the dissociation of Lhs1p-bound [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP. GdnHCl-treated Lhs1p was preloaded with [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP as before, followed by incubation in the presence of a greater than 1,000-fold excess of non-radioactive ATP. TLC analysis of Lhs1p-bound nucleotides demonstrated that the level of bound [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP was not significantly reduced even after 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>D</italic>). When the same assay was performed with Kar2p, the majority of [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP&#x000b7;Kar2p complexes were already dissociated after 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>D</italic>). These data confirm that, once formed, the Lhs1p&#x000b7;ATP complex is extremely stable. We therefore conclude that Lhs1p is purified in a nucleotide-bound form that can be dissociated by reversible denaturation with GdnHCl. The resultant &#x0201c;apoLhs1p&#x0201d; exhibits an efficient ATP binding activity the importance of which we investigated further.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1.</label><caption><p><bold>GdnHCl-EDTA treatment does not affect Lhs1p activity.</bold> Steady state ATPase activity of 0.25 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> Kar2p (<italic>K</italic>) in the absence or presence of 1 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> of the soluble J-domain of Sec63p (<italic>J</italic>) and 1, 0.5, 0.25, or 0.13 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> untreated Lhs1p or GdnHCl-treated Lhs1p.

The observation that an efficient interaction between wild-type Lhs1p and Kar2p is nucleotide-dependent suggests that nucleotide binding mutations would affect the Lhs1p-Kar2p interaction. Indeed, when assayed in a GST-Kar2p(G246D) pulldown assay, both nucleotide binding mutants showed a reduced Kar2p interaction, which could not be stimulated by nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>A</italic>). To determine whether the residual interaction observed in the pulldown assay was sufficient to stimulate nucleotide exchange on Kar2p, Kar2p was preloaded with [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP and incubated with wild-type Lhs1p or the Lhs1p mutants. The release of nucleotides from Kar2p was monitored by thin layer chromatography. As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) incubation with wild-type Lhs1p led to a rapid reduction in the amount Kar2p-bound [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]ADP and [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>B</italic>).

Especially the residues important for ATP binding and hydrolysis in canonical Hsp70s are highly conserved. Although this strict sequence conservation suggests the NBD is important for Lhs1p function, its exact role has not been clearly identified. Here we show that nucleotide binding to Lhs1p is essential for its function as a Kar2p nucleotide exchange factor. We found that Lhs1p was purified as a relatively stable ATP-bound complex. Removal of bound ATP was made possible by reversible denaturation whereupon the resulting apoLhs1p showed a much reduced interaction with Kar2p. This interaction was restored following incubation of apoLhs1p with nucleotide. This finding was confirmed with two different mutations in the nucleotide binding domain of Lhs1p that disrupted nucleotide binding. Both D26A and G28L mutant forms of Lhs1p showed reduced interaction with Kar2p and were unable to provide any nucleotide exchange activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. Nucleotide binding therefore appears to be essential for the NEF activity of Lhs1p.</p><p>The stability of the ATP-bound form of Lhs1p was particularly striking. Bound ATP could not be removed even after prolonged dialysis, neither did we find evidence for significant spontaneous exchange with competitor nucleotide even when the latter was present in substantial excess. However, by developing a reliable method for generating apoLhs1p we have been able to demonstrate that it is the nucleotide-bound form of Lhs1p that interacts with Kar2p. However, the interaction between Lhs1p-ATP and Kar2p was shown to be inhibited by the addition of ATP. Using an ATP-binding mutant form of Kar2p (G246D) we were then able to demonstrate that this inhibitory effect of ATP was now lost. Taken together, our data demonstrate that nucleotide-bound Lhs1p binds Kar2p only when the latter is in its nucleotide-free or ADP-bound states. This would be consistent with the function of Lhs1p as a nucleotide exchange factor for Kar2p.</p><p>Like Lhs1p, members of the cytosolic Hsp110 subfamily also function as nucleotide exchange factors for canonical Hsp70s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Nucleotide binding mutations in the Hsp110 Sse1p have similarly been reported to affect the interaction with the Hsp70s and to reduce nucleotide exchange activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Recent structural data demonstrate that Sse1p interacts with Hsp70s via its NBD and the helical bundle domain of the substrate binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>) and this interaction can only occur when the Sse1-NBD is in a closed, nucleotide bound, conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). In a pulldown assay, both ADP and ATP binding to Lhs1p appear to stimulate the interaction between Lhs1p and Kar2p to a similar extent. In contrast, ATP binding to Sse1p was reported to support the interaction between Sse1p and its Hsp70 partner Ssa1p more efficiently than ADP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). It is possible that Lhs1p and Sse1p respond slightly different to either ADP or ATP binding as protease protection of Lhs1p was found to be similar in the presence of ATP and ADP, whereas ADP-bound Sse1p is more susceptible to proteolysis than ATP-bound Sse1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). These data appear to indicate some differences in the properties of the ER-lumenal Lhs1p from its cytosolic counterpart.</p><p>In addition to its NEF activity Lhs1p can also function as a holdase (this study). Unlike the Kar2p interaction, nucleotide binding is not required for Lhs1p substrate binding as both GdnHCl-treated Lhs1p and the Lhs1p nucleotide-binding mutants are efficient holdases. This observation is consistent with studies on deletion mutants of Hsp110 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) and Grp170 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), which indicate that the substrate binding domain alone is sufficient for holdase activity. Importantly, the holdase activity of the nucleotide-binding mutants is not sufficient for function <italic>in vivo</italic>. &#x00394;<italic>lhs1</italic> cells expressing Lhs1p(D26A) or Lhs1p(G28L) show a dramatic accumulation of prepro-&#x003b1;-factor, suggesting that the translocation defects of &#x00394;<italic>lhs1</italic> cells are primarily caused by the lack of Lhs1p NEF activity. This is consistent with the observation that overexpression of Sil1p can partially compensate the translocation defect of a &#x00394;<italic>lhs1</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). However, Sil1p overexpression does not suppress the &#x00394;<italic>lhs1</italic> translocation defect completely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and it cannot be excluded that substrate binding to Lhs1p plays a role during protein translocation as well. In such a scenario, both Lhs1p and Kar2p could associate with the translocation peptide, either sequentially or simultaneously as has been proposed for the Hsp110&#x000b7;Hsp70 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). The observation that without UPR induction of Sil1p, both NBD mutations are lethal clearly indicates that the Lhs1p nucleotide exchange activity is indispensible for Lhs1p function <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by" id="FN1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported by The Wellcome Trust.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="abbreviations"><fn id="FN2"><label>2</label><p>The abbreviations used are: <def-list><def-item><term id="G1">ER</term><def><p>endoplasmic reticulum</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G2">NBD</term><def><p>nucleotide binding domain</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G3">NEF</term><def><p>nucleotide exchange factor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G4">UPR</term><def><p>unfolded protein response</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G5">GST</term><def><p>glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G6">AMP-PNP</term><def><p>5&#x02032;-adenylyl-&#x003b2;,&#x003b3;-imidodiphosphate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G7">GdnHCl</term><def><p>guanidine HCl.</p></def></def-item></def-list></p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Neil Bullied (University of Manchester, UK) for the use of the Cary 300 Biospectrophotometer and Christopher Sellick, Michael Spiller, Gabriella Forte, Barrie Wilkinson, and Martin Pool (University of Manchester, UK) for helpful discussions and technical assistance.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="B1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Simons</surname><given-names>J.
