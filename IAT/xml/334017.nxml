There are at least 20 abundant proteins in vertebrate cell hnRNP complexes and their structure and arrangement on specific hnRNAs is likely to be important for the processing of pre-mRNAs. hnRNP I, a basic protein of ca. 58,000 daltons by SDS-PAGE, is one of the abundant hnRNA-binding proteins. Monoclonal antibodies to hnRNP I were produced and full length cDNA clones for hnRNP I were isolated and sequenced. The sequence of hnRNP I (59,632 daltons and pI 9.86) demonstrates that it is identical to the previously described polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) and shows that it is highly related to hnRNP L. The sequences of these two proteins, I and L, define a new family of hnRNP proteins within the large superfamily of the RNP consensus RNA-binding proteins. Here we describe experiments which reveal new and unique properties on the association of hnRNP I/PTB with hnRNP complexes and on its cellular localization. Micrococcal nuclease digestions show that hnRNP I, along with hnRNP S and P, is released from hnRNP complexes by nuclease digestion more readily than most other hnRNP proteins. This nuclease hypersensitivity suggests that hnRNP I is bound to hnRNA regions that are particularly exposed in the complexes. Immunofluorescence microscopy shows that hnRNP I is found in the nucleoplasm but in addition high concentrations are detected in a discrete perinucleolar structure. Thus, the PTB is one of the major proteins that bind pre-mRNAs; it is bound to nuclease-hypersensitive regions of the hnRNA-protein complexes and shows a novel pattern of nuclear localization.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00225-0127-a" xlink:role="3673"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00225-0127-b" xlink:role="3673"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00225-0127-c" xlink:role="3673"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00225-0128-a" xlink:role="3674"/></fig><fig id="F5"><graphic xlink:href="nar00225-0130-a" xlink:role="3676"/></fig><fig id="F6"><graphic xlink:href="nar00225-0130-b" xlink:role="3676"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00225-0125.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3671"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00225-0126.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3672"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00225-0127.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3673"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00225-0128.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3674"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00225-0129.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3675"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00225-0130.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3676"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00225-0131.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3677"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00225-0132.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3678"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
