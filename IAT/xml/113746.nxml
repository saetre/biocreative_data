In pre-anaphase cells, Cdc14 is sequestered to the nucleolus by Net1 as a part of the RENT complex. When cells are primed to exit mitosis, the RENT complex is disassembled and Cdc14 is released from the nucleolus.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Here, we show that Cdc5 is necessary to free nucleolar Cdc14 in late mitosis, that elevated Cdc5 activity provokes ectopic release of Cdc14 in pre-anaphase cells, and that the phosphorylation state of Net1 is regulated by Cdc5 during anaphase. Furthermore, recombinant Cdc5 and <italic>Xenopus</italic> Polo-like kinase can disassemble the RENT complex <italic>in vitro</italic> by phosphorylating Net1 and thereby reducing its affinity for Cdc14. Surprisingly, although RENT complexes containing Net1 mutants (Net1(7m) and Net1(19m') lacking sites phosphorylated by Cdc5 <italic>in vitro</italic> are refractory to disassembly by Polo-like kinases <italic>in vitro</italic>, <italic>net1(7m)</italic> and <italic>net1(19m')</italic> cells grow normally and exhibit only minor defects in releasing Cdc14 during anaphase.

Identified components of the MEN include Tem1 (a GTP-binding protein), Lte1 (a putative guanine nucleotide releasing factor), Nud1 (a spindle-pole-body protein), Cdc15 (a protein kinase), Dbf2/Mob1 (a protein kinase complex), Cdc5 (a Polo-like protein kinase), and Cdc14 (a protein phosphatase). When cells harboring conditional-lethal temperature-sensitive (ts) mutations in any of these proteins are shifted to the restrictive temperature, they uniformly arrest in late anaphase as large-budded cells with segregated chromosomes, fully elongated microtubule spindles, and in all tested cases, elevated Cdc28/Clb2 protein kinase activity (Cdc28 is the major cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk1 and Clb2 the major mitosis-specific cyclin of budding yeast) (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]).</p><p>The protein phosphatase Cdc14 is likely to be the most downstream element in the MEN because it can act directly on cell cycle regulators to promote exit from mitosis. By counteracting Cdk1-mediated phosphorylations, Cdc14 activates both Hct1/Cdh1, which targets Clb2 for degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and Swi5, which turns on the transcription of Cdk1 inhibitor Sic1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Degradation of Clb2 and accumulation of Sic1 act in concert to eliminate mitotic Cdk activity, which is required for exit from mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Thus, elucidating how Cdc14 is regulated holds the key to understanding how cells exit mitosis. In pre-anaphase cells, Cdc14 is confined to the nucleolus as a subunit of the RENT complex (which also contains Net1/Cfi1 and Sir2), and its phosphatase activity is inhibited by Net1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Damaged DNA and mis-oriented mitotic spindles delay exit from mitosis (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]), but after errors have been rectified or bypassed, Lte1, Nud1, and possibly other unidentified factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] promote Tem1 activation. Tem1 recruits Cdc15 to the spindle pole body, which in turn recruits and phosphorylates the Dbf2/Mob1 protein kinase complex, thereby switching it on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The Tem1-signaling pathway eventually triggers disassembly of the RENT complex, enabling the release of Cdc14 (and a portion of Sir2) from Net1. Active Cdc14 diffuses into the nucleus and cytoplasm to extinguish mitotic Cdk activity and to promote exit from mitosis.</p><p>The relative position of the Polo-like kinase Cdc5 in the MEN is obscure. Cdc5 is required for full activation of the Dbf2-Mob1 protein kinase complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and has been proposed to impinge on the MEN both upstream and downstream of Tem1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. During exit from mitosis, Cdc5 is required for Clb2 destruction, and similar to over-expression of Cdc14 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], induction of Cdc5 triggers precocious Clb2 degradation in pre-anaphase cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In addition to its role in exit from mitosis, Cdc5 has other functions during mitosis in budding yeast. Depletion of Cdc5 or Polo-like kinase in <italic>cdc5&#x025b2;</italic> cells arrests a significant fraction of the cells in early anaphase with short mitotic spindles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], and phosphorylation of the cohesin subunit Scc1 by Cdc5 enhances the efficiency of Scc1 cleavage by the separase Esp1 during the metaphase to anaphase transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Although many proteins are known to be essential for exit from mitosis, the factor that sets Cdc14 free from the nucleolus still remains elusive. In this study, we assess the roles of Cdc5 in disassembly of the RENT complex and exit from mitosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus in late anaphase requires Cdc5</title><p>In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, disassembly of the RENT complex and the subsequent release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus drive cells to exit mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This event is thought to require two independent signals: an unknown mitosis-specific signal and a signal from the mitotic exit network (MEN) proteins including Tem1, Cdc15, and Dbf2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The Polo-like kinase Cdc5 also belongs to the MEN, thus we tested whether it too is required for release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus by using indirect immunofluorescence to compare Cdc14 localization patterns in wild type and <italic>cdc5-1</italic> cells. Wild type cells with short spindles were in pre-anaphase and showed focal nucleolar Cdc14 staining, and those with elongated mitotic spindles were in late anaphase and showed diffused Cdc14 staining (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, Rows 1 and 4; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]). In contrast, <italic>cdc5-1</italic> cells uniformly exhibited focal Cdc14 staining whether they were grown exponentially at permissive temperature (25&#x000b0;C) or arrested in late mitosis at nonpermissive temperature (33&#x000b0;C) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, Rows 2 and 5). Furthermore, in all (including late anaphase) <italic>cdc5-1</italic> cells, Cdc14 co-localized with A190, a nucleolar protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, Rows 3 and 6), suggesting that when <italic>CDC5</italic> is compromised, most or all Cdc14 fails to vacate the nucleolus in late anaphase.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus requires Cdc5.</bold>&#x000a0;<italic>CDC14-HA3</italic> cells in wild type (<italic>+</italic>) (RJD 1191) or <italic>cdc5-1</italic> (RJD 1217) background were grown at 25&#x000b0;C, and a portion of the cultures were further shifted to 33&#x000b0;C for three hours to arrest <italic>cdc5-1</italic> in late anaphase.

We first tested Cdc5, because Cdc5 is required for Cdc14 release (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), and because overexpression of Cdc5 triggers ectopic degradation of Clb2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], which normally depends upon active Cdc14 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. These experiments employed a <italic>GAL-CDC5(DB&#x025b2;)</italic> strain, in which expression of Cdc5(DB&#x025b2;), a stabilized version of Cdc5 lacking the destruction box, was driven by the inducible <italic>GAL</italic> promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Cells were arrested in G1 by &#x003b1;-factor, supplemented with galactose to induce the <italic>GAL</italic> promoter, and released into galactose-containing medium. Cdc14 was focal in almost all cells with short mitotic spindles, but became diffused in a significant fraction of these cells after Cdc5(DB&#x025b2;) was induced (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). A similar result was obtained if the total number of cells with diffused Cdc14 was plotted instead (data not shown). To address whether overexpression of Cdc5 could also force Cdc14 out of the nucleolus in cells arrested at a cell cycle stage where Cdc14 is nucleolar, we arrested cells in metaphase using the microtubule polymerization inhibitor nocodazole. After the expression of Cdc5(DB&#x025b2;) was induced in nocodazole-arrested cells, Cdc14 diffused beyond the domain of Net1 in ~49% of cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). In contrast, <italic>GAL</italic>-driven overexpression of Dbf2/(GST-Mob1) protein kinase complex did not dislodge Cdc14 from the nucleolus (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that overexpression of Cdc5 &#x02013; but not the putative downstream-most MEN component Dbf2/Mob1 &#x02013; activates premature release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Overexpression of Cdc5(DB&#x025b2;) triggers Cdc14 release.</bold> (A) Overexpression of Cdc5(DB&#x025b2;) promotes release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus even in cells with short spindles. <italic>CDC14-MYC9</italic> cells with (WY333) or without (WY201) integrated <italic>GAL-CDC5(DB&#x025b2;)</italic> were grown in YP + 2% raffinose (<italic>GAL</italic> promoter uninduced), arrested in G1 by &#x003b1;-factor, supplemented with galactose to 2% for 0.5 hour (<italic>GAL</italic> promoter induced), and released into YP + 2% galactose at time = 0.

Moreover, the arrest of <italic>cdc5-1</italic>, <italic>cdc5-2</italic>, <italic>cdc5-4</italic>, and <italic>cdc5-7</italic> temperature-sensitive mutants in late mitosis was potently suppressed by the <italic>TAB6-1</italic> allele (Park et al., submitted), which encodes a form of Cdc14 that binds weakly to Net1 and is released from Net1 during mitosis even in the absence of MEN function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].

Net1N includes the N-terminal 341 amino acids of Net1 and is sufficient to bind and inhibit Cdc14 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. When GST-Cdc14/His6-T7-Net1N complex anchored to anti-T7 beads was treated with ATP plus increasing amounts of recombinant Cdc5 purified from insect cells, both Cdc14 and Net1N were phosphorylated as indicated by their increased apparent molecular weight. Furthermore, Cdc14 was released from bead-bound Net1N to the supernatant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>), and free Cdc14 was active as a protein phosphatase (data not shown), suggesting that Cdc5 is sufficient to disengage active Cdc14 from Net1.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Polo-like kinases can phosphorylate and disrupt the RENT complex <italic>in vitro.</italic></bold>&#x000a0;<bold>(A)</bold> Cdc5 can disrupt recombinant Net1N/Cdc14 complex.

Active but not inactive Plx1 phosphorylated both Net1N and Cdc14, and completely dislodged Net1N from bead-bound Cdc14 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Thus, we conclude that like Cdc5, the protein kinase activity of Plx1 can disrupt the interaction between Net1N and Cdc14.

Surprisingly, <italic>cdc5-1</italic> cells grown at 25&#x000b0;C could exit mitosis despite persistent nucleolar localization of Cdc14, which may have been due to release of a small fraction of Cdc14 that was nevertheless sufficient to drive exit from mitosis in these cells. Alternatively, it is possible that complete release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus in <italic>cdc5-1</italic> cells was so brief that it escaped our detection. A ramification of this observation is that indirect immunofluorescence assays based on Cdc14 localization may not correctly predict whether a cell can exit mitosis.</p><p>Not only was Cdc5 required for Cdc14 release, but a stabilized mutant lacking the destruction box (Cdc5(DB&#x025b2;)) triggered inappropriate Cdc14 release in pre-anaphase cells when overexpressed from the <italic>GAL1,10</italic> promoter.

Thus, we prioritized phospho-sites based on their stoichiometry of phosphorylation and on homology to sites whose phosphorylation was demonstrated to be important in earlier release assays. In total, we tested more than 20 phospho-site mutants of Net1, and identified two &#x02013; Net1(7m) and Net1(19m') &#x02013; that still bound Cdc14 normally, but displayed a strong defect in releasing Cdc14 upon treatment with Plx1.

In addition, Cdc14 remained nucleolar in <italic>cdc5-1 net1&#x025b2; net1(7m)-myc9</italic> cells (data not shown), suggesting that the release event was still regulated properly.</p></sec><sec><title>How does Cdc5 promote disassembly of the RENT complex and exit from mitosis?</title><p>There are two extreme interpretations of our analysis of the Net1(7m) and Net1 (19m') mutants: First, Cdc5 is not directly involved in disrupting the RENT complex, and second, Cdc5 directly disassembles the RENT complex via phosphorylation of Net1, but because it is not feasible to evaluate all possible 10<sup>9</sup> (=2<sup>30</sup>) combinations of phospho-site mutants or because the sites phosphorylated by Cdc5 <italic>in vivo</italic> are different from those <italic>in vitro</italic> due to the presence of factors such as Sir2, Pol I, and rDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], we missed key phosphorylation sites that would have given a more definitive phenotype when mutated. A variation on this theme is that it might never be possible to construct a phosphosite mutant of Net1 that binds Cdc14 but fails to release it during anaphase, if the hydroxyl groups that are phosphorylated normally form critical hydrogen bonds that tether Cdc14 to Net1.</p><p>A third hypothesis that stakes middle ground between these polar extremes is that Cdc5 affects RENT stability both directly and indirectly, with the former role being less significant than the latter. Several lines of evidence are consistent with this view. First, <italic>net1(7m)</italic> and <italic>net1(19m')</italic> mutants exerted a modest effect on release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus, in that ~40% of cells with long mitotic spindles retained focal localization of Cdc14 and that both <italic>net1</italic> phospho-site mutants displayed a modest defect in 'Cdc14 early anaphase release' (FEAR; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]). Second, <italic>net1(19m')</italic> showed a synthetic growth defect when combined with <italic>dbf2-1</italic> or the <italic>msd2-1</italic> allele of <italic>CDC5</italic>. Third, phosphorylation site mapping of Net1 purified from arrested <italic>cdc14-1</italic> cells (WS and SC, unpublished data) revealed that at least one (S231) of the five <italic>in vivo</italic> phosphorylation sites in the first 341 amino acids was directly phosphorylated by Cdc5 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Nevertheless, because expression of neither Net1(7m) nor Net1(19m') had a major impact on exit from mitosis, any direct effect of Cdc5 on Net1 appears to be minor, and the requirement for Cdc5 in the release of Cdc14 might arise principally from phosphorylation of other release-promoting proteins.</p><p>If Cdc5 plays a minor role in directly disassembling RENT, then how does it promote exit from mitosis? Cdc15, Dbf2, and Mob1 are not properly localized to the spindle pole body in a significant fraction of <italic>cdc5-1</italic> cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and Dbf2/Mob1 protein kinase activity is diminished in <italic>cdc5</italic> cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], suggesting that at least one function of Cdc5 is to generate maximally active Dbf2/Mob1, which can then trigger Cdc14 release. This explanation is unlikely to account fully for Cdc5's role in exit from mitosis, however, because (1) overexpression of Cdc5, but not Dbf2/Mob1, provoked ectopic release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus; and (2) the Dbf2/Mob1 kinase complex is at least partially activated and is correctly localized to the spindle pole body in 50% of <italic>cdc5</italic> cells at the nonpermissive temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>While this manuscript was under consideration, two papers presented new evidence on how Cdc5 contributes to exit from mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. To summarize our study and these recent findings, we present a model (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>) that is consistent with all of the available data. Upon initiation of chromosome segregation, Cdc5 promotes the transient 'Cdc14 early anaphase release' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Our data suggest that Cdc5 can promote FEAR by directly phosphorylating Net1 as well as other yet-to-be-identified FEAR factors. Cdc5 also helps to activate the MEN by directly phosphorylating and disabling Bfa1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], which is thought to inhibit Tem1 by serving as a GTPase-activating protein. Cdc5 presumably impinges on the MEN by other means as well, because Cdc5 is required for maximal Dbf2 protein kinase activity even in the absence of Bfa1's obligate partner Bub2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Once activated, the MEN in turn sustains the transient Cdc14 release enabled by Cdc5 and other FEAR pathway components. The unique ability of overexpressed Cdc5 to expel Cdc14 from the nucleolus may thus be a consequence of Cdc5's abilities to directly disassemble Net1-Cdc14 complexes, promote FEAR, and activate the MEN. A complete understanding of Cdc5's role in mitotic exit will ultimately require identification of all of its direct substrates in the MEN and FEAR pathways.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Role of Cdc5 in exit from mitosis.</bold> Cdc5 may promote Cdc14 early anaphase release (FEAR) in part by phosphorylating Net1 directly (dotted arrow), and by activating an unknown Cdc14 dissociation factor (X). Subsequent activation of the MEN is important to sustain the transient Cdc14 release effected by the FEAR pathway. In the absence of MEN activity, Cdc14 returns to the nucleolus and cells arrest in late anaphase (bottom right). In the presence of MEN activity, Clb/CDK is shut off and cells exit mitosis (top right). The mechanism of action of MEN remains unknown, but activation of MEN correlates with appearance of Cdc14 in the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and mutation of known nuclear transport regulators renders mitotic exit independent of <italic>CDC15</italic> function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Together, these observations suggest that the MEN may promote exit by biasing the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of Cdc14. In addition to its role in the FEAR pathway, Cdc5 impinges positively on the MEN by several mechanisms, including: (i) Cdc5 promotes Tem1 activation by promoting chromosome segregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], which by enabling optimal spindle elongation and penetration into the bud, helps satisfy the spindle positioning checkpoint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]; (ii) Cdc5 promotes activation of Tem1 GTP-binding protein by inhibiting its negative regulator, the Bfa1/Bub2 GTPase-activating protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], and (iii) Cdc5 promotes activation of Dbf2 by an unknown, <italic>BUB2</italic>-independent mechanism (dashed line) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2199-3-3-7"/></fig></sec><sec><title>A word of caution on phosphosite mapping</title><p>Cdc5 can phosphorylate up to 30 residues in the amino terminal domain of Net1 <italic>in vitro</italic>.

For experiments in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, immunoprecipitation of RENT through Myc9-Net1 was carried out as described earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], except that EDTA (final 2 mM) was included in the lysis buffer. Each release reaction contained RENT from ~10 OD<sub>600</sub> units (1 unit equals 1 ml of culture at OD<sub>600</sub> = 1.0) of cells bound to 15 &#x003bc;l of 9E10 beads. To assemble Cdc14 beads with Net1N for two assays (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, detection method: Western blotting), 2 &#x003bc;l of rabbit-anti-GST antibodies were absorbed to 40 &#x003bc;l of protein A beads (Sigma) in 100 &#x003bc;l of HBS [20 mM HEPES (pH 7.2), 150 mM NaCl] + 2 mM EDTA + 0.1 mg/ml BSA + 1 mM DTT (HEBD) buffer for 1 hr.

The beads were incubated with 250 ng of GST-T7-Cdc14 in 100 &#x003bc;l of HEBD for 1 hr, followed by the same sequence of washes. Finally, the beads were incubated with Net1N (450 ng) for 1 hr. To assemble Net1N beads with Cdc14 for six reactions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, detection method: Coomassie Blue staining), 105 &#x003bc;l of anti-T7 beads (Novagen) were incubated with 24 &#x003bc;g of His6-T7-Net1N in 100 &#x003bc;l of HEBD for 1 hr, washed four times with HBS + 0.2% n-octylglucoside + 2 mM DTT, and incubated with 6 &#x003bc;g of GST-Cdc14 in 100 &#x003bc;l of HEBD for 1 hr. After the final incubation step of the protein complete assembly process, beads were extensively washed, followed by a final wash with Kinase Buffer [5 mM Tris&#x000b7;HCl (pH 8.0), 25 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 1 mM ATP, 10 &#x003bc;g/ml pepstatin + chymostatin + leupeptin (PCL)]. The beads were then distributed into equal aliquots for release assays. Kinase reactions were carried out in 30 &#x003bc;l Kinase Buffer at room temperature for 0.5&#x02013;1 hr, and the supernatant was transferred to new tubes at the end of assays. The beads were washed once with 70 &#x003bc;l of HEBD, and the wash was pooled with the supernatant, and precipitated with TCA (10% final) on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation in a microfuge for 10 min, the pellet was saved as "sup".
