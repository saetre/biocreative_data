The <italic>gcr2</italic>, <italic>gcl1</italic> and <italic>gcl2</italic> single, double and triple mutants do not display any apparent morphological phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002982-g002">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002982-g003">Figure 3</xref>), offering little clue to the exact biological role of <italic>GCR2</italic> gene family in Arabidopsis. This lack of a marked deficiency phenotype implies that the <italic>GCR2</italic> gene family may not be critical for plant development, but leaves open the possibility that these mutants may only exhibit phenotypes under certain conditions (e.g. under biotic and abiotic stresses).</p><p>We took several approaches to investigate the possible functions of the <italic>GCR2</italic> gene family. Because GCR2 has been shown to physically bind to GPA1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002982-Liu1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> and GCL1 and GCL2 are highly similar to GCR2 at the amino acid level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002982-Gao1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, we first examined a possible role for these proteins in G-protein signaling. First, we examined the possibility of GCL1 and GCL2 being classical GPCRs. Structural analysis <italic>in silico</italic> using the TMHMM2.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/</ext-link>) transmembrane segment prediction system predicted no transmembrane domains in GCL1 and GCL2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002982.s003">Figure S3</xref>), similar to the situation for GCR2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002982-Gao1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. This implies that the GCR2 protein family members unlikely function as classical GPCRs, because they do not possess seven-transmembrane domains, a structural hallmark of any classical GPCRs. Second, because Liu et al. (2007) recently argued that GCR2 may define a new type of non-classical GPCR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002982-Liu2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, we sought other evidence that may support a genetic coupling between the GCR2 protein family and G-proteins. The G-protein repertoire is much simpler in plants (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002982-Assmann1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002982-Temple1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>), and Arabidopsis possesses only one canonical G-protein &#x003b1; subunit, one G-protein &#x003b2; subunit, and two G-protein &#x003b3; subunit. We reasoned that, if GCR2 family proteins are important contributors to G-protein-coupled signalling pathways, one would expect to observe shared phenotypes (morphological or conditional) between G-protein subunit mutants and <italic>GCR2</italic>/<italic>GCL</italic> mutants. One of the characteristic morphological traits of loss-of-function alleles of the sole Arabidopsis heterotrimeric G-protein &#x003b1; subunit, <italic>GPA1</italic>, and the sole Arabidopsis heterotrimeric G-protein &#x003b2; subunit, <italic>AGB1</italic>, is round shaped rosette leaves <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002982-Ullah1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002982-Chen2">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, but none of the <italic>gcr2</italic>, <italic>gcl1</italic> and <italic>gcl2</italic> single, double and triple mutants displayed such morphological defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002982-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Another characteristic trait of <italic>gpa1</italic> and <italic>agb1</italic> mutants is the short hypocotyl and partially-opened hook phenotype in etiolated seedlings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002982-Ullah1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002982-Chen2">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Again, none of the <italic>gcr2</italic>, <italic>gcl1</italic> and <italic>gcl2</italic> single, double and triple mutants displayed such phenotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002982.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Therefore, although GCR2 has been shown to physically interact with GPA1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002982-Liu1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, the exact role of GCR2 (and GCL1 and GCL2) in G-protein signaling remains unclear.</p><p>We explored indirectly the possibility that <italic>gcr2</italic>, <italic>gcl1</italic> and <italic>gcl2</italic> might possess conditional phenotypes by examining the stress-specific expression profile of <italic>GCR2</italic>, <italic>GCL1</italic> and <italic>GCL2</italic> genes in the Genevestigator <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> microarray database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.genevestigator.ethz.ch/">https://www.genevestigator.ethz.ch/</ext-link>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002982-Zimmermann1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. We found that the expression of <italic>GCR2</italic>, <italic>GCL1</italic> and <italic>GCL2</italic> can be up- or down-regulated by certain stresses, but in general, the fold-change in transcript abundance was modest (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002982.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Very few treatments can up- or down-regulate the transcription of <italic>GCR2</italic>, <italic>GCL1</italic> or <italic>GCL2</italic> more than two-fold. This indirect approach provided little information about specific biotic or abiotic conditions that would warrant testing the behaviour of <italic>gcr2</italic> mutants directly.</p><p>Finally, we directly examined the sensitivity of <italic>gcr2</italic> mutants to other plant hormones including auxin, cytokinin, gibberellin, ethylene and brassinosteroid, because these hormones regulate almost every aspect of plant growth and development. We used the root elongation inhibition assay for measuring the sensitivity of <italic>gcr2</italic> mutants to auxin, cytokinin and brassinosteroid, used the hypocotyl elongation promotion assay for measuring the sensitivity to gibberellin, and used the triple response assay for measuring the sensitivity to ethylene. All <italic>gcr2</italic>, <italic>gcl1</italic> and <italic>gcl2</italic> single, double and triple mutants behaved like wild-type in all of these assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002982.s006">Figure S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002982.s007">Figure S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002982.s008">Figure S8</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our results from the examination of mutants carrying all possible combinations of mutations in each member of <italic>GCR2</italic> gene family suggest that GCR2 is not required for the ABA control of seed germination and early seedling development, and do not support the hypothesis that GCR2 functions as a receptor of ABA in these processes. Because we have yet discovered any morphological or conditional phenotypes in <italic>gcr2</italic> mutants, the exact role of <italic>GCR2</italic> in plants remains unknown.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p>All mutants are in the Arabidopsis Columbia ecotypic background (Col-0). <italic>gcr2-4</italic> and <italic>gcl1-1</italic> single mutants have been described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002982-Gao1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.
