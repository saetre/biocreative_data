Since DNA purified from cells is normally under-wound, most studies addressing the relaxation activity of topoisomerase I have utilized negatively supercoiled plasmids. The present report compares the relaxation activity of human topoisomerase I variants on plasmids containing equal numbers of superhelical twists with opposite handedness. We demonstrate that the wild-type enzyme and mutants lacking amino acids 1&#x02013;206 or 191&#x02013;206, or having tryptophane-205 replaced with a glycine relax positive supercoils faster than negative supercoils under both processive and distributive conditions. In contrast to wild-type topoisomerase I, which exhibited camptothecin sensitivity during relaxation of both negative and positive supercoils, the investigated N-terminally mutated variants were sensitive to camptothecin only during removal of positive supercoils. These data suggest different mechanisms of action during removal of supercoils of opposite handedness and are consistent with a recently published simulation study [Sari and Andricioaei (2005) <italic>Nucleic Acids Res</italic>., 33, 6621&#x02013;6634] suggesting flexibility in distinct parts of the enzyme during clockwise or counterclockwise strand rotation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>DNA topoisomerases are essential enzymes that exert their important cellular roles by relaxing the superhelical tension that inevitably arises during important DNA metabolic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Due to the double-helical nature of DNA, topological challenges are manifested whenever the two strands are separated to expose the genetic material. During transcription and replication, positive supercoils (over-winding of DNA) are generated in front of and negative supercoils (under-winding) behind the tracking polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Topoisomerases of the type IB family, including eukaryotic and poxviral topoisomerase I (topo I), relax both positive and negative supercoils by introducing transient single-strand breaks in the DNA duplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7 B8">5&#x02013;8</xref>). Using an active site tyrosine as a nucleophile, topo I cleaves the DNA backbone and generates a covalent 3&#x02032;-phosphotyrosyl linkage and a free 5&#x02032;-hydroxyl DNA end. This hydroxyl group acts as a nucleophile in the ensuing religation reaction, which releases the covalently bound enzyme and restores the continuity of the DNA strand. Relaxation occurs in the duration of the single-stranded DNA break (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>Human topo I is the cellular target for anti-cancer therapeutics of the camptothecin (CPT) class. These compounds exert their cytotoxic function by inhibiting the ligation step of topo I catalysis, thereby trapping covalent protein&#x02013;DNA complexes that are converted into permanent DNA damage upon collision with the replication and transcription machineries. In addition to affecting the ligation activity, CPT is known to inhibit the DNA relaxation activity of human topo I. Indeed recent single molecule nanomanipulation studies in combination with <italic>in vivo</italic> investigations using yeast as a model suggest that CPT at least in part exerts the cytotoxic effects by blocking relaxation of positive supercoils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p>The DNA relaxation event is difficult to address experimentally. Dynamic details concerning this step of topo I catalysis is available only in two recent single-molecule studies, which demonstrate that type IB topoisomerase-catalyzed DNA relaxation proceeds in a stepwise torque-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) and that CPTs slow down the strand rotation step of human topo I catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). These results are consistent with the &#x02018;controlled rotation&#x02019; mechanism for human topo I as suggested by Champoux and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). According to this model, DNA relaxation proceeds by rotation of the free 5&#x02032;-hydroxyl DNA end around the intact strand in a manner that is restricted by the surrounding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13 B14 B15">13&#x02013;15</xref>). Considering this model the observed CPT inhibition of relaxation can be explained by a drug-induced stalling of the enzyme in a conformation that prevents strand rotation by spatial blockage of the cleaved strand imposed by inflexible enzyme parts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>The controlled rotation model is in accordance with the ability of human topo I to relax supercoils of both signs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8">6&#x02013;8</xref>). However, since the direction of rotation will depend on the sign of the supercoils to be removed, the model also implies that different parts of the enzyme may be involved in the control of strand rotation during relaxation of negative versus positive supercoils. At present, experimental data that discriminate between relaxation of supercoils with opposite handedness is available for type II topoisomerases (topo II) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) and at the single molecule level for wild-type topo I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). A recent computer simulation study by Sari and Andricioaei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) suggested that relaxation of supercoils of opposite sign by human topo I involves different parts of the enzyme. This issue was not addressed in the published work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p>To fully appreciate the &#x02018;Sari and Andricioaei model&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), it is necessary to understand the 3D buildup of human topo I. The enzyme is composed of four domains defined as the N-terminal (aa 1&#x02013;206), core (aa 207&#x02013;635), linker (aa 636&#x02013;712) and C-terminal domains (aa 713&#x02013;765) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13 B14 B15">13&#x02013;15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21 B22 B23 B24">21&#x02013;24</xref>) of which the latter contains the active site tyrosine (Tyr-723). Structural data have been obtained only for residues 201&#x02013;765 and reveals a clamp-like enzyme structure embedding the DNA helix in a central protein pore, with two lobes of the protein each binding their side of the helix. One lobe is formed by aa 215&#x02013;433 of the core domain (the upper cap), which is connected by a flexible hinge to the &#x02018;lower cap&#x02019; composed of aa 434&#x02013;635, the C-terminal domain and the anti-parallel coiled-coil linker domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13 B14 B15">13&#x02013;15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p><p>When bound to DNA, human topo I exhibits a closed conformation in which the two caps bring together two opposable loop regions (&#x02018;the lips&#x02019;) located diametrically opposite to the hinge region. It is evident that this architecture necessitates opening/closing of the protein clamp during binding and release of DNA, which most probably is facilitated by motions within the flexible hinge region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). As mentioned, the &#x02018;controlled rotation model&#x02019;, implies that the clamp structure of human topo I presents spatial restrictions to the rotation of the free end of the cleaved DNA strand during the topoisomerization step of catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). An important role in this process is thought to be played by charged residues in the linker domain and in the so-called nose cone region of the upper cap, but other regions may be involved as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). For instance, the N-terminal domain seems to play a role in the control of strand rotation, although the function of this region is less clear due to the lack of extensive structural data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). However, close interactions of Trp-205 to residues in the flexible hinge have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) suggesting that Trp-205 may be important for motions within the hinge region, which in turn may be involved in the control of strand rotation. In support of such a mechanism, we previously demonstrated a role of Trp-205 during DNA topoisomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). This was manifested by altered relaxation kinetics of N-terminally mutated or deleted enzymes and by the DNA relaxation activity of these mutants being unaffected by CPT.</p><p>The importance of flexibility within the human topo I clamp structure during topoisomerization is still a matter of debate. Two individual investigations have addressed the effect of covalently closing the protein clamp by sealing the two opposable lips using disulfide bridging. However, they had contradictory results. One study, published by Carey and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), showed an unaltered DNA relaxation rate upon closing the protein clamp. In contrast, Woo <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) found that DNA relaxation activity was inhibited within the locked protein clamp structure. It is still uncertain how these conflicting results should be interpreted. The simplest explanation relies on the different positions of the disulfide bridges used to lock the two protein clamps. Woo <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) used a bridge positioned closer to the catalytic active site than did Carey and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Hence, the space left for strand rotation may have been too narrow in the Woo clamp but sufficient to allow relaxation in the Carey clamp.</p><p>The molecular dynamics simulation study by Sari and Andricioaei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) contributed significantly to the discussion concerning the mechanism of human topo I-mediated topoisomerization by proposing that two different mechanisms account for the relaxation activity of the enzyme depending on the handedness of supercoils in the DNA substrate. Their results, which presuppose the validity of the &#x02018;controlled rotation model&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), predict that relaxation of positive supercoils requires the loops of the lips to separate by &#x0223c;10&#x02013;14 &#x000c5;. Relaxation of negative supercoils, on the other hand, is expected to involve an &#x0223c;12 &#x000c5; stretching of the hinge, likely assisted by residues in the N-terminal domain such as Trp-205 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). The existing experimental data to some extent support the predictions. The two studies that addressed the effect of locking the topo I clamp by sealing the lips were performed on positively supercoiled DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). One of these studies demonstrated inhibition of relaxation upon clamp closure as predicted by the computer simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Our previous investigations suggesting the involvement of N-terminal regions of the enzyme in the control of DNA relaxation, most likely via interactions to the hinge region were performed on negatively supercoiled DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we addressed the validity of the &#x02018;Sari and Andricioaei model&#x02019; with respect to the putative functions of N-terminal regions in human topo I during topoisomerization. This is accomplished by comparing the activity of three N-terminally mutated human topo I variants, HT(207&#x02013;765) (lacking residues 1&#x02013;206), HT&#x025b5;(191&#x02013;206) (lacking residues 191&#x02013;206) and HT(Trp205Gly) (having Trp-205 replaced with Gly), with that of the wild-type enzyme (HT) on positively and negatively supercoiled DNA substrates. We demonstrate that all four topo I variants remove positive supercoils faster than negative supercoils. Moreover, the introduced mutations render the enzymes insensitive towards CPT in relaxation of negative but not positive supercoils. These results support the proposed model and suggest that residues within the N-terminal region are involved in controlling relaxation of negative but not positive supercoils.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Enzymes and materials</title><p>[&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP (7000 Ci/mmol) was from ICN, oligonucleotides were purchased from DNA technology, and Me<sub>2</sub>SO and CPT were from Sigma-Aldrich.

Positively supercoiled plasmids have been generated mainly by the use of intercalating agents or by subjecting a relaxed plasmid to significantly increased temperature.

However, these methods are not readily controlled to produce under- or over-wound DNA with equal numbers of supercoils of opposite sign allowing factors other than topoisomerase action on DNA topology to be ruled out.

Processive conditions were facilitated by a low salt buffer (15 mM NaCl, coming from the enzyme preparations and 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) using an enzyme:plasmid ratio of &#x0223c;1:1. Under these conditions, each of the four topo I variants have previously been shown to relax negatively supercoiled DNA by completing relaxation of the bound DNA substrate before attacking another substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Hence, the rate-limiting step of catalysis under these conditions is expected to be mainly the strand rotation while the association/dissociation and cleavage/ligation rates are expected to have less effect on the overall reaction rate. Ideally a molar excess of enzyme compared to plasmid should have been used to limit the effect of association/dissociation on the relaxation rate as much as possible. However, within the technical limitation of this assay, it was impossible to obtain quantitative data on relaxation of positive supercoils using a higher enzyme concentration since under these conditions relaxation of positively supercoiled substrates was completed within &#x0003c;5 s (data not shown).</p><p>The relative activities of the four topo I variants on negatively supercoiled substrates have been addressed in previously published comparative investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). In this study, to ease the comparison of their activities on plasmids with positive relative to negative supercoils, the concentration of each enzyme was adjusted to give similar activity on negatively supercoiled substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A&#x02013;D, lanes 1&#x02013;7). In the experimental setup, 300 ng of either positively or negatively supercoiled pBR322 were incubated with each of the enzymes HT, HT(Trp205Gly), HT&#x025b5;(191&#x02013;206) or HT(207&#x02013;765) for increasing time periods as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. Reaction products were analyzed in a 1% agarose gel without ethidium bromide. Following electrophoresis, the DNA was visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Note that positively supercoiled plasmids bind ethidium bromide less efficiently than negatively supercoiled plasmids and are, hence, stained less intensively than the corresponding amount of negative supercoiled plasmids. Therefore, to make sure that equal amounts of substrates were used in all experiments, the DNA concentration was measured by spectrophotometric analysis and by ethidium bromide staining of plasmids in the master reaction mixture after linearization by digestion with HindIII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E). By comparing lanes 1&#x02013;7 with lanes 8&#x02013;14 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A&#x02013;D, it is evident that each of the four topo I variants relaxed the positively supercoiled substrate faster than the negatively supercoiled substrate. Relaxation by all four enzymes proceeded in a processive manner at the investigated assay conditions and no obvious difference in the relaxation mode of the positively and negatively supercoiled substrates was observed for any of the enzymes. Therefore, the relative activities of the enzymes on the two substrates could be estimated rather simply by measuring the amount of fully supercoiled substrate left after the different incubation time periods.

For this purpose the amount of cleavage complexes trapped by the addition of 0.2% SDS (w/v) after 2 min of incubation of positive or negative supercoiled plasmids with a surplus of HT, HT(Trp205Gly), HT&#x025b5;(191&#x02013;206) or HT(207&#x02013;765) was compared. This type of experiment is hampered by the fact that cleavage by topo I is rapidly followed by relaxation, which converts the supercoiled plasmids to the relaxed form. In an attempt to circumvent this problem, the experiment was carried out for a short time period under processive conditions in which the enzyme tends to remain bound to the original DNA for an extended period of time. We therefore believe that the detergent-trapped cleavage pattern reflects the initial cleavage of supercoiled plasmids as much as possible.</p><p>As evident from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, the four topo I variants maintain a slightly (&#x0003c;2-fold) higher level of cleavage with positively relative to negatively supercoiled substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A top panel, compare lanes 3 with 4, 5 with 6, 7 with 8 and 9 with 10, for quantifications see lower panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A).

In contrast, DNA relaxation activity of wild-type human topo I on negatively supercoiled DNA is severely inhibited by CPT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). To address how CPT influences the relaxation of supercoils with different handedness by the four enzyme variants, we compared the effects of CPT on the relaxation of positively and negatively supercoiled substrates mediated by HT, HT(Trp205Gly), HT&#x025b5;(191&#x02013;206) or HT(207&#x02013;765). First, it was confirmed that DNA ligation by all four enzyme preparations was inhibited by CPT to a comparable level (data not shown). Next, 300 ng of either negatively or positively supercoiled pBR322 were incubated with each of the human topo I variants in the absence or presence of 60 &#x003bc;M CPT for increasing time periods as stated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>. For comparison, 10% Me<sub>2</sub>SO was added to reactions performed without CPT to match the conditions in samples containing the drug that was dissolved in Me<sub>2</sub>SO. Note that in this experiment, enzyme concentrations were adjusted to allow the relaxation rates of either positive or negative supercoils with or without added CPT to be compared. Due to the very different relaxation rates on positively versus negatively supercoiled substrates and the limitations of incubation times posed by drug and enzyme stability, the effects of CPT on the relaxation of either substrate could be allowed only by using &#x0223c;10-fold more enzyme for relaxation of negative (enzyme:plasmid ratio 1:1) than positive supercoils (enzyme:plasmid ratio 1:10).

As will be discussed, these results support a model where the regions of the enzyme engaged in control of strand rotation depend on the sign of the supercoils to be relaxed.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The present study was prompted by the &#x02018;Sari and Andricioaei model&#x02019; for HT, which implies different mechanisms of relaxation depending on the handedness of the supercoils to be removed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). To address this possibility experimentally, we have compared the abilities of human topo I and variants mutated or deleted in the N-terminal domain to relax plasmid substrates with an equal number of either positive or negative supercoils. As a result of these studies, we find that HT, HT(Trp205Gly), HT&#x025b5;(191&#x02013;206) and HT(207&#x02013;765) all relax positively supercoiled plasmids &#x0223c;20&#x02013;50 times faster than negatively supercoiled plasmid DNA under processive conditions (molar enzyme:plasmid ratio of &#x0223c;1:1, low salt buffer) and 3&#x02013;10 times faster under distributive conditions (molar enzyme:plasmid ratio of &#x0223c;1:10, high salt buffer). Cleavage activity was slightly (&#x0003c;2-fold) higher on positively supercoiled compared to negatively supercoiled substrates whereas no difference in binding affinity between the two substrates was observed. The relatively modest stimulation of relaxation by positive supercoils under distributive conditions may be explained by the modest stimulation of cleavage. The more drastic stimulation of relaxation under processive conditions by positive supercoils is unlikely to be accounted for solely by an increased cleavage rate. In surplus of enzyme, the relaxation rate under processive conditions is generally accepted to depend mainly on the speed of strand rotation. Due to technical limitations of our assay, we were not able to perform quantitative analyses using surplus of enzyme for the relaxation of both positive and negative supercoils. However, although not being able to determine the fold stimulation (relaxation of positive supercoils was completed too fast) we did observe significantly faster relaxation of positive versus negative supercoils also when using a molar enzyme:plasmid ratio of 5:1 (data not shown). This argues in favor of strand rotation being faster during relaxation of positively supercoiled DNA. In indirect support of this model is the observation that positive supercoils were relaxed relatively faster than negative supercoils under processive compared to distributive conditions. If increased binding/cleavage rates were the main determinant of the stimulated relaxation by positive supercoils, one would expect a more pronounced stimulation of the reaction under distributive rather than under processive conditions, which contradicts our observations. Based on these arguments we believe that strand rotation is faster during uncoiling of positive relative to negative supercoils. A recently published single-molecule nanomanipulation study where relaxation was monitored on a single DNA fragment in which supercoils were introduced by magnetic tweezers did not reveal a significant difference in the rate of positive or negative supercoil removal by human topo I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). However, a bias towards a higher velocity in the uncoiling of positive compared to negative supercoils was observed even at the single DNA molecule level and within the second scale time frame of the experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Since diminutive effects at the single molecule level will be accumulative in our experimental setup performed on a population of substrate and enzyme molecules in a minute scale time frame, we believe that the results obtained by the single molecule technology do not contradict the observations reported here.</p><p>Positive supercoils are primarily generated in cellular DNA ahead of DNA tracking processes such as replication and transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). During recent years it has been a matter of debate which of the eukaryotic topoisomerases topo I, topo II&#x003b1; or II&#x003b2; are mainly responsible of removing such supercoils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Although necessary for ongoing replication and transcription, topoisomerase action in front of DNA tracking processes also poses a cellular risk, since collision with polymerases convert accidentally trapped cleavage complexes to permanent DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33 B34 B35">33&#x02013;35</xref>). Hence, a potent relaxation activity associated with the lowest possible occurrence of cleavage complexes at any given time may be favorable to cells. This consideration leads to the recent suggestion of topo II&#x003b1; being a safe key player in the removal of topological stress ahead of DNA tracking polymerases since this enzyme shows a &#x0003e;10&#x02013;fold stimulated relaxation activity and a decreased cleavage activity on positively compared to negatively supercoiled plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). The stimulation of human topo I relaxation by positive supercoils associated with only a slightly enhanced cleavage activity reported here also argues in favor of human topo I being an important cellular factor in the relaxation of positive supercoils. This notion is supported by the recent finding that positive supercoils accumulate in yeast cells upon CPT-induced inhibition of topo I relaxation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p>We have shown previously that the relaxation activities of HT(207&#x02013;765), HT&#x025b5;(191&#x02013;206) and HT(Trp205Gly) on negatively supercoiled plasmid DNA are unaffected by CPT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). This result was confirmed in the present study. More interestingly, we found that relaxation of positive supercoils by all four enzymes [(HT, HT(Trp205Gly), HT&#x025b5;(191&#x02013;206) and HT(207&#x02013;765)) were inhibited 40- to 60-fold by CPT. In our hands the inhibition of positive supercoil relaxation by HT was less pronounced than was the inhibition of negative supercoil relaxation (150-fold inhibition). This result contradicts recently published data obtained by single DNA molecule and <italic>in vivo</italic> investigations suggesting a more pronounced drug inhibition of positive supercoil than of negative supercoil removal by human topo I. The reason for this difference is not clear. It may in part reflect different timescales and drug concentrations used in the two experimental setups. For the aim of the present study, however, the important thing to note is the comparable drug inhibition level of all four human topo I variants when relaxing positive supercoils as opposed to the lack of inhibition of HT(Trp205Gly), HT&#x025b5;(191&#x02013;206) and HT(207&#x02013;765) during relaxation of negative supercoils.The inhibitory effect of CPT on DNA relaxation by human topo I is believed to result from a drug induced stalling of the enzyme in a rather rigid conformation that hinders rotation of the cleaved DNA strand around the intact strand due to collision with the &#x02018;frozen&#x02019; enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). In favor of this theory the flexible linker domain has only been crystallized in protein&#x02013;DNA complexes bound by a CPT derivative suggesting that drug binding renders the linker region inflexible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). In further support of the notion that drug inhibition of DNA relaxation is mediated by spatial restrictions posed by the bound enzyme is that various deletions and/or mutations (including the mutations described in this study) of human topo I leave the enzyme insensitive towards CPT in relaxation of negative supercoils without affecting the drug-induced inhibition of ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Based on this model for CPT inhibition of relaxation, we believe the different responses of the mutated enzymes towards CPT when relaxing positive versus negative supercoils reflect different mechanisms of strand rotation being engaged in the removal of supercoils of opposite sign. More specifically, the sensitivity of the N-terminally mutated enzymes HT(Trp205Gly), HT&#x025b5;(191&#x02013;206) and HT(207&#x02013;765) towards CPT during relaxation of positively but not negatively supercoiled plasmids suggest a role of Trp-205 and possibly surrounding residues in the control of strand rotation during the removal of negative but not positive supercoils.</p><p>The recently published computer simulations of controlled strand rotation by human topo I performed by Sari and Andricioaei suggest stretching of the hinge region in topo I to be prerequisite during relaxation of negative supercoils, and separation of the lips to be required when positive supercoils are removed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). The experimental data presented here support the simulation model in terms of the involvement of the hinge region in the removal of negative supercoils since both structural and biochemical evidence suggest that Trp-205 and surrounding residues controls motions within the hinge. Hence, based on the available evidence, we suggest that the absence of important N-terminal residues leads to a constitutively stretched conformation of the hinge region allowing a rather uncontrolled clockwise strand rotation during the removal of negative supercoils as implied by the &#x02018;Sari and Andricioaei model&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). As suggested by the same authors, stretching of the hinge region may have little or no effect on the conformation of the lips, which they believe to be involved in the control of counterclockwise strand rotation during relaxation of positive supercoils. This in turn is consistent with the CPT sensitivity of HT(Trp205Gly), HT&#x025b5;(191&#x02013;206) and HT(207&#x02013;765) in the relaxation of positive supercoils presented here.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Maria Vinter for excellent technical assistance.
