In breast cancer patients, high tumor VEGF levels, as assessed by immunohistochemistry or quantitative immunoassay, appear to correlate with poor prognosis and decreased overall survival for both node-positive and node-negative breast cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. VEGF exists in several isoforms; the shorter isoforms are diffusible proteins whereas the longer isoforms are sequestered in the extracellular matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Proteolytic cleavage may convert the longer VEGF isoforms into soluble, bioactive forms in the extracellular space where they become available to endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Sex steroids have been shown to increase VEGF expression in normal breast tissue as well as in experimental breast cancer, both <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and an estrogen responsive element (ERE) has been identified in the promoter region of the gene for VEGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Estrogen exposure is considered a major risk factor for development of breast cancer and the majority of breast cancers maintain their hormonal dependency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. After menopause the circulating levels of estradiol are greatly reduced, yet postmenopausal women have been shown to maintain breast tissue estradiol levels higher than corresponding plasma levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Moreover, levels of estradiol in breast tumor tissue have been shown to be higher than those in normal breast tissue distant from the tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and the major enzymes involved in estrogen synthesis &#x02013; aromatase, sulphatase, and 17&#x003b2;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase &#x02013; have been demonstrated in human breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. As VEGF may be released and estradiol metabolized locally in the breast, an <italic>in situ </italic>technique for surveying these molecules may provide novel insight into their regulation in tumor tissue <italic>in vivo</italic>. We have previously used microdialysis for <italic>in vivo </italic>measurements of estradiol, VEGF, and other molecules in normal human breast and experimental breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In this study we have performed microdialysis in breast cancer patients in order to sample estradiol and VEGF locally in breast cancer tumors and in adjacent normal breast tissue. We found that extracellular levels of VEGF were significantly higher in tumors than in normal breast tissue <italic>in vivo</italic>. In addition, we show a positive correlation between normal breast tissue and plasma levels of estradiol and extracellular VEGF in normal breast tissue <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Ten postmenopausal women, ages 51&#x02013;86, participated in the study.

Each catheter consists of a tubular dialysis membrane (length 10 mm; diameter 0.52 mm) attached to a double-lumen tube (length 100 mm; diameter 0.8 mm). Prior to microdialysis, mepivacaine (0.3 mL; 5 mg/mL) was administered intracutaneously as a local anesthetic. Two microdialysis catheters were thereafter inserted in the affected breast, one intratumorally and one in adjacent, macroscopically normal breast tissue. The insertion was guided by catheters for intravenous use (Venflon, 1.4 mm; BOC Ohmeda AB, Helsingborg, Sweden). The microdialysis catheters were connected to a microinfusion pump (CMA 107, CMA Microdialysis AB) and perfused with NaCl (154 mM) and dextran-70 (40 g/L) at a rate of 0.5 &#x003bc;L/min. After an equilibration period of 30 minutes, the outgoing dialysate was collected and stored together with plasma samples at -70&#x000b0;C for subsequent analysis. No complications occurred during or after the microdialysis experiments.</p><p>Microdialysis allows sampling of the extracellular fluid by passive diffusion of substances over a semi-permeable membrane. The recovery i.e. the amount of substances that diffuse into the perfusion fluid depends on the tissue and membrane properties, the flow rate, and the size of the compound of interest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Diffusion of low molecular substances over the dialysis membrane is almost complete at low flow rates using a 30 mm long dialysis membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, for larger molecules the recovery over the membrane decreases and the measured levels in the microdialysis sample may not be absolute concentrations in the tissue. The recovery of certain substance may be measured <italic>in vitro</italic>, however, this <italic>in vitro </italic>recovery can only be an estimate of the <italic>in vivo </italic>recovery since other factors such as tissue pressure and temperature will affect the diffusion of substances. For the <italic>in vivo </italic>recovery several calibration techniques such as the no net flux technique, the stop flow techniques, and the endogenous reference technique have been developed for low molecular substances unbound in the extracellular space. However, when measuring high molecular weight proteins these techniques may not be applicable because the proteins of interest may be bound to binding proteins <italic>in vivo</italic>, recombinant proteins may not have the same properties as the natural proteins <italic>in vivo</italic>, and plasma and tissue levels of the protein are not equal. We have previously found that in the case of VEGF tissue homogenate, unlike plasma VEGF, correlate significantly with VEGF sampled by microdialysis. We have previously reported an <italic>in vitro </italic>recovery of VEGF of 8% and an <italic>in vitro </italic>recovery of estradiol from plasma of 30% and these data were confirmed in the present study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In the present study all microdialysis values are given as original raw data without any re-calculations.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantification of estradiol and VEGF</title><p>Measurements of estradiol in plasma and microdialysis dialysate were conducted using a commercial quantitative immunoassay kit (estradiol ELISA, DRG Instruments GmbH, Marburg, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. VEGF was quantified using a commercial quantitative immunoassay kit for human VEGF (Fluorokine MAP human VEGF kit, R&#x00026;D systems, Abingdon, UK) and analyzed by the Luminex 100 IS System (Luminex B.V., Oosterhout, Netherlands). According to the manufacturer, the VEGF kit measures the VEGF<sub>165 </sub>and VEGF<sub>121 </sub>isoforms, and the mean minimum detectable dose is 0.81 pg/mL.

Sections were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin. Negative controls did not show staining. In a blinded manner, entire sections were first scanned to determine the range of intensity of the staining. VEGF staining was thereafter scored as weakly or strongly positive.

We show that tumor levels of extracellular VEGF were significantly higher than those in adjacent normal breast tissue <italic>in vivo</italic>. In addition, we show a positive correlation between normal breast tissue levels of estradiol and extracellular VEGF in normal breast tissue <italic>in vivo</italic>, in agreement with previous findings in a larger cohort of healthy women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Higher extracellular VEGF in tumor tissue compared to normal tissue is in line with previous <italic>ex vivo </italic>findings demonstrating an up-regulation of VEGF in breast cancer compared to adjacent non-neoplastic tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The inter-individual differences in extracellular VEGF measured <italic>in vivo </italic>were not apparent in the <italic>ex vivo </italic>immunohistochemical staining. This may be explained by the fact that the shorter soluble isoforms of VEGF, which are sampled using microdialysis, are not likely to be detected in the extracellular space by immunostaining of tissue sections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The freely diffusible VEGF<sub>121 </sub>isoform has been shown to be more angiogenic and tumorigenic than other splice variants of VEGF and is considered the predominant isoform in human breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Moreover, our previous studies suggest that quantitative differences in secreted VEGF are not necessarily detectable in semi-quantitative immunohistochemical staining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Hence, sampling VEGF in the extracellular space, where it exerts its effects, may add significant insight into its regulation in tumor tissue.</p><p>Previous <italic>ex vivo </italic>studies have shown that estradiol levels may be higher in tumor tissue than in normal breast tissue distant from the tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The demonstration of enzymes involved in estrogen synthesis in human breast cancer has led to the intracrine concept that local estrogens produced in a breast tumor and surrounding tissue contributes to tumor development and progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In this study, estradiol levels measured in tumors <italic>in vivo </italic>were indeed higher than in normal breast tissue in 7 of the 10 patients with up to three times higher levels of estradiol in tumors, supporting possible intratumoral estrogen production in some breast cancers.</p><p>While a significant correlation was found between normal tissue estradiol and VEGF, there was no correlation between levels of tumor estradiol and VEGF. Although all tumors were ER positive, levels of expression varied between patients and half of the tumors showed no PR expression. Loss of PR expression has previously been attributed to a non-functional ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], which may be one reason for the absence of correlation between tumor estradiol and tumor VEGF. Therefore our results do not rule out a possible regulation of VEGF by estradiol in breast cancer tumors. Hypoxia is a potent regulator of VEGF and tumor angiogenesis via hypoxia inducible factor-I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], and we have previously demonstrated a positive correlation between tumor size and VEGF in experimental breast cancer models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Xenografts derived from cell lines are however more homogeneous than human tumors due to the use of only one clone of cancer cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In this study both lobular and ductal carcinomas were included, and tumor size varied between 9&#x02013;60 mm. The heterogeneity and the small sample size may explain, at least in part, the lack of correlation between tumor size and tumor VEGF.</p><p>Plasma and tumor levels of VEGF did not correlate in this study in line with our previous findings demonstrating that less than half of the VEGF in circulating plasma originates from the tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This suggests that determination of VEGF in plasma is a poor indicator of tumor VEGF.</p><p>The fact that estradiol may be synthesized and VEGF mobilized locally in the breast and in breast cancer emphasizes the need to sample these molecules in the extracellular space. This study is the first of its kind to measure VEGF and estradiol in human breast cancer tumors <italic>in situ </italic>by microdialysis. Sampling regulators of the tumor microenvironment directly <italic>in situ </italic>is highly desirable taking into consideration that gene expression levels and intracellular protein levels are not always indicative of biologically active extracellular protein levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. It may be argued that the differences seen between tumor and normal tissue merely reflect differences in recovery between the tissues. However, tumor tissue have increased blood flow compared to normal breast tissue which in theory would decrease the recovery and result in decreased levels of the compounds in the tumor. In our present study tumor tissue exhibited higher levels of VEGF. Hence, these results cannot be explained by possible differences of the <italic>in vivo </italic>recovery only. Moreover, correlations are measured in the same sample from the same tissue and these results are unaffected by different tissue recoveries. While studies today are generally limited to <italic>in vitro </italic>cell culture methods, animal models, and <italic>ex vivo </italic>surgical specimens, microdialysis is emerging as unique tool for <italic>in vivo </italic>sampling in accessible tumors such as those of the breast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings show that the <italic>in vivo </italic>levels of extracellular VEGF were significantly higher in breast cancer tumors than in normal breast tissue. In addition, our results support the role of estradiol as a potent regulator of VEGF in normal breast tissue <italic>in vivo</italic>. Further studies are warranted to investigate the role of VEGF in mediating sex steroid effects on breast cancer development and progression. Novel <italic>in situ </italic>data provided by microdialysis may increase our understanding of breast cancer tumor biology.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>CD conceived and designed the study.
