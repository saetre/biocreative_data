To study this process, we disrupted laminin &#x003b3;1 (lam&#x003b3;1) expression in the hippocampus. Lam&#x003b3;1 knockout (KO) and control mice had similar basal expression of kainate (KA) receptors, but the lam&#x003b3;1 KO mice were resistant to KA-induced neuronal death. After KA injection, KA1 subunit levels increased in control mice but were unchanged in lam&#x003b3;1 KO mice. KA1 levels in tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)&#x02013;KO mice were also unchanged after KA, indicating that both tPA and laminin were necessary for KA1 up-regulation after KA injection. Infusion of plasmin-digested laminin-1 into the hippocampus of lam&#x003b3;1 or tPA KO mice restored KA1 up-regulation and KA-induced neuronal degeneration. Interfering with KA1 function with a specific anti-KA1 antibody protected against KA-induced neuronal death both in vitro and in vivo. These results demonstrate a novel pathway for neurodegeneration involving proteolysis of the ECM and KA1 KA receptor subunit up-regulation.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Z.-L.

The extracellular serine protease tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and its zymogen substrate plasminogen are critical to excitotoxic neuronal death because mice deficient in either of these genes are resistant to excitotoxic neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tsirka et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">1997</xref>). Further study showed that the tPA/plasmin proteolytic cascade participates in excitotoxic neuronal death by degrading the ECM protein laminin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen and Strickland, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nagai et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Laminins are heterotrimeric ECM glycoproteins that play important roles in the nervous system. Laminins are expressed in the mouse hippocampus and disappear after excitotoxin injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hagg et al., 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jucker et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen and Strickland, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tian et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nagai et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Indyk et al., 2003</xref>). Laminin disappearance precedes neuronal death, is spatially coincident with regions that exhibit neuronal loss, and is blocked by either tPA deficiency or infusion of a plasmin inhibitor, both of which also prevent neuronal degeneration. These studies indicate that laminin is a key player in excitotoxic neuronal degeneration. However, the mechanism of how laminin degradation participates in neuronal death is not clear.</p><p>To study the mechanistic role of laminin in excitotoxic neuronal death, we generated a laminin &#x003b3;1 (lam&#x003b3;1) conditional knockout (KO) mouse line using the Cre/loxP system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen and Strickland, 2003</xref>) and disrupted laminin expression in the hippocampus (hereafter referred to as lam&#x003b3;1 KO mice). Analysis of these mice revealed that they were resistant to excitotoxic neuronal death. We established that laminin degradation products, which are produced via the tPA/plasmin system, lead to up-regulation of the KA1 subunit of the kainate (KA) receptor and subsequent neuronal death. Consistent with this conclusion, specific interference of KA1 subunit function rendered wild-type mice resistant to excitotoxic degeneration.</p><p>Our results illuminate a novel excitotoxic pathway in which KA up-regulates tPA, leading to laminin degradation by plasmin. The products of laminin proteolysis up-regulate a key KA receptor, which increases the sensitivity to excitotoxins and eventually causes neuronal death. This pathway suggests new approaches to countering the neuronal loss associated with excitotoxic injury in disorders like stroke.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Lam&#x003b3;1 depletion in the hippocampus renders neurons resistant to KA-induced neuronal cell death</title><p>Injection of excitotoxins into the hippocampus causes massive cell death in the cornu ammonis regions of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coyle et al., 1978</xref>).

To investigate whether neurons were stimulated by KA, we compared c-fos expression at 0, 2, 4, and 6 h after KA injection in the hippocampus of control and lam&#x003b3;1 KO mice by immunohistochemistry. Without KA injection, there was no c-fos expression in the hippocampus of either control (floxed lam&#x003b3;1 mice) or lam&#x003b3;1 KO mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, a and c). c-fos was induced similarly in the DG of both control and lam&#x003b3;1 KO mice 1 (not depicted) and 2 h after KA injection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A, e and g</xref>). 4 h after KA injection, c-fos expression spread to CA1&#x02013;3 regions in control mice but did not spread to CA1 and only minimally to CA3 in lam&#x003b3;1 KO mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A, i and k</xref>). 6 h after KA injection, c-fos expression was decreased in the control mice compared with 4 h (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A, i and m</xref>).

These results demonstrate that KA-induced c-fos expression in the DG region of lam&#x003b3;1 KO mice is initially identical to wild-type mice, but the induction fails to propagate to other regions, notably CA1. The failure of c-fos expression to spread in the lam&#x003b3;1 KO mice could be related to the neuroprotection observed in the absence of laminin.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>KA-induced c-fos protein expression in the hippocampus of lam&#x003b3;1 KO mice was impaired.</bold> (A) Time course of c-fos expression in the hippocampus of control (Con) and lam&#x003b3;1 KO mice after KA injection.

In tPA KO mice infused with control buffer, there was very little neuronal death 2 d after KA injection (Fig. S4, A and B, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803107/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803107/DC1</ext-link>).

The difference in the number of dead neurons between plasmin-digested laminin-infused and buffer-infused tPA KO mice was significant (Fig. S4 G). Because infusion of intact laminin into the hippocampus of tPA KO mice did not up-regulate KA1 expression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), we analyzed whether intact laminin could restore neuronal sensitivity to excitotoxins in tPA KO mice.

One possible explanation for the difference between our previous and present results is in the batch of laminin used. If our previous batch of intact laminin (no longer available) had some degradation, it could have facilitated KA-induced neuronal death in tPA KO mice.

A time course of KA1 expression after KA injection showed that KA1 increased at 1 h, peaked at 2 h, returned to normal levels at 6 h, and then decreased (Fig. S5 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803107/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803107/DC1</ext-link>), presumably as a result of neuronal loss. A time-course analysis of KA-induced neuronal cell death showed that neuronal loss was first detected 6 h after KA injection and gradually increased over the next 2 d (Fig. S5 B). The CA1 region showed the greatest neuronal death. Because KA1 expression is up-regulated in a 1&#x02013;4-h time frame and is mostly increased in CA1 after KA injection, whereas neuronal death begins at 6 h and is most obvious in the CA1 region, these results demonstrate that KA1 up-regulation precedes neuronal death and is spatially correlated to the regions that show the most profound degeneration.</p><p>The aforementioned experiments established a correlation between KA1 up-regulation and excitotoxic neuronal death. To further investigate this correlation, we investigated the effect of interfering with KA1 function on KA-induced neuronal cell death.

Among the five antibodies, three showed staining in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions. We analyzed the effect of these three anti-KA1 antibodies on KA-induced neuronal death in vitro.

Many facets of this cell death pathway are understood. For example, in conditions such as ischemic stroke, loss of blood flow leads to energy depletion in neurons and accumulation of excitatory amino acids like glutamate. The excess glutamate can depolarize the neurons, leading to an increased release of glutamate and the establishment of a deleterious cycle. This massive depolarization causes Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> influx and activation of cell death pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kemp and McKernan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hara and Snyder, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Although a general understanding of the process is known, many molecular details are unclear. In the work reported in this study, we shed light on two fundamental features of the cell death pathway: the critical role of the KA1 receptor and the role of proteases and the ECM.</p><p>KA receptors are one of the three subtypes of ionotropic receptors for the excitatory transmitter glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dingledine et al., 1999</xref>). The other two subtypes are <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate and AMPA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mayer and Westbrook, 1987</xref>). KA receptors are tetrameric combinations of five subunits: KA1, KA2, GluR5, GluR6, and GluR7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hollmann and Heinemann, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lerma, 2006</xref>). Among these subunits, GluR5, GluR6, and GluR7 have low affinity KA-binding sites, whereas KA1 and KA2 have high affinity binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">London and Coyle, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Unnerstall and Wamsley, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hampson et al., 1987</xref>). Therefore, high affinity receptors are heteromeric assemblies that include the KA1 or KA2 subunits, whereas receptors lacking KA1 or KA2 have lower affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Contractor et al., 2003</xref>). GluR5&#x02013;7 subunits can form functional homomeric or heteromeric receptors, whereas KA1 and KA2 subunits only participate in heteromeric receptors and can partner with any of the GluR5&#x02013;7 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Egebjerg et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Werner et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Herb et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sommer et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schiffer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huettner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lerma, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">2006</xref>).

However, after KA injection, only KA1 was significantly increased in wild-type mice. Further analysis using immunohistochemistry revealed that KA1 was mainly up-regulated in the CA1 pyramidal neuronal cell layers. Because the KA1 subunit contains a high affinity agonist-binding site, increased expression may increase the binding of the receptors to KA and therefore sensitize neurons to excitotoxic neuronal death. In keeping with this idea, KA1 was not up-regulated in mice resistant to neuronal loss (see below). These experiments established a correlation between KA1 up-regulation and neuronal death after KA injection.</p><p>Mice deficient in tPA or plasminogen are resistant to excitotoxic neuronal death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tsirka et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">1997</xref>). Analysis of these mice implicated the degradation of laminin as a component of the death pathway. A likely explanation was that loss of laminin resulted in loss of matrix interaction and cell death termed anoikis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen and Strickland, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gilmore, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reddig and Juliano, 2005</xref>). If this was the mechanism, mice lacking laminin in the hippocampus should be sensitized to neuronal degeneration.</p><p>However, mice deficient in laminin in the hippocampus were resistant to neuronal loss. In tPA or lam&#x003b3;1 KO mice, the KA1 subunit was not significantly increased after KA injection. One mechanism that would explain the previous results with tPA/plasmin-deficient mice and the new results with hippocampal lam&#x003b3;1 KO mice was that laminin degradation released products that contributed to neuronal death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen and Strickland, 1997</xref>). Our results indicate that laminin degradation by plasmin generates biologically active fragments that promote neuronal death. In this model, loss of tPA or plasmin would protect neurons because laminin would not be degraded. Laminin deficiency would also be protective because even in the presence of proteases, laminin degradation products would not be generated. Our results support this hypothesis. Infusion of laminin degradation products restores neuronal sensitivity to either lam&#x003b3;1 or tPA KO mice.</p><p>Various studies have shown that tPA is rapidly released (within 30 min) upon membrane depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gualandris et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Parmer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baranes et al., 1998</xref>). Laminin is degraded in 1&#x02013;2 h after KA injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen and Strickland, 1997</xref>). The KA1 subunit of the KA receptor is up-regulated during the same time frame (1&#x02013;2 h) in control mice (Fig. S5 A) but is not increased in either tPA or lam&#x003b3;1 KO mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Because KA1 is predominantly up-regulated in the CA1 region of control mice after KA injection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), the lack of KA1 up-regulation in the CA1 region of lam&#x003b3;1 KO mice impaired c-fos induction in CA1 4 h after KA injection and the spread and maintenance of c-fos expression in other regions of the hippocampus at later time points (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). The timing of these molecular changes supports our hypothesis that plasmin-mediated degradation of laminin up-regulates the KA1 subunit, which is necessary for c-fos induction and neuronal cell death in the CA1 region of the hippocampus.</p><p>Infusion of plasmin-digested laminin into the hippocampus of either tPA or lam&#x003b3;1 KO mice restored KA1 up-regulation after KA injection. However, infusion of intact laminin only restored KA1 up-regulation in lam&#x003b3;1 KO mice but not in tPA KO mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Lam&#x003b3;1 KO mice would still generate plasmin activity after KA, which could degrade the infused intact laminin. In contrast, the infused intact laminin could not be degraded in tPA KO mice because there is no tPA to activate plasminogen, and thus KA1 was not up-regulated. Therefore, the degradation products of laminin generated by plasmin play an important role in KA1 up-regulation. These experiments showed that proteolytic fragments of laminin can regulate KA1 subunit expression and therefore modulate excitotoxic neuronal degeneration. However, the mechanism by which laminin fragments regulate KA1 subunit expression is currently unclear. For example, laminin fragments could bind to as yet unidentified receptors and activate intracellular signaling pathway to regulate KA1 subunit expression. Laminin fragments could regulate KA1 expression at transcriptional, translational, or posttranslational levels.</p><p>Based on previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tsirka et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen and Strickland, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nagai et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2003</xref>) and our current results, we propose a new model of excitotoxic neuronal death. In the presence of excess excitatory amino acid, tPA is released from neurons and converts plasminogen to plasmin. Plasmin catalyzes the degradation of laminin, generating laminin fragments that up-regulate the KA1 subunit of KA receptors. Up-regulation of KA1 could bias the subunit composition of KA receptors so that more KA1 subunits participate in channel formation. Alternatively, increased expression of KA1 subunits could increase the number of KA receptors, which would be composed of one KA1 subunit with other subunits. Either one of these changes would lead to an increased ratio of KA1 subunits. Because the KA1 subunit is a high affinity site for KA, this occurrence would increase the affinity of the receptors to KA, therefore promoting excitotoxic neuronal death.</p><p>The up-regulation of the KA1 subunit mainly occurred in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, which normally exhibits low KA1 expression. Therefore, KA-induced excitotoxic neuronal death in CA1 may represent an effect of KA that is secondary to the up-regulation of KA1 subunits. In support of this idea, interfering with KA1 function by anti-KA1 antibodies dramatically decreased neuronal loss after KA injection. Given the location of KA1 up-regulation, it is possible that our model is most relevant to those pathologies in which neuronal death occurs mostly in the CA1 region.</p><p>Our results have implications for the mechanisms by which the ECM controls cell viability. It has been shown that the loss of the matrix attachment can lead to cell death via anoikis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Meredith et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frisch and Ruoslahti, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frisch and Screaton, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grossmann, 2002</xref>). It is possible that in some cases, it is not simply the loss of attachment but the generation of toxic degradation products from the matrix that contribute to cell death. This idea is similar in concept to a recent study showing that fragments of collagen can have antiangiogenesis effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marneros and Olsen, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Finally, there is no effective therapy for the neuronal death that occurs in ischemia. General glutamate receptor antagonists can protect against excitotoxic neuronal death, but such antagonists have dramatically deleterious effects on brain activity (e.g., impaired memory, decreased alertness, and coma). These side effects prevent their use in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kemp and McKernan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lipton, 2006</xref>). Demonstration that the single subunit KA1 is important for neuronal death suggests a more specific therapeutic approach that might protect neurons while leaving most brain activity unaffected.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Adult male mice (8&#x02013;10 wk of age) backcrossed to C57BL6 for 10 generations were used.

In brief, the mice were injected intraperitoneally with atropine (0.6 mg/kilogram of body weight) and were anesthetized with 2.5% avertin (0.02 ml/gram of body weight). They were placed on a stereotaxic apparatus (Stoelting). A microosmotic pump (Alza) containing 100 &#x003bc;l purified mouse laminin-1 (0.5 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich), 100 &#x003bc;l plasmin-digested laminin-1 (0.5 mg/ml; proteases were heat inactivated after digestion), 100 &#x003bc;l anti-KA1 antibody (80 &#x003bc;g/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), 100 &#x003bc;l rabbit IgG (80 &#x003bc;g/ml; control for KA1 antibody; Sigma-Aldrich), 100 &#x003bc;l PBS (control for laminin infusion), or 100 &#x003bc;l of control buffers used for laminin digestion was placed subcutaneously in the back of the animals. A brain infusion cannula was inserted in the brain (at coordinates bregma, &#x02212;2.5 mm; medial lateral, 0.5 mm; and dorsoventral, 1.6 mm), and was connected to a pump to deliver the compound into the hippocampus. The infusion rate was 0.5 &#x003bc;l/h. The pumps were allowed to infuse the designated solution for 7 d.</p><p>For KA or PBS injection into the CA1 region, a total volume of 300 nl PBS or 0.5 mM KA (Tocris Cookson) for a dose of 0.15 nmol was delivered unilaterally using a microinjection apparatus (Stoelting) via a 2.5-&#x003bc;l Hamilton syringe equipped with a 33-gauge needle over the course of 60 s. After retracting the needle 0.1 mm, the needle was kept in place for 2 min to allow diffusion of KA, after which it was completely removed. The coordinates for the injections were bregma, &#x02212;2.5 mm; medial lateral, 1.7 mm; and dorsoventral, 1.6 mm. The mice were perfused through the heart with ice-cold saline (for Western blotting) or further perfused with 4% PFA in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (for immunohistochemistry), for either 2 h , 4 h, 6 h, 2 d, or 6 d after experimental injections. For Western blot analyses, the hippocampi were collected in dry ice. For immunohistochemistry, the brains were removed, postfixed overnight at 4&#x000b0;C, and incubated in 30% sucrose in PBS for 48 h at 4&#x000b0;C. 30-&#x003bc;m coronal brain sections were cut on a microtome, collected in PBS, and processed for further analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 1999</xref>).

In brief, hippocampi were homogenized in lysis buffer containing 25 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 95 mM NaCl, 2% SDS, 10 mM EDTA, phosphatase inhibitor cocktail I and II, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich). Protein concentrations were determined by the Lowry method (Bio-Rad Laboratories). 30&#x02013;50 &#x003bc;g of proteins was fractionated on 10% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), and probed with primary antibodies. Primary antibodies were KA1 (1:2,000) and KA2 (1:1,000) obtained from Millipore, KA1 (1:1,000) and c-fos (1:1,500) obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., and GluR5 (1:2,000), GluR6, GluR7 (1:1,000), phospho&#x02013;c-Jun (1:1,000), phospho-JNK (1:2,000), and phospho-SEK1/MKK4 (1:1,000) obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. After incubation with appropriate secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare), proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Seven control and mutant hippocampi were used for each Western blot, and samples were blotted three times. For loading controls, each membrane was reprobed with anti&#x02013;&#x003b2;-actin antibody (1:8,000; Sigma-Aldrich). The signal intensity of the Western blot film was quantified by ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). All signal intensities were normalized to actin.

Cultures were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37&#x000b0;C with a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. The medium was changed every 3&#x02013;4 d by half volume. Using this protocol, the cultured cells were 99% neuronal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brewer et al., 1993</xref>; unpublished data).</p><p>To determine the effect of anti-KA1 antibodies on KA-induced neuronal death in vitro, 14-d in vitro neuronal cultures were washed with NeuroBasal media three times to remove dead cells. The neuronal cultures were incubated in fresh growth media overnight, and control IgG or anti-KA1 antibodies were added to the media and incubated for 3 h. 50 &#x003bc;M KA was added to the media and incubated for 48 h. Additional control IgG or anti-KA1 antibodies were added to the cultures 24 h after the first addition. Neuronal cultures were fixed in 4% PFA and processed for TuJ1 immunocytochemistry and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase&#x02013;mediated biotinylated UTP nick-end labeling assay (TUNEL staining). TUNEL staining was performed using the In Situ Cell Death Detection kit (Roche) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Neuronal cultures were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100/0.1% sodium citrate on ice for 2 min and incubated with the TUNEL reaction mixture at 37&#x000b0;C for 1 h in a humidified chamber. After TUNEL staining, the cultures were incubated with mouse anti-TuJ1 antibody (1:1,000; Covance), and the staining was visualized using fluorescent dye&#x02013;conjugated donkey anti&#x02013;mouse IgG. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. TUNEL and DAPI double-labeled nuclei were determined. Five random fields were analyzed in each culture well, and each experiment group was composed of three wells. The statistical analyses were based on results from three different batches of cultures. The differences in percentage of TUNEL-positive nuclei in different groups were analyzed by one-way ANOVA.</p></sec><sec><title>Image analysis</title><p>All images were acquired by using an AxioVision System (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) under a microscope (Axiovert 200; Carl Zeiss, Inc.) using a camera (Axiocam; Carl Zeiss, Inc.), and images were processed with Photoshop (Adobe).</p></sec><sec><title>Online supplemental material</title><p>Fig. S1 shows KA-induced neuronal death in the CA2/3 region of lam&#x003b3;1 KO mice and the long-term neuronal protective effect of lam&#x003b3;1 deficiency.
