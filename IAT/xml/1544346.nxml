The C/EBP transcription factors consist of an activation domain, a DNA-binding basic region, and a leucine-rich dimerization domain. The structure of C/EBP&#x003b1; and its isoforms has been well described. The predominant isoform is a 42 kDa protein with three transactivation domains in the N-terminal portion of the protein. A second isoform is a 30-kDa protein formed from a downstream initiation site that alters the transactivation domain. Both isoforms contain the same dimerization and DNA-binding domains and are influential in controlling terminal differentiation and growth of a variety of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. C/EBP&#x003b1; is expressed in numerous tissues with the highest expression in the placenta, liver, lung, skeletal muscle, pancreas, small intestine, colon and peripheral blood leukocytes. The C/EBPs in general are important regulators of cellular differentiation and determinants of terminal cell function. C/EBP&#x003b1; in particular is required for myeloid differentiation; mice deficient in C/EBP&#x003b1; have an early block in granulocyte maturation with a lack of expression of the G-CSF receptor[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The role of C/EBP&#x003b1; in hematopoietic differentiation is complex as at the same time that C/EBP&#x003b1; induces granulocyte differentiation while erythroid differentiation is inhibited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. C/EBP&#x003b1; plays a role in hepatocytes and adipocytes mediating cell cycle arrest and transcription of hepatic-specific and adipose-specific genes respectively. C/EBP&#x003b1; interacts with regulators of cell cycle expression such as cdk2 and cdk4, directly interacts with E2F, and represses c-Myc expression with a resultant inhibition of adipocytes, hepatocyte, and granulocyte proliferation and induction of terminal differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In view of the expression of C/EBP&#x003b1; in terminally differentiated tissues and its role in regulating cell growth it is attractive to examine whether abnormalities of expression of C/EBP&#x003b1; have a role in carcinogenesis. Recently, C/EBP&#x003b1; has been shown to be important in a subset of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. In patients with a t(8;21) translocation the resulting AML1-ETO fusion protein blocks C/EBP&#x003b1; expression and restoration of C/EBP&#x003b1; expression restores granulocyte differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In other patients with morphologically similar leukemias, but without the t(8;21) translocation, heterozygous mutations in C/EBP&#x003b1; result in the production of an amino terminus truncated protein that acts in a dominant negative manner to block C/EBP&#x003b1; DNA binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The resulting lack of transactivation of granulocyte target genes gives rise to the characteristic loss of differentiation seen in acute myelogenous leukemia.</p><p>The presence of C/EBP&#x003b1; in normal prostate tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and the role of C/EBP&#x003b1; in the regulation of differentiation and growth in other tissues raises the issues as to whether C/EBP&#x003b1; is important in normal prostatic differentiation and if aberrations of expression of C/EBP&#x003b1; are seen in prostate cancer. Significant levels of C/EBP&#x003b1; mRNA can be detected in the prostate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. While only one silent mutation of C/EBP&#x003b1; has been found in 33 prostate cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] increased expression of C/EBP&#x003b1; RNA in cancerous prostate epithelium versus normal epithelium and stroma has been detected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. To understand the function of C/EBP&#x003b1; in the prostate we examined first the distribution of C/EBP&#x003b1; in normal and cancerous prostatic epithelium. We then examined the effects of C/EBP&#x003b1; on the expression of the prostate specific antigen (PSA). PSA is a serine protease and a member of the kallkrein family. In normal prostate, PSA is produced in secretory epithelial cells to liquefy semen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and PSA is considered a marker of prostate epithelial differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In prostate cancer, PSA is an important biomarker for the diagnosis, treatment evaluation, and prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. An elevated serum PSA often indicates the presence and/or recurrence of prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and high levels of serum PSA is typical of patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer. In addition to semen liquefaction, PSA is thought to regulate prostate proliferation through the cleavage of insulin growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) to activate IGF signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Recent studies showed that PSA may contribute to bone metastasis by enhancing adhesion of prostate cancer cells to bone marrow endothelium and activating latent TGF&#x003b2; 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The expression of PSA is mainly regulated by the androgen receptor (AR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Inhibition of AR signaling blocks the expression of PSA. The tumor suppressor genes PPAR gamma and p53 inhibited PSA expression through AR signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. PSA is also regulated by androgen-independent mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In this study, we demonstrated the inhibition of PSA expression by C/EBP&#x003b1; via epigenetic loss of AR expression and direct interaction between C/EBP&#x003b1; and the PSA promoter/enhancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and cell transduction by retrovirus expressing C/EBP&#x003b1;</title><p>The human prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP (ATCC, Rockville, MD), was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech Cellgro, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS).

To determine if altered expression of C/EBP&#x003b1; also occurred at the protein level the presence of C/EBP&#x003b1; was examined by immunohistochemistry in tissue slides from 21 different cases of prostate adenocarcinoma. In normal or hyperplastic glands C/EBP&#x003b1; was detected predominately in the basal cell layer (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). The expression of C/EBP&#x003b1; in the normal glands showed a similar distribution to p63, which is a marker of basal cells of prostate gland and potential marker of prostate stem cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). As markers of prostate differentiation the expression of AR and PSA was predominately localized to secretory epithelial cells at the abluminal surface (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). In nineteen of the 21 prostate cancer cases C/EBP&#x003b1; was detected albeit with variable intensity from case to case (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>) and often with an intensity of staining less than seen in the basal layer of normal or hyperplastic glands. In addition, cells staining strongly for C/EBP&#x003b1; were often seen in the top layer of the cancerous epithelium forming pseudo lumen. In the 19 cases with positive staining for C/EBP&#x003b1;, the staining was seen regardless of Gleason score. For example, in a case with Gleason score 4+5 significant amounts of C/EBP&#x003b1; were detected in at least 10 to 15 % of the cancer cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>). Advanced cancerous regions often displayed apparently lower amounts of AR and PSA expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H</xref>) compared with AR and PSA expression in hyperplastic glands (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>C/EBP&#x003b1; expression inhibits expression of AR and PSA</title><p>The immunohistochemistry findings in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> indicated that C/EBP&#x003b1; was present in the in the basal layer of normal prostate epithelium while AR and PSA were localized to the differentiated secretory epithelial layers. What then is the role of expression of C/EBP&#x003b1; in the basal cells of normal prostate epithelium? In contrast to the known role of C/EBP&#x003b1; in other tissues is the expression of C/EBP&#x003b1; inhibiting differentiation of basal cells to secretory epithelium? And in the cancerous tissue is the expression of C/EBP&#x003b1; affecting differentiation and proliferation? To begin addressing these questions we tested the effect of C/EBP&#x003b1; expression on AR and PSA expression in LNCaP cells, a prostate cancer cell line that expresses both AR and PSA. The constitutional expression of C/EBP&#x003b1; in the LNCaP cells is extremely low. Hence, we introduced the C/EBP&#x003b1; gene into the cells by a retroviral construct carrying the rat C/EBP&#x003b1; cDNA. After selection by geneticin, two pooled clones with constitutional expression of C/EBP&#x003b1; were established from the LNCaP parental cells. The nuclear localization of the expressed C/EBP&#x003b1; was demonstrated by the western blot analysis of nuclear extracts from the two clones (data not shown). In clone 1 C/EBP&#x003b1; extinguished expression of AR and PSA immediately. Interestingly, in clone 2 with repeated passage the cells displayed increasing expression of C/EBP&#x003b1; and decreasing expression of AR and PSA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). By the third passage AR and PSA expression had decreased to 37% and 64% respectively of control cells transduced with virus vector alone and by the eighth passage expression of AR and PSA was almost non-detectable. In addition with sequential passages of clone 2 cells C/EBP&#x003b1; expression increased 1.6 fold between passage 3 and 8. Unexplained is the increased expression of the p30 isoform of C/EBP&#x003b1; in clone 2 at passage 8 while in clone 1 cells the p30 isoform was not expressed (data not shown). The long term expression of C/EBP&#x003b1; decreased not only the expression of AR and PSA but also significantly stimulated cell proliferation. The C/EBP&#x003b1;-expressing cells at passage 8 showed more rapid growth than the control cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). To Confirm the cell proliferation by long term expression of C/EBP&#x003b1; in prostate cancer cells, we introduced the virus carrying C/EBP&#x003b1; cDNA into PC3 and DU145 cells and the increased cell proliferation was also seen in the two transduced cell clones (data not shown)</p><p>The extinguished expression of AR and PSA could either be separate phenomena or, as the PSA promoter is known to have multiple androgen receptor response elements (ARE), if C/EBP&#x003b1; decreased AR expression then PSA expression would decrease also. To test the two possibilities we first examined the effect of further increases of C/EBP&#x003b1; on AR and PSA expression. To increase C/EBP&#x003b1; expression we exposed the clone 2 cells to trichostatin (TSA), an inhibitor of histone deacetylase, to activate retrovirus-mediated gene expression. The addition of TSA to the clone 2 cells for 48 hours resulted in a 7 fold increase of C/EBP&#x003b1; protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Concomitant with the increase of C/EBP&#x003b1; PSA expression decreased by 75 % but AR levels remained unchanged. We then examined the effect of transient transfection of C/EBP&#x003b1; on endogenous PSA expression in LNCaP cells transfected with the C/EBP&#x003b1;-pEGFP construct. Using a construct that expressed EGFP allowed the transfected cells to be sorted by flow cytometry. In the transfected cells the levels of PSA mRNA in the C/EBP&#x003b1;-pEGFP expressing cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, lane 2) decreased by approximately 2.5-fold compared to the cells transfected with pEGFP alone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, lane 1). These results suggest that transiently increasing C/EBP&#x003b1; expression results in decreased endogenous PSA levels implying that C/EBP&#x003b1; may directly inhibit the transcription of the PSA gene and that the decrease in PSA may not be related to the reduced expression of AR.</p></sec><sec><title>Further examination of the effects of C/EBP&#x003b1; expression on the transcriptional activity of PSA</title><p>To determine if the decreased expression of PSA was a direct effect of C/EBP&#x003b1; on PSA transcription we examined the effect of C/EBP&#x003b1; on expression of the PSA promoter. For these assays we used the PSA promoter coupled to a luciferase reporter gene. The PSA promoter consists of a proximal promoter containing two AREs and a distal enhancer with six AREs located about 4.2 kb upstream from the transcription start site. For these experiments, we used 5&#x003b1;-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a nature ligand of androgen receptor, to activate AR signaling. LNCaP cells transfected with the PSA promoter/enhancer coupled to the luciferase reporter were co-transfected with C/EBP&#x003b1;-pEGFP or pcDNA3-C/EBP&#x003b1; in the presence and absence of DHT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Both of the C/EBP&#x003b1; constructs significantly (p &#x0003c; 0.01) inhibited the PSA promoter although the pcDNA3-C/EBP&#x003b1; construct inhibited PSA transcriptional activity more than the C/EBP&#x003b1;-pEGFP construct both under basal conditions and in the presence of DHT. The greater inhibition by pcDNA3-C/EBP&#x003b1; could be the result of the C-terminus of the C/EBP&#x003b1; synthesized from the pcDNA3-C/EBP&#x003b1; construct being unencumbered by the EGFP moiety. The inhibition of PSA transcriptional activity in the presence of DHT also demonstrates that C/EBP&#x003b1; may affect AR signaling in activation of the PSA promoter/enhancer. To exclude the inhibition of the PSA promoter by C/EBP&#x003b1; as a non-specific artifact, we examined the promoter activity of prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) by co-transfection of the PMSA promoter with the C/EBP&#x003b1; expression plasmid. In contrast to the PSA promoter, the PSMA promoter was not inhibited by the expression of C/EBP&#x003b1; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). In addition, we examined the effect of the forced expression of C/EBP&#x003b1; in the PC3 and LNCaP retrovirus transduced cell lines on levels of granulocyte colony- stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor mRNA. C/EBP&#x003b1; is well known to stimulate transcription of the G-CSF receptor and in the transduced PC3 and LNCaP cell lines we observed that forced expression of C/EBP&#x003b1; increased the RNA level of the G-CSF receptor by 2&#x02013;6 fold (data not shown). Taken together these results suggest that inhibition by C/EBP&#x003b1; of the PSA promoter/enhancer activity is specific.</p><p>To exclude that the suppression of PSA transcription was specific to LNCaP cells we also examined the effect of pcDNA3-C/EBP&#x003b1; on the PSA promoter/enhancer in two other prostate cancer cell lines, ALVA101 and PC3, neither of which express AR or PSA. The ALVA101 and PC3 cells were co-transfected with an AR expressing plasmid to allow comparison of the effect of C/EBP&#x003b1; expression in the presence of DHT. As seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, in both the ALVA 101 and PC3 cells pcDNA3-C/EBP&#x003b1; significantly inhibited PSA transcription both in the absence and presence of DHT. Indeed, the inhibition of reporter expression was greater in the ALVA101 and PC3 cells than the LNCaP cells even with transfection with higher amounts of C/EBP&#x003b1;. In addition, the effect of C/EBP&#x003b1; on the proximal PSA promoter was also examined and demonstrated that in all three cell types, LNCaP, ALVA101, and PC3, that transient transfection with C/EBP&#x003b1; decreased proximal promoter transcription in the presence and absence of DHT although to a lesser degree than with the full-length promoter/enhancer (data not shown).</p><p>To examine if C/EBP&#x003b1; acted directly on the AR and interfered with the function of the AR in androgen-dependent signaling in the enhanced inhibition by C/EBP&#x003b1; of the PSA promoter/enhancer in DHT-stimulated transcription, varying amounts of AR expression plasmid were co-transfected with luciferase reporters and C/EBP&#x003b1; expression vector into LNCaP cells and transcription activation was measured by luciferase activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Alteration of the amount of AR expressed did not affect the inhibition by C/EBP&#x003b1; either of the full-length PSA promoter/enhancer (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, upper panel) or the proximal PSA promoter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, lower panel). These results indicate that inhibition by C/EBP&#x003b1; of androgen-dependent transcriptional activation of PSA was independent of the levels of AR expression. In additional experiments, C/EBP&#x003b1; could not be co-immunoprecipitated with AR suggesting no direct interaction between AR and C/EBP&#x003b1; (data not shown).</p><p>Mutations in the C/EBP&#x003b1; gene have been found in the myeloblasts of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia, FAB classification M2. Mutations have been observed to occur in both the transactivating and leucine zipper domains of the N- and C- termini portions of the gene, respectively. The protein products of the mutated C/EBP&#x003b1; act as dominant negative suppressors of wild type C/EBP&#x003b1; and block the stimulation of myeloid target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. We examined the effect of representative mutations of C/EBP&#x003b1; on PSA-luciferase activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). The mutation designated D30 showed considerable inhibition of PSA-luciferase activity while D4371, a mutation occurring in the leucine zipper domain exhibited minimal affect on C/EBP&#x003b1; inhibition of the reporter construct. These results suggest that the C-terminal leucine zipper region of C/EBP&#x003b1; is more important than the transactivating domain in the suppression of the PSA promoter/enhancer.</p><p>Analysis of the amino acid sequence of the members of C/EBP subfamily shows that the C-terminal leucine zipper region is highly conserved. Hence, if the C-terminus is essential for inhibition of the PSA promoter/enhancer, than other members of the C/EBP subfamily should exhibit a similar effect. We tested this hypothesis by transfecting LNCaP cells with C/EBP&#x003b2; and demonstrated that human C/EBP&#x003b2;, as with human C/EBP&#x003b1;, significantly inhibited PSA promoter/enhancer activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). The inhibition by human C/EBP&#x003b2; was 91% in DHT-stimulated transcription and 63% in basal transcription, respectively, compared to C/EBP&#x003b1; which caused inhibition of 94% and 57%, respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>C/EBP&#x003b1; is expressed in many tissues including white and brown adipose tissue, myeloid cells, lung, prostate, ovary, and colon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The role of C/EBP&#x003b1; in adipose, myeloid, and hepatocyte terminal differentiation has been well established. In myeloid cells, for example, the expression of C/EBP&#x003b1; is regulated and C/EBP&#x003b1; expression leads, in turn, to expression of genes necessary for cell differentiation and to limited myeloid proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. However, all hematopoiesis is not affected similarly. While C/EBP&#x003b1; stimulates the differentiation of myeloid cells, such as granulocytes, increased expression of C/EBP&#x003b1; significantly blocks the differentiation of erythroid precursors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The regulation by C/EBP&#x003b1; in proliferation and differentiation might contribute to the development of the malignant phenotype. The aberrant expression of C/EBP&#x003b1; has been described in myeloid leukemias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In a subset of myeloid leukemias mutations of C/EBP&#x003b1; result in the synthesis of abnormal proteins that act as dominant negative proteins to block the action of C/EBP&#x003b1; with a resulting block of differentiation and loss of the limits on proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In other leukemias the fusion protein formed from the AML1-ETO translocation down-regulates transcription of the C/EBP&#x003b1; gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>However, only to varying extents has the role of C/EBP&#x003b1; in the differentiation of some of the other tissues been defined. To even a lesser extent has the presence of aberrant expression of C/EBP&#x003b1; in malignancies of these various organs been described. For example, C/EBP&#x003b1; has a gradient of expression in the small intestine of mice with the greatest expression in the most proximal portions of the intestine and without any expression detected in mouse colonic epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In the mouse intestine C/EBP&#x003b1; was found in the epithelium of the villi and not in the crypt cells suggesting that here too C/EBP&#x003b1; expression is associated with terminal differentiation. In human colon and colonic cancers, however, C/EBP&#x003b1; can be detected suggesting that there is some species specificity and a slight decrease of expression has been detected in more advanced colon cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In the rat ovary expression of C/EBP&#x003b1; increases with differentiation of the follicular cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]; to date there are no reports of altered C/EBP&#x003b1; expression in ovarian cancer. In addition to the detection of mutations in C/EBP&#x003b1; in acute myelogenous leukemia of subtype FAB classification M2, mutations have been detected in myelodysplastic disorders but only silent mutations have been detected in non-hematologic tumors including one lung cancer and one prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In the lung C/EBP&#x003b1; is expressed in the basal layer of normal lung tissue and expression of C/EBP&#x003b1; is recognized to contribute to type II cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. However the role of expression of C/EBP&#x003b1; on the differentiation of lung cells is still unknown.</p><p>The studies presented here provide additional information to the study that examined C/EBP&#x003b1; expression by gene array [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and in which expression of C/EBP&#x003b1; RNA was increased by three fold in cancerous prostate epithelium versus normal epithelium. C/EBP&#x003b1; expression at the protein level in malignant and non-malignant prostate glands has not been previously investigated. In the normal prostate, C/EBP&#x003b1; is predominately expressed in the basal layers of the epithelium with little C/EBP&#x003b1; detected by immunohistochemistry in the more differentiated secretory epithelium expressing AR and PSA. This is a distinctly different distribution than seen in other tissues where C/EBP&#x003b1; is expressed in differentiated cells. It is interesting that in our immunohistochemistry studies, p63 was found to co-localize with the expression of C/EBP&#x003b1; in normal prostate gland. p63 is a marker of the prostate gland basal layer cell and a potential marker for prostate stem cells, which are characterized by active cellular proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Further, in prostate cancer the detection of C/EBP&#x003b1; in the basal layer was lost, but C/EBP&#x003b1; staining could be detected in cancerous cells throughout pseudoglandular structures. In advanced prostate cancer with the loss of glandular like structures, C/EBP&#x003b1; was still expressed in some cancer cells with a similar intensity of staining as in the non-malignant epithelium. Interestingly, in the immunohistochemical staining of prostate tissue arrays for C/EBP&#x003b1; and AR, the ratio of C/EBP&#x003b1; to androgen receptor expression increased with increasing Gleason scores (data not shown) supporting our observation that forced overexpression of C/EBP&#x003b1; in LNCaP cells induced loss of AR expression.</p><p>To address the questions derived from our immunohistochemical staining, we first selected the PSA promoter/enhancer as a molecular marker to investigate the role of C/EBP&#x003b1; in the prostate. PSA seemed a reasonable choice: PSA is as a marker of prostate differentiation and is expressed in the terminally differentiated epithelium lining the lumen of tubules in the normal prostate gland as is AR; expression of PSA is androgen-dependent; and increased levels of PSA in the serum is an important biomarker for prostate cancer. The observation that C/EBP&#x003b1; was expressed in the basal epithelium suggested that C/EBP&#x003b1; may suppress PSA expression. In view of very low level of constitutional expression of C/EBP&#x003b1; protein in the LNCaP cells, a widely used prostate cancer cell line that expresses AR and PSA, exogenous C/EBP&#x003b1; was expressed by use of a retrovirus system and two pooled clones of LNCaP cells with stable expression of C/EBP&#x003b1; were established. Clone1 was found to express neither AR nor PSA immediately upon establishment of the clone. Clone 2 developed epigenetic loss of AR and PSA expression with serial passage. Given the rapidity in which AR expression is lost it is unlikely that the retrovirus itself caused the loss of AR expression. In addition, we have examined AR and PSA expression in LNCaP cells stably transfected with pcDNA3-C/EBP&#x003b1; and also noted decreased expression of PSA and AR (data not shown). However, the stable expression of C/EBP&#x003b1; introduced with a non-virus vector could not be maintained in LNCaP cells despite continued selection pressure with geneticin.</p><p>In the LNCaP clones with stable expression of C/EBP&#x003b1;, concomitant with the expression of C/EBP&#x003b1; we observed the loss of AR expression. Both C/EBP&#x003b1; and AR are important for the control of growth of prostate cells. The continued growth of the clones overexpressing C/EBP&#x003b1; itself was a surprise. In lung cancer cells and other cell types restoration or increased expression of C/EBP&#x003b1; caused growth arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In contrast, in the LNCaP clones expressing C/EBP&#x003b1; we did not observe any signs of growth arrest. The resistance to C/EBP&#x003b1;-induced cell growth arrest may have taken place during clonal selection. However, the establishment of stable expression of C/EBP&#x003b1; itself in several prostate cell lines meant that cells could escape from the negative regulation of cell proliferation by C/EBP&#x003b1;. This may explain the difference of cell fates between transient and stably expression of C/EBP&#x003b1;. A recent similar example has been observed in hepatocytes where the suppression of cell proliferation by C/EBP&#x003b1; is lost during oncogenesis by dephosphorylation of C/EBP&#x003b1; which leads to failure of C/EBP&#x003b1; to interact with cdk2 and E2F as well as sequestering retinoblastoma protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Similar loss of the interaction between C/EBP&#x003b1; and cell cycle related proteins was found in established prostate cell lines (date not shown). In addition, the expression of C/EBP&#x003b1; in the actively proliferating basal cell layer of the prostate suggests that C/EBP&#x003b1; does not cause growth arrest in normal prostate epithelium.</p><p>The loss AR expression occurs in several prostate cancer cell lines, such DU145, PPC1 and PC3, and occurs frequently during the clinical evolution of prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. The data from gene expression profiles shows that expression of AR RNA is absent in 30 to 40 % of prostate cancer samples (GEO accession: GSE1431) and the proportion of prostate cancers not expressing AR is increased in metastatic prostate cancer (GEO accession:GSE3325). LNCaP cell lines with loss of AR expression exhibit stronger tumorgenicity and a greater metastatic potential in xenografts than AR positive LNCaP cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. In another prostate cancer cell line that lacked AR expression restoration of that expression restored AR-dependent cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. We would predict that the loss of AR in our C/EBP&#x003b1; overexpressing LNCaP clones would cause a transformation of cells from androgen-dependent to androgen-independent growth and that the cells would exhibit more aggressive growth, invasion, and metatstatic potential. Indeed, our initial analysis of cell growth showed a more rapid growth of the C/EBP&#x003b1; expressing Clone 2 LNCaP cells compared with the control cells at passage 8 when AR was barely detectable. In addition, our immunohistochemical findings of reduced expression of AR in advanced prostate cancer specimens especially those that express C/EBP&#x003b1; is in agreement with recent demonstrations of altered AR expression especially in androgen-independent prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><p>The mechanism(s) for the loss of AR expression both in prostate cell lines and prostate cancer tissue are not completely understood and expression may vary in the same patient at different sites of recurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Methylation of the AR gene promoter has been reported in advanced hormone-independent prostate cancer tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] and the addition of 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine(5-AZA) into DU145 cells with a heavily methylated AR promoter restored AR mRNA expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. In our C/EBP&#x003b1; overexpressing LNCaP cells, treatment with 5-AZA at 10 &#x003bc;M increased expression of AR and PSA in early passages of clone 2 but not clone 1 cells (data not shown). However, increased expression of AR by 5-AZA was seen in the corresponding control cells suggesting that methylation affecting AR expression was occurring in both C/EBP&#x003b1; expressing and non-expressing cells.</p><p>The immunohistochemical result demonstrating C/EBP&#x003b1; expression in the basal layer of the prostate epithelium with no expression of PSA in these cells led us to examine the effect of C/EBP&#x003b1; on the expression of the PSA promoter/enhancer. The inhibition of expression was not cell type specific as similar studies in CV1 and COS7 cells of co-transfection of C/EBP&#x003b1; and PSA promoter reporter gene demonstrated similar results (data not shown). A recent report shows that inhibition of PSA expression in LNCaP cells was dependent on an interaction between AR and C/EBP&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] while our results indicated that the inhibition was independent of any direct interaction with AR. With transient expression of C/EBP&#x003b1; in prostate cells, ALVA 101 and the non-prostate cell line CV-1 we could not show inhibition of the MMTV promoter which contains a cryptic AR (data not shown). Nor did we observe that an increased expression of AR affected the suppression of the PSA promoter by C/EBP&#x003b1;. In addition, a standard search for transcription factor binding sites by TESS or TFSEARCHING showed that more than 10 potential C/EBP&#x003b1; binding sites in the PSA promoter. Preliminary studies with a gel shift assay indicated that C/EBP&#x003b1; could bind to at least 3 of these sites. Therefore, direct binding of C/EBP&#x003b1; to PAS promoter may explain the suppression of the PSA promoter by C/EBP&#x003b1;. We can not exclude that C/EBP&#x003b1; might also stimulate expression of coactivators. On the other hand, the results also suggest that the C-terminal leucine zipper region was more important than the transactivating domains.</p><p>We are beginning to explore, amongst the various genes whose expression in prostate cancer cells is uniformly altered by forced expression of C/EBP&#x003b1;, those genes that may contribute to the loss of AR expression and which may provide therapeutic targets for the difficult clinical problem of hormonal independence.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>C/EBP&#x003b1; was differentially displayed between normal and cancerous prostate. Long term of stably expression of C/EBP&#x003b1; in prostate cancer cells stimulates cell proliferation. Down-regualtion of PSA expression by C/EBP&#x003b1; depends on the loss of AR expression in AR posive LNCaP cells and on the universal inhibiton of PSA promoter.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interest.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>HY participated in development of concept and design, performed experiments, analyzed data, draft manuscript.
