Although TRIM5&#x003b1; is constitutively expressed, its expression has been shown to be up-regulated by type I interferon (IFN). Among primates, a particular case exists in owl monkey cells, which express a fusion protein between TRIM5 and cyclophilin A, TRIMCyp, specifically interfering with HIV-1 infection. No studies have been conducted so far concerning the possible induction of TRIMCyp by IFN. We investigated the consequences of IFN treatment on retroviral restriction in diverse primate cells and evaluated the implication of TRIM5&#x003b1; or TRIMCyp in IFN-induced anti-retroviral activities.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>First, we show that human type I IFN can enhance TRIM5&#x003b1; expression in human, African green monkey and macaque cells, as well as TRIMCyp expression in owl monkey cells. In TRIM5&#x003b1;-expressing primate cell lines, type I IFN has little or no effect on HIV-1 infection, whereas it potentates restriction activity against N-MLV in human and African green monkey cells. In contrast, type I IFN treatment of owl monkey cells induces a great enhancement of HIV-1 restriction, as well as a strain-tropism independent restriction of MLV. We were able to demonstrate that TRIM5&#x003b1; is the main mediator of the IFN-induced activity against N-MLV in human and African green monkey cells, whereas TRIMCyp mediates the IFN-induced HIV-1 restriction enhancement in owl monkey cells. In contrast, the type I IFN-induced anti-MLV restriction in owl monkey cells is independent of TRIMCyp expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Together, our observations indicate that both TRIM5&#x003b1; and TRIMCyp are implicated in IFN-induced anti-retroviral response in primate cells. Furthermore, we found that type I IFN also induces a TRIMCyp-independent restriction activity specific to MLV in owl monkey cells.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>In response to infections, eukaryotes have evolved a wide variety of defense mechanisms. In addition to classical innate and adaptive immunities, a third mode of immunity specific to retroviral infections has recently been identified and termed "intrinsic immunity" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. So far, two classes of cellular proteins that specifically interfere with retroviral infections at the cellular level have been identified. The first class of factors is constituted of cytidine deaminases such as APOBEC3G, which induce lethal hypermutation of retroviral genomes (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]). The second class of retroviral restriction factors targets capsid proteins of incoming virions and comprises the murine Fv1 and the primate TRIM5&#x003b1; proteins (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]).</p><p>TRIM5&#x003b1; is responsible for a species-specific post-entry restriction of diverse retroviruses in primate cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. TRIM5&#x003b1; is a member of the large family of tripartite motif proteins (TRIM), which is composed of proteins containing a conserved tripartite organization (known as RBCC, for RING, B-BOX, and coiled-coil domains), followed by a C-terminal portion of variable nature (for review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]). TRIM5&#x003b1; contains a B30.2/SPRY domain in its C-terminus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), which determines the virus-specific restriction activity of TRIM5&#x003b1; protein from different species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Up-regulation of TRIM5 expression in primate cells</bold>. <bold>A</bold>.

Most TRIM5&#x003b1; variants from New World monkeys restrict simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac) but not HIV-1 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], with the notable exception of owl monkey (<italic>Aotus trivigartus</italic>) cells which block HIV-1 but not SIVmac or N-MLV infections. Instead of TRIM5&#x003b1;, owl monkeys express a TRIMCyp fusion protein, generated by retrotransposition of a cyclophilin A (CypA) mRNA within the TRIM5 locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This retrotransposition event led to the expression of a chimeric protein that consists of the RBCC motif of TRIM5 fused to a carboxy-terminal CypA moiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). CypA is a ubiquitously expressed and highly conserved peptidyl prolyl isomerase that can catalyze cis/trans-isomerization of prolyl peptide bonds. This cellular protein has been shown to bind the HIV-1 capsid protein (CA) through a direct interaction between the active site of CypA and an exposed loop within the CA protein, known as the CypA binding loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Capsid proteins from other retroviruses also interact with CypA, such as feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), SIVcpz or SIVagm, whereas others such as MLV or SIVmac, do not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. CypA-CA interaction can be disrupted by cyclosporine A (CsA), an immunosuppressive drug that competitively binds to the CypA active site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In consequence, since owl monkey TRIMCyp proteins bind CA proteins of incoming retroviruses through their C-terminal CypA domain, restriction can be relieved by CsA treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Like many other members of its protein family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], TRIM5&#x003b1; expression has been recently found to be up-regulated by type I interferon (IFN) in human cells, through an IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) within its promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This finding suggested that IFN might influence the retroviral activity of TRIM5&#x003b1;. In the particular case of owl monkey cells, it is not known whether TRIMCyp expression is also enhanced by IFN. We thus tried to determine whether the retroviral restriction profile of different primate cells can be modulated by type I (&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;) and type II (&#x003b3;) IFNs, and to evaluate the role of TRIM5&#x003b1; and TRIMCyp in IFN-induced anti-retroviral responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cells and viruses</title><p>Cell lines of human (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, HeLa cells), African green monkey (<italic>Cercopithecus aethiops</italic>, Vero cells), rhesus macaque (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>, CMMT cells), and owl monkey (<italic>Aotus trivigartus</italic>, OMK cells) origin were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics.</p><p>Vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G)-pseudotyped retroviral vectors were generated by co-transfecting 10-cm plates of 293T cells with 10 &#x003bc;g of pVSV-G, 10 &#x003bc;g of Gag-Pol expression plasmid and 10 &#x003bc;g of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing retroviral vector, using the ProFection calcium phosphate kit (Promega).

For this purpose, CMMT, Vero and OMK cells were treated with 1000 U/ml of human IFN-&#x003b1;, &#x003b2; or &#x003b3; for 20 min and the activation of Stat1 was estimated by western blotting using anti-phosphorylated Stat1 antibodies.

This moderate effect of IFN at low MOI is probably due to the fact that the constitutive amount of TRIM5&#x003b1; in the cells is sufficient to restrict a small amount of virus, whereas at higher MOI, it can be predicted that an increased expression of TRIM5&#x003b1; would prevent its saturation by incoming viruses, thus enhancing restriction. Indeed, when a higher dose of virus was used (MOI of 5 on MDTF cells), we observed a much higher restriction efficiency of N-MLV in HeLa and Vero cells treated with type I IFN (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In contrast, no significant increase of HIV-1 restriction can be observed in Vero or CMMT cells.</p><p>Together, our observations confirm that type I IFN can modulate retroviral restriction in diverse primate cells. However, we did not observe a direct and systematic correlation between the levels of up-regulation of TRIM5&#x003b1; expression and the enhancement of restriction activity. Indeed, the IFN-induced reduction of infectivity of TRIM5&#x003b1;-sensitive viruses seems to be dependent of diverse parameters, such as the multiplicity of infection and the basal restriction activity of cells against a given virus.</p><p>In OMK cells, treatment with type I IFN was found to have a greater influence on retroviral permissivity compared to other primate cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). IFN-&#x003b2; treatment, in particular, induces a 3-fold decrease of HIV-1 infectivity at low multiplicity of infection (MOI of 0.5), which rises to 26-fold at high MOI (MOI of 5). More surprisingly, stimulation with type I IFN also led to a reduced susceptibility of OMK cells to NB-MLV and N-MLV infection, although TRIMCyp is known to be inefficient to restrict MLV strains, since MLV CA proteins do not interact with CypA. Indeed, we found that IFN-&#x003b2; induces a 3.9 (at high MOI) to 5.6 (at low MOI) fold increase of restriction towards N-MLV and a 5.5 (at high MOI) to 5.6 (at low MOI) fold increase of anti-NB-MLV restriction activity in OMK cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). In order to determine whether IFN initiates a wide and unspecific antiviral response in OMK cells, we tested two other viruses which are known to be insensitive to TRIMCyp-mediated restriction, B-MLV and SIVmac (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Interestingly, B-MLV permissivity is also affected by IFN treatment, whereas OMK cells remain fully permissive to SIVmac. The fact that SIVmac is unaffected by this IFN-induced block proves that the loss of infectivity we observed with MLV is not the consequence of an increased cell mortality due to IFN treatment. Since IFN-&#x003b2; gave more contrasted results than IFN-&#x003b1;, we decided to pursue our study with IFN-&#x003b2; only. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> summarizes the effect of IFN-&#x003b2; on retroviral restriction in all tested primate cell lines. Results are expressed as fold restriction, which represents the ratio of untreated to IFN-treated cells to be transduced by the GFP-encoding retroviral vectors. As shown, IFN-&#x003b2; significantly increases (fold restriction &#x0003e; 2) the restriction of N-MLV in HeLa and Vero cells, whereas it induces a wide-spectrum anti-retroviral activity in OMK cells affecting HIV-1, NB-MLV, N-MLV and B-MLV but not SIVmac.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Effect of IFN-&#x003b2; treatment on retroviral restriction.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td align="center" colspan="10"><bold>FOLD RESTRICTION</bold></td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan="10"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="center" colspan="2"><bold>HIV-1</bold></td><td align="center" colspan="2"><bold>N-MLV</bold></td><td align="center" colspan="2"><bold>NB-MLV</bold></td><td align="center" colspan="2"><bold>B-MLV</bold></td><td align="center" colspan="2"><bold>SIVmac</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="center">MOI</td><td align="center">0.5</td><td align="center">5</td><td align="center">0.5</td><td align="center">5</td><td align="center">0.5</td><td align="center">5</td><td align="center">0.5</td><td align="center">5</td><td align="center">0.5</td><td align="center">5</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><bold>MDTF</bold></td><td align="center">1.2</td><td align="center">1.0</td><td align="center">1.0</td><td align="center">1.1</td><td align="center">1.1</td><td align="center">1.0</td><td align="center">1.1</td><td align="center">1.1</td><td align="center">1.1</td><td align="center">1.0</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><bold>HeLa</bold></td><td align="center">1.5</td><td align="center">1.1</td><td align="center"><bold>3.7</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>7.6</bold></td><td align="center">1.9</td><td align="center">1.4</td><td align="center">nt</td><td align="center">nt</td><td align="center">nt</td><td align="center">nt</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><bold>CMMT</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>2.8</bold></td><td align="center">1.2</td><td align="center">1.1</td><td align="center">1.0</td><td align="center">1.1</td><td align="center">1.1</td><td align="center">nt</td><td align="center">nt</td><td align="center">nt</td><td align="center">nt</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><bold>Vero</bold></td><td align="center">1.2</td><td align="center">1.3</td><td align="center"><bold>4.4</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>8.8</bold></td><td align="center">1.5</td><td align="center">1.2</td><td align="center">nt</td><td align="center">nt</td><td align="center">nt</td><td align="center">nt</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><bold>OMK</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>2.9</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>26.1</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>5.6</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>3.9</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>5.6</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>5.5</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>2.1</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>3.9</bold></td><td align="center">1.1</td><td align="center">1.1</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>HeLa, CMMT, Vero or OMK cells were stimulated with IFN-&#x003b2; and transduced 24 h later at a MOI of 0.5 or 5 (as determined on MDTF cells) with HIV-1, N-MLV, NB-MLV, B-MLV or SIVmac, as indicated.

A previous study reported that human TRIM5&#x003b1; expression can be directly up-regulated by IFN-&#x003b2; through a putative interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) within its promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Our data are in agreement with the results published by Asaoka <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], as we observed in HeLa cells an 8- to 9-fold increase of TRIM5&#x003b1; expression with IFN-&#x003b2; and no effect with IFN-&#x003b3;. In contrast, we found that IFN-&#x003b1; was almost as efficient as IFN-&#x003b2; in stimulating human TRIM5&#x003b1; expression, in agreement with another recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. It should be noted that the TRIM5&#x003b1; expression increase in CMMT cells is not as strong as in the other primate cells, with a 3- to 3.5-fold increase following stimulation by IFN-&#x003b1; or IFN-&#x003b2;, respectively.</p><p>We found that this type I IFN enhancement of TRIM5&#x003b1; expression can influence cell permissivity towards retroviral infections in diverse primate cells. In most cases, we observed a greater effect of IFN stimulation when high concentrations of virus were used. This probably reflects the fact that the constitutive amount of TRIM5&#x003b1; is sufficient to block a small number of incoming viruses, whereas at high MOI, an enhancement of TRIM5&#x003b1; intracellular concentration following IFN treatment facilitates restriction by preventing TRIM5&#x003b1; saturation.</p><p>In human cells, IFN-&#x003b2; treatment increases TRIM5&#x003b1; expression by approximately 9-fold, and leads to a 7- to 8-fold reduction of N-MLV permissivity. In contrast, IFN treatment does not affect the permissivity of TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>hu</sub>-insensitive viruses, such as NB-MLV or HIV-1. These first observations confirm a previous report showing that IFN-&#x003b1; treatment of human cells both increases the level of TRIM5&#x003b1; mRNA and potentates N-MLV restriction by approximately 5-fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>In the case of CMMT and Vero cells, TRIM5&#x003b1; expression is also up-regulated following type I IFN treatment, but in these cases, the increase of expression does not strictly correlate with a decreased infectivity of TRIM5&#x003b1;-sensitive viruses.</p><p>In rhesus macaque cells, at low MOI, we only observed a moderate decrease of HIV-1 infectivity (2- to 3-fold reduction), in agreement with Sakuma et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In contrast, no effect on N-MLV infection can be observed. Surprisingly, when a higher MOI was used, IFN-treated CMMT cells showed no difference of susceptibility to either N-MLV or HIV-1 infection, compared to untreated cells. This relative insensitivity of CMMT to IFN treatment probably reflects the fact that these cells constitutively express high amount of TRIM5&#x003b1; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) compared to the other primate cell lines. Furthermore, this high constitutive expression is conjugated to a moderate enhancement of TRIM5&#x003b1; expression in response to IFN (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>).</p><p>In Vero cells, we detected no effect of type I or type II IFNs at low MOI, whereas at high MOI, we observed an enhancement of N-MLV restriction following induction by type I IFN only. Unlike N-MLV, HIV-1 infectivity was not found to be significantly affected by the IFN-induced up-regulation of TRIM5&#x003b1; expression. We believe that this apparent discrepancy may be explained by the basal restriction phenotype in Vero cells. Indeed, at constitutive levels of TRIM5&#x003b1; expression, Vero cells restrict N-MLV infection much more efficiently than HIV-1, suggesting that their TRIM5&#x003b1; proteins recognize N-MLV CA better than HIV-1 CA. Our observations suggest that IFN stimulation can potentate restriction towards highly sensitive viruses, but is not sufficient to enhance the restriction activity towards less sensitive ones.</p><p>Importantly, we were able to demonstrate that the IFN-induced restriction increase towards N-MLV observed in human and African green monkey cells was mainly due to the enhancement of TRIM5&#x003b1; expression, demonstrating that TRIM5&#x003b1; is the main mediator of the anti-retroviral activity of type I IFN in these cells.</p><p>Several studies have demonstrated that IFN-&#x003b1; can interfere with early and late steps of HIV-1 replication, <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Although we have only tested the effect of IFN on HeLa cells rather than primary blood cells, our results are not in favor of a direct implication of TRIM5&#x003b1; in the early anti-HIV-1 block induced by IFN in human cells. Indeed, up-regulation of TRIM5&#x003b1; expression by type I IFN was not found to correlate with a significant decrease in HIV-1 permissivity. In this context, APOBEC3G, another cellular IFN-induced anti-retroviral factor, is more likely to play a role as a mediator of the early IFN-&#x003b1;-mediated anti-HIV block in human cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], whereas the possible involvement of TRIM5&#x003b1; in the late steps remains to be addressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>The second part of our study focused on the characterization of IFN-induced modulation of retroviral infection susceptibility in owl monkey cells. Cells derived from this New World monkey species express a TRIMCyp fusion protein which allows them to specifically interfere with viruses whose capsid can bind CypA, such as HIV-1, FIV and SIVagm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In contrast, MLV and SIVmac capsid proteins do not bind CypA and these viruses are in consequence insensitive to TRIMCyp restriction.</p><p>First, we observed a 3 (at a MOI of 0.5) to 26-fold (at a MOI of 5) reduction of HIV-1 permissivity following stimulation of OMK cells with type I IFN, which can be attributed almost entirely to the IFN-induced up-regulation of TRIMCyp expression.</p><p>Surprisingly, in addition to this strong enhancement of HIV-1 restriction following type I IFN stimulation of OMK cells, we also observed a significant and reproducible restriction of MLV. This MLV block is independent of the strain tropism, since N-, B- and NB-tropic MLV strains were found to be sensitive. Many mammalian cells are able to restrict MLV, but in all cases, the block only affects N-tropic strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], with the exception of murine NIH-3T3 cells which express a B-tropic MLV-specific restriction factor, known as Fv1<sup>n </sup>(reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]). We were able to demonstrate that this IFN-induced anti-MLV activity is independent of TRIMCyp expression and occurs early during the MLV replication cycle, before or during the reverse transcription step. In contrast to MLV, we found that SIVmac was not affected by IFN-treatment in OMK cells. Even though the effect of IFN-treatment in OMK cells has never been investigated, this observation was unexpected. Indeed, in human cells, IFN-treatment was found to block an early step of SIVmac replication, between viral entry and reverse transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Furthermore, IFNs are known to activate multiple antiviral proteins which induce a wide-spectrum antiviral response.

Interestingly, in addition to these well characterized IFN-induced antiviral mediators, some other proteins belonging to the TRIM protein family have also been involved in IFN-induced antiviral defense, such as TRIM5&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], PML/TRIM19 (for review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]), TRIM22 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] or TRIM25 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].

The number of TRIM proteins up-regulated by IFN and/or implicated in antiviral resistance raises the possibility of the involvement of a TRIM protein other than TRIMCyp in the IFN-induced anti-MLV restriction we observed in OMK cells. Apart from TRIMCyp, the only TRIM protein that has been characterized so far in OMK cells is TRIM1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, since it was found to interfere specifically with N- but not B-tropic strains of MLV, this protein is unlikely to play a role in the observed phenotype. Whether it belongs to the TRIM protein family or not, the identification of the mediator(s) of the IFN-induced anti-MLV restriction in owl monkey cells will need further investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>LC carried out most of the experimental work and contributed to the analysis of data and the writing of the manuscript.
