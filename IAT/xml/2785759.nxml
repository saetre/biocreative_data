Activation of autoreactive T and B cells plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of this disease. A role of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in the pathogenesis has been suggested. Proline-rich tyrosine kinase2 (PYK2) is structurally related to FAK, however, the functional activation of PYK2 in SLE remains unclear. In the present study, we showed that PYK2 is significantly increased and activated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with SLE.

These molecules are thus targets in considering effective strategies in the treatment of SLE.

CD28-mediated costimulatory activity, following the interaction of T cells with B cells, is significantly decreased in patients with SLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].

Unlike the ubiquitous expression of prototype FAK, PYK2 is primarily expressed in populations of neuronal and hematopoetic cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].

Protein concentrations were determined with the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA). From each sample preparation, 80 ug of total proteins were mixed in Laemmli loading buffer, boiled for 4 minutes, separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to PVDF blotting membranes (Gelman, NY, USA). Membranes were blocked with the Tris buffered saline-Tween/1% bovine serum albumin/1% nonfat dry milk and incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for PYK2 (SC-9019), phospho-PYK2 (SC-11767-R) and &#x003b2;-actin (SC-1616-R) (All from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA) overnight at 4&#x000b0;C (diluted according to the manufacturer's instructions).

To understand the molecular events during lymphocyte activation and analyze the role played by PYK2, we tested the effect of PMA on phosphorylation of PYK2. PBMCs obtained from healthy donors, RA and SLE patients were treated with PMA or medium in 24-well culture dishes in 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>at 37&#x000b0;C for 24 h, and the status of PYK2 Y402 phosphorylation was analyzed by western boltting.

As expected, using PMA to stimulate PBMCs from active SLE resulted in a significant upregulation of CD40L and CTLA4, whereas this upregulation is not observed in PBMCs pretreated with chemical inhibitor of PYK2 kinase activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). In PBMCs from normal individuals and RA patients, CD40L and CTLA4 expression were also significantly upregulated by stimulation with PMA. This effect, however, cannot be suppressed by administration of TyrA9 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A, B</xref>).

We also found the activation is negatively correlated with the level of serum complement. By isolating and culturing the PBMCs, we verified p-PYK2 a mediator specific to SLE to induce costimulatory molecules CD40L and CTLA4, and to promote the cell proliferation. This study represents the first demonstration that PYK2 expression and activation appear exclusive in SLE PBMCs and crucial for the pathogenesis of SLE.</p><p>Lymphocyte activation is a fundamental component implicated in the production of autoantibodies in SLE patients. Understanding the precise molecular mechanism of SLE lymphocyte activation will be important to develop novel therapeutic strategies targeting reduction autoantibodies and to increase the sensitivity of current treatment modalities. PYK2, a nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase which plays pivotal roles in the regulation of lymphocyte activation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], has drawn our attention in considering the lymphocyte activation in SLE.</p><p>Our studies showed no detection of p-PYK2 in PBMCs of RA and healthy controls. PYK2 in SLE PBMCs is not only increased but also phosphorylated at tyrosine 402 resides. These findings suggest that upregulation and activation of PYK2 may be implicated in the pathogenesis of SLE.</p><p>PYK2 has been reported overexpressed in glomeruli but not in other tissues of human and rat crescentic glomerulonephritis, and its overexpression is closely associated with the onset of glomerulonephritis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. In our study, we showed a marked upregulation of p-PYK2 in PBMCs from SLE patients with class IV lupus nephritis, but not healthy donors or SLE patients with CNS disease or nephritis other than class IV. Further, we found clear negative correlation between the levels of p-PYK2 and serum CH50. It suggests that signaling pathway involving PYK2 are likely to play a role in the development and progression of nephritis.</p><p>FAK, the prototype of PYK2, mediates signaling in active SLE enhancing autoreactive T cell activation by proliferation and by upregulating the expression of costimulatory molecule CD40L[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. PYK2 also provides important signals to T and B lymphocyte activation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Its expression and activation, however, are not seen in PBMCs from RA patients. We explored whether the similar scenario will happen in SLE. Given that costimulatory molecules are known to be a prerequisite for lymphocyte activation, we answered this question by checking the expression of costimulatory molecules and subsequent proliferation in SLE PBMCs. In contrast to what has been observed in RA, PYK2 was shown exclusively in SLE a mediator of activation signaling of proliferation. Therefore, PYK2-mediated activation of lymphocytes is not only functionally enhanced in SLE but also a process specific to SLE. Taking into account the limitations that chemical inhibitor of Pyk2 kinase activity is almost never perfect in its specificity, in subsequent experiments, we are going to use RNA-mediated interference, Pyk2-deficient PBMCs and dominant negative Pyk2 mutants to confirm the exact function of Pyk2 in regulating SLE PBMCs proliferation.</p><p>Abnormal T and B lymphocytes activation and lymphocytes death underlie the pathology of SLE[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Potentially autoreactive T and B lymphocytes are removed by apoptosis during development and after completion of an immune response. Paradoxically, lupus T cells exhibit both enhanced spontaneous apoptosis and defective activation-induced cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Increased spontaneous apoptosis has been linked to chronic lymphopenia in patients with SLE[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. By contrast, defective activation-induced cell death (AICD) may be responsible for persistence of autoreactive T and B lymphocytes, leading to expansion of antigen-spectific T cell clones[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Indeed, in prototypical murine SLE models (i.e., lpr/lpr and gld/gld mice), the animals are defective in Fas and FasL, respectively, which are critical elements in T cell apoptosis. Our result demonstrate that in addition to increased phosphorylation of PYK2 in SLE PBMCs, phosphorylated PYK2 signaling could also enhances the autoreactive lymphocyte activation and proliferation (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). However, the mechanism that phosphorylated PYK2 induce lymphocyte proliferation is not clear. It would be interesting to investigate whether phosphorylated PYK2 could promote lymphocyte activation and proliferation via inhibition of apoptosis or via enhanced hyperreactivity of lymphocyte.</p><p>Our results, together with those of earlier studies, demonstrate that the PBMCs from SLE patients exhibit both increased activation and enhanced activity of PYK2. We strongly propose PYK2 a major contributor to the complex autoimmune pathogenesis of SLE.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the present study, We found a significant increase of both the total PYK2 protein and its activated/phosphorylated form in PBMCs from patients with SLE, particularly those with the complication of nephritis (WHO IV). There is a clear inversly correlation between the activation of PYK2 and the level of serum complements. In active SLE patients, activation of PYK2 in PBMCs is accompanying the increased cell proliferation and the induced expression of costimulatory molecules CD40L and CTLA4. These results indicate that phosphorylated PYK2 may induce the expression of CD40L and CTLA4, and subsequently the cell proliferation. PYK2 signaling enhances the autoreactive lymphocyte activation and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of SLE.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>SLE: Systemic lupus erythematosus; FAK: focal adhesion kinase; PYK2: Proline-rich tyrosine kinase2; PBMC: peripheral blood mononuclear cell; RA: rheumatoid arthritis; CPM: [<sup>3</sup>H]-thymidine incorporation; IL-2: interleukin-2; SLEDAI: SLE Disease Activity Index; WHO: World Health Organization; CNS: central nervous system; PBS: phosphate buffered saline</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Wang M and Zhang W work for Provincial Hospital affiliated to Shandong University.
