Trl1 consists of two domains&#x02014;an N-terminal ligase component and a C-terminal 5&#x02032;-kinase/2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cyclic phosphodiesterase (CPD) component&#x02014;that can function in tRNA splicing <italic>in vivo</italic> when expressed as separate polypeptides. To understand the structural requirements for the kinase-CPD domain, we performed an alanine scan of 30 amino acids that are conserved in Trl1 homologs from other fungi. We thereby identified four residues (Arg463, His515, Thr675 and Glu741) as essential for activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. Structure&#x02013;function relationships at these positions, and at four essential or conditionally essential residues defined previously (Asp425, Arg511, His673 and His777), were clarified by introducing conservative substitutions. Biochemical analysis showed that lethal mutations of Asp425, Arg463, Arg511 and His515 in the kinase module abolished polynucleotide kinase activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. We report that a recently cloned 1104 amino acid <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> RNA ligase functions in lieu of yeast Trl1 <italic>in vivo</italic> and identify essential side chains in the ligase, kinase and CPD modules of the plant enzyme. The plant ligase, like yeast Trl1 but unlike T4 RNA ligase 1, requires a 2&#x02032;-PO<sub>4</sub> end for tRNA splicing <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Yeast tRNA splicing occurs in three stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). First, a splicing endonuclease breaks the pre-tRNA at the exon&#x02013;intron boundaries to yield 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032; cyclic phosphate and 5&#x02032;-OH termini at both incision sites. Second, the ends of the broken tRNA halves are healed and then sealed by a tRNA ligase to form a 2&#x02032;-PO<sub>4</sub>, 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; phosphodiester at the splice junction. Third, the junction 2&#x02032;-PO<sub>4</sub> is transferred to NAD<sup>+</sup> to form the mature spliced tRNA, nicotinamide and ADP-ribose 1&#x02032;,2&#x02032; cyclic phosphate. The yeast tRNA ligase (Trl1) catalyzes three essential reactions during the healing/sealing stage: (i) the 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032; cyclic phosphate terminus is hydrolyzed to a 3&#x02032;-OH, 2&#x02032;-PO<sub>4</sub> terminus by a 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032; cyclic phosphodiesterase (CPD) activity; (ii) the 5&#x02032;-OH terminus is phosphorylated by a GTP-dependent polynucleotide kinase activity; and (iii) the resulting 3&#x02032;-OH, 2&#x02032;-PO<sub>4</sub> and 5&#x02032;-PO<sub>4</sub> ends are sealed by an ATP-dependent RNA ligase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>).</p><p>Trl1 consists of an N-terminal ligase module that resembles bacteriophage T4 RNA ligase 1 (Rnl1), a central polynucleotide kinase module that resembles T4 polynucleotide kinase, and a C-terminal CPD module that resembles the 2H phosphotransferase superfamily. Initial structure&#x02013;function studies showed that all three modules are essential <italic>in vivo</italic>, though they need not be linked in the same polypeptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Complementation of a lethal <italic>trl1</italic>&#x00394; mutation by the plasmid shuffle method was achieved by expressing the ligase domain Trl1-(1&#x02013;388) and the kinase-CPD domain Trl1-(389&#x02013;827) as unlinked polypeptides. Moreover, each of the three component catalytic activities is essential for cell growth, insofar as alanine mutations in the active sites of the ligase, kinase and CPD modules are lethal <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>The mechanism of the ligase component of yeast Trl1 is similar to that of T4 Rnl1, which joins broken tRNAs via three nucleotidyl transfer steps, as follows: (i) ligase reacts with ATP to form a covalent ligase-(lysyl-N)&#x02013;AMP intermediate plus pyrophosphate; (ii) AMP is transferred from ligase-adenylate to the 5&#x02032;-PO<sub>4</sub> RNA end to form an RNA-adenylate intermediate (AppRNA); and (iii) ligase catalyzes attack by an RNA 3&#x02032;-OH on the RNA-adenylate to seal the two ends via a phosphodiester bond and release AMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). An important difference is that yeast tRNA ligase apparently requires the terminal 2&#x02032;-PO<sub>4</sub> on the proximal tRNA half-molecule, whereas T4 Rnl1 does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). An extensive alanine scan of the N-terminal ligase domain of yeast Trl1 identified 28 individual amino acids essential for activity <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). Structure-activity relationships at these positions were then illuminated by conservative substitutions. The essential elements included: (i) putative equivalents of nucleotidyltransferase motifs I, Ia, III, IV and V found in DNA ligases, T4 RNA ligases 1 and 2, and mRNA capping enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>); (ii) an N-terminal segment shared with the T4 Rnl1 subfamily only; and (iii) a constellation of conserved residues specific to fungal tRNA splicing enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>).</p><p>Less is known about the mechanisms and structure-activity relationships of the kinase and CPD components. An initial alanine scan showed that mutations K404A and T405A in the P-loop (<sup>401</sup>GxGKT<sup>405</sup>) of the central kinase module had no effect on Trl1 function <italic>in vivo</italic>. The K404A and T405A mutations eliminated the ATP-dependent RNA kinase activity of Trl1 <italic>in vitro</italic>, but preserved GTP-dependent kinase activity. The double-alanine mutant K404A-T405A in the P-loop was lethal <italic>in vivo</italic> and abolished GTP-dependent kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). These results indicated that GTP is the physiological substrate and that the Trl1 kinase has a single NTP binding site of which the P-loop is a component. Two other mutations in the central domain were lethal <italic>in vivo</italic> and either abolished (D425A) or severely reduced (R511A) GTP-dependent RNA kinase activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. Mutations of the two signature histidines of the &#x02018;2H&#x02019; motifs in the CPD module were either lethal (H777A) or conferred a temperature sensitive growth phenotype (H673A). Here we conduct more extensive structure&#x02013;function analyses of the kinase-CPD domain of yeast Trl1, entailing alanine scanning and conservative substitutions at 34 positions, which reveal unique structural requirements, or lack thereof, for the Trl1 kinase-CPD activity <italic>vis a vis</italic> those of T4 polynucleotide kinase or 2H phosphoesterase family members.</p><p>The phylogenetic distribution of Trl1-like proteins is surprisingly narrow, given the wide occurrence of tRNA introns in archaea and eukarya. Trl1 homologs are found in all genera of fungi for which genome sequences are available. Putative homologs of yeast Trl1 are also found in the kinetoplastid protozoa <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> and <italic>Leishmania</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). Yet, Trl1-like proteins are absent from archaea and metazoans. A multifunctional Trl1-like enzyme has been purified to near homogeneity from wheat germ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>) and the cDNA encoding <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> RNA ligase was identified recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Although the plant RNA ligase polypeptide displays very limited global sequence similarity to yeast Trl1, it does contain counterparts of some of the signature ligase, kinase and CPD motifs found in yeast Trl1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>), and they are arranged in the same linear order as in yeast Trl1, i.e. ligase-kinase-CPD. Here we ask whether plant RNA ligase is a true ortholog of Trl1, by testing its ability to complement growth of a <italic>trl1</italic>&#x00394; yeast strain. We report that: (i) the RNA repair activity is portable from plants to fungi; (ii) plant tRNA ligase, like Trl1, is active <italic>in vivo</italic> as unlinked ligase and kinase-CPD domains; and (iii) the plant ligase, like yeast Trl1 but unlike T4 Rnl1, requires a 2&#x02032;-PO<sub>4</sub> end for tRNA splicing <italic>in vivo</italic>. Also, we map constituents of the ligase, kinase and CPD active sites of plant RNA ligase, thereby resolving ambiguities about what motifs are relevant and underscoring the similarities between the plant and fungal tRNA splicing enzymes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast vectors encoding missense mutants of Trl1-(389&#x02013;827)</title><p>Missense mutations and overlapping diagnostic restriction sites were introduced into the <italic>TRL1</italic>-(389&#x02013;827) open reading frame (ORF) via the two-stage PCR overlap extension method as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>).

Our inference is that these arginines make bidentate interactions with the kinase substrates or other functional groups on the enzyme. His515 was also strictly essential, as neither Gln nor Asn (partial isosteres that can mimic the hydrogen bonding capacity of histidine N&#x003b5; and N&#x003b4;, respectively) restored function. In contrast, glutamate was able to restore growth in lieu of Asp425, although asparagine was not (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

Whereas the C-terminal segment of plant ligase includes two HxT motifs and is therefore recognizable as homologous to the fungal CPD domain, the putative plant kinase module in the central portion of the protein is quite divergent from that of yeast Trl1, and the plant N-terminal domain is hardly recognizable as a polynucleotide ligase, except for the presence of a candidate adenylylation site (motif I; <sup>152</sup><underline>K</underline>HSG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>).</p><p>Further scrutiny of the sequence of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> polypeptide in light of the now extensive structure&#x02013;function analysis of yeast Trl1 affords some clues to the organization of the plant ligase.

The results of this analysis are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>.</p><p>The first salient finding was that the Lys152 side chain in putative nucleotidyltransferase motif I is essential for plant tRNA ligase activity, consistent with the prediction that this lysine is the nucleophile in the auto-adenylylation reaction of the RNA ligase module.

Motifs IV and V are located close together in the primary structure; they are separated by 10&#x02013;20 amino acids in DNA ligases, RNA capping enzymes and fungal tRNA ligases. Only one of the three candidates for a plant motif IV contained an essential carboxylate side chain, that being <sup>326</sup>EGLVA (shaded black in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Because the Asp529 and Asp564 side chains in the other motif IV candidates (<sup>529</sup><underline>D</underline>GLAD, and <sup>564</sup><underline>D</underline>GAAA) were nonessential, we judged these motifs to be impostors (shaded gray in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These results were puzzling, insofar as the real motif IV has no candidate motif V located at the expected distance downstream, whereas both of the &#x02018;false&#x02019; motifs IV actually do have a KxK sequence situated immediately downstream (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Mutating the alternating lysines in the motif V candidates highlighted <sup>539</sup>MIKMK as the real motif V, containing essential Lys541 and Lys543 constituents, and relegated the two other peptides (<sup>434</sup>LMKEK and <sup>584</sup>DGKQK) to impostor status.

It is now clear that the glutamate is the defining component of motif III; the glutamate contacts the ribose sugar of the NTP substrate and is essential for enzyme activity.

These experiments showed that: (i) the plant ligase domain was functional <italic>in vivo</italic> when paired with the yeast kinase-CPD domain and (ii) the plant kinase-CPD domain was active when paired with the yeast ligase domain. Given that there is scant primary structure similarity between the plant and yeast proteins, the findings that the plant and yeast domains are functionally interchangeable as separate polypeptides suggests that a hypothetical physical interaction between the plant ligase and plant kinase-CPD domains is not essential for tRNA splicing activity <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Previous studies showed that the yeast tRNA splicing system can be replaced <italic>in vivo</italic> by coexpression of bacteriophage T4 Rnl1 and Pnkp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). However, whereas the yeast ligase domain and T4 Rnl1 are functionally interchangeable as isolated sealing modules, the respective end-healing enzymes are not. T4 Pnkp could substitute for the yeast kinase and CPD modules in tandem with T4 Rnl1, but was inactive when paired with the yeast ligase module. Here we find that the plant ligase module is also unable to function in tRNA splicing when paired with T4 Pnkp as the source of the end-healing activities. Because the kinase modules of the phage Pnkp and plant kinase-CPD enzymes generate identical products (a 5&#x02032;-PO<sub>4</sub> RNA end), we ascribe the fact that the plant ligase functions only in tandem with plant or fungal kinase-CPD to the distinctive 3&#x02032;-OH, 2&#x02032;-PO<sub>4</sub> end configuration generated by yeast CPD versus the 3&#x02032;-OH, 2&#x02032;-OH end produced by Pnkp.

Below we discuss and interpret the functional data, drawing on the atomic structures of enzymes with biochemical activities similar to those of the tRNA ligase domains.</p><sec><title>The kinase domain</title><p>The key landmarks of the fungal kinase domain are the <sup>404</sup>Lys-Thr<sup>405</sup> dipeptide of the P-loop, plus Asp425, Arg463, Arg511 and His515. These essential residues are strictly conserved among fungal tRNA ligases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Yet conservation <italic>per se</italic> is clearly not predictive of essentiality, insofar as nineteen other conserved residues subjected to alanine scanning were found to be nonessential for Trl1 activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. We can speculate about the roles of some of the essential components of the fungal kinase by reference to the crystal structures and extensive mutational analyses of the kinase domain of T4 Pnkp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). The GSGKS<sup>16</sup> P-loop element of T4 Pnkp connects a beta strand to an alpha helix and forms and &#x02018;oxyanion hole&#x02019; for binding of the beta phosphate of the NTP substrate. The binding occurs via multiple contacts of the phosphate oxygens to the backbone amides of the loop, plus contacts to the lysine and serine side chains. It is reasonable to think that the same NTP contacts are made by the P-loops of the yeast and plant kinases. Yet, structure-activity relations differ for the T4, yeast and plant P-loops. For example, T4 kinase activity is ablated by single alanine mutations at Lys15 or Ser16 of the P-loop, whereas the equivalent Lys404 and Thr405 side chains appear to be functionally redundant in yeast Trl1, requiring a double K404A-T405 mutation to abolish activity <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). However, in the plant enzyme, where the P-loop sequence GxxGSAKS deviates from the consensus, the P-loop lysine is dispensable, but the serine is essential for activity <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>The RxxxR motif located &#x0223c;100 amino acids downstream of the P-loop is located within an alpha helix and loop that form a &#x02018;lid&#x02019; over the NTP binding pocket. The distal arginine of this motif (Arg126 in T4 Pnkp) contacts the alpha and beta phosphates of the nucleotide substrate. Mutation of this arginine side chain ablates the kinase activity of T4 Pnkp, as do mutations of the equivalent Arg511 residue in yeast Trl1. An alanine mutation of the likely equivalent of the plant enzyme, Arg804, results in a severe growth defect. Thus, we speculate that the fungal and plant kinases probably have a lid structure similar to that of T4 kinase. The proximal arginine side chain of the RxxxR motif of T4 Pnkp (Arg122) forms a &#x003c0;-cation stack on the purine base of the NTP substrate. Replacing Arg122 with alanine had no effect on T4 kinase activity; nor did the equivalent mutation of Arg507 in yeast Trl1 affect its activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. A noteworthy finding here is that the essential His515 residue of yeast Trl1 is located just downstream of the RxxxR motif, in what would be the loop component of the lid of T4 Pnkp. The putative loop sequence immediately following the RxxxR motif in yeast Trl1 (GNNHQSIK) is conserved among fungal tRNA ligases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The equivalent segment of T4 Pnkp (GTKAVPID) has little similarity to that of the fungal proteins. It is conceivable that this motif, which includes an essential histidine, is a determinant of the specificity of the yeast polynucleotide kinase for GTP as the phosphate donor. The corresponding sequence of the plant kinase (VNHPGKLD) includes an Asn-His dipeptide that could be related to the yeast element. At present, the NTP donor specificity of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> kinase remains uncharted.</p></sec><sec><title>The CPD domain</title><p>Atomic structures are available for several members of the 2H phosphotransferase family, including human and rat brain 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032; cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>), archaeal 2&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; RNA ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>) and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ADP-ribose 1&#x02032;,2&#x02032; CPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). These structures, and especially the structures of the plant CPD with sulfate or cyclic vanadate inhibitor bound and human CPD with phosphate bound, illuminated the likely catalytic roles of the HxT motifs and other functional groups in the active site. The 2H enzymes share a symmetrical bilobed tertiary structure with each lobe consisting of a three- or four-stranded beta sheet at the lobar interface and alpha helices on the periphery. The HxT motifs reside within beta strands lining the active site. Both histidines and both threonines make contacts to the phosphate oxygens in the ligand complexes. The proposed mechanism of the 2H enzymes invokes acid-base catalysis by the histidines of the HxT motifs. The histidine of the distal HxT motif is posited to act as a general base to activate a water for attack on the phosphorus center. The histidine of the proximal HxT motif is proposed to act as a general acid to donate a proton to the ribose O leaving group. The two threonines are supposed to stabilize the transition state via hydrogen bond donation to the phosphate oxygens.</p><p>Mutational analyses of rat brain, zebrafish and yeast 2H family enzymes underscore that both histidines are essential for catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). Yet, we find that only the distal histidine is strictly essential for the <italic>in vivo</italic> CPD function of both the yeast and plant tRNA ligases. Mutation of the proximal histidine of the yeast and plant proteins results in a conditional growth defect. Mutational analysis of brain CPD showed that both threonines are essential for catalysis of the 2&#x02032;3&#x02032; CPD reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). The threonine of the distal HxT motif was also shown to be essential for the zebrafish 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-CPD activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). In contrast, we find that only the proximal theonine is essential for tRNA splicing and mutation of the distal threonine had no apparent effect on the <italic>in vivo</italic> CPD activity of either the yeast or plant tRNA ligase. Thus, the contributions of the individual amino acids at the CPD active site are significantly different in the tRNA ligases <italic>vis a vis</italic> other 2H family members.</p><p>We speculate that the relaxed requirement for the proximal histidine in tRNA ligases might reflect the capacity to switch from a general acid mechanism, where the histidine donates a proton to the leaving O3&#x02032; ribose atom, to one of specific acid catalysis in which a water can occupy the active site and act as a proton donor. Alternatively, another functional group on the enzyme or the tRNA could assist in leaving group expulsion when the histidine is missing. Whatever the mechanism, the proximal histidine-less ligases can apparently sustain a threshold level of CPD activity at lower growth temperatures, but not at 37&#x000b0;C.</p><p>The benign effect of the distal threonine mutations in the yeast and plant tRNA ligases signifies either that: (i) the proximal threonine suffices for binding the tRNA 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032; cyclic phosphate and stabilizing the transition state or (ii) there are additional constituents of the enzyme that serve this role to the extent that the distal threonine is redundant. In the same vein, Nasr and Filipowicz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>) reported that neither of the hydroxyamino acids of the Hx(S/T) motifs of yeast ADP-ribose 1&#x02032;,2&#x02032; CPD was required for activity with the physiological substrate Appr&#x0003e;p. However, when the yeast ADP-ribose 1&#x02032;,2&#x02032; CPD was assayed with 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032; cyclic AMP, the proximal threonine was essential, a situation that echoes our findings for the 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032; CPD activity of tRNA ligases.</p></sec><sec><title>The plant ligase domain</title><p>We discussed previously the structure-activity relationships at the numerous essential residues within the ligase domain of yeast Trl1 and their interpretation in light of known ligase structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). The remarkable aspect of the plant RNA ligase domain is how little it resembles the fungal tRNA ligase or any other RNA ligase. By sorting out the functionally relevant putative equivalents of the classical covalent nucleotidyltransferase motifs from other irrelevant impostors, we have placed the plant ligase firmly within the covalent nucleotidyltransferase superfamily, while highlighting the divergence in motif sequence and spacing in the plant protein versus other superfamily members. In particular, the large interval between motifs IV and V is unique to the plant ligase and accounts, in good part, for the much larger size of the autonomous ligase domain of AtRNL (675 amino acids) compared to that of yeast Trl1 (388 amino acids). A search of the nonredundant GenBank database with the 208 amino acid polypeptide sequence separating motifs IV and V uncovered no similar polypeptide from a non-plant source. It is conceivable that this large insert plays a plant-specific role in tRNA splicing (or some other RNA repair process).</p><p>The recently reported crystal structure of bacteriophage T4 Rnl1 bound to the nonreactive substrate mimetic AMPCPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>) provides the closest structurally defined homolog of the fungal tRNA ligase domain, which belongs to an Rnl1-like subfamily of viral and cellular RNA sealing enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). The residues defined herein as essential in the plant tRNA ligase domain&#x02014;Lys152, Glu218, Glu326, Lys541 and Lys543&#x02014;are the putative equivalents of residues Lys99, Glu159, Glu227, Lys240 and Lys242 that comprise the active site of T4 Rnl1. T4 Rnl1 can execute the sealing steps of tRNA splicing in yeast when it is provided with either a 2&#x02032;-OH, 3&#x02032;-OH or a 2&#x02032;-PO<sub>4</sub>, 3&#x02032;-OH terminus on the proximal tRNA half. In contrast, the plant and yeast ligases can only seal the 2&#x02032;-PO<sub>4</sub>, 3&#x02032;-OH ends generated by the CPD component of tRNA ligase. Accounting for the unique requirement of yeast and plant ligases for a 2&#x02032;-PO<sub>4</sub> and divining the contributions of the plant-specific and yeast-specific primary structure elements will depend on success in obtaining atomic structures of the yeast and plant ligase domains. The delineation of an autonomous plant ligase domain using yeast as a surrogate genetic system is an initial step toward this goal.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by NIH grant GM42498.
