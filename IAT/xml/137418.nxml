The response of eukaryotic cells to the formation of a DSB is highly conserved and involves both checkpoint functions that arrest the cell cycle, allowing time for repair to occur, and repair functions that directly fix the break (for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c1">1</xref>). DSBs can be repaired by homologous recombination (HR) or non- homologous end joining (NHEJ). Both mechanisms are used in higher eukaryotes, with NHEJ being used predominantly in G<sub>1</sub> and HR in G<sub>2</sub> of the cell cycle (for an example see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c2">2</xref>; for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c3">3</xref>). HR is the predominant mechanism of repair used by yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c3">3</xref> and references therein).</p><p>One of the earliest known responses to DSB formation is phosphorylation of the C-terminal tails of H2A histones in nucleosomes located in the vicinity of the break (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c5">5</xref>). Histone variant H2AX is the H2A histone that is phosphorylated in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c6">6</xref>). The amino acid sequence of H2AX is nearly identical to that of H2A except for its C-terminal tail, which has a divergent sequence and 13 additional amino acids (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf496f1">1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c7">7</xref>). H2AX is phosphorylated on Ser139 in an SQ motif located near the C-terminus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf496f1">1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c6">6</xref>). The phosphorylated form of H2AX is referred to as &#x003b3;-H2AX. H2AX is phosphorylated by the PIK-related protein kinase ATM or ATR, depending on whether the break is introduced by radiolytic damage or replicative stress, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c9">9</xref>). Phosphory lation occurs within 20 s of radiation-induced break formation, making it the earliest event known to occur after DNA breakage and kinase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c6">6</xref>). While H2AX is uniformly distributed in chromatin, only H2AX located in the vicinity of a DSB becomes phosphorylated, and a single domain of phosphorylation might encompass megabases of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c10">10</xref>). DSBs also induce phosphorylation in budding yeast, but in yeast it is the core histone H2A that is phosphorylated rather than a histone variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c11">11</xref>). Yeast H2A is phosphorylated within an SQ motif located in its C-terminal tail, analogous to mammalian H2AX (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf496f1">1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c11">11</xref>). This evolutionary conservation suggests that H2A phosphorylation is a conserved response of eukaryotic cells to DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c5">5</xref>).</p><p>DSB-induced phosphorylation of H2A histones is important for some mechanisms by which the DSB is repaired. In budding yeast that lack H2A phosphorylation, for example, repair by NHEJ is reduced 2-fold, and knockout mice that lack H2AX have a pleiotropic phenotype that includes increased genomic instability, increased radiation sensitivity, reduced immunoglobulin class switching, and male sterility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c12">12</xref>). For some mechanisms of repair, phosphorylation of H2A histones appears to be less important, such as for homology-dependent repair in yeast and V(D)J recombination in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c12">12</xref>). So, even though localized phosphorylation of H2A histones has been found at all DSBs thus far studied, irrespective of how the break is formed or the pathway by which it is eventually repaired, H2A phosphorylation may be functionally important for only a subset of repair processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c17">17</xref>).</p><p>Antibodies that specifically bind phosphorylated H2AX in mammals also recognize radiation-induced proteins in <italic>Muntiacus muntjac</italic>, <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c10">10</xref>). The fruitfly, <italic>D.melanogaster</italic>, has a single H2A variant, H2Av, in addition to core histone H2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c18">18</xref>). H2Av is an essential gene and is homologous to the H2AZ family of histone variants, which function in the chromatin-mediated regulation of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c22">22</xref>). In addition to H2Av being the H2AZ ortholog of flies, the C-terminal tail of H2Av also contains an SQ motif similar to that in mammalian H2AX and yeast H2A (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf496f1">1</xref>; for a broader phylogenetic comparison see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c5">5</xref>). The presence of the SQ motif prompted previous investigators to predict that H2Av would be the protein in <italic>Drosophila</italic> recognized by &#x003b3;-H2AX-specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c10">10</xref>). We tested this prediction and, in this report, we demonstrate that the C-terminal tail of <italic>Drosophila</italic> H2Av is phosphorylated in response to radiation-induced DSBs, specifically at Ser137 within the SQ motif. Furthermore, mutant animals that lack H2Av phosphorylation have increased levels of radiation-induced apoptosis of imaginal disc cells, although the increase in apoptosis caused little or no larval lethality. These results suggest a function for H2Av phosphorylation in repair of radiation-induced DSBs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Antibody synthesis and affinity purification</title><p>A polyclonal antiserum that recognizes both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated H2Av was generated by injecting rabbits with a synthetic peptide homologous to the C-terminal 15 amino acids of H2Av in which Ser137 was phosphorylated.

Briefly, S2 cells were grown in the presence of 25 &#x000b5;M bromodeoxyuridine for 4 days.

The antiserum recognized a 14.6 kDa nuclear protein in S2 cells, consistent with earlier studies of H2Av (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf496f1">1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c26">26</xref>). A slower migrating protein was also detected when the S2 cells were exposed to &#x003b3;-radiation prior to protein isolation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf496f2">2</xref>A). The radiation-induced protein was absent in samples treated with alkaline phosphatase, demonstrating that the protein is generated by radiation-induced phosphorylation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf496f2">2</xref>A). Because the H2Av peptide used to generate the antiserum was phosphorylated on what would be Ser137 of H2Av (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf496f1">1</xref>), phosphorylation-specific antibodies could be isolated using an affinity column containing non- phosphorylated peptide (see Materials and Methods). When such phosphorylation-specific antibodies were used to probe western blots of proteins from control and &#x003b3;-irradiated S2 cells, only the radiation-induced phosphorylated protein was bound (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf496f2">2</xref>B). This result is consistent with radiation causing the phosphorylation of H2Av on Ser137.</p><p>The possibility that the radiation-induced protein was not phosphorylated H2Av was considered. Radiation could have induced the phosphorylation of an SQ motif in another protein that is fortuitously recognized by antibodies in the H2Av antiserum.

A fly strain was obtained that expresses <italic>His2Av</italic><sup>&#x00394;CT</sup>, a <italic>His2Av</italic> gene containing a deletion that removes the C-terminal 15 amino acids of H2Av, including Ser137 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf496f1">1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c23">23</xref>).

Phosphorylation of H2Av occurred rapidly after DNA breakage. When S2 cells were exposed on ice to 50 Gy and then transferred to medium at 23&#x000b0;C, H2Av phosphorylation was detected within 1 min and was maximal after 5 min. The percentage of phosphorylated H2Av remained maximal for at least 5 min and then declined gradually over several hours (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf496f3">3</xref>B). The gradual loss of phosphorylated H2Av is likely to be caused by the active dephosphorylation or turnover of H2Av rather than loss of cells due to radiation-induced apoptosis, since apoptotic cell death takes &#x0003e;3 h to occur (see Materials and Methods). Both the dose-response relationship and kinetics of H2Av phosphorylation are very similar to what has been reported for the radiation-induced phosphorylation of H2AX in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c6">6</xref>).</p><p>Ionizing radiation creates a variety of cellular damage in addition to DNA DSBs, primarily through the generation of reactive oxygen species. It was important, therefore, to establish that H2Av phosphorylation is induced specifically by DSBs and not by other types of damage to DNA or other macromolecules. DSBs were induced photochemically, without the collateral damage caused by ionizing radiation, by incorporating BrdU into the DNA and then exposing the cells to long wavelength UV-A light in the presence of Hoechst dye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c25">25</xref>). Such photochemically created DSBs induced H2Av phosphorylation as efficiently as did &#x003b3;-irradiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf496f4">4</xref>A). In addition, neither general oxidative damage due to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> exposure nor single-strand breaks induced by short wavelength UV-C light caused H2Av phosphorylation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf496f4">4</xref>B and C). These results, in conjunction with those discussed above, establish that H2Av is rapidly phosphorylated on Ser137 in response to DSBs (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf496f2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf496f4">4</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>H2Av phosphorylation helps prevent radiation-induced apoptosis</title><p>If H2Av phosphorylation has a function in DSB repair, we would predict that a cell lacking H2Av phosphorylation would be more sensitive to radiation and would be more prone to die of radiation-induced apoptosis as a consequence of its reduced ability to repair broken DNA.

The number of apoptotic cells in each disc was measured by manually counting the number of fluorescing nuclei.</p><p>Imaginal discs from larvae lacking H2Av phosphorylation had significantly more radiation-induced apoptotic cells than did discs from wildtype larvae (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf496f5">5</xref>).

Finally, similar increases in radiation-induced apoptosis were also observed in eye&#x0002f;antennal and leg discs (data not shown).</p><p>The radiation-sensitive phenotype is likely to be caused solely and specifically by the lack of H2Av phosphorylation at Ser137 and not by any other unanticipated consequence of the deletion of 15 amino acids of the H2Av C-terminus. The C-terminal 15 amino acids of H2Av are not known to encode any functions other than DSB-induced phosphorylation. The amino acids are not required for the essential functions of H2Av (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c23">23</xref>); the C-terminal tail has no homology outside the SQ motif involved in phosphorylation to the C-terminal tails of H2AZ or H2AX histones in other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c5">5</xref>); and the &#x00394;CT mutation leaves a C-terminal tail of six amino acids and is therefore unlikely to have a detrimental impact on the structure or function of the globular domain of H2Av, given that the normal C-terminal tail of H2A is only seven amino acids long (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf496f1">1</xref>).</p><p>Finally, the 2-fold increase in radiation-induced apoptosis of imaginal disc cells did not cause a concomitant increase in lethality. Specifically, the percentage of irradiated roaming stage third-instar larvae to complete metamorphosis and emerge as pharate adults did not differ between larvae that could or could not phosphorylate H2Av, irrespective of radiation dose (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf496f6">6</xref>). This was also true of early third-instar larvae as well as 24 h pupae (data not shown). The 2-fold increase in imaginal-cell apoptosis might have only negligible effects on overall disc development and morphogenesis, or perhaps is a level of cell loss for which the imaginal disc is able to compensate by increased proliferation of viable cells. We also measured the radiation sensitivity of embryos and adults, and again found no difference between animals that could and could not phosphorylate H2Av (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> H2Av is unique among histone variants, providing in a single histone both the transcription function of H2AZ variants and the DNA repair function of H2AX variants. Ser137 in the C-terminus of H2Av is phosphorylated in response to DSBs and preventing this phosphorylation causes imaginal disc cells to become radiation sensitive (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf496f2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf496f5">5</xref>). These observations support the conclusion that H2Av phosphorylation contributes to repair of DSBs and that H2Av is the functional homolog in flies of mammalian H2AX. The amino acid sequence of H2Av outside its C-terminal tail clearly identifies H2Av as the H2AZ ortholog in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The H2AZ function provided by H2Av is essential for normal fly development and is likely involved in chromatin-mediated regulation of transcription, although a function in transcription has yet to be directly demonstrated in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c22">22</xref>). The juxtaposition of both DNA repair and transcription functions in a single variant histone distinguishes H2Av in <italic>Drosophila</italic> from the situation in both yeast and mammals, in which these functions are provided by separate H2AX and H2AZ histones.</p><p>The phosphorylation of H2Av in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is also distinct from DSB-induced phosphorylation in yeast and mammals in that the histone phosphorylated is specifically an H2AZ variant. Mammalian H2AX outside its C-terminal tail is almost identical to H2A, differing at only three of 120 residues, and H2A is the histone phosphorylated in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c11">11</xref>). The phosphorylation of H2Av in <italic>Drosophila</italic> suggests that an H2AZ variant can make the same contribution to DNA repair as does H2A, assuming that DSB-induced phosphorylation in mammals, flies and yeast facilitates repair by a single mechanism. The equivalence of H2AZ and H2A histones with respect to DNA repair was not necessarily expected, given that H2AZ and H2A are not equivalent with respect to their functions in transcription. H2A cannot functionally replace H2AZ in flies or yeast and H2AZ cannot functionally replace H2A, at least in yeast, in which such an experiment can be done (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c28">28</xref>). Perhaps H2Av in flies, H2AX in mammals and H2A in yeast function equivalently with respect to DNA repair because their C-terminal tails, the substrates for DSB-induced phosphorylation, are located in the same position along the chromatin fiber. The C-terminal tail of all H2A histones extends from the nucleosome near the position where linker DNA enters and exits, and H2A C-termini can directly interact with linker DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c30">30</xref>). Since the tails are in the same location, it is reasonable to assume that phosphorylation of those tails would have comparable effects. If the location of the C-terminal tail is, in fact, all that matters for DNA repair, this would also imply that any unique functions provided by the globular domains of H2AZ or H2A are unrelated to, and likely unaffected by, the mechanism by which phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail facilitates repair. This is a particularly interesting issue with respect to H2AZ variants, because they may be involved in regulating the equilibrium among differing states of chromatin compaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c31">31</xref>).</p><p>Identification of a function for H2Av in DNA repair also provided an explanation for a puzzling aspect of the pattern of localization of H2Av in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome, which was characterized previously. H2Av-containing nucleosomes are found associated with DNA sequences located through the genome, including non-coding satellite sequences within heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c26">26</xref>). The association of H2Av with non-coding satellite sequences would be difficult to understand if the only function of H2Av was in transcriptional regulation. Identification of a function for H2Av in DNA repair provides a plausible explanation for why H2Av would be associated with non-coding sequences. A DSB located anywhere in the genome is a potentially lethal lesion, so some amount of H2Av-containing nucleosomes might need to be associated with all sequences of the genome to ensure that repair can be facilitated wherever a DSB might occur.</p><p>In addition to the localization of H2Av to all regions of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome, the density of H2Av-containing nucleosomes also varies significantly and frequently along the length of each chromosome arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c26">26</xref>). While variations in density are likely to be a general characteristic of H2AZ variants, this pattern is quite different from the uniform distribution observed for mammalian H2AX and yeast H2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c20">20</xref>). The fact that H2Av functions in both transcription and repair demonstrates that both functions can be compatible with the localization pattern of a single histone; it suggests, more generally, that H2AZ and H2AX variants do not require mutually exclusive locations in the genome to provide their respective functions. The variation in H2Av density also raises the possibility that the efficiency of DSB repair could vary among different regions in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome, if it were the case that the density of H2Av in any given region of chromatin influenced the extent to which DSB-induced phosphorylation facilitated repair. Alternatively, a minimum density of H2Av-containing nucleosomes might be sufficient to provide the function of H2Av in repair and increases in density above that minimum might be necessary for the essential function of H2Av in transcription, but would not influence repair.</p><p>Overall, the phenotype of <italic>Drosophila</italic> lacking H2Av phosphorylation is quite modest. Radiation sensitivity in larvae unable to phosphorylate H2Av increased 2-fold when assayed at the level of imaginal cell apoptosis and no increase in sensitivity was observed at the level of larval lethality (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf496f5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf496f6">6</xref>). If H2Av phosphorylation were an essential step in the DSB repair pathway, radiation-induced larval lethality would be expected to increase substantially. For example, mutation of specific repair proteins, such as DmRAD54, can increase radiation-induced lethality 7-fold, and if a second repair gene is mutated simultaneously the increase in radiation-induced lethality can reach nearly 40-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c32">32</xref>). In the light of these observations, the modest phenotype described in this report suggests that H2Av phosphorylation promotes repair efficiency rather than being an essential step in the repair process itself. A similar conclusion is suggested by genetic analyses of DSB-induced phosphorylation of H2A in budding yeast. Prevention of H2A phosphorylation increased the sensitivity of yeast to radiomimetic drugs, but it only reduced NHEJ repair about 2-fold and appeared to have little or no effect on HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c11">11</xref>). The phenotype of H2AX knockout mice also suggests that H2AX phosphorylation in mammals is probably not essential for most mechanisms of DSB repair, although H2AX phosphorylation in mice does appear to be more important for some types of repair than is DSB-induced phosphorylation for repair in either yeast or flies. Mice lacking H2AX are growth retarded, radiation sensitive and male sterile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf496c12">12</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Drosophila</italic> lacking H2Av phosphorylation grow at normal rates, larvae are no more radiation sensitive than the wildtype and both sexes are fertile (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf496f6">6</xref>; R.L.Glaser, unpublished observations). So, genetic analyses of DSB-induced phosphorylation of H2A histones in yeast, flies and mice are consistent with the general conclusion that the function of phosphorylation is to facilitate repair efficiency. The phenotype of H2AX knockout mice further suggests that during evolution phosphorylation of H2AX in mammals acquired greater importance for particular DSB repair processes.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf496f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> C-terminal amino acid sequence of H2A histones.
