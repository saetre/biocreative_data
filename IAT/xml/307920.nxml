This activity is shown here to be a function of the E. coli RecJ protein, previously described as a 5'--&#x0003e;3' single-strand specific DNA exonuclease involved in a recombination pathway and in mismatch repair. Highly purified preparations of dRpase contained 5'--&#x0003e;3' exonuclease activity for single-stranded DNA, and homogeneous RecJ protein purified from an overproducer strain had both 5'--&#x0003e;3' exonuclease and dRpase activity. Moreover, E. coli recJ strains were deficient in dRpase activity. The hydrolytic dRpase function of the RecJ protein requires Mg2+; in contrast, the activity of E. coli Fpg protein, that promotes the liberation of 5'--&#x0003e;3'Rp residues from DNA by beta-elimination, is suppressed by Mg2+. Several other E. coli nucleases, including exonucleases I, III, V, and VII, endonucleases I, III and IV and the 5'--&#x0003e;3' exonuclease function of DNA polymerase I, are unable to act as a dRpase. Nevertheless, E. coli fpg recJ double mutants retain capacity to repair abasic sites in DNA, indicating the presence of a back-up excision function.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00030-0111.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="993"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00030-0112.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="994"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00030-0113.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="995"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00030-0114.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="996"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00030-0115.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="997"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00030-0116.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="998"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
