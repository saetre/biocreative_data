Based on our data and that from another group, the minimal region of allele loss was between <italic>D6S264</italic> and <italic>D6S149</italic> (7.4 cM). To identify the putative tumour suppressor gene, we established a physical map initially with YACs and subsequently with PACs/BACs from <italic>D6S264</italic> to <italic>D6S149</italic>. To accelerate the identification of genes, we sequenced the entire contig of approximately 1.1 Mb.

This gene is 24.5 kb and comprises of 8 exons. There are two transcripts with the shorter one due to splicing out of exon 4. It is expressed in testis, small intestine, spleen, prostate, and ovary. In a panel of 8 ovarian cancer cell lines, UNC93A expression was detected by RT-PCR which identified the two transcripts in 2/8 cell lines. The entire coding sequence was examined for mutations in a panel of ovarian tumours and ovarian cancer cell lines. Mutations were identified in exons 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8. Only 3 mutations were identified specifically in the tumour. These included a c.452G&#x0003e;A (W151X) mutation in exon 3, c.676C&#x0003e;T (R226X) in exon 5 and c.1225G&#x0003e;A(V409I) mutation in exon 8. However, the mutations in exon 3 and 5 were also present in 6% and 2% of the normal population respectively. The UNC93A cDNA was shown to express at the cell membrane and encodes for a protein of 60 kDa.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These results suggest that no evidence for UNC93A as a tumour suppressor gene in sporadic ovarian cancer has been identified and further research is required to evaluate its normal function and role in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Unc-93</italic></kwd><kwd>ovarian cancer</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Ovarian cancer is the most frequent cause of death from gynaecological malignancies in the Western World [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Epithelial ovarian cancer constitutes 70&#x02013;80% of ovarian cancer and encompasses a broad spectrum of lesions, ranging from localised benign tumours and neoplasms of borderline malignant potential to invasive adenocarcinomas. The p53 gene has been found to be frequently mutated (50%) in sporadic malignant ovarian tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are mutated in a proportion of patients with familial breast/ovarian cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. However, familial ovarian cancer accounts only for 5&#x02013;10% of all ovarian tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In tumours from patients with sporadic ovarian cancer, only five mutations in the BRCA1 gene and four in the BRCA2 gene have been reported suggesting that they are rare in sporadic ovarian cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, epigenetic inactivation due to methylation has been reported for BRCA1 and 2 in a proportion of sporadic tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Mutations in the mismatch repair genes have been reported at a frequency of 10% in sporadic ovarian cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. More recently, the PTEN gene has been reported to be mutated in 20% of endometrioid subtype of sporadic ovarian tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, detailed evaluation by mutation analysis and immunohistochemistry has shown inactivation of PTEN in other subtypes of ovarian cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Thus tumour suppressor genes that may be more critical in tumour progression in sporadic ovarian cancer have not yet been fully characterised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Chromosome 6 has been implicated to contain a putative tumour suppressor gene important in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer, both by karyotypic analysis and allele loss studies. The analysis of 70 malignant ovarian tumours using cosmids mapping to chromosomal arm 6q initially defined the minimal region of allele loss between <italic>D6S149</italic> and <italic>D6S193</italic> (1.9 cM) in one tumour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Subsequent studies have shown increased frequency of allele loss on 6q around the same region, although a minimal region was not defined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Based on the analysis of 56 malignant ovarian tumours we showed previously that the minimal region of allele loss on 6q27 is between <italic>D6S297</italic> and <italic>D6S264</italic> (3 cM) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The maximal frequency of allele loss occurred at <italic>D6S193</italic> (62%) and <italic>D6S297</italic> (52%) which are approximately 55 Kb apart. Three tumours showed loss of <italic>D6S193</italic> only, while retaining flanking markers thus suggesting that the putative tumour suppressor gene was close to <italic>D6S193</italic>. The allele loss was observed in all types of epithelial ovarian cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Further evidence that there might be a putative tumour suppressor gene around <italic>D6S193</italic> is provided by FISH studies using YACs on direct metaphase spreads from fresh ovarian tumours which suggested that this change might be important even in early ovarian tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. More recently, a homozygous deletion has been mapped centromeric to <italic>D6S193</italic> in one ovarian cancer cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Further, it is possible that the same region is implicated in a subset of lymphomas and breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Genomic structure and ESTs corresponding to UNC93A.</bold> PAC 366N23 contains the entire gene for UNC93A and exons 8 and 9 of TCP10.

UNC93A and the last two exons of TCP10 were identified by analysis of the sequence from RP3-366N23 with a suite of exon prediction programmes. Several ESTs were also mapped to the same genomic region (RP3-366N23) that was identified to contain the predicted gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.)

The putative initiation methionine was preceded by an inframe stop codon and had the best Kozak's consensus sequence.

To isolate full length cDNA clones and also to confirm the sequence of the predicted cDNA, primers were designed to amplify the coding sequences of UNC93A. RT-PCR was performed using total RNAs from normal ovary (epithelial cells) and the panel of 8 ovarian cancer cell lines as templates. Two products of 1.4 and 1.3 kb were observed in cell lines 41M and OAW28 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Direct sequencing of these two products have shown that the 1.4 kb amplicon represented the entire coding sequence of UNC93A and the 1.3 kb amplicon did not have exon 4. Another set of RT-PCR was carried out to confirm the above result by using the same panel of RNAs as templates with primers designed to amplify exon 3&#x02013;5 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Again, two major amplicons were observed in cell lines 41M and OAW28. Sequencing of both PCR products showed that the smaller product did not contain exon 4. Therefore, there are two splice variants of UNC93A, with one containing all of the 8 exons and one missing exon 4.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>A) The expression of UNC93A in ovarian cancer cell lines by RT-PCR.</bold> Top panel: Ethidium-bromide stained agarose gel of amplification products from the RT-PCR using primers located in exon 1 and exon 8 of the cDNA of UNC93A to amplify the entire coding sequence.

We analysed exon 3 by F-SSCP in a panel of 50 normal DNA samples (Caucasian). 3 samples showed a different pattern on SSCP compared to placenta (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9A</xref>). Direct sequencing of exon 3 from these 3 normal DNA samples, revealed that two were heterozygous for the mutation c.452G&#x0003e;A and one was homozygous (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9B</xref>). Similarly, the frequency of the mutation in exon 5, c.676C&#x0003e;T, which creates a stop codon, in the normal population was also evaluated. This mutation creates a new restriction site for the enzyme Nde1 (CA&#x02193;TATG). Therefore, this exon was amplified by PCR from 50 normal DNA samples and the PCR products were digested with Nde1. One sample (ORK29) had an altered restriction pattern suggestive of a heterozygous mutation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). This was confirmed by direct sequencing of exon 5 in this sample.</p><fig position="float" id="F9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p><bold>c.452G&#x0003e;A mutation in exon 3 in normal DNA</bold>. <bold>A)</bold> Electrogram of F-SSCP of exon 3 from DNA from placenta and two normal controls ORK67 and ORK97 are shown.

The latter PAC contains the telomeric marker <italic>D6S149</italic>. The entire region has been sequenced (1.1 Mb) and we have identified 7 genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. One of the candidate genes identified within this interval was the human homologue of <italic>unc-93</italic> in <italic>C.elegans</italic>. We chose to analyse this gene in detail as it was expressed in the ovary and mapped within the interval of allele loss between <italic>D6S149</italic> and <italic>D6S264.</italic> We have published the results of analysis of other candidate genes within this interval separately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>unc-93</italic> is one of a set of five interacting genes (<italic>unc-93</italic>, <italic>sup-9, sup-10, sup-11</italic> and <italic>sup-18</italic>) involved in the regulation or co-ordination of muscle contraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Mutation of this gene gives a characteristic "rubber-band" phenotype in the worm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. When a rubber band mutant is touched on its head, the worm contracts and then quickly relaxes without moving backwards, whereas a wild-type worm simply moves backwards. Thus, the regulation or co-ordination is defective in the rubber band mutants, although they can contract their body wall muscles. These mutants are sluggish, flaccid, and defective in egg laying. Mutations are quite diverse but the major ones are <italic>e1500</italic> which alters G388R in a membrane spanning domain, the <italic>n200</italic> animals have two mutations, A49V and G562V which are in the hinge domains and in the <italic>n234</italic> animals the <italic>Trp</italic> at position 534 is altered to a stop codon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. It has been proposed that these mutations produce aberrant proteins which are toxic and cause defects in the regulation of muscle contraction. Interestingly, loss of function, or null, mutations in <italic>unc-93</italic> confers no visibly abnormal phenotype. It has been concluded that this is because the set of five genes involved in muscle contraction are functionally redundant of each other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The putative <italic>unc-93</italic> proteins have two distinct regions: the N-terminal is extremely hydrophilic, while the rest of the protein has multiple potential membrane-spanning domains. The expression of <italic>unc-93</italic> in <italic>C.elegans</italic> is quite low compared to other unc genes. It is suggested that <italic>unc-93</italic> is likely to encode a membrane-associated muscle protein in <italic>C. elegans </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>As none of the available ESTs for UNC93A encoded full length cDNA, the entire coding sequence was amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced completely. The amino acid sequence suggests that following a short leader peptide there are at least seven membrane spanning domains similar to that of <italic>unc-93</italic>. Comparison of the cDNA sequence with that of the genomic sequence showed that the gene encodes 8 exons as predicted by the exon prediction programmes. The data form RT-PCR, confirmed by sequencing suggests that there are two splice variants expressed naturally. The second splice variant does not contain exon 4. UNC93A was expressed as two transcripts, 2.1 kb and 1.1 kb on Northern analysis. There is relatively less expression of the smaller transcript in the ovary compared to testis and small intestine. Importantly, none of the ovarian cancer cell lines expressed UNC93A on northern analysis although by more sensitive RT-PCR we did find expression in cell lines. Upon transfection of the GFP tagged UNC93A, there is clear fluorescence at the membrane, confirming that it is a membrane associated protein. It is now apparent there are homologous <italic>unc-93</italic> genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and a second <italic>unc-93</italic> gene in <italic>C.elegans.</italic> There is quite significant similarity among the species, in particular in the membrane spanning domains.</p><p>To evaluate if this gene is involved in the pathogenesis of sporadic ovarian cancer, mutation detection analysis was carried out on a panel of 36 malignant tumours using methods such as SSCP (both <sup>32</sup>P-labelled and fluorescent dye-labelled primers) and DHPLC. In general, there was good concordance between conventional SSCP and F-SSCP. However, DHPLC did detect the mutations in exons 5 and 1 which were not identified by SSCP. The use of both methods significantly increased the success of identifying mutations. Overall, 18/36 tumours were identified to have mutations that might have functional significance (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>). Both missense and nonsense mutations were identified. However, surprisingly the majority of these mutations were present in the matched normal DNA for each individual tumour. Only in three tumours (8%) were specific mutations identified. Firstly, in exon 3 in T30, c.452G&#x0003e;A which alters residue <italic>Trp</italic> to a stop codon. Secondly, in exon 5 in T43, c.676C&#x0003e;T which alters <italic>Arg</italic> to a stop codon. Both the above mutations should alter the reading frame and truncate the protein. Thirdly, one missense mutation in T19 in exon 8, c.1225G&#x0003e;A which alters <italic>Val</italic> to <italic>Ile</italic>. Direct sequencing revealed that many of the mutations identified in the tumours were also present in the cell lines. However, there was one missense mutation c.874G&#x0003e;A in exon 5 identified (<italic>Ala-Val</italic>) only in UCI101 and a frequent mutation in exon 6, c.874G&#x0003e;A (<italic>Val-Ile</italic>) which were observed in 6/8 cell lines. The mutations identified in UNC93A were more numerous than that identified in <italic>unc-93</italic> mutants in <italic>C.elegans</italic> and their location was not identical. It is possible that the mutations in UNC93A may be due to the presence of a pseudogene. Analysis of UNC93A sequence in the database has not identified a pseudogene or any other related genes. Secondly, Southern analysis of normal genomic DNA confirmed that UNC93A is a single copy gene (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F11"><label>Figure 11</label><caption><p><bold>Mutations in UNC93A</bold> All the mutations observed in tumours or cell lines in individual exons are as indicated.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2156-3-20-11"/></fig><p>The identification of the mutation W151X in exon 3 in 4 matched normal DNA samples as well as in tumours (11%), suggested that this might be present in the normal population. The frequency of this polymorphism in the normal population was 3/50 (6%). This included at least one sample having a homozygous mutation. In exon 5, the mutation c.676C&#x0003e;T, which also creates a stop codon, was identified in one tumour (&#x0003c;3%). Screening of 50 normal DNA samples identified this sequence change in one sample (2%). The identification of these two mutations in the normal population suggest that these represent low frequency polymorphisms. Such polymorphisms are rare and an extensive search of the literature identified one report involving BRCA2 where a stop codon polymorphism was found in one patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. However, recently genome wide scanning for SNPs in coding sequences have identified a low frequency of such mutations in less than 1% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] of the genes analysed. The functional impact of these rare mutations are at present unknown. It is estimated that on average the number of polymorphic sites per kilobase of DNA was 3.4 in the coding region and 50% of them coded for an aminoacid change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In the coding sequence of UNC93A, the frequency is much higher (6.4/kb). Only genes of the HLA complex and the P450 cytochrome enzymes have higher rates of polymorphism than this.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The frequency and nature of the mutations in UNC93A in ovarian tumours and cell lines suggests the following. Firstly, UNC93A is an unusual gene which is highly polymorphic and the truncating mutations may not result in any deleterious function in the normal population. This might be due to compensation by other related genes yet to be identified. Secondly, because of identification of significant mutations in the germline of these patients, it is probable that these mutations predispose to ovarian cancer. Polymorphic variants of genes in individuals may increase the risk of a particular cancer. Extensive research is being performed to identify such genes which might explain polygenic diseases. Although several candidate genes have been evaluated for such association in ovarian cancer, none have been identified that could significantly increase the risk of ovarian cancer. Further research is required to discover the allele frequency of the sequence variants in the coding sequence of UNC93A in the normal population and their possible association with ovarian cancer. However, the results presented in this paper do not suggest that UNC93A is the tumour suppressor gene to explain the allele loss observed between D6S264 and D6S149 in ovarian tumours.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Tumour tissues and blood samples</title><p>Fresh tissues (tumours, normal ovary and placenta) and peripheral blood samples were collected from patients in John Radcliffe and Churchill Hospitals, Oxford.

The immune complexes were resolved by 10% SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and then transferred to Hypond-P nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham). The membrane was blocked overnight in PBSA (5% non-fat milk, 0.1% Tween 20) at 4&#x000b0;C, rinsed with PBSA (0.1% Tween 20), and then incubated with monoclonal GFP antibody (1:3000 dilution) for 1 hour in PBSA (0.5% non-fat milk, 0.1% Tween 20), rinsed with PBSA (0.1% Tween 20), and incubate with anti-Mouse Horse-Radish-Peroxidase (1:5000 dilution, Clontech) for 1 hour in PBSA (0.5% non-fat milk, 0.1% Tween 20). The membrane was then washed with PBSA (0.5% non-fat milk, 0.1% Tween 20) for 50 min at room temperature with several changes of the wash solution. Bound proteins were detected by chemiluminescence (Amersham).</p></sec><sec><title>Accession numbers</title><p>The accession number of sequence for RP3-366N23: AL021331, RP3-431P23:AL009178.
