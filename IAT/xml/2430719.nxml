The three mammalian Vav proteins (Vav1, Vav2, and Vav3) differ in their tissue distribution. Vav1 is primarily expressed in hematopoietic cells, while Vav2 and Vav3 are more ubiquitously expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Vav proteins contain multiple function motifs and are involved in various cellular signaling processes, including cytoskeleton organization, calcium influx, phagocytosis, and cell transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Vav proteins share a common structure, including a N-terminal calponin homology (CH) domain involved in Ca<sup>+2 </sup>mobilization and transforming activity, an acidic domain (AD) containing three regulatory tyrosines, a Dbl homology (DH) domain with a conserved region that promotes the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rac/Rho GTPases, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain binding to PIP<sub>3 </sub>that enables its movement to the inner face of the plasma membrane, two Src-homology 3 (SH3) domains interacting with proteins containing proline-rich sequences, and a Src-homology 2 (SH2) domain interacting with proteins containing phosphorylated tyrosines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Tyrosine phosphorylation by receptor protein tyrosine kinase or cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase is required for Vav protein activation. In the non-phosphorylation state, Vav is folded, which is achieved by binding of the tyrosines in the AD domain to the DH domain and binding of the CH domain to the C1 region. Upon phosphorylation of the tyrosines in the AD domain, the folding is opened and the DH domain is exposed. Thus, Vav protein is activated and interacts with substrate proteins, and the PH domain is exposed for PIP3 binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Breast cancer is the most common malignant disease worldwide and the number one cause of cancer-related death among non-smoking women in the US. The major problem in breast cancer therapy is development of estrogen-insensitive growth after hormonal therapy. Aberrant ER&#x003b1; activation by various mechanisms contributes to breast cancer development and estrogen-resistant diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This ER&#x003b1; hypersensitivity can be achieved by estrogen-independent mechanisms, such as ER&#x003b1; phosphorylation by crosstalking with signal transduction pathways and overexpression of nuclear receptor coactivator SRC3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Numerous studies have shown that EGFR/HER2-elicited signaling is involved in human breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In addition, elevated PI3K-Akt signaling, mediated by PTEN deletion and/or mutation and PI3K subunit p110a (PI3KCA) mutation, upregulates ER&#x003b1; activity and is correlated with the breast cancer development and anti-estrogen resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Activation of PI3K has been implicated in part because the downstream PI3K target, Akt, phosphorylates and promotes ligand-independent ER&#x003b1; activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Transgenic breast cancer mouse models have confirmed that elevated signaling in the EGFR/HER2-PI3K-Akt pathway either by targeted Akt overexpression or HER2 overexpression in breast epithelial cells induces breast cancer development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. These signaling pathways have been the targets for breast cancer therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The classical ER&#x003b1; is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that activates transcription of its target genes in nucleus, which is known as genomic ER&#x003b1; activity. Recent findings revealed that the classical steroid hormone receptors also associate with cell membrane and mediate cell signaling through kinase cascade, defined as nongenomic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Nongenomic ER&#x003b1; resides in multiprotein complexes with molecules, such as MNAR/PELP1 and src, in the cytoplasm and signals through the PI3K-Akt and MAPK pathways in breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Nongenomic ER&#x003b1; signaling has been shown to contribute to estrogen-independent growth in breast cancer.</p><p>Recently, we and others found that Vav3 oncogene is overexpressed in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells, enhances androgen receptor (AR) activity, and stimulates androgen-independent growth in prostate cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. We further showed that Vav3, as a signal transducer, upregulates AR activity partially via PI3K-Akt signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The DH domain of Vav3 is responsible for AR activation. Vav3 also potentiates EGF activity for cell growth and AR activation in prostate cancer cells. More importantly, Vav3 is overexpressed in 32% of human prostate cancer. These findings suggest that Vav3 overexpression may be involved in prostate cancer.</p><p>The purpose of this study is to determine the role of Vav3 in breast cancer. We found that Vav3 is overexpressed in human breast cancer specimens and cell lines. Vav3 stimulates growth of breast cancer cells and activates ER&#x003b1; partially via PI3K-Akt signaling. Vav3 potentiates EGF activity for cell growth and ER&#x003b1; activation in breast cancer cells. These data suggest that Vav3 impacts on ER&#x003b1; signaling axis and its overexpression may be involved in breast cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>RPMI 1640 medium was purchased from Invitrogen (Gaithersburg, MD).

Lipofectamine 2000 used for transfection of siRNA has been shown to knock down more than 80% activity of the endogenous gene in a panel of cells tested (Invitrogen). We confirmed a reduced level of Vav3 upon transfection of Vav3 siRNA by protein expression analysis relative to the control (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). A growth stimulatory effect in response to estrogen stimulation was observed in T47D and MCF7 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref><bold>and </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>). We found that knockdown expression of Vav3 significantly inhibited both estrogen-dependent and -independent growth in these breast cancer cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref><bold>and </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>). At 1.2 pM of siRNA, the growth of T47D and MCF7 cells was inhibited by 64% and 68% in the absence of estrogen and 46% and 77% in the presence of estrogen relative to their respective controls. These data suggest that Vav3 is involved in both estrogen-dependent and -independent growth in breast cancer cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Vav3 upregulates ER&#x003b1; activity</title><p>Previous studies have revealed that Vav3*, a Vav3 mutant with N-terminal domain deletion including the AD domain containing three tyrosine residues, is a constitutive active form and has much stronger oncogenic effect relative to that by wild type Vav3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Structure analysis of Vav protein suggested that in the non-phosphorylation state, Vav protein is folded, which is achieved by binding of tyrosines in the AD domain to the DH domain and binding of the CH domain to the C1 region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Phosphorylation of the tyrosines in the AD domain results in unfolding of Vav protein and exposure of the DH domain for interacting with substrate proteins. Consistently, we found that the constitutive active Vav3* shows a much stronger activity in upregulation of AR activity than that by Vav3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>To determine whether Vav3 regulates ER&#x003b1; activity, we used both Vav3 and Vav3* for the reporter assay. Hela cells were transiently cotransfected with a luciferase reporter driven by the estrogen response element (ERE), ER&#x003b1; expression vector, and either Vav3 or Vav3* expression vector. Overexpression of Vav3, and Vav3* with a greater effect relative to the empty vector pHEF, enhanced both basal and estrogen-stimulated ER&#x003b1; activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Furthermore, we found that both estrogen-stimulated and Vav3-activated ER&#x003b1; activities were blocked by ER antagonist Tamoxifen (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The inhibitory effect for ER&#x003b1; by Tamoxifen was compromised with Vav3 overexpression. Upregulation of the endogenous ER&#x003b1; activity by Vav3 relative to the empty vector pHEF was also confirmed in MCF7 cells by stimulation of luciferase reporter expression driven by ERE (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) and natural promoter of ER&#x003b1; target gene pS2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Vav3 also significantly enhanced ER&#x003b1; activity stimulated by sub-physiological concentrations of estrogen (10<sup>-11 </sup>and 10<sup>-10 </sup>M) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).

Since Vav3 is a potential upstream regulator of the PI3K-Akt pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], we investigated whether Vav3 overexpression impacts on PI3K-Akt signaling-mediated ER&#x003b1; activation. Hela cells were transiently cotransfected with ERE-Luc reporter, and expression vectors ER&#x003b1;, Vav3*, and p85 (the regulatory subunit of PI3K) and p110 (the catalytic subunit of PI3K). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, cotransfection of Vav3* or PI3K relative to the empty vector pHEF or pCR3.1 stimulated ER&#x003b1; activity. ER&#x003b1; activity was further enhanced in cells cotransfected with both Vav3* and PI3K. On the other hand, cotransfection of a dominant-negative Akt relative to the empty vector pCR3.1 blocked Vav3*-mediated ER&#x003b1; activation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Next, we determined the role of endogenous PI3K in Vav3-induced ER&#x003b1; activation. Data in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref> showed that PI3K inhibitor Wortmannin blocked both basal and Vav3-stimulated ER&#x003b1; activation in the absence and presence of E2. Similar results were also noted in cells treated with PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (data not shown).

In addition, homologous analysis of Vav3 and Vav1 genes identified a conserved NLS in the PH domain of Vav3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>).

Breast cancer and prostate cancer are steroid-dependent tumors and share a significant similarity in their characteristics and treatment. For instance, growth of these cancer cells, mediated by their corresponding hormone receptors ER&#x003b1; and AR, is hormone-dependent. Hormone ablation is common therapy for both cancers. Recurrent diseases develop hormone-independent growth. Given that steroidal nuclear receptors share many common properties, we hypothesized that Vav3 may regulate ER&#x003b1; activity and is involved in human breast cancer. We tested this hypothesis in the present study by examining the expression of Vav3 in human breast cancer specimens and cell lines and investigated a potential role of Vav3 in breast cancer cell growth and ER&#x003b1; signaling. We found that Vav3 was overexpressed in human breast cancer, particularly in the poorly differentiated lesions and in the two most commonly used breast cancer cell lines. The knockdown expression of Vav3 compromised both estrogen-stimulated and -independent growth of breast cancer cells. On the other hand, overexpression of Vav3 enhanced ER&#x003b1; signaling. These data strongly suggest that Vav3 may play an important role in breast cancer development and/or progression.</p><p>Vav3 is an oncogene identified in cell transformation experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Vav3 is activated upon ligand stimulation of EGF, insulin, Ros, and IGF receptors and physically associates with a variety of signaling molecules, including Rac1, Cdc42, PI3K, Grb2, and PLC-&#x003b3;, leading to alteration in cell morphology and cell transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Overexpression of Vav3 leads to PI3K activation and focus formation in NIH3T3 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In contrast, blocking PI3K activation by PTEN and LY294002 inhibits Vav3-induced cell transformation. Furthermore, it has been shown that Vav3*, a Vav3 mutant with N-terminal domain deletion including the acidic domain, is a constitutive active form and has much stronger oncogenic effect compared with that by Vav3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Consistently, we found that the augmentation of ER&#x003b1; signaling by Vav3 overexpression was similarly inhibited by Wortmannin and by overexpression of a dominant-negative Akt. In addition, Vav3 showed a lower activity for ER&#x003b1; activation relative to that by Vav3*. EGF treatment significantly potentiated Vav3 activity for ER&#x003b1; activation. These data suggest that Vav3 is subjected to regulation by phosphorylation, most likely at the three tyrosines in the AD domain, which may cause conformation change, release the inhibitory effect of the N-terminal domain, and expose the DH domain for ER&#x003b1; binding.</p><p>Many coactivators of steroid hormone receptors have the LXXLL motifs, where L is leucine and X is any amino acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. These coregulators interact with and upregulate ER&#x003b1;-mediated signaling in both nucleus and cytoplasm. For instance, SRC-1 and its related proteins are a family of coactivators containing the homologous bHLH-PAS domain and receptor-interacting domain (RID) with multiple LXXLL motifs and enhance transcription activity of nuclear receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. PELP1/MNAR containing the LXXLL motif interacts with and enhances both genomic and nongenomic ER&#x003b1; activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Recent findings implicate that Vav family proteins also complex with transcription factors and regulate gene expression. Vav1 was identified in the component of transcriptionally active nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)- and nuclear factor NFkB-like complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. A nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the PH domain is solely responsible for nucleus localization of Vav1 protein, indicating a role of Vav family proteins as a transcription coregulator. We found that Vav3 contains the LXXLL motifs in the DH domain and NLS in the PH domain. This finding suggests that Vav3 is also a nuclear protein.</p><p>Previous study has shown that Vav protein can be activated by receptor tyrosine kinase upon activation of EGFR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Furthermore, ER&#x003b1; resides in multi-protein complexes with molecules, such as MNAR/PELP1 and src, in the cytoplasm and signals through the PI3K-Akt and MAPK pathways in breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. ER&#x003b1; was also found localized in lipid rafts and involved in signaling elicited by EGFR and HER2 receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. We found that Vav3 activates ER&#x003b1; partially via PI3K-Akt signaling and potentiates EGF effect for cell growth and ER&#x003b1; activation in breast cancer cells. More interestingly, we found that Vav3 complexes with ER&#x003b1;. These findings suggest that Vav3 enhances ER&#x003b1; signaling axis in breast cancer cells. Vav3 overexpression may confer ER&#x003b1; hypersensitivity and play a role in breast cancer. Given both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of Vav3 protein, our data implicate that Vav3 may impact on both genomic and nongenomic ER&#x003b1; activity. Furthermore, the relationship of Vav3 and ER&#x003b1; in the context of EGFR/HER2 and PI3K-Akt signaling is remained to be determined.</p><p>Our findings support the notion that Vav3 overexpression may play a role in breast cancer, based on the following reasons: 1) Vav3 is overexpressed and correlated with poorly differentiated tumors in human breast cancer; 2) Vav3 contains the LXXLL motifs and complexes with ER&#x003b1;; 3) Vav3 enhances ER&#x003b1; activity partially via the PI3K-Akt pathway; 4) Vav3 is a protein with multiple domains and functions, including the SH2 domain interacting with receptor protein tyrosine kinase, the PH domain binding PIP3 involved in association with the cell membrane, and the DH domain involved in interaction with ER&#x003b1;; 5) Vav3 potentiates EGF for cell growth and ER&#x003b1; activation. Taken together, these findings suggest that Vav3 overexpression enhances ER&#x003b1;-mediated signaling axis and may be involved in breast cancer.</p><p>Data presented in this report clearly show that Vav3 is overexpressed in human breast cancer and is involved in growth of breast cancer cells and ER&#x003b1; signaling. Whereas our data showed that Vav3 complexes with ER&#x003b1;, molecular mechanisms underlying the enhancement of ER&#x003b1; signaling remain to be elucidated.
