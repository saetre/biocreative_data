Capture Compound<sup>TM</sup> Mass Spectrometry (CCMS) is a novel technology to address this issue. CCs are trifunctional molecules that accomplish the reversible binding of target protein families to a <italic>selectivity group</italic> (small molecule), covalent capturing of the bound proteins by photoactivated cross-linking through a <italic>reactivity group</italic>, and pullout of the small molecule-protein complexes through a <italic>sorting function</italic>, <italic>e.g.</italic> biotin. Here we present the design, synthesis, and application of a new Capture Compound to target and identify cAMP-binding proteins in complex protein mixtures. Starting with modest amounts of total protein mixture (65&#x02013;500 &#x003bc;g), we demonstrate that the cAMP-CCs can be used to isolate <italic>bona fide</italic> cAMP-binding proteins from lysates of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content>, mammalian HepG2 cells, and subcellular fractions of mammalian brain, respectively. The identified proteins captured by the cAMP-CCs range from soluble cAMP-binding proteins, such as the catabolite gene activator protein from <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> and regulatory subunits of protein kinase A from mammalian systems, to cAMP-activated potassium/sodium hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels from neuronal membranes and specifically synaptosomal fractions from rat brain. The latter group of proteins has never been identified before in any small molecule protein interaction and mass spectrometry-based proteomics study. Given the modest amount of protein input required, we expect that CCMS using the cAMP-CCs provides a unique tool for profiling cAMP-binding proteins from proteome samples of limited abundance, such as tissue biopsies.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>cAMP is an important biological second messenger molecule involved in many biological processes, such as adaptation of bacteria to low glucose growing conditions, chemotaxis in slime molds, and various signal transduction processes in metazoa downstream of the activation of hormone receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). The concentration level of cAMP in biological systems is tightly controlled by the activity of adenylyl cyclases that catalyze the formation of cAMP and by the activity of phosphodiesterases, which catalyze the degradation of cAMP. Given the importance of signaling cascades downstream of hormone or neurotransmitter receptors that involve increased formation or degradation of cAMP, the identification and profiling of cAMP effector proteins can be expected to be an essential contribution to elucidate the molecular basis of physiological as well as pathophysiological signaling events.</p><p><italic>Bona fide</italic> effectors of cAMP are proteins that contain a cyclic nucleotide binding domain (CNBD).<xref ref-type="other" rid="G1"><sup>1</sup></xref> This motif represents a protein domain initially defined and characterized by the crystal structure of the major known cAMP-binding protein from <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content>, the catabolite gene activator protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). This domain is present in all known mammalian cAMP-binding proteins as well. Three major classes of proteins exist that contain CNBDs. The first group contains protein kinase A subunits, namely regulatory subunits of protein kinase A isozymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), as well as the cGMP-dependent protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). A group of Rap guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Epac proteins) that contain CNBDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) comprises the second group. Both groups contain key proteins involved in signaling cascades. A number of ion channels that can be directly regulated by cAMP contain CNBDs, such as the cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), make up the third group. In particular, potassium/sodium hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels play a crucial role in the pacemaking of heart and brain activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). A relatively small number of further proteins that contain CNBDs, such as phosphodiesterase isoforms and a sodium-hydrogen exchange transporter, can be retrieved from searches in databases such as Swiss-Prot.</p><p>Among the methodological repertoire applied in functional proteomics, small molecule affinity-based techniques seem to be ideal for the task of profiling the cAMP binding proteome subset. Established strategies make use of cAMP affinity beads. These beads comprise cAMP derivatives covalently attached to the polymer backbone via an aminoalkyl linker. The linker may vary in length of the alkyl chain and in the attachment position at the nucleobase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). This approach, however, suffers from the relatively large amount of protein input required to obtain significant data, precluding <italic>e.g.</italic> the profiling of the target proteins in samples of limited abundance. Furthermore, it has not been demonstrated yet that affinity-based enrichment of cAMP-binding proteins is suitable for cAMP-binding membrane proteins that are known to be difficult to access. On the other hand, soluble cAMP- and cGMP-binding proteins along with their interaction partners were robustly identified with this methodology. Another approach described in the literature used a cyclic guanosine monophosphate analogue immobilized on a Biacore chip to isolate cGMP- and cAMP-binding proteins from a cell lysate, estimate the quantity of the material, and elute proteins for proteolysis and identification by LC-MS/MS. In addition, for single purified proteins, binding constants can be measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The applicability of this approach to transmembrane cGMP/cAMP-binding proteins, however, has yet to be determined.</p><p>Here we describe the synthesis and application of a trifunctional Capture Compound<sup>TM</sup> (CC) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>) as a novel approach for the functional isolation of cAMP-binding proteins from complex protein mixtures using low amounts of protein input. In contrast to current pulldown approaches, the CC enables the covalent linkage to the target proteins by a photoactivatable reactivity group in addition to the reversible binding of target proteins by the selectivity group. The Capture Compound-protein conjugate can be isolated from the complex protein mixture via the sorting function (a biotin moiety) of the Capture Compound by means of streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The cAMP-binding protein-selective Capture Compound described here was successfully applied to the isolation of cAMP-binding proteins from <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> lysate and cultured eukaryotic HepG2 cells, respectively. Furthermore, we report the applicability of the CCMS approach for the capturing of cAMP-binding HCN channel proteins from rat brain synaptosome preparations as well. To our knowledge, this has not yet been achieved by any cAMP affinity bead approach. In addition, the ion channels, which by antibody- and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization-based techniques have been shown to be located in neuronal tissues at synaptic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), have also escaped detection in many detailed proteomics profiling studies conducted to establish the protein complements of synaptic structures (see <italic>e.g.</italic> Refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Our data suggest that the cAMP-CC approach is uniquely efficient and sensitive for the identification and profiling of cAMP-binding proteins in complex protein mixtures.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>All standard chemical reagents and solvents were obtained from commercial suppliers and were used without further purification.

Further mass spectrometric settings were as follows: spray voltage was set to 1.7 kV, temperature of the heated transfer capillary was set to 200 &#x000b0;C, and normalized collision energy was 35% for MS<sup>2</sup>.

All eight cAMP-CCs synthesized were tested in capture experiments using <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> lysate (500 &#x003bc;g of total protein). The capture experiments were performed on bead and off bead, respectively (for details, see &#x0201c;Experimental Procedures&#x0201d;). All cAMP-CCs captured CAP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">Table I</xref>). Nevertheless, the capture efficiency differed significantly depending on the linker length. In a comparative study for the capture efficiency of C8-attached cAMP-CCs with different linker lengths (<bold>7a</bold>, <bold>7b</bold>, <bold>7c</bold>, and <bold>7d</bold>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <italic>lanes 1&#x02013;4</italic>), we observed that capturing of CAP was significantly lower with 8-AEA-cAMP-CC (<bold>7a</bold>) than with the other Capture Compounds (<bold>7b</bold>, <bold>7c</bold>, and <bold>7d</bold>). This was confirmed by subsequent nano-LC-MS/MS analysis regarding both the number of identified peptides and the number of assigned spectra (<xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">Table I</xref>). In the case of <bold>7a</bold>, only five CAP-specific peptides were identified in the on-bead capture experiment, whereas just one CAP-specific peptide was identified in the off-bead experiment (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">Table I</xref>). In general, the longer the linker, the better the cAMP-CC binds to CAP with an apparent optimum for the hexyl linkers as judged on the basis of protein band intensities on the gel and the number of peptides (assigned spectra) identified in LC-MS/MS. However, when the linker length was too long, the capture efficiency decreased again as shown with compound <bold>7d</bold>. Capturing of CAP using 8-AHA-cAMP-CC (<bold>7c</bold>) was largely reduced in the presence of an excess amount of 2 m<sc>m</sc> 8-AHA-cAMP (<bold>4c</bold>) as competitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <italic>lane 5</italic>), whereas 2 m<sc>m</sc> cAMP as competitor was less efficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <italic>lane 6</italic>) because of the low stability of cAMP in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> lysate. Addition of scaffold <bold>1</bold> to 8-AHA-cAMP-CC (<bold>7c</bold>) did not influence the capture yield (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <italic>lane 7</italic>), providing additional evidence that capturing of CAP is solely based on the interaction between the selectivity function and the target protein. The competition efficiency (<xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">Table I</xref>, last column) differed significantly between off-bead (two identified peptides) and on-bead (six identified peptides) experiments. One reason might be that in contrast to off-bead experiments on-bead experiments were carried out with a 2.5 times higher concentration of Capture Compound. This is necessary because of the streptavidin magnetic beads, which were also used in 2.5-fold excess in both cases but were fully loaded with Capture Compound in the on-bead experiment. The changed ratio between Capture Compound and competitor to a less optimal value may cause incomplete competition. Another explanation for the reduced competition efficiency of 8-AHA-cAMP (<bold>4c</bold>) in on-bead experiments might be substantial steric hindrance at the protein-coated surface of the beads that disturbed the thermodynamic equilibrium. Comparing 6-AH-cAMP-CC (<bold>5b</bold>) and 6-AE-cAMP-CC (<bold>5a</bold>) as well as 2-AHA-cAMP-CC (<bold>6b</bold>) and 2-AEA-cAMP-CC (<bold>6a</bold>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">Table I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <italic>lanes 8&#x02013;11</italic>) again revealed that CCs with a longer linker have a better capture efficiency, although the difference was less pronounced in the case of <bold>6a</bold><italic>versus</italic><bold>6b</bold>. The tendency for a C<sub>4</sub>&#x02013;C<sub>6</sub> linker is in line with two requirements for the Capture Compound design: 1) the &#x0201c;undisturbed&#x0201d; binding of the selectivity group must be preserved, and 2) the reactivity group must be able to cross-link to the target protein. Based on their ability to capture CAP, the three hexyl-linked cAMP-CCs, 8-AHA-cAMP-CC (<bold>7c</bold>), 6-AH-cAMP-CC (<bold>5b</bold>), and 2-AHA-cAMP-CC (<bold>6b</bold>), were further explored in several comparative experiments.

From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, it can be clearly stated that the simple pulldown experiment is much less effective to enrich CAP than the capture experiment according to our protocol.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Silver-stained SDS-PAGE gel (4&#x02013;20% gradient gel): on-bead capturing in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> lysate (500 &#x003bc;g) using Capture Compound 7c.</bold><italic>Lane 1</italic>, 1 &#x003bc;g of <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> whole cell lysate; <italic>lane 2</italic>, 8-AHA-cAMP-CC (<bold>7c</bold>) <italic>with</italic> photoactivation (=capturing); <italic>lane 3</italic>, competition of <bold>7c</bold> with 2 m<sc>m</sc> 8-AHA-cAMP (<bold>4c</bold>); <italic>lane 4</italic>, 8-AHA-cAMP-CC (<bold>7c</bold>) <italic>without</italic> photoactivation (=pulldown). <italic>MW</italic>, molecular weight marker.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zjw0120935040003"/></fig><p>We extended our studies to mammalian cAMP-binding proteins. In an initial experiment, we compared the EC<sub>50</sub> value of Capture Compound <bold>7c</bold> with that of cAMP to cAMP-binding proteins, such as the commercially available regulatory subunits of PKA, by fluorescence polarization. In the fluorescence polarization competitive binding experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), the binding potency of the cyclic nucleotides was directly related to the obtained EC<sub>50</sub> value as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>. It was found that cAMP displays an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 4 n<sc>m</sc> and the Capture Compound <bold>7c</bold> displays an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 25.8 n<sc>m</sc>, indicating a 6 times decreased affinity of the Capture Compound to human PKARI&#x003b1;, although the Capture Compound <bold>7c</bold> is still a nanomolar binder to this protein. Based on the binding assay and the capture results from <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content>, compounds <bold>5b</bold>, <bold>6b</bold>, and <bold>7c</bold> along with 8-AEA-cAMP-CC (<bold>7a</bold>) were tested using a commercially available preparation of the bovine PKARII. Again, the regulatory subunit of PKA bound cAMP with nanomolar affinity. As expected, the C<sub>6</sub>-linked 8-AHA-cAMP-CC (<bold>7c</bold>) displayed a much better capture performance than the ethyl-linked analog (<bold>7a</bold>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>, <italic>lanes 5</italic> and <italic>7</italic>). The two other hexyl-linked Capture Compounds with N6 and C2 attachment positions, <bold>5b</bold> and <bold>6b</bold>, were similarly efficient compared with Capture Compound <bold>7c</bold>. In analogy to the experiments with the <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> lysate, the addition of 2 m<sc>m</sc> cAMP to the reaction prior to the addition of the CCs largely abolished capturing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>, <italic>lanes 2</italic>, <italic>4</italic>, <italic>6</italic>, and <italic>8</italic>). Scaffold <bold>1</bold>, which lacks the selectivity function, showed no significant binding to bovine PKARII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>, <italic>lane 9</italic>). This result enabled us to use the scaffold <bold>1</bold> as a second background control. Because the gel bands obtained from capture experiments using 2.3 &#x003bc;g of bovine PKARII with Capture Compounds <bold>5b</bold>, <bold>6b</bold>, and <bold>7c</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>, <italic>lanes 1</italic>, <italic>3</italic>, and <italic>5</italic>) were of similar intensities compared with the control band comprising 0.5 &#x003bc;g of bovine PKARII (<italic>lane 10</italic>), a capture yield of &#x0223c;20% was estimated with all of these Capture Compounds. It should be noted that photocross-linking yields are often below 10% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), so a capture yield of over 20% is remarkable. The capture yield of <bold>7c</bold> was independently determined to be 23% by analyzing an SDS-PAGE gel where a triplicate capture experiment was compared with a concentration series of bovine PKARII (0.1&#x02013;0.5 &#x003bc;g) (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/M900110-MCP200/DC1">supplemental Fig. F12</ext-link>). In an analogous experiment, the capture yield for human PKARI&#x003b1; with Capture Compound <bold>7c</bold> was determined (37%), providing insight into the variability of the photocross-linking efficiency even for closely related, but distinct proteins.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Fig. 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Fluorescence polarization competitive binding experiment.</bold> 2.5 n<sc>m</sc> human PKARI&#x003b1; was added to a serial dilution of the cyclic nucleotide indicated on the plot, and apparent EC<sub>50</sub> values were calculated (for experimental details see the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/M900110-MCP200/DC1">supplemental material</ext-link>).

Among the <italic>bona fide</italic> cAMP-binding proteins were two members of the HCN channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>, for MS/MS spectra) and a Rap guanine nucleotide exchange factor (<xref ref-type="table" rid="TIV">Table IV</xref>). In the control experiment using 8-AHA-cAMP (<bold>4c</bold>) (2 m<sc>m</sc>) as competitor, no cAMP-binding protein-specific peptides were identified by LC-MS/MS. In addition to proteins with known CNBD and their binding partners, other nucleotide-binding proteins were captured with <bold>7c</bold> as well but not with scaffold <bold>1</bold> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="TV">Table V</xref>). In contrast to the experiments with HepG2 lysate, competition experiments using 2 m<sc>m</sc> 8-AHA-cAMP (<bold>4c</bold>) failed with synaptosomal fractions. However, competition (fully or in part) was possible with other nucleotides (2 m<sc>m</sc> concentration of either ATP, GTP, or NADH; <xref ref-type="table" rid="TV">Table V</xref>).

For this purpose, small molecules may be immobilized on polymer beads (for reviews, see Refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Another well established approach is the use of multifunctional activity-based probes that bind selectively and covalently to the active centers of members of the targeted enzyme families. A sorting function, linked to the selectivity group, permits the isolation of the small molecule-protein conjugates. This approach is known as activity-based protein profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Both techniques have particular strengths and limitations. The affinity bead approach requires relatively large amounts of protein input, preventing its application to scarce samples, such as tissue biopsies or primary cell cultures. In addition, considerable preparative effort is required for achieving sufficient amounts of the input material from appropriate sources. In the activity-based protein profiling approach the small molecule attaches covalently to the target protein to maximize the sensitivity. Therefore, this method is applicable to less abundant protein samples. However, it is restricted to those small molecules that can covalently react with the active centers of targeted proteins, which is not the case for the vast majority of small molecules that specifically bind to target protein families.</p><p>We have overcome this restriction by adding a photoactivatable reactivity group to the backbone scaffold attached to the small molecule. A similar approach has been used in distinct cases for the isolation of histone deacetylases from complex protein mixtures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). We have developed a novel and general approach to functionally isolate and identify proteins by combining the Capture Compound strategy with mass spectrometric analysis and named it CCMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). A crucial step in the work flow of our methodology is the photocross-linking under controlled and reproducible conditions, in particular the reaction temperature of the sample as well as wavelength and power of the UV light. For this purpose, we have developed a photocross-linking device with an integrated cooling unit. This allows the photoactivation between 290 and 370 nm (for the spectral characteristics of the UV lamp, see the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/M900110-MCP200/DC1">supplemental material</ext-link>), which is necessary to activate most available reactivity groups beyond the cutoff of cell lysates, at a reaction temperature of 2&#x02013;4 &#x000b0;C. The lamps emit light with a maximum at 312 nm. Indeed we<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN5"><sup>4</sup></xref> and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) found that the well known aryltrifluoromethyldiazirines are most efficiently activated to the carbenes at 310 nm, whereas at 350&#x02013;360 nm, the wavelength normally used for activation of diazirines, the carbenes are generated only in part alongside transformation of the diazirine to the diazo compound. Here we report the efficiency of CCMS using the novel cAMP-binding protein-specific Capture Compounds as an example. CCMS serves as an analytical tool to probe the cAMP-interacting subset of the proteome. Our results clearly demonstrate that the CCMS strategy can be used to isolate not only principle soluble <italic>bona fide</italic> cAMP-binding proteins but also their interacting partners, such as the AKAPs.</p><p>The sensitivity of the cAMP-CCMS approach was demonstrated by the success in functional isolation and identification of HCN channels from synaptosomal fractions. This result is unique compared to those of existing studies to target cAMP-binding proteins based on small molecule-protein interactions combined with mass spectrometry-based proteomics. It has been reported, based on immunohistochemical data, that HCN1 and HCN2 are localized at the dendritic side of synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). However, to our knowledge, even in large scale comprehensive MS-based screening studies using subcellular proteomics approaches in which more than 2000 individual gene products have been identified from synaptic structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), HCN channels have escaped analysis. Likewise, in comprehensive cAMP affinity purification experiments from heart ventricular tissue in which HCN4 channels are known to be localized, this class of proteins escaped analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), although other cAMP- and cGMP-binding proteins, such as the regulatory subunits of PKA and the cGMP-dependent protein kinases, were robustly identified in those studies.</p><p>To our knowledge there are only a few studies to date that reported the identification of endogenous HCN channels by mass spectrometry-based proteomics at all. One of those is a shotgun-type study to profile phosphopeptides from synaptosome proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>) in which a large number of phosphorylation sites of synaptosome proteins were reported, among them a total of seven phosphorylation sites from four different HCN channels. In an entirely different type of experimental approach, Zolles <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>) isolated HCN ion channel complexes by an immunoprecipitation-based approach followed by mass spectrometric analysis directed at the identification of new HCN ion channel interaction partners.</p><p>This highlights the difficulty to get preparative access to these proteins at the endogenous level in general. Moreover, shotgun approaches as well as immunoprecipitation approaches answer experimental questions different from those addressed by small molecule-protein interaction-based approaches. In contrast to a shotgun approach, the CCMS approach requires still native functional protein during the capture reaction. This is the case in an immunoprecipitation experiment as well, but the latter is entirely targeted to the protein that is recognized by the antibody used. cAMP-CCMS, however, still retains a screening character and addresses a heterogeneous functional subset of the proteome, and sensitivity matters in terms of coverage of the targeted subset.</p><p>These observations led us to suggest that CCMS using cAMP-CCs is a uniquely sensitive and efficient strategy to profile target proteins even from samples of relatively low amounts of protein. This further suggests that CCMS using cAMP-CCs permits screening for the target proteins from sample types of restricted abundance, such as tissue biopsies, which cannot be scaled up.</p><p>In addition to <italic>bona fide</italic> cAMP- or cGMP-binding proteins and validated interaction partners (the AKAP proteins), a number of further proteins were captured with 8-AHA-cAMP-CC (<bold>7c</bold>) but not with scaffold <bold>1</bold>, which lacks the selectivity group (Tables III and V). There are three possible explanations for this observation. 1) There may be proteins that specifically bind to cAMP but that lack a CNBD domain. 2) Proteins may have been captured that bind to nucleotides in a promiscuous manner under the experimental conditions chosen. 3) There may be additional indirect binding partners of cAMP/cGMP-binding proteins that were co-isolated through non-covalent interactions. Data from cAMP/cGMP affinity bead pulldown studies or from combined Biacore/LC-MS/MS studies have reported similar results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). In these studies, the specificity for cyclic nucleotide monophosphate binding has been probed by sequential elution of the bound proteins with a range of different nucleotides, such as ATP, GTP, NAD, and finally cAMP (or cGMP), although elution with cAMP (or cGMP) was often incomplete. In CCMS, the specificity cannot be tested at that stage of the experiment because captured proteins are covalently attached to the Capture Compounds. Instead, in CCMS, the specificity of the Capture Compound-protein interaction can be tested by competition of nucleotides for the binding of the cAMP Capture Compound directly in the CCMS assay. <italic>Bona fide</italic> cAMP-binding proteins were substantially competed by free 8-AHA-cAMP (<bold>4c</bold>). Interestingly, ATP at 2 m<sc>m</sc> was also capable to compete in these cases. This raises the interesting possibility that cAMP signal transduction may be sensitive to the metabolic state of the affected cells and may be &#x0201c;toned down&#x0201d; to a certain extent in situations in which intracellular ATP concentrations are particularly high.</p><p>Another major advantage that results from the CCMS work flow is that cAMP-binding proteins can be screened against control samples in which the binding of the CC has truly been competed by a suitable competitor molecule, making the results reliable. This concept is in contrast to the application of cAMP affinity beads. In studies using this affinity bead work flow the specificity of the protein isolation was established through sequential elution of non-cAMP nucleotide-binding proteins by nucleotide compounds such as ADP, NAD, or cGMP. However, the <italic>bona fide</italic> cAMP-binding proteins could not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) or could only partially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) be eluted from the affinity matrix even by cAMP itself. Rather it was concluded that those proteins that were retained on the cAMP bead column even after &#x0201c;elution&#x0201d; with cAMP were the real high affinity cAMP binders. This obviously creates uncertainty in the case where a protein previously not known to interact with cAMP was retained on the affinity beads. CCMS, because of the possibility to efficiently compete for specifically captured proteins, therefore, provides much more solid data in the discovery of novel cAMP-binding proteins.</p><p>It may still be possible to scale up the capture experiments by pooling several samples for subsequent protein analysis to increase the number of identified peptides per protein. The scope of the work presented here was to demonstrate the analytical power of CCMS even for low amounts of protein input as well as to identify proteins that are otherwise difficult to access, such as membrane proteins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplemental Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="M900110-MCP200_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M900110-MCP200_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are in debt to Dr. Daniela Bertinetti and Prof. Friedrich W.
