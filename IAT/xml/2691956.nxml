Profiling of the innate immune responses induced by MVA is essential for the design of vaccine vectors and for anticipating potential adverse interactions between naturally acquired and vaccine-induced immune responses. Here we report on innate immune sensing of MVA and cytokine responses in human THP-1 cells, primary human macrophages and mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). The innate immune responses elicited by MVA in human macrophages were characterized by a robust chemokine production and a fairly weak pro-inflammatory cytokine response. Analyses of the cytokine production profile of macrophages isolated from knockout mice deficient in Toll-like receptors (TLRs) or in the adapter molecules MyD88 and TRIF revealed a critical role for TLR2, TLR6 and MyD88 in the production of IFN&#x003b2;-independent chemokines. MVA induced a marked up-regulation of the expression of RIG-I like receptors (RLR) and the IPS-1 adapter (also known as Cardif, MAVS or VISA). Reduced expression of RIG-I, MDA-5 and IPS-1 by shRNAs indicated that sensing of MVA by RLR and production of IFN&#x003b2; and IFN&#x003b2;-dependent chemokines was controlled by the MDA-5 and IPS-1 pathway in the macrophage. Crosstalk between TLR2-MyD88 and the NALP3 inflammasome was essential for expression and processing of IL-1&#x003b2;. Transcription of the <italic>Il1b</italic> gene was markedly impaired in TLR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BMDM, whereas mature and secreted IL-1&#x003b2; was massively reduced in NALP3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BMDMs or in human THP-1 macrophages with reduced expression of NALP3, ASC or caspase-1 by shRNAs. Innate immune sensing of MVA and production of chemokines, IFN&#x003b2; and IL-1&#x003b2; by macrophages is mediated by the TLR2-TLR6-MyD88, MDA-5-IPS-1 and NALP3 inflammasome pathways. Delineation of the host response induced by MVA is critical for improving our understanding of poxvirus antiviral escape mechanisms and for designing new MVA vaccine vectors with improved immunogenicity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) is a highly attenuated, replication-deficient, poxvirus currently developed as a vaccine vector against a broad spectrum of infectious diseases including HIV, tuberculosis and malaria. It is well known that robust activation of innate immunity is essential to achieve an efficient vaccine response, and that poxviruses have developed numerous strategies to block the innate immune response. Yet, the precise mechanisms underlying innate immune sensing of MVA are poorly characterized. Toll-like receptors (TLR), RIG-I-like receptors (RLR) and NOD-like receptors (NLR) are families of membrane-bound and cytosolic sensors that detect the presence of microbial products and initiate host innate and adaptive immune responses. Here, we report the first comprehensive study of MVA sensing by innate immune cells, demonstrating that TLR2-TLR6-MyD88, MDA-5-IPS-1 and NALP3 inflammasome pathways play specific and coordinated roles in regulating cytokine, chemokine and interferon response to MVA poxvirus infection. Delineation of the pathways involved in the sensing of MVA by the host could help designing modified vectors with increased immunogenicity, which would be of particular importance since MVA is considered as a leading vaccine for HIV/AIDS vaccine following the recent failure of an adenovirus-mediated HIV vaccine trial.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Attenuated poxviruses are currently being developed as vaccines vectors against various infectious diseases including HIV, malaria and tuberculosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000480-Gomez1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) and NYVAC are highly attenuated poxvirus strains due to multiple deletions of viral genes and are replication-deficient in human cells. MVA and NYVAC are immunogenic and safe and have been shown to be excellent vaccine vectors for the expression of foreign antigens. MVA is a leading vaccine candidate for delivery of HIV genes with efficient induction of T-cell mediated immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000480-Gomez1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000480-Johnston1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Profiling of the immune responses triggered by poxvirus vaccine vectors is critical not only for optimal design of vaccine vectors but also for anticipating potential harmful interactions between naturally acquired or vaccine-induced immune responses against the vaccine target. This is indeed an important lesson learned from the adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) HIV vaccine (MRKAd5) STEP trial. Pre-existing neutralizing antibodies against the Ad5 vaccine vector were found to increase the relative risk of HIV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000480-Johnston2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000480-Sekaly1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence the need for extensive assessments of vaccine-induced innate and adaptive immune responses to prevent unexpected adverse events.</p><p>Sensing of invasive pathogens by sentinel innate immune cells is a fundamental feature of the host antimicrobial defense response. Toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) like receptors (RLRs) and nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) have recently emerged as central innate sensors of viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000480-Ishii1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Virus sensing by TLR occurs at the cell surface and in the endosomal compartment. At the cell surface, TLR2 or TLR4 recognize either DNA (herpes viruses) or RNA viruses (respiratory syncitial, hepatitis C and measles viruses). In the endosomal compartment, TLR7, TLR3 or TLR9 sense single stranded (vesicular stomatitis virus, Sendai, West Nile and influenza viruses) and double stranded (reovirus) RNA viruses, and DNA viruses (herpes simplex viruses, cytomegalovirus), respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000480-Alexopoulou1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000480-Lund1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Two members of the cytosolic pattern recognition RLR receptors, RIG-I (also known as DDX58) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 protein (MDA5) (also known as helicard), have been shown to function as sensors of RNA viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000480-Kato1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000480-Pichlmair1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. RIG-I detects 5&#x02032;-triphosphate of ssRNAs and short dsRNAs, while MDA5 preferentially recognizes long dsRNAs. NALP3 (NLRP3 also known as cryopyrin) is a member of the NLR family which have been involved in the sensing of both DNA (adenovirus) and RNA (rotavirus, Sendai and influenza viruses) viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000480-Kanneganti1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000480-Muruve1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. NALP3, ASC and pro-caspase 1 form a multimeric cytosolic molecular complex known as the NALP3 inflammasome that controls the processing of the IL-1&#x003b2; cytokine precursor pro-IL-1&#x003b2; into IL-1&#x003b2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000480-Petrilli1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

To determine the contribution of endocytosis to MVA-induced intracellular signalling and cytokine production, THP-1 cells were treated with cytochalasine D, an actin-depolymerizing drug that blocks the endocytotic trafficking, or with chloroquine, a lysosomotropic weak base to neutralize the acidic environment of endocytic vesicles. IL-1&#x003b2; and to a lesser extend IFN&#x003b2; production were inhibited by cytochalasine D and chloroquine treatment. The inhibition was not related to drug toxicity because chloroquine did not affect IL-8 production and cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000480-g005">Figure 5</xref> and data not shown). The reason why the inhibition of cytokine production (particularly IFN&#x003b2;) was only partial after treatment with the inhibitors remains uncertain. The data suggest that additional non-endocytic pathways may play a role in the production of IFN&#x003b2;.

At the cell surface, MVA is sensed by the TLR2-TLR6 heterodimer that induces the production of IFN&#x003b2;-independent chemokines (IL-8, MIP-1 and MIP-2) (1) and pro-IL-1&#x003b2; (2). Upon virus entry into the cell, cytosolic MVA or MVA-derived viral components (possibly envelope or core proteins, early mRNA or DNA) activate the MDA-5-IPS-1 pathway to release IFN&#x003b2; (3) and subsequent induction of IFN&#x003b2;-dependent chemokines (such as RANTES, IP-10) following activation of the type I IFN receptor (4). Finally, MVA infection leads to the activation of the NALP3 inflammasome (composed of NALP3, ASC and pro-caspase 1) enabling caspase-1 processing, pro-IL-1&#x003b2; maturation and IL-1&#x003b2; secretion (5). For simplicity, the same diagram for MVA is shown outside and inside the cell.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ppat.1000480.g010"/></fig><p>RIG-I has been shown to be involved in the induction of TNF and type I IFN by myxoma poxvirus in human macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000480-Wang1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. Yet, silencing of MDA-5 was associated with a small (about 25&#x00025;) but clear reduction of macrophages response to myxoma virus suggesting that both RIG-I and MDA-5 were implicated, albeit to various degree, in innate immune response to myxoma virus. The nature of the component(s) of DNA viruses activating the RLR pathway remains to be identified. Obvious candidate molecules include, envelope or core proteins, early mRNA and DNA itself. Unless RLR engagement is used primarily to the virus own benefit, it is likely that poxviruses have developed antiviral escape strategies interfering with the host RLR antiviral defense pathway. In line with this assumption, the dsRNA binding protein E3 of vaccinia virus has been reported to inhibit IPS-1 signaling, IRF3 phosphorylation, cytokine and IFN&#x003b2; production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000480-Smith1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000480-Zhang1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. Should inhibitors of the RLR pathway be identified in the MVA genome, gene deletion might provide an opportunity to generate new MVA vaccine vectors with increased immunogenicity.</p><p>In addition to RLR, profiling of the cytokine response induced by MVA in the macrophage revealed a key role for the heterodimeric TLR2-TLR6 complex and the adapter protein MyD88 in the production of IFN&#x003b2;-independent chemokines (such as IL-8, MIP-1&#x003b1;, MIP-1&#x003b2; and MIP-2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000480-g010">Figure 10</xref>). Innate immune recognition of the vaccinia virus has also been shown to depend on TLR2 and MyD88 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000480-Zhu1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. The present observation is one of the few examples of viral recognition mediated by TLR2 heterodimers. Recognition of human cytomegalovirus has been shown to be mediated by a TLR2-TLR1 heterocomplex and that of hepatitis C virus by either TLR2-TLR1 or TLR2-TLR6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000480-Boehme1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000480-Chang1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. The facts that TLR2 is expressed at the cell surface and that the inhibition of endocytosis or UV-irradiation of MVA did not affect IL-8 production by macrophage suggest that a component of the MVA envelope or a core protein is responsible for the activation of the TLR2-TLR6-MyD88 pathway. However, the nature of the viral component likely to serve as ligands for these TLR2-TLR1/TLR6 heterodimers has so far remained elusive.</p><p>Other TLRs have also been implicated as innate sensors of poxviruses. Ectromelia virus, the causative agent of mousepox, was shown to be recognized by mouse dendritic cells in TLR9 dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000480-Samuelsson1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, responses of dendritic cells to MVA was both TLR9-dependent (up-regulation of CD40) and TLR9-independent (up-regulation of CD69 and production of IFN&#x003b1; and IL-6) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000480-Samuelsson1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000480-Waibler2">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. Although we did not perform experiments with TLR9-deficient macrophages in the present study, the data obtained with MyD88 deficient cells clearly rule out the implication of TLR9 in MVA-induced IFN&#x003b2; and IFN&#x003b2;-dependent chemokines. However, we cannot exclude the involvement of TLR9 in the production of IFN&#x003b2;-independent chemokines. Finally, in a mouse model activation of TLR3 contributed to the pathogenesis of Western Reserve vaccinia virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000480-Hutchens1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, experiments conducted with TRIF-deficient macrophages clearly showed that the production of chemokines and IFN&#x003b2; induced by MVA was TLR3-independent in the present study. Taken together these observations demonstrate that TLRs may exert a two-sided role in poxvirus infections acting on the one hand as key initiators of the host anti-poxvirus defense response and on the other hand as important mediators of viral pathogenicity and tissue damage.</p><p>The other important intracellular innate immune sensor of microbial products and endogenous molecules is the NALP3 inflammasome that controls the processing and maturation of the cytokines IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-18 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000480-Petrilli1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Here we show that MVA is a potent activator of the NALP3 inflammasome and of IL-1&#x003b2; release by macrophages. IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-18 are key mediators of the host antimicrobial defense response and several lines of evidence suggest that these cytokines are likely to play an important role in host defenses against poxvirus infections. For example, the <italic>B15R</italic> gene of the vaccinia virus encodes an IL-1&#x003b2; decoy receptor blocking the activity of IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-18 and inactivation of <italic>B15R</italic> gene reduces the virulence of the vaccinia virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000480-Spriggs1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000480-TanakaKataoka1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, poxviruses release IL-18 binding proteins inhibiting IL-18 activity and vaccinia viruses <italic>A46R</italic>, <italic>A52R</italic>, <italic>N1L</italic> and, <italic>K1L</italic> gene products have been shown to disrupt the IL-1 receptor intracellular signaling pathway at multiple levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000480-Seet1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000480-Roy1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, we observed that MVA stimulated the release of large amounts of the IL-1 receptor antagonist by macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000480-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) adding further support to the view that IL-1 is an important target of the poxvirus antiviral escape strategy. Finally, consistent with the notion that the NALP3 inflammasome plays an important role in host defenses against poxviruses, several inhibitors of caspase-1 and ASC, like CrmA (cowpox virus), M13L-PYD (myxoma virus) and PYD-only (shope fibroma-virus) have been identified in the genomes of several poxviruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000480-Dorfleutner1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000480-Ray1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Crosstalks between TLRs and NLRs have been demonstrated to occur in the course of bacterial infections, such as between TLR5 and the IPAF inflammasome after exposure to flagellated bacteria or the flagellin protein itself <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000480-Franchi1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000480-Hayashi1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>. To the best of our knowledge, however, the present data provide the first demonstration of a crosstalk between the TLR and NLR pathways in the context of a viral infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000480-g010">Figure 10</xref>). While TLR2 and MyD88 were necessary to induce IL-1&#x003b2; mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000480-g008">Figure 8A</xref>), the NALP3 inflammasome was absolutely required for the processing of pro-IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-1&#x003b2; secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000480-g008">Figure 8B and C</xref>). Dual activation pathways coupling MVA recognition to IL-1&#x003b2; may provide the host with an increased capacity of fine tuning of its cytokine response.</p><p>In summary, the present data show that the TLR2-TLR6-MyD88, MDA-5-IPS-1 and NALP3 inflammasome pathways exert both specific and coordinated functions in the sensing of MVA infection and in the regulation of cytokine, chemokine and IFN&#x003b2; responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000480-g010">Figure 10</xref>). After the unfortunate failure of the adenovirus type 5 HIV vaccine STEP trial due to issues related to natural immunity against this virus, the attenuated MVA and NYVAC strains of poxvirus have become attractive vaccine vectors against HIV/AIDS. Arguments supporting the use of MVA and NYVAC as vaccine vectors include excellent immunogenicity and safety profiles and limited pre-existing immunity to poxvirus in the population at risk of HIV infection due to the abandon of vaccine campaigns after the eradication of smallpox in the 1970s. The present findings are therefore likely to provide important information relevant to the study of the pathogenesis of poxvirus infections, the understanding of antiviral escape mechanisms of poxvirus and may help to design new vaccine vectors with increased immunogenicity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All animal procedures were approved by the Office V&#x000e9;t&#x000e9;rinaire du Canton de Vaud (authorizations n&#x000b0; 876.5, 876.6, 877.5 and 877.6) and performed according to our institution guidelines for animal experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Mice</title><p>Eight to ten-week-old female BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (L'Arbresle, France) and were acclimatized for at least one week before experimentation.
