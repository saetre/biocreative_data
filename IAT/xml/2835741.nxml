Our findings show that the absence of STAT3 signaling in astrocytes leads to (i) increased production of superoxide anion and other reactive oxygen species and decreased level of glutathione, (ii) decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and decreased ATP production, and (iii) decreased rate of cell proliferation. Many of the differences observed in STAT3-CKO astrocytes were distinctly altered by exposure to rotenone, suggesting a role for complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain.

While astrogliogenesis resulted in normal astrocyte numbers and morphology in these mice, cellular response to injury was significantly altered. In addition to GFAP synthesis, nestin and vimentin were underexpressed and cells demonstrated impaired ability to regulate inflammation. These findings raised the possibility that intrinsic properties of STAT3-CKO astrocytes diminished their capacity to withstand stress and their ability to protect neurons. In this study we sought to determine the effects of STAT3 deletion on astroglial mitochondrial functions and on oxidative stress response and defense.</p><p>One established function of astrocytes is to limit the oxidative stress of ROS generation resulting from the high rate of neuronal oxygen consumption.

A common tool used for detection of ROS is the cell-permanent fluorescent probe DCF-DA which becomes oxidized and fluorogenic in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, OH&#x02022;, peroxinitrite and other oxidants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009532-Bass1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Using this method ROS was 23&#x00025; higher in STAT3-CKO cells compared with STAT3 &#x0002b;/&#x0002b; cells. This pattern was not observed in the absence of glucose and was strongly enhanced in the presence of 25 &#x000b5;M rotenone, suggesting differential sensitivity of complex I of the electron transport chain in the two cell types. However, DCF-DA fails to detect the superoxide anion. Using the probe, HE, which specifically detects superoxide anion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009532-Benov1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, we observed 66&#x00025; higher basal levels of superoxide production in STAT3-CKO cells. Rotenone increased superoxide production two-fold but attenuated the relative difference between STAT3 &#x0002b;/&#x0002b; and STAT3-CKO cells to 25&#x00025;, further suggesting that STAT3 may ultimately impact complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This STAT3-dependent difference in superoxide generation was also diminished with the uncoupling agent, FCCP, suggesting a dependence on the mitochondrial membrane potential gradient. One possible explanation for the elevation and O<sup>&#x02212;</sup><sub>2</sub> would be lower levels of superoxide dismutase in STAT3-CKO cells. STAT3 has been shown to up-regulate expression of MnSOD (SODII) in hepatocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009532-Terui1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, cardiomyocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009532-Negoro1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, and hippocampal neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009532-Guo1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. In support of this hypothesis, gene expression array studies suggested that there may be small decreases in mRNA for SOD enzymes in the STAT3-CKO cells.</p><p>Elevated levels of NADPH quinone dehydrogenase (7.6-fold), GSH peroxidase 7 (2.5-fold) and GSH synthetase (30&#x00025;) in STAT3-CKO cells are indicative of ARE promoter activation and chronic oxidative stress. However, several other genes normally associated with the ARE pathway such as hemoxygenase I and peroxiredoxin 6 were not elevated. Decreased expression of peroxiredoxins, metallothionein 2, and GSH reductase may be contributing factors to lower levels of reduced GSH and increased oxidative stress.</p><p>Numerous indicators of mitochondrial function were diminished in STAT3-CKO cells. Apparent mitochondrial mass, as revealed by MitoTracker Green, was lower by &#x0223c;15&#x00025;. Mitochondrial membrane potential and cellular ATP levels were also lower. These abnormalities suggested to us that mitochondria may play a contributing role to the elevation in ROS in STAT3-CKO cells. Evidence for this effect was provided by studies using MitoSOX Red. When normalized to mitochondrial mass, mitochondrial-specific ROS was 38&#x00025; higher in STAT3-CKO cells. Antimycin A potentiated the difference between STAT3 &#x0002b;/&#x0002b; and STAT3-CKO cells and produced an &#x0223c;6-fold greater stimulation of mitochondrial ROS than did rotenone.</p><p>Gene expression array studies also identified decreased expression of NDUFS4, a subunit of NADH dehydrogenase of complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Since complex I is a source of ROS generation, abnormal function of this site could account for both increased production of superoxide anion and diminished ATP production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009532-AdamVizi1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009532-Scacco1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Further evidence for a role of astrocyte STAT3 in mitochondrial function is provided by studies of cell energetics. Using JC-1, mitochondrial membrane potential was found to be 25&#x00025; lower in STAT3-CKO cells compared with STAT3 &#x0002b;/&#x0002b; cells. This mitochondrial effect was accompanied by a 10&#x00025; decrease in cellular ATP. The dissimilarity in membrane potential values was eliminated by rotenone exposure, as this agent did not change mitochondrial membrane potential in STAT3-CKO cells while lowering it by &#x0223c;25&#x00025; in STAT3 &#x0002b;/&#x0002b; cells. Antimycin A, however, caused a 70&#x00025; reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential in STAT3-CKO cells and had a more potent effect on ATP level and mitochondrial ROS generation relative to rotenone. These findings again suggested that the STAT3 effect on mitochondria was dependent on mitochondrial complex I function. Recent studies have identified a direct interaction between STAT3 and mitochondria in cells from heart and liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009532-Gough1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009532-Wegrzyn1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. This interaction appeared to be dependent on serine phosphorylation of STAT3 and independent of transcriptional activity of the STAT3 protein. Mitochondrial respiration was reduced via inhibition of activities of complexes I and II of the electron transport chain. Our present observations of increased superoxide generation and decreased mitochondrial function modified by rotenone in STAT3-CKO cells support this novel mechanism of STAT3 action in cortical astrocytes.</p><p>Results from studies using the Jak-2 kinase inhibitor, AG490, with enriched cortical astrocyte cell cultures confirmed the notion that prevention of STAT3 activation alters cellular function and compromises cell defense capabilities. Two-hr exposure to 25 &#x000b5;M AG490 suppressed basal and Il-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation and lowered astrocyte GSH levels, mitochondrial membrane potential and rate of cell proliferation. The magnitudes of these effects were similar to those observed when comparing astrocytes from STAT3-CKO and control STAT3 &#x0002b;/&#x0002b; mice. Unlike the STAT3-CKO model, wherein STAT3 activation was absent selectively in the astrocyte lineage throughout pre- and postnatal development, AG490-treated cells were acutely deprived of activated STAT3 for only two hr after many days of normal activity. Our results suggest that the duration of STAT3 inhibition in normal, unstressed cells was of little consequence for the effects on mitochondrial and cellular defense properties examined in this study.</p><p>The present studies identify several abnormalities in astrocytes lacking the STAT3 gene. Mitochondria displayed lower mass and were less efficient in maintaining their membrane potential and producing ATP. Elevated rates of superoxide generation in STAT3-CKO cells and loss of GSH are indicative of oxidative stress. Finally, lower rates of DNA synthesis and cell proliferation were observed. The decreased cell proliferation was not corrected by antioxidants and likely resulted from altered expression of cell cycle control and apoptosis regulatory genes. These defects would likely compromise the ability of astrocytes to promote gliosis and to protect neurons <xref ref-type="bibr"
