A variety of effects have been described for different cell types; hepatocyte lipid turnover pathways are inhibited during inflammation, whereas interleukin-1&#x003b2; (IL-1&#x003b2;) reduces intracellular cholesterol levels in fibroblasts. Levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1&#x003b2; and tumour necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;) are up-regulated at sites of formation of atherosclerotic plaques. Plaque formation is though to begin with infiltration of monocytes to the intimal layer of the vascular wall, followed by differentiation to macrophages and macrophage uptake of modified lipoproteins, resulting in accumulation of intracellular lipids. The lipid-filled cells are referred to as macrophage foam cells, a key feature of atherosclerotic plaques. We have investigated the effects of IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; on macrophage foam cells in order to assess whether presence of the pro-inflammatory cytokines improves or aggravates macrophage foam cell formation by affecting lipid accumulation and lipid turn-over in the cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Differentiated primary human macrophages or THP-1 cells were lipid loaded by uptake of aggregated low density lipoproteins (AgLDL) or very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), and then incubated with IL-1&#x003b2; (0 &#x02013; 5000 pg/ml) in lipoprotein-free media for 24 h. Cells incubated in absence of cytokine utilized accumulated neutral lipids, in particular triglycerides. Addition of exogenous IL-1&#x003b2; resulted in a dose-dependent retention of intracellular cholesterol and triglycerides. Exchanging IL-1&#x003b2; with TNF-&#x003b1; gave a similar response. Analysis of fatty acid efflux and intracellular fatty acid activation revealed a pattern of decreased lipid utilization in cytokine-stimulated cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; enhance macrophage foam cell formation, in part by inhibition of macrophage intracellular lipid catabolism.

A striking example is sepsis (endotoxinemia), which is correlated with severe hypertriglyceridemia. In cells such as hepatocytes, smooth muscle cells, and adipocytes several effects of endotoxins on intracellular lipid metabolism are identical to, or mediated by, effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1&#x003b2; (IL-1&#x003b2;) and tumour necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. These two cytokines are also present in atherosclerotic plaques, where it has been suggested that the cytokines mediate a constant low-grade inflammatory state. If they affect lipid metabolism in cells in the vascular wall in a similar manner as they affect peripheral tissues during acute phase response, such effects may contribute to atherosclerotic plaque development.</p><p>Macrophage foam cells are a characteristic feature of atherosclerotic plaques. During foam cell formation modified lipoproteins enters cells by receptor mediated uptake and excess neutral lipids are stored as lipid droplets, creating a typical foamy appearance. Oxidized forms of low density lipoproteins (LDL) are the modified lipoprotein usually considered causative during foam cell formation <italic>in vivo</italic>, but excessive uptake of other lipoproteins can also result in intracellular lipid accumulation and give macrophages a foamy appearance. We have previously described an <italic>in vitro </italic>model system for foam cell formation, where cells are lipid loaded by incubation with aggregated LDL (AgLDL) or very low density lipoproteins (VLDL). In this <italic>in vitro </italic>model system all cells incubated with AgLDL or VLDL have large numbers of intracellular lipid droplets, illustrating a model for macrophage foam cell formation with predominantly cholesterol ester or triglyceride rich lipid droplets, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>We hypothesised that IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; affect lipid turnover in macrophage foam cells, a mechanism not previously described for this cell type. After lipid loading, foam cells were treated with either cytokine, mimicking the <italic>in vivo </italic>situation where atherosclerosis development is propagated by both hyperlipidemia and inflammation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Intracellular lipid content of macrophage foam cells</title><p>Isolated primary human monocytes were differentiated to macrophages and lipid loaded by incubation with VLDL or AgLDL. Control cells were incubated for the same period of time in lipoprotein-free cell culture media. After incubation in presence or absence of lipoproteins all cells were rinsed with heparin in order to remove lipoproteins attached to the cell surface. Fresh cell culture media supplemented with 0&#x02013;5000 pg cytokine/ml was added to cells and the macrophages were incubated in this media for an additional 24 h. Cell viability was not affected by this treatment, as judged by two different assays performed both directly after lipoprotein lipid loading and after subsequent cytokine treatment.</p><p>Incubation of control macrophages and macrophage foam cells with IL-1&#x003b2; resulted in higher levels of intracellular lipids in cytokine treated cells, in a cytokine dose-dependent manner. Effects were most pronounced in cells lipid loaded by incubation with VLDL before cytokine treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>).

In this cell type TNF-&#x003b1; displayed a strong and significant effect on intracellular lipid levels in lipid loaded cells as well as in control cells. Exposure to the cytokine resulted in high levels of intracellular triglyceride and total cholesterol regardless of lipid loading before cytokine treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).

In virtually all eukaryotic cells intracellular lipid will accumulate in lipid droplets when lipoprotein lipid uptake exceeds lipid degradation and efflux. In atherosclerotic plaques, macrophage foam cell lipid droplets mainly accumulate cholesterol ester [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Pro-inflammatory cytokines have earlier been reported to increase intracellular cholesterol levels in some cell types; IL-1&#x003b2; increases cholesterol accumulation in mesengial cells by up-regulation of scavenger receptors, by dysregulation of the LDL receptor, and by inhibition of cholesterol efflux mediated by the ATP binding cassette transporter protein A1 (ABC-A1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Cytokines have also been reported to affect macrophage lipid efflux in mouse J774 cells, where IL-1&#x003b2; or TNF-&#x003b1; both decrease mRNA and protein levels of ABC-A1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>It is clear from our experiments that when THP-1 cells were lipid loaded by incubation with lipoproteins and then incubated in cytokine free media, the cells utilized stored lipids (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>: the "0" points for individual dose-response curves compared to respective intracellular lipid value before incubation with IL-1&#x003b2;). Cytokine treatment after lipoprotein lipid loading resulted in dose-dependent retention of intracellular lipid. The results suggest that increased cellular lipid content after incubation with the pro-inflammatory cytokine is the result of decreased intracellular lipid catabolism and/or efflux. However, we cannot exclude that lipid content of cells after cytokine treatment in part also may reflect affected lipid synthesis. Such directs effects on lipid synthesis have been reported for adipocytes, where TNF-&#x003b1; decreases <italic>de novo </italic>fatty acid synthesis, whereas IL-1&#x003b2; increases it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Macrophage foam cells lack pathways for cholesterol degradation; excess lipid can only be removed from cells via reverse cholesterol transport pathways. Excess cholesterol is removed from macrophage foam cells as oxysterols, via efflux to extra-cellular acceptor particles, or via endogenous production of apoE leading to formation of LpE particles that mediate cholesterol removal from human monocyte-derived macrophages in absence of serum or exogenous acceptor particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Cytokine treatment may directly affect apoE production; long-term (3 days) treatment with TNF-&#x003b1; stimulates human monocyte (but not macrophage) apoE mRNA expression and protein levels <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This effect may be species-specific, as 2 days of incubation with TNF-&#x003b1; or IL-1&#x003b2; decreased <italic>de novo </italic>synthesis of apoE secretion in mouse peritoneal macrophages to approximately half of the level in control cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Neither cytokine exerted any consistent effect on apoE secretion from control or lipid-filled cells. Our experiments were performed in absence of extra-cellular acceptor particles, as we aimed to analyze cytokine effects on endogenous macrophage lipid efflux pathways only. Additional experiments using the same model systems as above in presence of exogenous apoA-I or HDL particles will shed further light on whether cytokine treatment also affect lipid efflux pathways involving ABC transporters.</p><p>Treatment of macrophage foam cells with IL-1&#x003b2; or TNF-&#x003b1; may decrease overall foam cell lipid efflux capacity, although our data on efflux of labelled fatty acids did not demonstrate cytokine effects strong enough to account for the entire effect on intracellular lipid retention. TNF-&#x003b1; (but not IL-1&#x003b2;) decreased efflux of labelled fatty acid from cells, and both cytokines showed trends towards increasing the amount of fatty acid label retained in the intracellular triglyceride fraction after lipid loading and cytokine treatment. These data indicate that cytokine treatment may impede foam cell lipid droplet turnover.</p><p>An interesting observation is that regardless of method of lipid loading cytokine effects on neutral lipid turnover appeared to be stronger or more pronounced for triglycerides than for cholesterol ester. Foam cell lipid droplet turnover of triglycerides has been reported to be three to four times faster than that of cholesterol esters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. It is likely that the effects of IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; are partially mediated by cytokine effects on enzymatic activity of acyl-CoA synthetase, a key point for fatty acid oxidation but also for fatty acid esterification and storage in triglycerides, cholesterol ester, and phospholipids. Enzymatic activity depends not only on protein levels or substrate availability but also on intracellular location, as the same enzyme activates fatty acids for catabolic &#x003b2;-oxidation in mitochondria as for anabolic esterification on the endoplasmic reticulum. For that reason, we chose to analyze acyl-CoA synthetase activity in different subcellular fractions rather than in whole cell homogenates.</p><p>It has to be pointed out that Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> illustrates ACS enzyme activity during five minutes of incubation only. The short incubation time of the ACS assay is necessary for a linear dose response ratio between enzyme activity and production of labelled product. The effects of IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; on total intracellular triglyceride and cholesterol content illustrated in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> are the result of incubations with respective cytokine for 24 h. Therefore, although the cytokine effect on ACS activity during short term incubation is minor, it is likely that the combined decrease in activation of fatty acids for subsequent &#x003b2;-oxidation and increase in activation of fatty acids for esterification will result in major accumulation of intracellular lipids over time.</p><p>It can be argued that cytokine concentrations used in our experiments are high compared to what is found <italic>in vivo</italic>. Serum concentrations of IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; are typically in the low pg/ml range, with increases in serum concentrations found in post-infarction and diabetic patient (values ranging between 10&#x02013;25 pg/ml). It is well documented that IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; expression is strongly increased in atherosclerotic plaques compared with surrounding tissues, but this is typically analyzed with immunohistochemical methods or with PCR analysis of mRNA expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Attempts have been made to analyze plaque cytokine production directly, such as analyses of TNF-&#x003b1; secretion in endotoxin-stimulated culture of explanted human atherosclerotic plaque tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], with final cytokine concentration in conditioned media reaching 200 pg/ml. It is likely that concentrations of cytokines in the vicinity of cells in atherosclerotic plaques are several degrees of magnitude higher than serum concentrations or concentrations in tissue culture, making the higher concentrations used in the current experiment possible <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data suggests that IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; may share a previously unknown effect on macrophage foam cells, resulting in retention of neutral lipids by a combination of decreased lipid efflux, decreased &#x003b2;-oxidation substrate availability, and stimulated fatty acid esterification. If such mechanisms are active <italic>in vivo</italic>, the high neutral lipid content of cytokine-treated cells may contribute to atherosclerotic development and even accelerate development of unstable lipid-rich atherosclerotic plaques.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Lipoprotein isolation</title><p>Lipoproteins were prepared by differential ultra centrifugation of fresh plasma from healthy donors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].

Labelled fatty acid ([9,10(n)-<sup>3</sup>H]-oleate in ethanol, 1 &#x003bc;Ci/sample) was added either to lipoproteins before addition to cells, or directly to plates of control cells incubated in absence of lipoproteins. Control experiments demonstrated that the lipid label mainly resided in triglyceride, cholesterol ester, and phosphatidyl choline fractions of cells after initial lipoprotein uptake and fatty acid labelling of cells, with only low levels of label recovered in the intracellular FFA fraction. After labelling, cells were rinsed with a heparin solution (20 IU/ml in PBS) and incubated for an additional 24 h in fresh serum, lipoprotein, and PMA free media in presence of 0&#x02013;5000 pg IL-1&#x003b2; or TNF-&#x003b1;/ml. Efflux of labelled fatty acids and fatty acid degradation products to conditioned media was analyzed by liquid scintillation counting after centrifugation for 5 min at 1000 rpm (to remove floating cells and cell debris). At termination of experiments, cells were rinsed with the heparin solution and cell lipids extracted as described above. Lipid extracts were separated in polar and neutral lipid classes by high performance thin layer chromatography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].
