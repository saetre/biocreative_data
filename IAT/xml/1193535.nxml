Here we have employed microarray analysis to study the temporal activity of developmentally regulated genes during zebrafish embryogenesis. Transcriptome analysis at 12 different embryonic time points covering five different developmental stages (maternal, blastula, gastrula, segmentation, and pharyngula) revealed a highly dynamic transcriptional profile. Hierarchical clustering, stage-specific clustering, and algorithms to detect onset and peak of gene expression revealed clearly demarcated transcript clusters with maximum gene activity at distinct developmental stages as well as co-regulated expression of gene groups involved in dedicated functions such as organogenesis. Our study also revealed a previously unidentified cohort of genes that are transcribed prior to the mid-blastula transition, a time point earlier than when the zygotic genome was traditionally thought to become active. Here we provide, for the first time to our knowledge, a comprehensive list of developmentally regulated zebrafish genes and their expression profiles during embryogenesis, including novel information on the temporal expression of several thousand previously uncharacterized genes.

They determined that developmentally regulated genes in zebrafish could be grouped based upon their time of transcript accumulation onset (activation) and their peak of activity (peak accumulation). For example, genes encoding transcriptional regulators are activated en masse earlier than the target genes that they control. Thus, the developmental gene expression profile in zebrafish can be grouped into successive waves of gene activation followed by peak activity. One very novel group of genes that was discovered in this study is a set of about 100 genes that are activated even earlier than what was previously thought to be the earliest time of embryonic transcriptional activation. These genes are likely to be important for preparing the embryonic cells for subsequent high-level genome activation and normal development.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>Citation:</meta-name><meta-value>Mathavan S, Lee SGP, Mak A, Miller LD, Murthy KRK, et al.

The zebrafish database contains more than 400,000 ESTs grouped into about 18,000 clusters, but only a few thousand ESTs have been analyzed by whole embryo in-situ hybridization (WISH) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://zfin.org">http://zfin.org</ext-link>). Systematic analysis of the temporal expression of the ESTs by WISH may take several more years to complete. A high-throughput expression genomics approach would provide complementary information to the single-gene approaches currently under way. Microarrays are currently the strongest technology platform for large-scale analysis of gene expression profiles during embryogenesis. They provide an opportunity to simultaneously monitor the expression of thousands of genes at various developmental stages, thus providing an opportunity to analyze temporal and spatial patterns of gene expression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b23">23</xref>&#x0005d;.

In contrast, a high-density microarray for genome-wide gene expression (transcriptome) analysis has not previously been attempted for zebrafish. In the present study, we used high-density oligonucleotide microarrays containing 16,416 genes to map the transcriptome profiles at 12 different developmental time points (from unfertilized eggs to the hatching stage). RNA was collected at closely spaced time points during blastula and gastrula stages&#x02014;the dynamic development stages&#x02014;and thus provides a dense coverage and a comprehensive analysis of the expression patterns of developmentally regulated genes during embryogenesis.</p><p>Traditionally, it is believed that the zygotic genome becomes active at the mid-blastula transition (MBT) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b30">30</xref>&#x0005d;.

We speculated that there might be a subset of genes activated with regards to transcript accumulation prior to MBT that in turn could play a subsequent role in genome-wide transcriptional activation but had escaped detection owing to their low numbers relative to the entire genome. To test our speculation, we made a systematic analysis of gene expression profiles preceding MBT, which revealed for the first time to our knowledge a striking cohort of genes that actively increase transcript levels prior to MBT. These new data form the starting point for determining the role of these genes in the control of zebrafish genome activation and embryogenesis. To make the data we have generated here easily available to the public, we have created a GIS-sponsored Web site (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://giscompute.gis.a-star.edu.sg/~govind/zebrafish/index.html">http://giscompute.gis.a-star.edu.sg/~govind/zebrafish/index.html</ext-link>) that includes annotation data and all expression data for all the genes in the zebrafish microarray.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Validation of Zebrafish Microarray Data</title><p>The microarray data obtained in this work were validated using the following criteria: Firstly, 172 copies of the beta-actin gene were printed on the oligonucleotide array as calibration spots. Biological and experimental replicates of array hybridizations showed that, at the selected time points, the signals of all the beta-actin calibration spots were identical (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010029-sf01">Figure S1</xref>), indicating the reproducibility and reliability of the array data. Secondly, candidate genes with known expression patterns were compared with the array-derived expression patterns, and the patterns were found to be similar to one another (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010029-st01">Table S1</xref>). In addition, real-time PCR analysis was performed for two genes <italic>(beta-actin</italic> and <italic>myosin light chain, mlc2f)</italic> at all selected time points. The quantity of transcripts detected could not be compared because of different methods of estimations. However, the pattern of transcript abundance detected for these genes in the array and in real-time PCR showed nearly identical expression profiles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010029-sf02">Figure S2</xref>). Further, expression data of ribosomal protein (RP) genes of zebrafish obtained from the arrays showed temporally coordinated expression (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">results</xref> section of RP gene expression). In order to confirm the array data, a Northern blot analysis was performed for selected genes <italic>(rpl7a-, rps3a-, rps12-,</italic> and <italic>rps10-)</italic> using the RNA samples collected at 14 different time points during embryogenesis. The pattern of expression of RP genes obtained in the array and Northern blot were essentially identical, validating the array data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010029-sf03">Figure S3</xref>A). Intensity of hybridization of RP genes in the Northern blot were digitized and measured. Using the digitized data, the pattern of transcript accumulation was compared with array data, and the pattern of expression was similar in both the experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010029-sf03">Figure S3</xref>B).

For example, the company database gives a description based on GO terms for about 1,152 probes, and the remaining are indicated as &#x0201c;GO unknown.&#x0201d; From our recent annotation, we have found GO terms for more than twice those reported by the company. We made critical analysis of the clones and identified the duplicates to determine the actual number of non-redundant clones in the array. The array represented 16,416 GenBank entries. Of this, 16,177 probes had non-redundant GenBank entries and the rest of the 239 GenBank entries were duplicated (including 171 copies of beta-actin) in the array. We mapped the non-redundant GenBank entries to the zebrafish UniGene database (UniGene build 79) and found that 2,751 GenBank entries did not have UniGene IDs and the rest of the 13,426 entries matched to UniGenes. Of these clones with UniGene entries, 12,153 clones were non-redundant, while the rest (1,273 UniGenes) were duplicates. On the whole, the probes in the array represented 14,904 non-redundant genes (12,153 non-redundant UniGene IDs plus 2,751 non-redundant GenBank entries). We have included here the most recent putative annotations for the clones in the array by obtaining the annotations from various database sources. The annotations can be obtained from our institute resource Web site (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://giscompute.gis.a-star.edu.sg/~govind/zebrafish/index.html">http://giscompute.gis.a-star.edu.sg/~govind/zebrafish/index.html</ext-link>). We have also included examples of annotations in the Datasets.

High-resolution time-course expression data were generated during embryogenesis. Considering the sensitivity of the array data and the number of replicates of each sample, it is very likely that most of the polyadenylated transcripts were detected for the genes represented in the array for each time point. Total RNA was extracted at 12 different developmental time points (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref> for details), and for each time point analysis two to three independent biological replicates were made. Reference RNA was prepared by pooling equal concentration of total RNA from various embryonic stages and also adult male and female fish. The intensity of value of each spot and each side was normalized using the intensity-based log ratio median method &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b32">32</xref>&#x0005d;. Differentially expressed genes were selected using modified t-statistic (SAM) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b33">33</xref>&#x0005d; with 15&#x00025; of the standard deviation percentile as the fudge constant and log2 ratios. Stage-specific genes were selected following paired <italic>t</italic>-test (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref> for details). By this procedure, we have identified 3,657 genes that showed significant levels of differential expression with a single peak during the course of development. This subset of developmentally regulated genes was used for further analysis of gene activity during embryogenesis. For the benefit of other scientists, the entire dataset generated from this study has been placed in our institute resource database, which can be accessed at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://giscompute.gis.a-star.edu.sg/~govind/zebrafish/data_download.html">http://giscompute.gis.a-star.edu.sg/~govind/zebrafish/data&#x0005f;download.html</ext-link>.</p><p>Hierarchical clustering of 3,657 genes demonstrated diverse temporal expression profiles during zebrafish embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010029-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010029-sd01">Dataset S1</xref>). The complexity of the gene cluster clearly displayed the significant modulations in the temporal activity of developmentally regulated genes. The cluster also revealed the identical expression profile of all the copies of beta-actin genes. Of the 3,657 genes extracted for the analysis, 622 genes showed a maximum level of transcript accumulation at the maternal stage (unfertilized egg), and the rest of the 3,035 genes showed an onset and peak of transcript abundance during one or more stages of embryonic development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010029-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Differential Degradation of Maternally Loaded Gene Transcripts</title><p>The dataset of 622 gene transcripts displaying maximum abundance at the unfertilized egg stage (maternally loaded transcripts; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010029-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010029-sd02">Dataset S2</xref>) was divided into three groups based on the pattern of transcript degradation. The first group represented 221 genes, and the transcripts of these genes persisted only at the unfertilized egg stage and were degraded prior to the commencement of the blastula stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010029-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, line a). This group contained the known maternal genes (examples are those encoding proteins of the zona pellucida, <italic>zp2, zp2.4,</italic> and <italic>zp3</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b34">34</xref>&#x0005d;) and the chorion protein component. A number of genes with putative annotations also displayed an expression pattern identical to previously characterized maternal genes, suggesting a possible maternal function. The clones with putative annotation of rhamnose-binding lectins (STL) of other fish are included in this group of genes. This family of lectins is expressed in the ovary and egg of the steelhead trout <italic>(Oncorhynchus mykiss).</italic> Furthermore, a few members of the lectin family (STL2 and STL3) were found to be abundant in the ovary and the levels dramatically decreased after fertilization &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b36">36</xref>&#x0005d;, indicating the maternal specificity of this gene. We have identified here, for the first time to our knowledge, a large number of previously uncharacterized genes and ESTs that appear to have maternal-specific activity. The maternal function of these clones and their control of zygotic genome activation will be an important area for future investigations.</p><p>The second group of transcripts (259 genes) persisted to a greater extent during maternal and blastula stages and subsequently degraded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010029-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, line b). These genes may be involved in cleavage and other early embryonic functions. One example is the maternally derived gene <italic>cyclin B1,</italic> which is expressed up to the early blastula stage. It is known that zebrafish embryos undergo synchronous cell divisions during the cleavage stage prior to their entry into the MBT &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b30">30</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>cyclin B1</italic> has been shown to be involved in the synchronous cell division phase &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b37">37</xref>&#x0005d;, consistent with its maximum activity during these stages. Similar to <italic>cyclin B1,</italic> there are a number of genes that display activity at maternal and early zygotic stages. The gene transcripts that persisted during the blastula stage are involved, in one way or the other, in early developmental functions. Some of the genes functionally relevant during maternal and blastula stages are given here as examples: <italic>calreticulin</italic> (a chaperone involved in folding of newly synthesized glycoproteins), <italic>catalase</italic> (catalytic functions in cell growth), <italic>birc5b/survivin2</italic> (cell death regulator), <italic>mcl1a</italic> (cellular apoptosis function), <italic>claudin-like gene</italic> (tight junction function during growth), <italic>lmnl3 (maternal lamin L3),</italic> oocyte and blastula nucleoskeletal proteins of the nuclear membrane during cell division. These gene transcripts are degraded slowly (by the end of the blastula stage). The third group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010029-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, line c) had 142 genes with a maximum level of transcripts at the maternal stage; this group of genes underwent a very slow rate of transcript degradation. Some of the transcripts persisted up to the segmentation stage, and the average performance of this group is presented.</p><p>These observations revealed that the maternally deposited gene transcripts are not degraded at the same rate and there is a definite gene-specific differential degradation. The differential degradation and the extended stability of specific maternal genes implicated a potential relevance of these genes in later zygotic stages. It is known that after fertilization the earliest developmental processes in the egg are programmed by maternally deposited gene transcripts &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b38">38</xref>&#x0005d;. Subsequently, embryos initiate zygotic genome activation for the continuation of embryonic development. The maternal control of zebrafish development before and after MBT has recently been reported following extensive analysis of maternal mutants &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b02">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b03">3</xref>&#x0005d;. These authors showed that mutations in some of the maternal genes have generated embryos with defects in zygotic gene functions and developmental alterations during pre-MBT, MBT, and also beyond these stages. In this study, we have identified maternal stage-specific expression for a number of previously uncharacterized ESTs, which may play a vital role in modulating normal development. It has been reported in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that maternal RNA is degraded during the course of early development either by maternally derived factors (to degrade transient transcripts) or zygotically derived factors (to degrade moderately stable transcripts), and that the combined action of maternal and zygotic factors is required to degrade the highly stable maternal transcripts &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b42">42</xref>&#x0005d;.

Though these genes commenced transcript accumulation at the blastula stage, a subset of these genes showed expression peaks at subsequent stages of development. It was also observed that 15.7&#x00025; (477genes), 15.1&#x00025; (460 genes), and 4.4 &#x00025; (131 genes) of the zygotic genes began their onset of transcript accumulation at gastrula, segmentation, and pharyngula stages, respectively. Average performance of the genes in these groups is presented as a clustergram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010029-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010029-sd03">Datasets S3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010029-sd12">S12</xref>). Onset of temporally expressing genes aligns with their required developmental functions. For example, some of the genes exhibiting early transcript accumulation are those involved in early developmental functions such as the cell cycle <italic>(cyclins),</italic> cell regulation and cell adhesion <italic>(claudins, connexins),</italic> embryonic apoptotic functions <italic>(survivins),</italic> transcriptional regulation <italic>(smad, pou, sox, wnt),</italic> and other early developmental processes. The genes that began transcription during later stages of development (segmentation and pharyngula) are related more to organogenesis and encode, to a large extent, structural proteins (e.g., collagens, pro-collagens, skeletal muscle proteins, selenoproteins, ceruloplasmin).</p><p>Embryonic development in zebrafish (from fertilization to hatching) extends for 48 h. Within the first 5 h post-fertilization (hpf), cleavage and blastula are completed, and the process of gastrulation takes another 5 h. Thus, within 10 hpf (which is equal to about 21&#x00025; of the total embryonic period), the early developmental processes are completed. Segmentation and pharyngula stages are completed in about 14 and 24 h, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010029-g002">Figure 2</xref>G). About 80.5&#x00025; of the zygotic genes initiated their transcript accumulation during the blastula (64.8&#x00025;) and gastrula (15.7&#x00025;) stages. Considering the peak of expression of zygotic genes, about 53&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010029-g002">Figure 2</xref>F) of the genes attained their peak during blastula and gastrula stages. Such high level of activity occurred within about 21&#x00025; of the developmental period. Cumulative analysis of onset and peak of expression showed a sigmoid pattern: the onset of transcript accumulation sharply increased, displaying about 99&#x00025; of the activity by 12 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010029-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Similarly, most of the developmentally regulated genes attained their peak by about 24 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010029-g002">Figure 2</xref>C insert). Analysis of the frequency of distribution indicated the dominance of transcriptome dynamics during blastula and gastrula stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010029-g002">Figure 2</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010029-g002">2</xref>E). It is interesting that such a high percentage of genes would be activated within the relatively short window of the developmental period.</p><p>To obtain an overview of embryonic gene expression, we sought to specifically address the temporal expression patterns in the following developmental stages: (1) maternal (unfertilized eggs); (2) blastula; (3) gastrula; (4) segmentation; and (5) pharyngula/hatching stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010029-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). From the expression data, we selected the genes that showed peak of activity at each stage and presented the data in clustergrams (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010029-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). The average performance of the genes in each developmental stage is also graphically presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010029-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). This analysis illustrates that different set of genes have peaks of expression at different developmental stages suggestive of their relevance for stage-specific developmental functions. Intriguingly, the clusters of the developmentally regulated genes grouped into specific or adjacent clusters, forming a wave of gene activity moving from maternal to blastula and through each subsequent stage of embryogenesis. The clustering of developmentally related genes indicated that the process of embryogenesis is continuously regulated and displayed dynamic gene activity that, in turn, directs the evolving program of development.</p><p>The following observations can be made from this analysis. Of the total number of 3,657 genes analyzed, 622 genes (17&#x00025;; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010029-sd13">Dataset S13</xref>) showed maximum activity at the maternal stage. Of the remaining 3,035 (zygotic) genes, 609 (16.6&#x00025;), 1,006 (27.5&#x00025;), 688 (18.9&#x00025;), and 732 (20.0&#x00025;) genes showed maximum transcript levels at blastula (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010029-sd14">Dataset S14</xref>), gastrula (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010029-sd15">Dataset S15</xref>), segmentation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010029-sd16">Dataset S16</xref>), and pharyngula (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010029-sd17">Dataset S17</xref>) stages, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010029-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). Analysis of our results indicated that some of the genes have short spans of activity while others have extended periods of expression, suggestive of functional requirements. As an example, we analyzed the array data and found abundant transcripts for <italic>birc5b (baculoviral IAP repeat-containing 5B,</italic> also called <italic>survivin2)</italic> and cell-death regulator <italic>mcl1a (myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1a)</italic> up to the blastula stage. These gene families have been implicated in anti-apoptotic functions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b47">47</xref>&#x0005d;. It has also been shown that <italic>survivin</italic> is abundantly expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> during oogenesis and early embryogenesis functioning as an inhibitor of apoptosis and a positive regulator of the cell cycle &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b48">48</xref>&#x0005d;. The transcript abundance of <italic>birc5b</italic> and <italic>mcl1a,</italic> negative regulators of apoptosis, during maternal/blastula stages, indicated the importance of regulating apoptotic process during early embryonic development. It has been reported that embryonic apoptosis is activated in the zebrafish during the gastrula stage, and it is most likely that down-regulation of the maternally derived negative regulators may activate the embryonic apoptotic process in zebrafish during the gastrula stage &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b49">49</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Genes displaying a peak of expression during the pharyngula stage continued their expression beyond the pharyngula stage, suggesting a functional requirement for these genes during embryonic and post-embryonic stages of development. For example, <italic>ceruloplasmin (cp),</italic> which has been implicated in liver development &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b50">50</xref>&#x0005d;, displayed maximum expression during the pharyngula stage. Expression of this gene did not terminate at the end of the pharyngula stage, suggesting that its continued expression during post-embryonic stages could be playing a role in liver function. The genes that displayed similar expression are involved in parallel embryonic and post-embryonic developmental processes. For example, muscle-specific genes and collagens also show similar patterns of expression, as they are involved in the progressive formation of muscles and skeletal development in zebrafish. It is known that almost all the primordial processes of organogenesis commence at gastrulation and continue during segmentation and post-segmentation stages. Thus, an overview of genome-wide expression analysis demonstrated a temporally demarked expression pattern of developmentally regulated genes and showed that the gene activities were well correlated with the developmental events at the respective stages. Prior to our analysis, only 7&#x00025; of the differentially expressed genes were fully annotated (with GO), and temporal expression patterns for the majority of the clones in the array were not established. Our analysis, for the first time to our knowledge, identified the temporal patterns of expression for about 80&#x00025;&#x02013;90&#x00025; of the clones, and for most of them the patterns of expression are presented here for the first time, to our knowledge.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Transcription Analysis of Selected Clusters of Functionally Related Genes</title><p>From the array data, expression patterns of a number of functionally related genes could be identified based on their GO and/or putative functions. However, we selected three groups of genes involved in (1) cell cycle, (2) ubiquitin functions (ubiquitins and proteasomes), and (3) somitogenesis as examples and discuss here the expression patterns of these genes in relation to their biological significance.</p><sec id="s2f1"><title>Cell cycle.</title><p>Expression of cell cycle related genes encoding cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases were analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010029-g004">Figure 4</xref>A; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010029-sd18">Dataset S18</xref>). Most of the <italic>cyclin</italic> genes involved in the cell cycle commenced their expression maternally, maintained expression through the blastula stage, and were subsequently down-regulated. The down-regulation of maternally derived cyclin transcripts was shown to be regulated by zygotically derived factors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b51">51</xref>&#x0005d;. From the array data, it is clear that <italic>cyclinD1</italic> alone commenced expression zygotically (at the blastula stage) and exhibited its peak after MBT, an observation that is in agreement with the earlier analysis of <italic>cyclinD1</italic> gene transcription &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b52">52</xref>&#x0005d;.

In contrast to <italic>cyclinD1,</italic> the maximum level of <italic>cyclinB1</italic> and <italic>cyclinE</italic> transcripts were observed during the phase of synchronous cell divisions consisting of S and M phases (prior to MBT) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b53">53</xref>&#x0005d;. However, the continued presence of transcripts of <italic>cyclinE</italic> during asynchronous cell divisions and post-MBT development indicated that the expression profiles differ from the transcripts of <italic>cyclinB1</italic>. Cyclin-dependent kinases, their regulatory subunits, activators, and associated proteins showed almost continuous transcript abundance with a maximum during blastula, gastrula, and segmentation stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010029-g004">Figure 4</xref>A), indicating their continuous involvement in the regulation of one or other cyclin genes during the cell cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s2f2"><title>Ubiquitins and proteasomes.</title><p>Genes involved in protein degradation by ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic function displayed low levels of transcripts during early development (up to the blastula stage).

Most of the genes encoding the proteasome subunits are involved in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010029-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and regulation of cell differentiation through the <italic>notch</italic> signaling pathway has been described previously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b54">54</xref>&#x0005d;.

We have taken somitogenesis as an example and analyzed a subset of genes involved in this process. Broadly, somitogenesis can be divided into an early phase where the paraxial mesoderm is subdivided in a rostrocaudal pattern into blocks of cells called somites and a subsequent phase of cell differentiation within the somites where somatic cells acquire a variety of distinct dorsoventral and mediolateral fates. In zebrafish, the dorsolateral somitic mesodermal cells contribute to muscle development. Consistent with this, most of the muscle-specific protein (MSP) genes commenced expression during early somitogenesis, and they steadily increased their transcript abundance in positive correlation with somite formation. From the array expression data, the transcripts for MSP genes were first detected around 11 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010029-g004">Figure 4</xref>D; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010029-sd20">Dataset S20</xref>), and, subsequently, their transcript levels increased in accordance with the progress of somitogenesis. We compared the expression of selected MSP genes from arrays with Northern blot analysis of the same genes reported earlier &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b56">56</xref>&#x0005d;, and the results were identical. Therefore, array analysis faithfully recapitulated the data obtained from single gene analysis (Northern or WISH).</p><p>Distinct classes of genes encoding transcriptional regulators are expressed dynamically during somitogenesis in all vertebrates and precede the onset of MSP gene expression. The activities of members of the bHLH transcription factors, namely <italic>hairy (h), Enhancer of split (E spl),</italic> and <italic>hairy-related,</italic> have been shown to play critical roles during somitogenesis in vertebrates. Analysis of the zebrafish bHLH family of <italic>h/E (spl)-</italic>related genes has shown the involvement of <italic>hairy related 9 (her9-)</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b57">57</xref>&#x0005d;, <italic>her1-, her4-, her6-,</italic> and <italic>her7-</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b59">59</xref>&#x0005d; in somitogenesis. Our array data clearly revealed that most of these transcription factors (<italic>mespa-, mespb-, mef2a-, mef2c-, mef2d-, foxc1a,</italic> and a number of <italic>her</italic> genes) commenced their expression prior to the onset of muscle-specific gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010029-g004">Figure 4</xref>E). These results revealed that global analysis of gene expression using microarrays could detect a cascade of gene activity involved in somitogenesis in the zebrafish. Similar analyses could be extended to explore the expression patterns of genes involved in other organ systems.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>RP Genes Are Coordinately Expressed during Zebrafish Embryogenesis</title><p>From the array expression data, 35 RP genes of zebrafish (similar to known RP genes) showed temporally coordinated expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010029-g004">Figure 4</xref>F; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010029-sd21">Dataset S21</xref>). From the clustergram, it is evident that the level of transcripts of almost all the RP genes changed in concert except for a few, which differed slightly in their expression profile. On average, the onset of RP gene transcript accumulation commenced at the blastula stage and the expression increased continuously. Assembly of ribosomes requires coordinated expression of genes coding for their structural components, and are represented by several rRNA molecules and about 80 RPs. In eukaryotes, genes encoding rRNA and 5S RNA are amplified and presented by multiple copies, whereas the genes for RPs are present in only one or two copies per haploid genome. It has been reported that after fertilization and during the period of synchronous cell division, no transcripts were detected for zygotic genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b60">60</xref>&#x0005d;. This transcriptional block is terminated at MBT in concert with desynchronization of the cell cycle. It was shown that transcripts for some of the RPs <italic>(rps3, rpl17,</italic> and <italic>rpl31)</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b61">61</xref>&#x0005d; and <italic>rps24</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b62">62</xref>&#x0005d; were detected at the early blastula stage prior to the detection of new zygotic transcripts in the sea urchin, suggesting their maternal origin. Published data on the expression of fish RP genes have not presented a comprehensive view &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b64">64</xref>&#x0005d;. However, our results presented here indicate that almost all the RP genes were coordinately expressed in a global and continuous fashion from the onset (beginning of MBT) to hatching.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Accumulation of Gene Transcripts Do Occur prior to the MBT in Zebrafish</title><p>Gene expression patterns during early development (pre-MBT and post-MBT stages) were studied by looking at the profiles of expression at selected time points during early cleavage and post-cleavage stages. The expression data obtained during these stages were selected following the statistical method described in the Materials and Methods section. Groups of genes showing distinct expression patterns were clustered based on the onset of transcript accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010029-g005">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010029-sd23">Dataset S23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010029-sd25">S25</xref>). Four distinct expression patterns were recorded. The first cluster represented maternally loaded transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010029-sd22">Dataset S22</xref>), and almost all the transcripts in this cluster degraded rapidly prior to blastula (4 hpf). Cluster 3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010029-sd24">Dataset S24</xref>) and Cluster 4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010029-sd25">Dataset S25</xref>) represented the expression of zygotic genes commencing the transcript accumulation after MBT stage (blastula and gastrula). This pattern of expression is in accordance with the pattern described earlier &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b30">30</xref>&#x0005d;. Cluster 2 contained a cohort of genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010029-sd23">Dataset S23</xref>) that commenced transcript accumulation prior to the onset of MBT. This expression pattern is a new discovery, demonstrating pre-MBT accumulation of zygotic transcripts. As transcript accumulation can take place only in the presence of gene transcription, these genes represent a group of pre-MBT transcribed genes. From a total of 16,416 genes analyzed in the array, 125 genes showed evidence for pre-MBT transcript accumulation. These genes did not show transcript accumulation during the one-cell, four-cell, and eight-cell stages; however, transcripts for this subset of 125 genes increased from the 64-/128-cell stage onwards. This pattern of pre-MBT zygotic gene expression has not been previously reported in zebrafish. We were the first to detect transcript accumulation at these early cleavage stages, owing to the unbiased and global nature of high-density microarrays.</p><p>Since these novel gene transcripts were the earliest activated in zebrafish development, they are likely to be involved in specific early embryonic functions and possibly in subsequent genome-wide activation. We analyzed several of the genes in this cluster based on the predicted putative functions, which are as follows. Several proteasome subunits in this cluster are known to be involved in protein degradation by the ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic pathway &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b55">55</xref>&#x0005d;. The proteasomes may be required at this stage for the proteolytic degradation of maternal gene products. A number of proteasome subunits have been shown to be functional in the proliferating ARPE19 retinal pigment epithelium cells. Since the cleavage stage is similar to the proliferating cells stage, it is reasonable to find the proteasome transcripts at this stage. This cluster also contains the putative gene for ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, and it is known that ubiquitin conjugating enzymes mediate ubiquitination and degradation of specific substrates by the ubiquitin-dependent degradation pathway &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b65">65</xref>&#x0005d;. This enzyme has also been shown to promote cyclin proteolysis during mitosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b66">66</xref>&#x0005d;. We have reported in the present study that transcript levels of cyclins involved in cell cycle regulation <italic>(cyclin A2, cyclin B, cyclin B1, cyclin E)</italic> are highly abundant in unfertilized eggs and during cleavage stages &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b53">53</xref>&#x0005d;. For the degradation of these gene products, proteasomes and ubiquitin conjugating enzyme may be required at the synchronous cell cycles stage (pre-MBT) of zebrafish development.</p><p>Another gene in this cluster is a putative RNA helicase. RNA helicases are implicated in a number of cellular processes involving RNA secondary structures such as translation initiation and ribosome and spliceosome assembly. Some of the members of this family have been active in embryogenesis and in embryonic stem cells. RNA helicase has been shown to be essential for normal gastrulation in the mouse &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b67">67</xref>&#x0005d;. It has been shown that RNA helicase II is necessary for cell growth and cell cycle progression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b68">68</xref>&#x0005d;, and a role for RNA helicases in ribosomal RNA biogenesis in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes has been observed &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b69">69</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, it has been shown that down-regulation of RNA helicase II results in depletion of ribosomal RNA production in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes and cell culture &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b70">70</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, the expression of putative RNA helicase at the pre-MBT stage may be essential for cell growth and/or cell cycling during the cleavage stages of embryogenesis and also early commitment to normal gastrulation. Furthermore, it appears that the presence of RNA helicase II during early embryogenesis may facilitate ribosomal RNA production and the positioning of the translational machinery so as to meet the demand at MBT.</p><p>Other interesting genes in this cluster are alanyl-tRNA synthetase and nascent-polypeptide associated complex alpha (DNA primase small subunit). Transcripts for these genes have also been found in ES cells. DNA primase is involved in nascent polypeptide production resulting in protein biosynthesis, and tRNA synthetase is involved in protein synthesis related processes such as tRNA binding and tRNA ligase activity. Thus, all the genes described above are related to cell growth, cell proliferation, cell adhesion, nascent RNA synthesis and stability, and other cellular functions. It may be that these genes need to commence their function during pre-MBT stages in order to facilitate normal progression through MBT and subsequent embryonic development. GO analysis of the genes in this group reveals that more than 50&#x00025; of the genes show putative functions such as DNA/RNA binding, development, protein folding, and protein biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010029-sf04">Figure S4</xref>). Human and mouse orthologs of some of the known genes in this group are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010029-st02">Table S2</xref>. Clusters 3 and 4 displayed the cohort of zygotic genes displaying maximum transcript accumulation at blastula (4 hpf) and gastrula (6 hpf) stages, respectively. The genes that have been shown to be expressed in blastula- (for example, <italic>cyclin D1</italic>) and gastrula- (for example, <italic>cathepsin L</italic>) stage embryos were identified with Clusters 3 and 4, respectively, as expected. Thus, the microarray detected the expression of known genes at the expected time points, once again confirming the reliability of the array detection.</p><p>It has been shown that transcription can occur prior to MBT in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010029-b31">31</xref>&#x0005d;; namely, these authors showed that <italic>beta-catenin</italic> and <italic>tcf</italic> regulated pre-MBT transcription of <italic>nodal</italic> genes <italic>xnr5</italic> and <italic>xnr6</italic> does take place. However, in this study, they restricted the investigation to single gene expression analyses. Most of the earlier studies on the functional analysis of zebrafish genes were restricted to a handful of genes using WISH or Northern blot analysis with embryos at MBT or beyond. Parallel analysis of the expression of thousands of genes at selected closely spaced time points and early cleavage stages has not been previously attempted, to our knowledge. Thus, we are the first to our knowledge to undertake parallel analysis of expression of early genes using high-density zebrafish arrays. This approach revealed a cohort of genes that actively accumulate zygotic transcripts prior to the MBT stage, and the data presented here will serve as a starting point for the functional investigations of the roles of these genes during zebrafish embryogenesis.</p><p>To validate the expression profiles, real-time PCR was done for selected genes from each cluster. Real-time PCR was done for 16 samples from Cluster 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010029-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010029-g006">6</xref>) using the same total RNA used for array hybridization. The pattern of expression was similar in both analyses. Subsequently, we extracted new batches of RNA from one-cell, two-/four-cell, 64-/128-cell, 256-/512-cell, and 4-hpf embryos and performed real-time PCR for eight genes from Cluster 2 and compared the array data with RT-PCR data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010029-sf05">Figure S5</xref>). Of these eight genes, real-time PCR was done for four genes using independently isolated batches of RNA, and the results are comparable. Quantity of transcripts for the selected genes at 64-/128-cell and 256-/512-cell (pre-MBT stages) is more than that at one- to four-cell stages indicating the accumulation of new transcripts prior to MBT. Similarly, real-time PCR was also done for selected genes from Clusters 3 and 4 (unpublished data). The results show that the pattern of expression obtained via real-time PCR analysis parallels the observations made in the array. Furthermore, whole-embryo RNA in situ hybridization was performed for eight different clones from the early genes of which real-time PCR was also done. Hybridization intensity was significantly higher at 64-/128-cell and 256-/512-cell compared to one- to four-cell stages, indicating transcript accumulation during the pre-MBT stages of development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010029-g007">Figure 7</xref>). The pattern of in situ data is similar to the real-time PCR profile. All these observations clearly support the presence of a cohort of early genes in zebrafish exhibiting pre-MBT transcript accumulation.</p><p>In summary, we described here the first genome-wide microarray analysis of the embryonic zebrafish transcriptome. This study revealed a remarkable undulating developmental expression program and temporal clustering of gene groups never before characterized (to our knowledge) during embryogenesis. Furthermore, a previously unknown cohort of very early genes transcribed <italic>prior</italic> to MBT was discovered in this study, which now represents the earliest known (to our knowledge) transcribed and accumulating RNAs in zebrafish and revised our earlier thinking that MBT marked the onset of all zygotic gene transcription. We are the first to create a comprehensive integrated database by incorporating resources from different databases for the annotation of the clones in the zebrafish oligoarray (Compugen) that will serve as a significant resource for the zebrafish community.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Embryo collection.</title><p>Wild-type zebrafish (Singapore local stock) embryos were obtained from the zebrafish facility of the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology.

Peak of the expression is defined as the time at which the mRNA abundance attains its highest level. The onset of expression is defined as the earliest time of the peak in the profile. This algorithm was used for the single peak genes selected as differentially expressed for this study. Prior to applying the algorithm, the dataset was selected based on statistical methods (SAM and FDR) described above, which removed the noisy profiles. Apart from that, the algorithm contains a Gaussian smoothing step that also removes the noisy profiles. Both onset and peak of expression are the onset and peak of relative abundance rather than absolute abundance. Manual verification of the profiles derived by using the algorithm showed that less than 0.1&#x00025; of the data deviated from onset time by just one time point. The prediction of peak of expression did not vary from the observed data.
