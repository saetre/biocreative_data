Computer-assisted comparison reveals that one sequence motif of 30 amino-acid residues is very similar to a region conserved in the C-terminal part of eukaryotic poly(A) binding proteins (PABP). A second region of the rat 100 kDa protein, containing alternating basic, mostly arginine, and acidic amino-acid residues, is structurally related to sequence motifs found in the 70K protein of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP), which is involved in RNA splicing. Northern blot analysis shows that a corresponding 9.5 kb transcript is highly expressed in rat testis; lower mRNA levels are found in other tissues such as liver, kidney, lung and brain. Ontogenic studies reveal that the expression of the 100 kDa protein-encoding gene and sexual maturation are correlated, being barely detectable during early post-natal life but reaching maximal levels around the first month after birth.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00081-0033-a" xlink:role="1472"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00081-0035-a" xlink:role="1474"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00081-0035-b" xlink:role="1474"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00081-0035-c" xlink:role="1474"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00081-0032.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1471"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00081-0033.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1472"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00081-0034.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1473"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00081-0035.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1474"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00081-0036.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1475"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
