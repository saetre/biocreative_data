The interaction between the APE1 and hnRNP-L proteins does not require the presence of nCaRE-B2.

APE1 (also named APEX, HAP-1 and Ref-1) has been extensively characterized in the repair of damaged DNA, specifically for its role in the base excision repair (BER) pathway (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c3">3</xref>). In the BER process, APE1 acts as a dual-function nuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c5">5</xref>). As an endonuclease, it cleaves the DNA strand 5&#x02032; to AP sites generated as a result of excision of abnormal bases by monofunctional DNA glycosylases. APE1 also acts as a 3&#x02032;-phosphodiesterase to remove 3&#x02032; blocking groups generated directly in DNA by reactive oxygen species or after removal of oxidized base lesions by complex DNA glycosylase&#x0002f;AP lyases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c7">7</xref>).</p><p>APE1 was independently identified as a redox activator of AP-1 DNA-binding activity and named Ref-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c8">8</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> studies showed that APE1&#x0002f;Ref-1 converts the oxidized and inactive form of c-Jun into a reduced, active form, presumably via a thiol exchange reaction between oxidized Cys272 of c-Jun and Cys65 in APE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c10">10</xref>). Furthermore, oxidized APE1 was shown to be reduced by thioredoxin, which interacts with the N-terminal domain of APE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c12">12</xref>). APE1 has also been shown to activate p53, by both redox-dependent and -independent mechanisms, resulting in its nuclear translocation and increased DNA-binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c13">13</xref>). A link between p53 and APE1 in tumor induction was provided by genetic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c14">14</xref>). Finally, APE1 was recently shown to mediate activation of several other transcription factors, including Pax 5, Pax 8 and basic helix&#x02013;loop&#x02013;helix transcription factors (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c15">15</xref>).</p><p>A third and apparently distinct function of APE1 was discovered during investigation of <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors that act as Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent repressors of the parathyroid hormone (PTH) gene by binding to the negative Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> response elements (nCaRE) in its promoter. Expression of the PTH gene is down-regulated in response to increases in extracellular calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c16">16</xref>), which is mediated by nCaRE-A and nCaRE-B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c18">18</xref>). Subsequent experiments revealed that APE1 (Ref-1) is a component of the nuclear protein complexes that bind to nCaRE-A and nCaRE-B elements; however, APE1 was incapable of binding alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c19">19</xref>). It was suggested, therefore, that APE1 requires an additional factor(s) to form a competent DNA-binding complex. Use of DNA affinity chromatography led to the identification of Ku antigen p70 and p86 as partners of APE1 in binding to nCaRE-A, but not to nCaRE-B, of the PTH promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c20">20</xref>).</p><p>We have previously characterized the promoter region of the human APE1 gene and identified a negative regulatory region &#x0223c;2 kb upstream of transcriptional initiation, a distance comparable to that found in the PTH gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c21">21</xref>). Sequencing of this region revealed the presence of a single nCaRE-A-type and two nCaRE-B-type sequences. Further deletion and mutational analysis revealed that this repression was eliminated with the removal of one of the nCaRE-B elements, nCaRE-B2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c21">21</xref>). Additionally, we showed that HeLa cell nuclear extract formed a discrete binding complex with the nCaRE-B2 oligonucleotide and formation of this binding complex could be inhibited by preincubation with anti-APE1 antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c21">21</xref>). However, recombinant APE1 alone, purified from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, was incapable of binding to this element, consistent with previous reports indicating that APE1 protein requires additional factors to form competent binding complexes with nCaRE elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c20">20</xref>). In this report we show that the binding complex for the nCaRE-B2 element in the APE1 promoter contains APE1 and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (hnRNP-L).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Purification of nCaRE-B2-binding protein by affinity chromatography</title><p>The nCaRE-B2 duplex oligo was generated by annealing synthetic oligonucleotides (Gibco Life Technologies) with 5&#x02032;-phosphate: top strand, 5&#x02032;-GATCCTTTT<underline>TGAGAC</underline>AGA<underline>GTTTCA</underline>CTCTTG-3&#x02032; (nCaRE-B palindromic sequence underlined; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c18">18</xref>), corresponding to nucleotides &#x02013;1719 to &#x02013;1690 in the APE1 promoter; bottom strand, 3&#x02032;-AAAAACTCTGTCTCAAAGTGAACCTAGG-5&#x02032;, which contains an additional 5 nt at the 5&#x02032;-end to facilitate concatemer formation.

SDS&#x02013;PAGE analysis of fractions with strong binding activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf146f1">1</xref>A, lanes 5 and 6) showed the presence of two major proteins, at 66 and 36 kDa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf146f1">1</xref>B, left, lane 2). The 36 kDa band was identified as APE1, based on its immunoreactivity to anti-APE1 antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf146f1">1</xref>B, right, lane 3). The 66 kDa band appeared to be the binding partner of APE1. After failing to identify the N-terminal sequence of this protein, we were able to sequence three internal peptides after trypsin digestion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf146f1">1</xref>C). A BLASTP search showed that these peptides corresponded exactly to sequences in hnRNP-L. The hnRNP-L protein, previously characterized in HeLa cell extracts, was shown to have a molecular mass of 64&#x02013;68 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c25">25</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that the 66 kDa band was indeed hnRNP-L.</p></sec><sec><title>EMSA with nCaRE-B2</title><p>After co-purification of APE1 and hnRNP-L from the nCaRE-B2 affinity column, we investigated the interaction between these proteins and further defined the nature of the complex utilizing several experimental approaches. In an effort to show supershift of the nCaRE-B2 complex after treatment with anti-hnRNP-L mAb clone 4D11 (a generous gift from Dr Dreyfuss), we observed an &#x0223c;3.5-fold reduction in the amount of complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf146f2">2</xref>, lanes 2 and 5). A similar treatment with anti-APE1 antibody resulted in a 2-fold reduction in nCaRE-B2-binding activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf146f2">2</xref>, lane 4). The addition of preimmune serum had no effect on binding complex formation (data not shown). The sequence specificity of this binding complex is also shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf146f2">2</xref>. Addition of a 20-fold molar excess of unlabeled nCaRE-B2 oligonucleotides resulted in almost complete elimination of binding complex formation (compare lanes 2 and 3). On the other hand, addition of a 20-fold molar excess of unlabeled mutant nCaRE-B2 oligo, which lacks the consensus binding motif, did not compete with the nCaRE-B2-binding complex to a significant extent (compare lanes 7 and 8), demonstrating that an intact palindrome is required for interaction with the proteins. The addition of a 20-fold molar excess of unlabeled PTH nCaRE-A caused a slight reduction in nCaRE-B2-binding complex formation (lane 9).</p></sec><sec><title>Transient transfection of APE1 and hnRNP-L expression vectors</title><p>In order to confirm the initial observation that APE1 and hnRNP-L comprise the nCaRE-B2-binding complex, APE1 and hnRNP-L cDNAs were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA4HisMax and transiently expressed in COS-1 cells. These plasmid-encoded proteins contain N-terminal epitope tags (X-Press epitope) that allow discrimination between endogenous and ectopically expressed APE1 and hnRNP-L. Representative western analyses of ectopically expressed APE1, hnRNP-L and APE1 &#x0002b; hnRNP-L nuclear protein levels are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf146f3">3</xref>B. EMSA was performed using nuclear extracts from COS-1 cells transiently transfected with APE1 and hnRNP-L expression vectors. With a limiting amount (3.5&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g) of extract, we did not observe a mobility shift with nuclear extracts from untransfected COS-1 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf146f3">3</xref>C, lanes 2 and 3). Ectopic expression of APE1 and&#x0002f;or hnRNP-L, however, significantly increased nCaRE-B2-binding activity with the same amount of COS-1 nuclear extract (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf146f3">3</xref>C and D). The increased binding activity observed with APE1 and hnRNP-L transfected alone suggests that these ectopically expressed proteins are capable of recruiting endogenous binding partners to participate in the nCaRE-B2-binding complex. Interestingly, while co-transfection of both APE1 and hnRNP-L resulted in increased binding activity, it was not synergistic or additive compared to the activity observed with APE1 or hnRNP-L transfected alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf146f3">3</xref>C, lanes 4&#x02013;6). We interpret these observations as suggesting that covalent modification of APE1 and&#x0002f;or hnRNP-L, such as acetylation or phosphorylation, rather than simple mass action, may be required for the observed nCaRE-B2-binding activities.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro</italic> reconstitution of the nCaRE-B2-binding complex</title><p>In order to determine whether the APE1 and hnRNP-L proteins together are sufficient to form the nCaRE-B2-binding complex and to test whether recombinant proteins are as efficient as the endogenous proteins in complex formation, we reconstituted this complex using recombinant APE1 and hnRNP-L proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf146f4">4</xref>). Recombinant human hnRNP-L purified from insect cells and bacterially expressed human APE1 were used in nCaRE-B2 EMSAs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf146f4">4</xref>C). Binding reactions contained 2&#x000a0;nmol recombinant APE1 (lane 4), 3 nmol hnRNP-L (lane 5) or APE1 and hnRNP-L together (lane 3) under nCaRE-B2 EMSA binding conditions and were compared to a control with HeLa S3 nuclear extract (lane 2). These results clearly demonstrate the formation of one major nCaRE-B2-binding complex in reactions containing both recombinant APE1 and hnRNP-L that migrates to the same position as seen with the HeLa S3 control extract. Recombinant APE1 alone failed to form a detectable complex, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c21">21</xref>). However, recombinant hnRNP-L alone displayed weak binding activity (lane 5). It is surprising that the mobility of the complex with hnRNP-L alone was not significantly different from that containing both hnRNP-L and APE1 in lanes 2 and 3. The mobility of complexes in EMSA should depend on their molecular masses, which are obviously different in the case of hnRNP-L versus hnRNP-L together with APE1. However, we have often observed a lack of correlation between the relative mobility of a complex and the total molecular mass of proteins in the complex in these assays. In any event, these results suggest that hnRNP-L possesses an ability for nCaRE-B recognition and that its initial binding is strengthened or stabilized by APE1. There is an alternative possibility that the weak binding observed with hnRNP-L alone was due to interaction with an APE1-like protein present in Sf9 cells that co-purified with hnRNP-L as a minor contaminant.</p></sec><sec><title>GST pull-down assay</title><p>We next examined whether the interaction between APE1 and hnRNP-L required the presence of nCaRE-B2 sequences. Repeated attempts at co-immunoprecipitation experiments using our anti-APE1 and anti-hnRNP-L polyclonal antibodies failed, probably due to the characteristics of our antisera. However, the GST&#x02013;hnRNP-L fusion protein enabled its effective isolation, with associated factors, via interaction of GST with immobilized glutathione. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf146f5">5</xref>, 200&#x000a0;ng GST&#x02013;hnRNP-L incubated with 80 &#x000b5;g COS-1 nuclear extracts with or without nCaRE-B2 oligonucleotides, followed by the addition of reduced glutathione&#x02013;Sephadex and three washes of the bound GST&#x02013;hnRNP-L and then western analysis, demonstrated that the association between APE1 and hnRNP-L is not dependent on the presence of cognate DNA elements. These results demonstrate that APE1 and hnRNP-L associate <italic>in vitro</italic> and may be complexed <italic>in vivo</italic> in the absence of the nCaRE-B2 oligo.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>The nCaRE-B2-binding complex consists of APE1 and hnRNP-L</title><p>We have demonstrated that the nCaRE-B2-binding complex contains both APE1 and hnRNP-L polypeptides. Identification of APE1 in this complex confirms earlier results reported by us and others and was thus predictable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c21">21</xref>). By analogy with the situation of the nCaRE-A-binding complex, which was shown to include APE1 and Ku70, we expected the presence of a second protein in the nCaRE-B2-binding complex. Identification of this second protein as hnRNP-L was, however, completely unexpected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf146f1">1</xref>). Its presence in this binding complex was verified by EMSA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf146f2">2</xref>) and by reconstitution of the nCaRE-B2-binding activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf146f4">4</xref>). Furthermore, the interaction between APE1 and hnRNP-L was shown using a GST pull-down assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf146f5">5</xref>), which also indicated that the cognate <italic>cis</italic> element is not required for stable interaction between these two proteins. While our results demonstrate that the APE1 and hnRNP-L proteins are components of the binding complex, we cannot exclude the possibility that additional factors contribute to the formation of this binding complex and that covalent modifications of these proteins may be required for optimum binding to the nCaRE-B sequence.</p></sec><sec><title>A novel function of hnRNP-L</title><p>Pre-mRNAs, termed heterogeneous nuclear RNAs (hnRNAs), are synthesized in the nucleus by RNA polymerase II and require extensive post-transcriptional processing to generate mature mRNAs. These RNAs are complexed with a group of proteins named heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c26">26</xref>). While the primary <italic>in vivo</italic> role of the hnRNP family, which consists of about 20 members with molecular masses ranging between 34 and 120 kDa, is in the packaging of nascent hnRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c27">27</xref>), recent studies suggest broader and unrelated functions for these proteins, e.g. in transcriptional regulation of gene expression and other cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c29">29</xref>). For example, while hnRNP-L was first identified and characterized as a component of hnRNP complexes in HeLa cell nuclear extracts, immunohistochemical analysis showing significant amounts of hnRNP-L in the free form suggests that it has a distinct activity in the uncomplexed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c25">25</xref>). Several diverse functions for hnRNP-L have indeed been reported, including its binding to a <italic>cis</italic>-acting RNA sequence that facilitates nuclear export and expression of a chimeric, intronless gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c30">30</xref>). Furthermore, hnRNP-L was shown to interact with the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (hnRNP-I) located at the 3&#x02032;-border of the internal ribosome entry site of hepatitis C virus, suggesting a role in viral translational control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c32">32</xref>). More recently, hnRNP-L has been shown to regulate the stability of human endothelial growth factor mRNA in response to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c33">33</xref>). To date, our studies are the first to identify a novel role of hnRNP-L in the regulation of gene expression. Interestingly, several other hnRNP family members have been reported to have similar roles in transcriptional regulation. For example, hnRNP-K was shown to bind to the CT element of the c-myc promoter to activate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c35">35</xref>). hnRNP-F has been shown to possess a transactivation function, via which it binds to DNA and interacts with RNA polymerase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c36">36</xref>). Nucleolin and an isoform of hnRNP-D have been shown to comprise the B cell- and sequence-specific DNA-binding complex LR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c37">37</xref>). More recent studies suggest a role for hnRNP-D in telomere maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c38">38</xref>). It is thus becoming increasingly apparent that the hnRNP family members have a much broader role <italic>in vivo</italic> than in mRNA biogenesis alone.</p></sec><sec><title>Potential model for hnRNP-L&#x02013;APE1 interaction</title><p>The hnRNP-L polypeptide contains a stretch of basic amino acids similar to those found in the transcription factors HLF, c-Fos and c-Jun (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf146f6">6</xref>). The N-terminal redox domain of APE1 has been shown to be required for reductive activation of these transcription factors at specific, conserved cysteine residues in these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c39">39</xref>). While we do not propose a similar reductive activation of hnRNP-L, as the conserved cysteine is replaced by arginine in hnRNP-L and EMSA experiments were unaffected by DTT (data not shown), we propose that this region may function as an interaction domain that mediates the coupling of hnRNP-L and APE1. This would involve an interaction of the N-terminal region of APE1 with a region near the C-terminus of hnRNP-L. This model is consistent with the interaction between APE1 and Ku70&#x0002f;Ku86, which has been shown by Chung <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c20">20</xref>) to require the N-terminal region of APE1, i.e. the region encompassing the redox domain. Furthermore, the authors identified a sequence, AALCR, corresponding to residues 395&#x02013;399 in Ku70, which is involved in this interaction. This is consistent with our proposal that this region may function as a common protein&#x02013;protein interaction domain for APE1.</p><p>Our observation that HeLa nuclear extract showed a much higher efficiency of binding to nCaRE-B2 than a mixture of recombinant APE1 and hnRNP-L (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf146f4">4</xref>C) suggests that some other component is required for optimum complex formation. One possibility is that a third protein or small molecule is present in the shifted complex which does not affect the position of the band. It is more likely, however, that one or both of these proteins are post-translationally modified <italic>in vivo</italic> and that the modified APE1 and hnRNP-L interact more strongly with each other and with nCaRE-B2. This may also explain how moderately abundant proteins like APE1 and hnRNP-L can carry out such specialized functions in specific DNA sequence recognition, in addition to carrying out their predominant activities not related to transcriptional regulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Potential for negative autoregulation of the APE1 gene</title><p>Identification of APE1 as a component of nCaRE-B2-binding complexes and the role of nCaRE-B elements as functional negative regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c20">20</xref>) suggest that the APE1 gene may be down-regulated by its own product, as proposed earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf146c21">21</xref>). This is the first such example of autoregulation of a eukaryotic DNA repair enzyme. The present studies show that APE1, with the ability to recognize AP sites in DNA, and hnRNP-L, with a primary function other than DNA binding, interact to form a functional binding complex for a unique DNA sequence. How the cell &#x02018;directs&#x02019; the activities of these two multifunctional proteins to this unique function remains to be elucidated.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf146f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Purification of nCaRE-B2-binding proteins.
