A yeast two-hybrid screen, with the extended plant homeodomain (ePHD) of SPBP as bait, identified TopBP1 (topoisomerase II &#x003b2;-binding protein 1) as a candidate interaction partner of SPBP. TopBP1 has eight BRCA1 carboxy-terminal (BRCT) domains and is involved in DNA replication, DNA damage responses and in the regulation of gene expression. The interaction between SPBP and TopBP1 was confirmed <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and was found to be mediated by the ePHD domain of SPBP and the BRCT6 domain of TopBP1. Both SPBP and TopBP1 enhanced the transcriptional activity of Ets1 on the <italic>c-myc</italic> P1P2- and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP3) promoters. Together they displayed a more than additive effect. Both proteins were associated with these promoters. The involvement of TopBP1 was dependent on the serine 1159 phosphorylation site, known to be important for transcriptional activation. Depletion of endogenous SPBP by siRNA treatment reduced MMP3 secretion by 50% in phorbol ester-stimulated human fibroblasts. Taken together, our results show that TopBP1 and SPBP interact physically and functionally to co-operate as co-activators of Ets1.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stromelysin-1 PDGF responsive element binding protein (SPBP) is a 220 kDa ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein containing an N-terminal transactivation domain, three nuclear localisation signals, a DNA-binding domain with an AT-hook and a C-terminal extended PHD domain (ePHD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Originally, SPBP was identified as a protein involved in transcriptional activation of the matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP3)/Stromelysin-1 promoter via the specific sequence element SPRE (Stromelysin-1 PDGF responsive element) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Later SPBP was found to act as a transcriptional co-activator since it enhanced the transcriptional activity of the positive co-factor and RING finger protein SNURF/RNF4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), and of certain transcription factors such as Sp1, Ets1, Pax6 and c-Jun (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). SPBP was also reported to interact with c-Jun <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Recently, SPBP was found to act as a phosphoserine-specific repressor of oestrogen receptor &#x003b1; (ER&#x003b1;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). A region spanning NLS2 of SPBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) bound directly to ER&#x003b1; phosphorylated on serine 104, 106 and 118, but not to the unphosphorylated form of ER&#x003b1;. Over-expression of SPBP inhibited the proliferation of an ER&#x003b1;-dependent breast cancer cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Thus, a picture is emerging of SPBP as a transcriptional co-regulator with both activating and inhibitory potential depending on the conditions. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>SPBP and TopBP1 interact <italic>in vitro</italic> via the ePHD and BRCT6 domains.

The pulled-down proteins, together with 10% of the input were separated by SDS&#x02013;PAGE.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkm739f1"/></fig></p><p>The PHD finger is a common structural motif present throughout eukaryotic proteomes in nuclear, chromatin-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). PHD fingers are found to have both protein- and nucleosome-binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), and recently it was shown that the PHD finger is a highly specialized methyl-lysine-binding domain recognizing trimethylated lysine 4 on histone H3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). PHD fingers may co-operate with an adjacent domain to constitute a functional nucleosome-binding module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The ePHD domain of SPBP is related to the PHD finger motif. The PHD domains contain two zinc-fingers with the zinc ligands forming a Cys<sub>4</sub>-His-Cys<sub>3</sub> signature. The ePHD domain has instead a Cys<sub>4</sub>-His-Cys<sub>2</sub>-His signature and an N-terminal extension that may form an additional zinc-finger with a Cys<sub>2</sub>-His-Cys signature.</p><p>TopBP1 is an evolutionary conserved checkpoint mediator that binds to ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3 related) and is a direct positive regulator of the ATR&#x02013;ATRIP complex upon DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). TopBP1 is recruited to sites of DNA damage and replication stress via its interaction with Rad9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). TopBP1, first identified as an interaction partner of topoisomerase II &#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), is associated with chromatin during DNA replication and important for genome integrity during normal S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). In addition to its roles in checkpoint signalling and genome maintenance, several reports implicate TopBP1 in transcriptional regulation. Metazoan TopBP1 contains five BRCT domains homologous to yeast Dpb11 (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>) and Cut5/Rad4 (<italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>), and three additional BRCT domains in the C-terminus that are found to interact with various transcription factors such as E2F1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), Miz-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) transcription-replication factor E2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Over-expression of TopBP1 enhanced the ability of HPV16 E2 to activate transcription and replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), while the Miz-1-TopBP1 interaction inhibited Miz-1's ability to activate its target genes <italic>p15INK4B</italic> and <italic>p21Cip1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). TopBP1 interacts with E2F1 via its BRCT6 domain and recruits the chromatin modification complex Brg/BRM1 leading to repression of known E2F1 activities, including transcriptional activation and induction of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). This interaction is observed both after DNA damage and during G1/S transition, and believed to be crucial for the control of E2F1-dependent apoptosis. The interaction between TopBP1 and the three transcription factors HPV16 E2, Miz-1 and E2F1 involves the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)&#x02014;Akt/PKB signalling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Akt/PKB phosphorylation of TopBP1 at serine 1159 induces oligomerization of TopBP1, which is crucial for the observed interactions. Additionally, TopBP1 is reported to interact with the tyrosine kinase c-Abl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). TopBP1 was demonstrated to be phosphorylated by c-Abl, and to repress c-Abl at the level of transcription, probably by recruiting histone deacetylases to the <italic>c-abl</italic> promoter. Similar to the repression activity involving E2F and Miz-1, the repression of the <italic>c-abl</italic> promoter is dependent on phosphorylation.</p><p>Here we show that TopBP1 and SPBP interact <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo.</italic> The interaction involved mainly the ePHD domain of SPBP and the BRCT6 domain of TopBP1. Reporter gene assays using the Ets1 regulated promoters <italic>c-myc</italic> P1P2 and MMP3, showed that TopBP1 and SPBP co-operate to enhance Ets1-mediated transcription. This co-operation requires their interaction domains and is dependent on the S1159 phosphorylation site of TopBP1. Both TopBP1 and SPBP were found to be associated with the <italic>c-myc</italic> P1P2 promoter and the MMP3 promoter. Mutation of the Ets1-binding sites in the MMP3 promoter inhibited the stimulatory effect of Ets1, SPBP and TopBP1. Finally, siRNA mediated knockdown of endogenous SPBP significantly reduced the expression of the metalloproteinase MMP3 in a human fibroblast cell line.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>cDNA constructs were subcloned into Gateway entry vectors and expression clones made as described (Invitrogen).

A yeast two-hybrid screen using the C-terminal ePHD3-12 region of SPBP (amino acid 1837&#x02013;1960) as bait (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A), identified the DNA damage checkpoint mediator TopBP1 as a putative interaction partner. We denote the bait fragment ePHD3-12 since it contains the 10 C-terminal zinc ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5 B6 B7 B8 B9 B10 B11 B12">3&#x02013;12</xref>). This region has previously been called the ZNF2 domain and is conserved between SPBP and members of the trithorax family proteins such as MLL, MLL2 and &#x02212;4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Nearly 60% (165 of 280) of the positive clones sequenced encoded BRCT domains 6 and 7 and part of BRCT domain 8 of TopBP1 [TopBP1(862&#x02013;1406)] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Co-immunoprecipitation assays of <italic>in vitro</italic> translated HA-tagged TopBP1 (HA-TopBP1) and Myc-tagged SPBP (Myc-SPBP) demonstrated interaction between the full-length proteins <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). To verify the interaction <italic>in vitro</italic> and to determine whether the complete ePHD domain of SPBP also could interact with TopBP1, GST pull-down assays using GST-fusions of SPBP(ePHD3-12) and SPBP(ePHD), and <italic>in-vitro</italic> translated HA-tagged TopBP1(862&#x02013;1406) were performed.

A region containing the BRCT6 domain of TopBP1 (amino acids 862&#x02013;1011) and a region containing BRCT domains 7 and 8 (amino acids 1012&#x02013;1522) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) were produced as GST fusion proteins and tested for interaction with <italic>in vitro</italic> translated HA-tagged SPBP (HA-SPBP). As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D, full-length SPBP bound to BRCT domain 6 of TopBP1. Since the BRCT domains of TopBP1 are shown to bind double- and single-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), we wanted to test whether the interaction between SPBP and TopBP1 is indirect via DNA. Complete removal of DNA by treatment with the nuclease benzonase had no effect on the interaction between SPBP and TopBP1(862&#x02013;1406). Clearly, DNA is not a &#x02018;bridging factor&#x02019; between the two proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D).</p><p>Next, the interaction between TopBP1 and a deletion mutant of SPBP lacking the ePHD domain was investigated. Surprisingly, SPBP(&#x00394;ePHD) bound both to TopBP1(BRCT6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E) and TopBP1(BRCT7 + 8) (data not shown), even though the interaction was clearly weaker than for the full-length SPBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E). To further delineate which region of SPBP that was involved in this additional interaction, three deletion constructs of SPBP (amino acids 4&#x02013;486, &#x02212;532&#x02013;1344 and &#x02212;1333&#x02013;1666) were <italic>in vitro</italic> translated and assayed by GST-pulldown with GST-TopBP1(BRCT6) and GST-TopBP1(BRCT 7 + 8). These studies showed that the SPBP region containing amino acids 1333&#x02013;1666 interacted weakly both with BRCT6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>F) and BRCT7 + 8 of TopBP1 (data not shown). This region of SPBP encompasses the DNA-binding domain and a bipartite nuclear localization signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). In conclusion, SPBP and TopBP1 interact <italic>in vitro</italic> primarily via the ePHD domain of SPBP and the BRCT6 domain of TopBP1. This interaction is not dependent on DNA. There are also weaker contributing interactions involving amino acids 1333&#x02013;1666 of SPBP and BRCT7 + 8 domains of TopBP1.</p></sec><sec><title>SPBP and TopBP1 interact <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>To investigate the SPBP&#x02013;TopBP1 interaction <italic>in vivo</italic> we first established a U2OS-TA cell line stably expressing <italic>GFP-SPBP</italic> (U2OS-GFP-SPBP) as described in Materials and Methods section. U2OS-TA is a human osteosarcoma cell line with a stably integrated tetracycline regulated transcriptional activator (tet-VP16) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). This system allows regulated expression of the transgene in a doxycycline-repressible manner. A clone expressing GFP-SPBP at the level of endogenous SPBP that displayed efficient doxycycline-mediated repression of GFP-SPBP expression was used for the further study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). HA-tagged TopBP1 was transiently expressed in the U2OS-GFP-SPBP cell line, and an anti-GFP antibody was used to immunoprecipitate GFP-SPBP from total cellular extracts. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, HA-TopBP1 was co-precipitated with GFP-SPBP. Next, we wanted to determine whether endogenous TopBP1 was co-precipitated with SPBP. SPBP was immunoprecipitated from total U2OS-GFP-SPBP cellular extracts with anti-SPBP antibodies, and the associated TopBP1 was detected by anti-TopBP1 antibodies on a western blot. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C shows that endogenous TopBP1 was co-precipitated with SPBP. The weak band of co-precipitated TopBP1 may reflect the expression level of TopBP1 in an extract from unsynchronised cells. TopBP1 generally displays a low expression level, except during S-phase when its expression is induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Similarly, IP of endogenous TopBP1 using TopBP1 antibodies showed that both endogenous SPBP and the fusion protein GFP-SPBP were associated with TopBP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D).

To confirm that the MMP3 promoter-region harbouring the EBS could be occupied by SPBP and TopBP1 in addition to Ets1 itself we performed ChIP assays using the U2OS&#x02013;GFP&#x02013;SPBP cells.

We also included a region around 3 kb upstream the cathepsin D gene promoter as an additional negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D, lower panels). To further test the role of SPBP in Ets1-mediated transcriptional activation of the MMP3 promoter, endogenous SPBP was depleted by transfecting HeLa cells with SPBP siRNAs. Of four different siRNAs tested, all caused a significant knockdown of SPBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>E).

A small but reproducible reduction in Ets1 transcriptional activity was seen when TopBP1 was knocked down while the co-activation potential of SPBP was strongly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>H). Similar results were obtained using the <italic>c-myc</italic> P1P2 promoter (data not shown).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, mutation of the tandem EBS abolished both Ets1 activation of the MMP3 promoter and the stimulatory effect of SPBP or TopBP1 on this promoter. When all three proteins were co-expressed, the mutated promoter was induced but to a much lower extent than the wild-type promoter. This residual induction is very likely due to activation via weaker Ets1 responsive sites at position &#x02212;92/&#x02212;73, &#x02212;344/&#x02212;355 and &#x02212;72/&#x02212;48 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>).

The IMR90 cells were transfected with SPBP siRNA or control siRNA, serum starved and stimulated with phorbol ester before performing western blot on the cell medium to determine the level of secreted MMP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A).

Importantly, RAI1 also possesses a C-terminal ePHD domain, an N-terminal transactivation domain and three nuclear localisation signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). The gene organization of SPBP and RAI1 is remarkably similar suggesting that they represent duplicated genes with a common ancestor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). RAI1 is implicated in Smith&#x02013;Magenis syndrome, a syndrome with multiple congenital anomalies and mild mental retardation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). The ePHD domain of RAI1 is organized similarly to the SPBP ePHD domain with an extended loop region between the two most N-terminal zinc-ligands and the conserved region containing the PHD fingers. We decided to test whether RAI1 had the ability to enhance Ets1-mediated transactivation of the MMP3 promoter similar to SPBP. However, comparative reporter gene assays in HeLa cells showed that RAI1 neither stimulated Ets1-mediated transcriptional activation of the MMP3 promoter nor co-operated with TopBP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A and B). On the contrary, RAI1 repressed Ets1-mediated transcriptional activation. Next, we asked whether the ePHD domain of RAI1 had the ability to interact with TopBP1. Interestingly, a yeast two-hybrid assay revealed that RAI1 has very low affinity for TopBP1 compared to the SPBP ePHD domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>D). This was confirmed by GST pull-down assays (data not shown). In contrast to RAI1, the ePHD domains from the trithorax group proteins MLL, MLL2 and -4 can bind to TopBP1 suggesting that this is a more general feature of some ePHD domains. However, the RING finger protein hRNF4, known to interact with SPBP and carrying a zinc-finger domain related to the ePHD domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), does not bind to TopBP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>D). <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>The SPBP homologue RAI1 does not stimulate Ets1-mediated transcriptional activation of the MMP3 promoter or co-operate with TopBP1.

To determine the importance of these regions for their ability to co-activate Ets1-mediated transcription, a C-terminal deletion mutant of SPBP lacking the ePHD domain, SPBP(&#x00394;ePHD), and a TopBP1 deletion mutant lacking BRCT6, TopBP1(&#x00394;BRCT6), were tested in reporter gene assays using the MMP3 promoter as read-out. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A shows that both SPBP(&#x00394;ePHD) and TopBP1(&#x00394;BRCT6) enhanced Ets1-mediated transcriptional activity similar to the full-length proteins.

Also, when deletion mutants of both SPBP and TopBP1 are over-expressed together with Ets1, co-operation between TopBP1 and SPBP is completely abolished, leaving only the additive effect. Western blots and immunostaining showed that the deletion mutants are expressed at similar levels as the full-length proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B) and are present in the cell-nucleus (data not shown). These results indicate that the co-operation between SPBP and TopBP1 is dependent on interactions involving the ePHD domain of SPBP and the BRCT6 domain of TopBP1. The weak co-operation displayed when only the ePHD domain or only the BRCT6 domain was deleted may either be due to (i) the region encompassing amino acids 1333&#x02013;1666 of SPBP and BRCT7 + 8 of TopBP1 or (ii) the fact that both TopBP1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) and SPBP(data not shown) have the ability to oligomerize.

The physical interaction is mainly mediated by the ePHD domain of SPBP and the BRCT6 domain of TopBP1. There is also a weaker interaction between BRCT6 of TopBP1 and a region encompassing amino acids 1333&#x02013;1666 of SPBP. Similarly, the BRCT domains 7 and -8 of TopBP1 could also interact weakly with the ePHD of SPBP. Upon induction of DNA double-strand breaks, TopBP1 is recruited to sites of damage where it plays an important role as an adaptor protein to facilitate phosphorylation of Chk1 by the ATR kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). However, in contrast to TopBP1, SPBP is not recruited to sites of DNA double-strand breaks (data not shown). Hence, we have so far no evidence for a role of SPBP in DNA damage responses, but this issue deserves further investigation. Here we decided to focus on functional studies of the SPBP-TopBP1 interaction in gene regulation since both SPBP and TopBP1 are implicated in transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Reporter gene assays using two different Ets1-regulated promoters demonstrated that TopBP1 and SPBP co-operate to enhance Ets1-mediated transcriptional activation. This co-operation was dependent on their interaction domains (the ePHD domain of SPBP and the BRCT6 domain of TopBP1) in addition to phosphorylation of serine 1159 of TopBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). ChIP showed that both TopBP1 and SPBP are associated with these Ets1-regulated promoters, and siRNA-mediated knockdown of SPBP in a fibroblast cell-line revealed that the endogenous levels of SPBP affected the expression of the Ets1-regulated matrix metalloproteinase MMP3. Mutation of the tandem EBS in the MMP3 promoter demonstrated that the stimulatory effect of SPBP and TopBP1 is mediated via Ets1 binding to these sites.</p><p>The interaction between SPBP and TopBP1 shows similarity to the E2F1&#x02013;TopBP1 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). The interaction is dependent on the BRCT6 domain of TopBP1 and on oligomerization of TopBP1 induced by phosphorylation on serine 1159 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Liu <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) suggested that oligomerization of TopBP1 was specifically required for TopBP1 to interact with transcription factors. Our results are in line with this hypothesis. BRCT domains have been identified as phosphopeptide-binding modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39 B40 B41">39&#x02013;41</xref>). BRCT domain 6 of TopBP1 binds preferentially to an E2F1 peptide phosphorylated at a serine residue, rather than the unphosphorylated counterpart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). The ePHD domain of SPBP has several potential serine-, threonine- and tyrosine phosphorylation sites as predicted by the NetPhos 2.0-(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>) and ScanSite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>) servers. However, phosphorylation of the ePHD domain of SPBP is not essential for binding to TopBP1 since an <italic>E. coli</italic>-produced GST fusion of the ePHD domain is capable of interacting with <italic>in vitro</italic>-translated TopBP1.</p><p>TopBP1 is reported to act both as a repressor and as an activator of transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16 B17 B18">16&#x02013;18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Here we present evidence that TopBP1 has a stimulatory effect on Ets1 transcriptional activity of the <italic>c-myc</italic> P1P2 promoter and the MMP3 promoter. Co-overexpression of TopBP1 and SPBP resulted in a more than additive enhancement of transcriptional activation mediated by Ets1 on both these promoters. Interestingly, preliminary results suggest that SPBP and TopBP1 can also co-operate to stimulate c-Jun transcriptional activity (data not shown). Thus, their co-operation in activating transcription is most likely not limited to Ets1. The stimulatory effect of SPBP and TopBP1 is significantly reduced when the level of endogenous SPBP or endogenous TopBP1 is knocked down by specific siRNAs. SPBP is reported to bind to the SPRE-element at position &#x02212;1578 of the MMP3 promoter and stimulate its transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). However, the stimulatory effect of SPBP reported here is not dependent on this SPRE element since: (i) mutation of the tandem EBS in the MMP3 promoter inhibited the stimulatory effect of SPBP; (ii) the MMP3 promoter construct used in this study (containing 1448 bp of the MMP3 upstream region) does not include the SPRE element; (iii) a MMP3 promoter construct containing the SPRE site (2298 bp of the MMP3 upstream region) gave similar results as the 1448 bp construct (data not shown) and (iv) no such SPRE element has been identified in the <italic>c-myc</italic> P1P2 promoter.</p><p>We found that SPBP, TopBP1 and Ets1 are all associated with a short fragment of the MMP3 promoter, and that SPBP and TopBP1 interacts <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, we have not been able to co-immunoprecipitate endogenous Ets1 and SPBP, or endogenous Ets1 and TopBP1, suggesting that any physical interactions between Ets1 and these two proteins are weak and/or may be dependent on an unknown factor. Hence, the mechanism for SPBP and TopBP1-mediated stimulation of Ets1 has to be elucidated. At least three mechanistic models can be suggested. First, SPBP contains a DNA-binding domain with an AT-hook motif which binds sequence specifically to AT-rich DNA-binding motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). The EBS in the MMP3-promoter and the P1P2 <italic>c-myc</italic> promoter are flanked with AT-rich sequences. Hence, SPBP may recognize these sequences, and when Ets1 is bound at a proximal site, the binding of both proteins is stabilized. Other transcription factors have been shown to modulate the DNA-binding affinity of Ets1, and thereby regulate its transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). The Ets1&#x02013;SPBP&#x02013;DNA complex may recruit oligomerized TopBP1 to the promoter via the ePHD domain of SPBP. Second, PHD domains are known to contain nucleosome-binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), specifically recognizing methylated histone tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Hence, SPBP may be recruited to the promoter sites via its ePHD domain. The ePHD domain which also contains protein-binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), may recruit or stabilize Ets1 and TopBP1 at the promoters. Third, SPBP may relocalize TopBP1 from repressor complexes. It is shown that E2F1 and Ets1 compete for the same binding site in the P1P2 <italic>c-myc</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). E2F1 represses expression from the <italic>c-myc</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>), while Ets1 act as an activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). TopBP1 binds to E2F1 and repress its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Thus, SPBP associated with Ets1 may recruit TopBP1 from the repressive E2F1&#x02013;TopBP1 complexes to the stimulatory co-operation of Ets1, SPBP and TopBP1, and thereby switch the regulation of the P1P2 <italic>c-myc</italic> promoter from off to on. It is reported that Akt/PKB induces expression of <italic>c-myc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). This is in line with our results showing that stimulation of the P1P2 <italic>c-myc</italic> promoter by Ets1, SPBP and TopBP1 is dependent on the S1159 phosphorylation site of TopBP1 shown to be an Akt/PKB substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).</p><p>SPBP is found to be 4- to 6-fold up-regulated in arthrinogenic synovial fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>), which are the cells mainly responsible for hyperplasia and chronic inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis. Activated fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) are characterized by an up-regulated expression of adhesion molecules, chemokines, proinflammatory molecules, oncogenes and matrix metalloproteinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). Interestingly, both <italic>c-myc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>) and MMP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>) are shown to be extensively expressed in FLSs. Hence, SPBP expression correlates well with <italic>c-myc</italic> and MMP3 expression, and also with the invasive properties of the FLSs. Furthermore, two recent papers show that MMP3 expression is induced via the PI3K/Akt pathway in fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>) and microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). These reports correspond well with our results showing that the more than additive enhancement of the MMP3 promoter by SPBP and TopBP1 is abolished if a S1159A mutant of TopBP1 is co-expressed with SPBP. FLS exhibit characteristics of metastatic cells, such as decreased adhesion, increased proliferation and migration. Interestingly, SPBP expression is shown to be up-regulated in small-cell lung cancer and advanced adenocarcinoma cells from patients receiving extensive chemotherapy treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>) and in desmoid tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>). Hence, together with our data these results suggest that a co-operation between SPBP and TopBP1 may contribute to the metastatic process by up-regulating c-<italic>myc</italic> and MMP3 expression.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We are grateful to Jiri Lukas for the gift of U2OS-TA cells.
