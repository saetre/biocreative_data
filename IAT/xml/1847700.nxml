These lipid anchors serve for membrane attachment or protein&#x02013;protein interactions in many pathways. Although well-tolerated selective prenyltransferase inhibitors are clinically available, their mode of action remains unclear since the known substrate sets of the various prenyltransferases are incomplete. The Prenylation Prediction Suite (PrePS) has been applied for large-scale predictions of prenylated proteins. To prioritize targets for experimental verification, we rank the predictions by their functional importance estimated by evolutionary conservation of the prenylation motifs within protein families. The ranked lists of predictions are accessible as PRENbase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mendel.imp.univie.ac.at/sat/PrePS/PRENbase">http://mendel.imp.univie.ac.at/sat/PrePS/PRENbase</ext-link>) and can be queried for verification status, type of modifying enzymes (anchor type), and taxonomic distribution. Our results highlight a large group of plant metal-binding chaperones as well as several newly predicted proteins involved in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation, enriching the known functional repertoire of prenylated proteins. Furthermore, we identify two possibly prenylated proteins in Mimivirus. The section HumanPRENbase provides complete lists of predicted prenylated human proteins&#x02014;for example, the list of farnesyltransferase targets that cannot become substrates of geranylgeranyltransferase 1 and, therefore, are especially affected by farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) used in cancer and anti-parasite therapy. We report direct experimental evidence verifying the prediction of the human proteins Prickle1, Prickle2, the BRO1 domain&#x02013;containing FLJ32421 (termed BROFTI), and Rab28 (short isoform) as exclusive farnesyltransferase targets. We introduce PRENbase, a database of large-scale predictions of protein prenylation substrates ranked by evolutionary conservation of the motif. Experimental evidence is presented for the selective farnesylation of targets with an evolutionary conserved modification site.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Various cellular functions require reversible membrane localization of proteins.

Farnesyltransferase (FT) and geranylgeranyltransferase I (GGT1) recognize the so-called C-terminal CaaX box of substrate proteins to attach either a farnesyl (15 carbons) or geranylgeranyl (20 carbons) anchor to the conserved cysteine via a thioether linkage.

Therefore, it is of great scientific and applied medical interest to clarify which proteins and pathways are affected by farnesyl- or geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitors in human cells or in unicellular parasites.</p><p>Based on the refinement of descriptions of sequence motifs recognized by the three enzymes (FT, GGT1, and GGT2) in substrate proteins, we have recently developed amino acid sequence&#x02013;based predictors for various types of protein prenylation (PrePS &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030066-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;). PrePS is available as a WWW service (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mendel.imp.ac.at/sat/PrePS/index2.html">http://mendel.imp.ac.at/sat/PrePS/index2.html</ext-link>). Since the rate of false-positive predictions of PrePS is low (for proteins with CXXX C-terminus, the false-positive rate is estimated at &#x0223c;5&#x00025; at a sensitivity for true targets of &#x0223c;98&#x00025; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030066-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;), this tool is appropriate for large-scale automated annotation (for example, for proteome scans). In this work, we apply PrePS to finding all potential protein substrates of the three prenyltransferases. With the analyses of these protein sets, it can be determined which prenylation targets are preferentially affected if enzyme-specific prenyltransferase inhibitors are applied.</p><p>As previous experience with a similar project (the application of the MyrPS/NMT myristoylation predictor &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030066-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030066-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d; for searching the nonredundant database and the resulting MYRbase &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030066-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;) has shown, large-scale scans produce a considerable number of hits, and, for their ranking with respect to the biological significance, additional criteria are necessary. It should be noted that the score function of PrePS tests the concordance of C-termini of query proteins (the terminal 12 residues) with a simplified binding site model of the respective prenyltransferase without consideration of other sequence properties. It is not rare that sites for posttranslational modifications and sequence motifs coding for subcellular translocation are not conserved among proteins with otherwise highly similar sequences (exemplary cases of myristoylation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030066-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;, GPI lipid anchoring &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030066-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;, and prenylation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030066-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;). More surprisingly, functional motifs can be hidden in proteins without the proper biological context and be masked by other sequence signals (e.g., the case of peroxisomal targeting signal type 1 (PTS1) in proteins destined for other subcellular localizations &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030066-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;). Nevertheless, conservation of the prenylation site among a larger number of homologues will indicate enhanced biological importance of the potential lipid modification and increase the confidence in correct prediction (evOluation concept in MYRbase &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030066-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;). Therefore, evolutionary conservation of prenylation sites in homologous families can be used for ranking in hit lists and for the selection of potential targets for experimental verification in conditions of limited resources.</p><p>Here, we report the results obtained after applying the three prenylation predictors over the National Center for Biotechnology Institute's (NCBI) nonredundant protein sequence database (NR). The proteins predicted to be prenylated have been clustered into homologous families and are made available as the annotated database PRENbase. A sophisticated interface can generate target lists with regard to the experimental status of the modification (known, predicted, etc.), exclusive or shared types of modifying enzymes (FT, GGT1, GGT2), as well as for evolutionary conservation by constraining the taxonomic distribution within clusters or for single sequences. We investigate the validity of various hit-ranking schemes relying on sequence homology information and taxonomic distribution. Finally, we use PRENbase to list human proteins that could represent elusive cellular targets of FT inhibitors (lack of alternative prenylation by GGT1 under FT inhibition) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030066-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d; and verify experimentally the prenylation status of selected human proteins (versions of Rab28, the BRO1/rhophilin domain containing FLJ32421 &#x0005b;termed BROFTI&#x0005d;, Prickle1, and Prickle2) following our published protocols &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030066-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>PRENbase: Methodological Workflow and Database Description</title><p>The three predictors included in PrePS &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030066-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d; have been run over the NR at NCBI. After removing protein fragments with an incomplete C-terminus (as annotated in Genbank), 5,410 proteins were predicted to be prenylated. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030066-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows the distribution among the three modifying enzymes, including their substrate protein overlaps. While the number of predicted substrates shared between FT and GGT1 is not surprising (mainly due to the fact that FT can also prenylate substrates with terminal leucine &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030066-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;), it is interesting that there also is a substantial overlap with GGT2. At least for Rab8 and Rab11, this enzyme ambiguity has been demonstrated in vitro &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030066-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030066-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. It has to be mentioned that the predictions by PrePS merely represent the capability of a substrate sequence to be modified when presented to the enzyme. In vivo, activity, relative affinity, and availability of FT, GGT1, and GGT2 in the cellular context determine which enzyme will execute the prenylation for a given substrate protein.</p><sec id="s1a1"><title>Family clustering.</title><p>To facilitate the selection of targets for experimental validation, we tried to rank the predictions by the importance of the lipid anchor for their function based on the analysis of evolutionary motif conservation within protein families. It would be of special interest to study the conservation of farnesyl, geranylgeranyl, and double geranylgeranyl anchors within protein families, as this can indicate exclusive or overlapping substrate specificity between the three enzymes. Thus, the extent of variation can give additional hints on the importance of the specific anchor size &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030066-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. We employed BLAST &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030066-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d; and the MCL (Markov chain clustering) algorithm &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030066-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d; to assign the 5,410 predicted sequences to a total of 1,024 clusters (protein families). For details on the clustering procedure, see the Materials and Methods section.</p></sec><sec id="s1a2"><title>Annotation of families of predicted homologous prenylation targets.</title><p>We have manually curated protein family annotations for clusters with at least three sequences (201 clusters total). Due to the power law&#x02013;like behavior of protein family cluster sizes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030066-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;, we could provide curated cluster annotation for approximately 83&#x00025; of the predicted sequences by looking at only 20&#x00025; of all clusters. The remaining clusters of size 1 or 2 have been annotated with names automatically extracted from their description lines.</p><p>In addition to the protein family name and function description, we annotated clusters with respect to verification status. This is not a trivial task because it requires manual lookup of hundreds of literature sources. While the actual number of experimentally verified proteins is small compared with the total number of predictions, many proteins can safely be assumed to be prenylated simply by similarity to known examples. We annotate clusters/families as KNOWN (&#x0002b;) when they include at least one from a list of 113 proteins experimentally verified to be prenylated. In addition, we created the annotation category LIKELY (&#x0002a;) for clusters that do not have an experimentally verified example included directly, but where members of the cluster show a clear similarity (BLAST E-value &#x0003c; 1e&#x02212;10) to at least one of the verified cases. Finally, clusters without any detectable similarity to any of the 113 proteins experimentally verified to be prenylated are categorized in PRENbase as NEW (?). While the former families (with annotation KNOWN and LIKELY) form a basis to summarize existing knowledge of prenylated proteins, the latter (NEW) are of special interest because their function apparently has not been recognized yet in the context of prenylation.</p><p>During the annotation process, we have also encountered a few predictions where conservation of a C-terminal cysteine in CaaX box arrangement can also occur for prenylation-independent functions such as disulfide bridges (e.g., metridin-like ShK toxin family members). Although these do not appear to be prenylation targets in vivo, it cannot be excluded that they become prenylated in a different context when their C-termini would be exposed to the prenylating enzyme. The endothelin-converting enzyme 1 (ECE1) from the neprilysin-like zinc metallopeptidase family is another example with a CaaX box where the capacity for prenylation is apparently not used in vivo (possibly because of a disulfide bond). It is predicted by PrePS to be weakly prenylated and, indeed, its C-terminus has been shown to be weakly prenylatable in vitro &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030066-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. However, it is known to be a type II transmembrane protein. Therefore, the C-terminus and, hence, the potential prenylation motif moves to the lumenal side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and becomes inaccessible for the prenyltransferases. In agreement with the cellular context, the protein does not appear to be prenylated in vivo &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030066-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030066-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, these predictions are not necessarily false positives. We have annotated these predictions in PRENbase as OUT-OF-CONTEXT (&#x02212;).</p></sec><sec id="s1a3"><title>Family ranking.</title><p>If a predicted protein feature, such as a prenylated C-terminus, is conserved among a large number of homologues (large cluster size), this feature appears more critical for biological function and more reliably predicted. Thus, predictions can be scored by <disp-formula id="pcbi-0030066-e001"><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.0030066.e001.jpg" position="anchor" mimetype="image"/></disp-formula>where <italic>N<sub>ph</sub></italic> is the number of family members with a predicted prenylation site. However, the number of homologous proteins sharing the motif becomes less indicative for ranking purposes when the protein family in general is overrepresented in nature or in the databases, respectively (e.g., immunoglobulin chains). Hence, knowledge of the total family size, including proteins with and without the investigated motif, can be used to balance for such overrepresentation. As suggested earlier &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030066-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;, ranking of families by evolutionary motif conservation could be performed with a scoring function such as <disp-formula id="pcbi-0030066-e002"><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.0030066.e002.jpg" position="anchor" mimetype="image"/></disp-formula>where <italic>N<sub>ph</sub></italic> is the number of predicted and <italic>N<sub>th</sub></italic> is the total number of homologues or family members. This ratio balances for overrepresented sequences when compared with the simple ranking by cluster size (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi-0030066-e001">Equation 1</xref>). The square of <italic>N<sub>ph</sub></italic> also helps to downrank very small clusters or orphans relative to clusters with large <italic>N<sub>ph</sub></italic>; e.g., <italic>N<sub>ph</sub></italic> as well as <italic>N<sub>th</sub></italic> is 1 in these cases. </p><p>Instead of ranking based on counting the number of homologues, it is also possible to analyze the taxonomic distribution and score the families according to how widespread (or old) the motif is in the evolution of the protein family. Such phylogenic complexity can simply be estimated as a score function of the number of species (<italic>N<sub>spec</sub></italic>) that have family members with the motif. To remove artificial bias introduced through disproportional sequencing coverage of specific proteins of closely related species, we suggest multiplying <italic>N<sub>spec</sub></italic> by a factor that evaluates the broad distribution throughout all kingdoms and selected divisions. In our case, we count how many of 12 selected taxonomic groups from all kingdoms (archaea, bacteria, viruses, mammals, birds, amphibiae, fishes, insects, nematodes, fungi, plants, and &#x0201c;other eukaryotes&#x0201d;) are covered by the investigated family (<italic>N</italic><sub>12</sub> &#x02264; 12). Then, the final phylogenic complexity scoring function can be written as: <disp-formula id="pcbi-0030066-e003"><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.0030066.e003.jpg" position="anchor" mimetype="image"/></disp-formula></p><p>It should be noted that ranking based on phylogenic complexity does not require the computationally costly determination of the total family size (including members without the motif). Large clusters that consist mainly of sequences of closely related species are downranked in favor of families with a more widespread taxonomic distribution.</p><p>To investigate the performance of the different ranking schemes, we plotted the distribution of clusters colored by their annotated modification status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030066-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Clusters that are homologous to proteins that have already been shown experimentally to be prenylated are shown in green. Those without known prenylated homologues are colored blue (or yellow if the cluster size is smaller than three). Clusters where the motif appears conserved for prenylation-independent functions are colored red. The median values for the distribution of the different cluster and ranking types are marked in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030066-g002">Figure 2</xref> and listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030066-t001">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>It can be seen that the simple ranking by cluster size brings the known or likely prenylated proteins (green clusters) to the front of the list. However, the red clusters also appear to be highly ranked. Using the evOluation score &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030066-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d; for ranking retains the green in front and moves the red to the back. The phylogenic complexity approach performs somewhat worse in downranking the red clusters, but, in contrast, it keeps larger unknown clusters (blue) closer to the top of the list. In conclusion, the different ranking schemes substantially influence the distribution of clusters and might be used to select targets based on emphasis of specificity of the motif for the complete protein family (evOluation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030066-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;) or on taxonomic diversity (phylogenic complexity).</p></sec><sec id="s1a4"><title>Estimate of gain of performance when adding evOluation to PrePS.</title><p>We previously estimated that PrePS misses about 2&#x00025; of yet unknown prenylation motifs (cross-validated average sensitivity of PrePS: 98&#x00025;) while predicting only 0.1&#x00025; false positives in complete database searches (average specificity of PrePS: 99.9&#x00025;) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030066-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. This estimate for false positive predictions includes motifs that can be prenylated in vitro, while the in vivo context makes the lipid modification rather unlikely. In this work, we identified and discussed such examples (see the previous subsection Annotation of families of predicted homologous prenylation targets). We referred to these predictions as OUT-OF-CONTEXT rather than as false positives. Since there are no new cutoffs and the &#x0201c;evOluation&#x0201d; score is only used for a priority ranking of all predictions, the absolute rates of false negative and false positive predictions in PRENbase are by definition the same as those reported for the PrePS method. We do, however, show that the evOluation score widens the gap between true positives (KNOWN) and contextual false positives OUT-OF-CONTEXT in the ranking. This is visualized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030066-g002">Figure 2</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030066-t001">Table 1</xref>, and further discussed in the previous paragraphs.</p><p>To estimate the performance gain of adding the evOluation ranking compared with the standard PrePS prediction alone, we apply ROC analysis by sliding an artificial threshold over the cluster ranks and count the true positive (KNOWN) and contextual false positive (OUT-OF-CONTEXT) clusters above or below the given thresholds. This allows plotting sensitivity (100-rate of false negatives) versus specificity (100-rate of false positives) for the different methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030066-g003">Figure 3</xref>). As can be seen, the evOluation score clearly outperforms the other ranking schemes and results in a gain in contextual specificity of up to 60&#x00025; at high sensitivities compared with the standard PrePS. Apparently, random occurrences of small motifs, a typical source of false positives, are indicated by a lower conservation within their protein family, and this feature can therefore be used to further reduce false positives in the context of the biological importance of the motif for the protein. We propose that similarly significant performance gains could also be reached for other methods predicting small sequence motifs by considering the evolutionary conservation of the predicted motifs within protein families.</p></sec><sec id="s1a5"><title>PRENbase Web interface.</title><p>The manually annotated clusters/families of prenylated proteins described above are available as PRENbase.

The output can be ranked by cluster size, by the evOluation score that also takes into account the total family size in databases, or by an estimated phylogenic complexity. The default settings give access to the collection of both known and predicted eukaryotic and viral prenylated proteins, which can then be browsed. To facilitate tasks for less-experienced users, we have listed a series of standard queries that might be of particular biological interest. Queries are assigned to a unique query code that can be used to recover previous queries without having to readjust the multiple parameters of the interface. Furthermore, users can map their own sequence against PRENbase using a BLAST module linked to the PrePS server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mendel.imp.univie.ac.at/sat/PrePS/">http://mendel.imp.univie.ac.at/sat/PrePS/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s1a6"><title>HumanPRENbase.</title><p>For biomedical applications, it is of great interest to know which human proteins are particularly affected by prenyltransferase inhibitors that have already passed phase II and III clinical trials &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030066-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d; but whose molecular mode of action is not fully understood yet &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030066-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;.

The classical examples are (1) H-Ras that can only be modified by FT (hereafter, proteins of this type are called pF) and (2) K-Ras that can be a substrate of both FT and GGT1 (hereafter, pFGG). The distinction of pF- and pFGG-type proteins is critical since it helps to identify the exclusive cellular targets affected by FT inhibition (pFs) and give hints to the molecular mechanisms involved in various cancer types &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030066-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030066-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The most prominent group of prenylated oncogenes comprises members of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases.

This example shows that it is useful to clearly identify the orthologous counterparts of individual human proteins. A procedure to derive clusters of such orthologous groups is described in detail in the Materials and Methods section and has allowed the creation of a list of 242 unique human clusters with their isoforms and in-paralogues merged together in the same cluster with at least one (human) member predicted to be prenylated. We removed sequences that are less than 50&#x00025; of the length of the query sequence (in cases of multidomain proteins) to avoid ambiguous cluster assignments of short homologous sequences. Furthermore, the resulting clusters made up by the orthologues and a representative human sequence are available in a style similar to the original PRENbase. The listed status annotation is derived using the same criteria as for the general PRENbase clusters. For example, there are few members of the large Ras, Rab, and Rho families of GTPases where the prenylation has been shown directly (annotated as KNOWN). However, for many other related clusters (annotated as LIKELY), prenylation can often be safely inferred if a valid motif exists. On the other hand, clusters annotated as NEW signify that this protein family is not yet known to be prenylated and could involve a completely new mode of action for prenyltransferase inhibitors. This HumanPRENbase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mendel.imp.univie.ac.at/sat/PrePS/HumanPRENbase/">http://mendel.imp.univie.ac.at/sat/PrePS/HumanPRENbase/</ext-link>) can now be queried for the experimental status of the modification of homologues (known/new&#x02026;), and exclusive or shared types of modifying enzymes (FT, GGT1, GGT2) as well as for evolutionary conservation by constraining the taxonomic distribution within clusters or for single sequences.

Thus, a major strength of this work is the complete proteomic view of prenylation with an added evolutionary perspective. For example, by querying PRENbase for families with conserved prenylation motif in mammals, insects, nematodes, fungi, and plants, we derive a core set of only three clusters of already known prenylated proteins. These are the Rab, the Rho/Rac, and the DnaJ-like heat shock chaperone families which, therefore, could be postulated as being the oldest examples of prenylated proteins due to their most widespread taxonomic distribution. When weakening the conservation requirements and &#x0201c;only&#x0201d; considering conservation in mammals, insects, and nematodes, several other families join this list of presumably important prenylated proteins. These are (in the order of the evOluation ranking): the Ras/Ral/Rap family, the Lamin B cluster (linking also more generally coiled coil proteins), a cluster of mixed serine/threonine kinases, geranylgeranylated G gamma subunits, protein tyrosine phosphatase IVA, protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 16 (in cluster with other Ankyrin domain containing proteins), as well as phosphorylase B kinase &#x003b1;&#x0002b;&#x003b2; subunits. Although spread over multiple clusters due to their sequence diversity, fungal mating factors/pheromones compose another large functionally related group of prenylated proteins.</p><p>In contrast to the examples above where the prenylation site is highly conserved among various taxa, there are many cases where the predicted prenylation is specific to taxonomic lineages or even single species. Nevertheless, this posttranslational modification can be an important requirement for function of the respective proteins. Therefore, the smaller clusters that can be found in PRENbase also merit deeper investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>&#x0201c;The Mother of Ras&#x0201d;</title><p>It is no surprise that the small GTPase families, well-known for their prenylation, top the evolutionary ranked lists in PRENbase.

The Rab family &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030066-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d; is not only the most populated one in PRENbase (followed by the Rho/Rac subfamily), but it also has a much wider taxonomic distribution.

Although highly speculative and by no means unambiguously conclusive, one can attempt to narrow down the candidates for closest living relatives of the common ancestor of Ras GTPases by searching for the taxonomically most conserved individual Ras-related proteins. In HumanPRENbase, the respective hits are (in decreasing order of the phylogeny-based ranking): Rab1B, Rab7, Rac1, and Rab6A. So the &#x0201c;mother of Ras&#x0201d; would have been more likely to be related to Rab or Rac proteins nowadays. Since Rab proteins are typically dually geranylgeranylated by the type II prenyltransferase GGT2 and both Ras and Rac proteins are specifically processed by type I prenyltransferases FT and GGT1, the similarity of substrate characteristics would point to a closer relationship of Rac to Ras, rather than to Rab proteins. In agreement with the co-clustering of Ras and Rac proteins in phylogenetic tree analyses, including other Rab and more distantly related GTPases, Ras proteins appear to have emerged from a common ancestor shared with the Rho/Rac family.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>The Anonymous &#x0201c;Known&#x0201d; Group of Plant Copper Chaperones</title><p>In our predictions for prenylated protein families, we find a large group of 88 homologous plant proteins that are annotated to be metal-binding copper chaperones spread over 21 clusters.

Surprisingly, we find several proteins that are related to ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation.</p><p>One of these groups comprises some ubiquitin-like proteins. In particular, UBL3 and its prenylation motif are not only conserved in organisms from mammals to insects and worms but, apparently, also in some fungi and plants. Fitting into the related functional context of ubiquitin-mediated degradation, it is also interesting to observe predicted prenylation for several ubiquitin hydrolases. For example, ubiquitin specific protease 32 is conserved in mammals, pufferfish, and insects with a domain architecture of an N-terminal EF-hand domain, a central DUF1055 domain, followed by a C-terminal ubiquitin hydrolase domain which finally precedes the conserved prenylation motif. Furthermore, we predict several fungal proteins that have a carboxy-terminal ubiquitin hydrolase domain in addition to a prenylation motif. Interestingly, there also exists an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme with conserved prenylation motif in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice.</p><p>The connection of prenylation and protein degradation continues with the prediction of a prenylation site in F-box and leucine-rich repeat proteins, with FBL2 being conserved in organisms from mammals to insects, worms, and fungi.

On the other hand, the FT restriction also represents a possible vulnerability to FT inhibitors.</p><p>Given the above listed ambiguities, one cannot conclude with certainty whether a specific prenyl anchor length is important for a protein family based on the evolutionary variability of substrate preferences. However, in a taxonomically widely conserved family, a clear preference for farnesylation could still indicate a length dependency and, consequently, a requirement of farnesyl for specific protein&#x02013;protein interactions. In HumanPRENbase, besides the above mentioned G gamma 1 and 2, the following families fall under these criteria: nucleosome assembly protein 1-like 1, prickle-like 1, phosphorylase kinase &#x003b2;, FLJ32421/BROFTI, RasD2/Rhes, RhoH, Rab28 long isoform, RhoQ, EH domain binding protein 1, DnaJ-homolog A4, 72kDa inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase E, and WD&#x0002b;tetratricopeptide repeats protein 1.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Conclusions</title><p>PRENbase provides (1) a review of previous knowledge of known and likely prenylated proteins resulting in the rediscovery of the large group of prenylated metal-binding chaperones in plants; (2) target lists for experimental validation of newly predicted prenylation are ranked by evolutionary conservation, which leads to the notion that several proteins involved in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation could be prenylated; (3) lists of possible targets for FT inhibition (human proteins that are unique substrates of FT and not GGT1 or GGT2) with the experimental evidence for Prickle1, Prickle2, the BRO1-domain-containing FLJ32421 (termed BROFTI), and Rab28 (short isoform); (4) lists of dual FT/GGT substrates that are essentially not affected by FT inhibition or that can receive an altered anchor type under FT inhibition; (5) a list of viral proteins possibly processed by eukaryotic host enzymes, most notably two proteins from Mimivirus; as well as (6) examples of the importance of specific farnesyl anchor length (clusters that only include FT but not GGT1 or GGT2 substrates) that could be indicative of involvement in protein&#x02013;protein interactions.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>PRENbase family clustering procedure.</title><p>In MYRbase, sequences with higher than 40&#x00025; sequence identity have been clustered into protein families. This rather conservative threshold is reasonable to infer similarity of biological function &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030066-b055">55</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030066-b057">57</xref>&#x0005d; with confidence, but frequently leads to spreading protein families with many remotely similar members and from phylogenetically distant taxa over several clusters. In the case of PRENbase, we applied the MCL procedure to unite many of these clusters &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030066-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d; and to facilitate a more comprehensive phylogenetic comparison. The use of BLAST &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030066-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d; allows finding more remote homologues, but simple single linkage clustering based merely on significant BLAST similarity cannot account for the multidomain modular architecture of proteins. For example, frequently occurring regulatory domains (such as SH3) can appear in different contexts with other domains. Therefore, proteins with different functions would be clustered together according to their similarity in such a single overlapping domain hit. These problems seem to have been largely overcome by the MCL algorithm &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030066-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d; that allows for a certain flexibility of intercluster BLAST connections that are weaker than respective average intracluster links. More precisely, the MCL method understands sequences as nodes in a graph with edges between nodes weighted by the negative logarithm of the BLAST E-value of the two sequences (the average of backward and forward searches); hence, their sequence similarity. The graph is transformed into a matrix with edge weights being normalized to probabilities of walking between nodes. When simulating random walks within the graph, walks within clusters are much more likely than walks between clusters. Through iterative expansion and inflation of the matrix (until the matrix essentially remains unaltered by further iterations), the links within clusters are strengthened and intercluster connections downweighted.</p><p>To cluster predicted proteins into their natural families independent of the existence/prediction of a lipid anchor, we have executed BLAST searches (E-value 0.005) starting with the 5,410 predicted proteins against the same complete database from which the predictions were derived (NCBI's NR with 2,179,151 entries, based on GenBank/GenPept version 144). Using the measured BLAST similarity as input for MCL &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030066-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;, with the inflation parameter I set to 5.0 (for fine-grained clusterings, best precision in a benchmark of clustering SCOP families &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030066-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;), we obtain 1,024 clusters. For comparison, single linkage clustering of the 5410 proteins at an E-value threshold of 0.005 would result in 615 clusters, merging several clusters compared with the MCL clustering.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>HumanPRENbase orthologue clustering.</title><p>We first generated a list of human proteins that are predicted to be prenylated by at least one of the three enzymes FT, GGT1, and GGT2 by running PrePS over NCBI's NR. Then, we determined the orthologues in other organisms with the condition of best reciprocal BLAST hits. The algorithm employed here follows in the steps of earlier methods to detect orthology and paralogy relationships &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030066-b058">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030066-b059">59</xref>&#x0005d;, employing the definition of orthologues and in-paralogues as in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030066-b060">60</xref>&#x0005d;. This scheme, however, is not straightforward due to several problems. First, the reciprocal similarity search started with the nonhuman organism might find an isoform or in-paralogue (duplication has occurred after the last speciation event) of the initial human query as best hit. We have found that a threshold of greater than or equal to 98&#x00025; identity (within the aligned segments) is a reasonable threshold with which to classify isoforms. In-paralogues were identified as human proteins that occur as BLAST hits with an E-value smaller than E-50 (this threshold is set to limit the number of noninformative reciprocal BLASTs) and that find the initial query or find one of its known isoforms in a reciprocal BLAST before proteins of any nonhuman species. Finally, we define orthologues as proteins that are the best hits of their species to a human query protein and that in a back-BLAST find either the initial query or its isoforms or in-paralogues as best human hit.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Construct production and cloning.</title><p>We generated plasmids containing GST and pEGFP fusions of all genes studied in this work. The cDNAs of Rab28 short isoform and FLJ32421/BROFTI were cloned into the pGEX5X1-vector, thereby creating N-terminal GST-fusion proteins. Since the cDNAs received for Prickle1 and Prickle2 did not match or only partially matched the desired sequence, we used oligonucleotides representing the last 15 residues at the C-terminus instead. The Stratagene QuikChange XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit was used to introduce a cysteine-to-alanine mutation in the CaaX motif. Since this residue is the site of covalent thioether linkage of the isoprenoid modification, the ability to become modified should be abolished. Both wild-type and mutant cDNA of Rab28 short isoform and FLJ32421/BROFTI were also cloned into the pEGFP C2 vector. For Prickle2, we used a C-terminal fragment representing the last 338 residues at the C-terminus, which is the longest matching sequence we had available. The N-terminal GFP-fusion proteins were used to investigate the subcellular localization in transiently transfected HeLa cells. No GFP-construct of Prickle1 was cloned, since the localization of the last 15 amino acids would not have been representative at all.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>In vitro prenylation assay.</title><p>The cDNA of the GST fusion proteins was amplified by PCR and transcribed and translated in vitro using the Promega TNT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation Kit in the presence of the radioactive label of choice (typically, 20 &#x003bc;Ci &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;mevalonic acid, 10 &#x003bc;Ci &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;FPP, or &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;GGPP, all purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.arc-inc.com">http://www.arc-inc.com</ext-link>).
