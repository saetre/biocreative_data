Although definitive hematopoiesis has been extensively studied, the development of primitive myeloid blood has received far less attention. In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, primitive myeloid cells originate in the anterior ventral blood islands, the equivalent of the mammalian yolk sac, and migrate out to colonize the embryo. Using fluorescence time-lapse video microscopy, we recorded the migratory behavior of primitive myeloid cells from their birth. We show that these cells are the first blood cells to differentiate in the embryo and that they are efficiently recruited to embryonic wounds, well before the establishment of a functional vasculature. Furthermore, we isolated <italic>spib</italic>, an ETS transcription factor, specifically expressed in primitive myeloid precursors. Using <italic>spib</italic> antisense morpholino knockdown experiments, we show that <italic>spib</italic> is required for myeloid specification, and, in its absence, primitive myeloid cells retain hemangioblast-like characteristics and fail to migrate. Thus, we conclude that <italic>spib</italic> sits at the top of the known genetic hierarchy that leads to the specification of primitive myeloid cells in amphibians.</p></abstract><contract-sponsor id="CS200" xlink:href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/">Wellcome Trust</contract-sponsor></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The existence of embryonic macrophage-like cells has been reported in all animal models and its conservation suggests important roles during development. Studies in zebrafish and <italic>Xenopus</italic> have provided important insights into the mechanisms responsible for primitive hematopoiesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref></sup> Until recently, however, most of these studies have focused on the specification and differentiation of primitive erythrocytes. Comparatively, little is known about the mechanisms and gene networks responsible for the development of primitive macrophages and neutrophils. In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, primitive myeloid cells arise from the anterior ventral blood island (aVBI), the embryonic region equivalent to the zebrafish anterior lateral plate mesoderm (ALPM) and the mammalian yolk sac. In zebrafish, the ALPM, which contains the primitive myeloid-forming compartment, is physically separated from the primitive erythroid-forming compartment, the posterior lateral plate mesoderm (PLPM). However in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, the primitive myeloid-forming aVBI, is juxtaposed next to the erythroid-forming compartment, the posterior ventral blood island (pVBI). In both fish and frogs, these tissues arise from distinct locations in the embryo. Whereas the pVBI and PLPM arise from ventral gastrula mesoderm, the aVBI and ALPM arise from dorsal gastrula mesoderm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref></sup> Experiments using a variety of model organisms have pointed to a conserved gene regulatory network leading to hematopoietic specification, with the transcription factor <italic>scl</italic> representing one of the central genes in the hematopoietic specification cascade.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref></sup> In frog embryos, <italic>scl</italic> expression appears first in the aVBI and only at a later time point in the pVBI with its characteristic V shape. At stage 20, as <italic>scl</italic> expression is down-regulated and restricted to bilateral stripes in the aVBI, <italic>scl</italic> is concomitantly up-regulated in the pVBI forming the tissue that will give rise to the first erythroid cells. The analysis of gene expression profiles and distinct origins of the aVBI and pVBI reveals 2 distinct temporal hematopoietic events that occur in juxtaposed mesodermal tissues. The aVBI tissue at the neurula stage also expresses other transcription factors typical of both hematopoietic and endothelial lineages such as <italic>fli1, lmo2, runx1</italic>, or <italic>hhex</italic> and the coexpression of these markers represents the hemangioblast stem cell&#x02013;like state.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref></sup> Very little is know about the transcriptional regulation that controls primitive myelopoiesis in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, however it has been shown in zebrafish that the balance between primitive myelopoiesis and primitive erythropoiesis is dictated by the antagonistic interplay between the activity of 2 transcription factors <italic>spi1</italic> (also known as <italic>pu.1</italic>), which promotes myelopoiesis, and <italic>gata1</italic>, which promotes erythropoiesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref></sup> To date, neither <italic>spi1</italic> nor any other specific regulator of primitive myeloid development has been characterized in <italic>Xenopus</italic>.

Interestingly, no shift in the expression pattern of these genes into the anterior primitive myeloid compartment was detected, nor was a premature expression of hematopoietic genes in the posterior compartment (Figure S3). Therefore, when the differentiation of primitive myeloid cells was impaired, this did not result in an anterior shift or premature erythroid differentiation. Thus, we conclude that blocking myeloid differentiation, by eliminating <italic>spib</italic> function, did not interfere either with primitive erythroid lineage differentiation or the balance between primitive erythroid and myeloid-forming compartments as assayed by WMISH.</p></sec><sec><title>Retention of hemangioblast-like characteristics in <italic>spib</italic>-depleted embryos</title><p>One possible model to explain the phenotype we observed in <italic>spib</italic>-depleted embryos is that, as primitive myeloid progenitor differentiation is blocked, cell migration away from the aVBI is impaired and progenitor cells remain in an earlier state of hematopoietic differentiation.

To analyze whether primitive progenitors were &#x0201c;stuck&#x0201d; in an earlier cellular stage of hematopoietic differentiation, we analyzed the expression of (1) postulated hemangioblast markers such as <italic>scl</italic> and <italic>fli1</italic>, (2) hematopoietic stem cell markers such as <italic>scl, lmo2</italic>, and <italic>runx1</italic>, (3) endothelial differentiation markers such as <italic>fli1</italic> and <italic>kdr</italic>, or (4) the erythroid marker <italic>gata1</italic>.

In situ hybridization analysis of <sup>spib</sup>e1i1<sub>10ng</sub> and <sup>spib</sup>ATG<sub>10ng</sub> morphants indicated that a triangle-shaped expression domain of <italic>scl</italic> and <italic>fli1</italic> was retained at the border between aVBI and pVBI at stage 22, whereas all other markers analyzed to date were unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>J-O black and white arrowheads). In this small area, expression of <italic>scl</italic> and <italic>fli1</italic> has normally been down-regulated by stages 22 and 23 (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>J-K and M-N). Retention of <italic>scl</italic> and <italic>fli1</italic> expression is suggestive of retention of hemangioblast-like characteristics.

At stage 26, no differences in the expression of <italic>scl</italic> and <italic>fli1</italic> can be observed between <italic>spib</italic>-depleted and control embryos (Figure S3 and data not shown). We also did not observe differences in the pattern of expression of the hematopoietic stem cell markers <italic>runx1</italic> and <italic>lmo2</italic>. Overall, these results suggest that in the absence of <italic>spib</italic> function primitive myeloid progenitors are blocked in their normal differentiation and migration, and they retain for a period of 2 to 3 hours hemangioblast-like characteristics in a small subset of aVBI cells, which would have otherwise differentiated into primitive myeloid cells.</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Analysis of migratory potential and hemangioblast-like characteristics of primitive myeloid progenitors in <italic>spib</italic>-depleted embryos</bold>.
