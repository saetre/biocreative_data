We have previously quantified SV40 large T antigen expressed over a several fold range in different cell lines and correlated the average number of molecules to average fluorescence obtained by cytometry and determined cell cycle phase related expression by calculation from multi-parametric cytometry data. Using a modified approach, we report quantification of endogenous cyclin B1 and generation of the cell cycle time related expression profile.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology</title><p>Recombinant cyclin B1 was purified from a baculovirus lysate using an antibody affinity column and concentrated. We created fixed cell preparations from nocodazole-treated (high cyclin B1) and serum starved (low cyclin B1) PC3 cells that were either lyophilized (for preservation) or solubilized. The lysates and purified cyclin B1 were subjected to Western blotting; the cell preparations were subjected to cytometry, and fluorescence was correlated to molecules. Three untreated cell lines (K562, HeLa, and RKO) were prepared for cytometry without lyophilization and also prepared for Western blotting. These were quantified by Western blotting and by cytometry using the standard cell preparations.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The standard cell preparations had 1.5&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> to 2.5&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> molecules of cyclin B1 per cell on average (i.e., 16-fold range). The average coefficient of variation was 24&#x00025;. Fluorescence varied 12-fold. The relationship between molecules/cell (Western blot) and immunofluorescence (cytometry) was linear (r<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.87). Average cyclin B1 levels for the three untreated cell lines determined by Western blotting and cytometry agreed within a factor of 2. The non-linear rise in cyclin B1 in S phase was quantified from correlated plots of cyclin B1 and DNA content. The peak levels achieved in G2 were similar despite differences in lineage, growth conditions, and rates of increase through the cell cycle (range: 1.6&#x02013;2.2&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> molecules per cell).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Net cyclin B1 expression begins in G1 in human somatic cells lines; increases non-linearly with variation in rates of accumulation, but peaks at similar peak values in different cell lines growing under different conditions.

In general this knowledge is communicated with cartoons coupled with somewhat tortured text to create a sense of understanding. Most of this knowledge is not quantitative and the limited quantitative knowledge is based on relative measurements. In recent years, momentum and enthusiasm has grown for more integrated systems approaches to the study of cell biology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007064-Hood1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. One cornerstone of these &#x0201c;Systems Biology&#x0201d; efforts is mathematical modeling of the regulatory biochemical network of the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007064-vanRiel1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Our short term purpose for the work reported here is to transform cytometry data into non-relative measurements. The long term goal is to create a robust system of measurement on an absolute scale that supplies the information that these systems efforts require.</p><p>Quantification of specific cell protein contents is generally measured and reported as relative values. There are exceptions and these usually involve incorporating purified proteins as standards in immunoblotting methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007064-Yu1">&#x0005b;e.g., 3&#x0005d;</xref>, measuring fluorescence of fluorescent proteins (FP) or of FP-fusion proteins and external fluorescent protein standards on the same instrument <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007064-Xu1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, and mass spectrometry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007064-Bantscheff1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Only the FP method provides single cell resolution. We have previously coupled the immunoblot approach with cell line standards, expressing different levels of SV40 large T antigen (Tag) expressed over a several fold range, to create a method whereby protein expression could be quantified in absolute terms (molecules per cell) and correlated with any other parameter by multi-parametric cytometry of the same cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007064-Frisa1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The method relied on correlating the average Tag-specific fluorescence with the Optical Density (OD) of the Tag band on western blots into which recombinant, purified SV40 Tag was also incorporated. Because cytometry was used, this was also a single cell method.</p><p>Here we report that we have extended this procedure to a protein that oscillates during the cell cycle, cyclin B1. SV40 T antigen is a long-lived protein expressed throughout the cell cycle when expressed from its own promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007064-Lehman1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> or from recombinant promoters from other viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007064-Frisa2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007064-Sladek1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Overall, Tag is in equilibrium at an expression rate that ranges less than two fold as a ratio of the average G2 to average G1 cell. On the other hand, cyclin B1 ranges from an undetectable level in early G1 to 1000's fold over the earliest detectable levels with a very sharp, non-linear rise in late S and G2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007064-Jacobberger1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. We faced several challenges for cyclin B1. First, we did not have an obvious strategy to create cell lines that expressed the protein over the many-fold range necessary to create a standard curve. Second, the antibodies available to detect it had significantly lower affinity than the Tag antibody; third, related to the first, cyclin B1 was thought to be expressed at low levels compared to a stable, promiscuously expressed protein like Tag. Finally, we did not know whether the fluorescence averaging method would work well when a large number of the cells were not expressing the protein. In principle, this shouldn't matter, but coupled with the relatively low expression of cyclin B1, a significant fraction of the fluorescence signal is background. The last three problems are all related and depend on the quality of the antibody.</p><p>Other investigators have measured cyclin B1 levels in HeLa cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007064-Xu1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007064-Arooz1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, mouse and Xenopus oocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007064-KanatsuShinohara1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007064-Kobayashi1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, and yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007064-Cross1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. The methods and results vary significantly. Here, we report results for Hela, RKO, and K562. The methods used to quantify were substantially different in each case and the direct comparisons of Hela cells are not in agreement. The results of Xu et al. agree with our results within two-fold. The results of Arooz et al. are different by a large factor. It is not clear whether this is technical or biological, although the difference in magnitude seems too great to be biological, and examination of methodological points wherein differences might occur on the order of two-fold doesn't account for the orders of magnitude difference in results.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Effect of Protein Concentration on Immunoblot Detection of Purified Cyclin B1</title><p>Our previous experience with SV40 large T antigen (Tag) showed that there were two important facets to Western blotting that should be addressed for molecular quantification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007064-Frisa1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p><underline>The quantity of protein loaded</underline> becomes important because the purified recombinant proteins need to be applied as a dilution series to create the standard. Protein content per sample affects the distance a protein runs and the intensity of the band transferred to the paper. Previously, we used NIH 3T3 cell lysates to equalize the total protein levels in the recombinant dilutions of Tag. For cyclin B1, we needed a non-replicating cell source or a replicating source from a non-cross reacting species. Since either of these would involve some difficulty, we investigated use of a single, purified protein in lieu of cell lysates. We tried three different proteins. A typical Western blot for trypsin inhibitor is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007064-g001">Figure 1A</xref>. In this experiment, a constant amount of recombinant cyclin B1 was mixed with variable amounts of trypsin inhibitor, which, at 21.5 kDa, migrates faster than cyclin B1 during electrophoresis. The intensity of the cyclin B1 band changed in the expected manner as a function of trypsin inhibitor concentration. The results of 3 experiments were combined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007064-g001">Figure 1B</xref> and show that 25&#x02013;50 &#x000b5;g of trypsin inhibitor provide an optimal cyclin B1 signal. Beta-galactosidase, which migrates slower than cyclin B1, showed the same pattern of increase in cyclin B1 intensity as trypsin inhibitor. BSA, which migrates at about the level of cyclin B1, interfered with cyclin B1 migration. In subsequent work, trypsin inhibitor was added to the recombinant cyclin B1 and the cells lysates to bring the total protein in each electrophoretic lane to 50 &#x000b5;g/lane. We conclude that adding a purified protein is an efficient way to optimize for protein concentration effect, however, the type and amount appears empirical. For example, similar experiments for Tag showed peak detection at 1.5 &#x000b5;g added &#x003b2;-galactosidase.</p><fig id="pone-0007064-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007064.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Protein level affects epitope detection.</title><p>(A) A fixed amount of purified cyclin B1 (6.36 ng) was added to a serial dilution of trypsin inhibitor (TI) and subjected to electrophoresis and Western blotting. (B) Relative intensity of the cyclin B1 bands is presented corresponding to trypsin inhibitor levels. Cyclin B1 intensity was maximal at 25&#x02013;50 &#x000b5;g trypsin inhibitor and decreased at lower and higher protein levels. Densitometry readings from 3 experiments and 6 gels were combined by normalizing by linear regression on measurements common to each paired series. The number of common points ranged from 6 to 8. The combined set was then normalized to the 500 TI mean value, therefore the Y axis can be read as fold over this value.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0007064.g001"/></fig><p><underline>The method of cell lysis</underline> is the second major variable. The validity of quantitative Western blotting is dependent on solubilization of all or most of the protein under study. This was difficult for Tag because a significant fraction of Tag is tightly bound to the nuclear matrix. To test whether cyclin B1 posed similar problems, lysis buffers of different strengths were used to extract cyclin B1 from PC3 and DU145 prostate cell lines. RIPA, 0.75&#x00025; Triton X-100, and 1, 5, and 23&#x00025; SDS did not show major reproducible differences in cyclin B1 solubilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007064-g002">Figure 2</xref>) indicating that it is not tightly bound to insoluble cellular structures. This was verified in additional experiments in which cyclin B1 was not detectable by immunofluorescence cytometry or Western blot of cells after Triton X-100 permeabilization and washing (data not shown). SDS at 1&#x00025; was used in subsequent work.</p><fig id="pone-0007064-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007064.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Extraction of cyclin B1 in various lysis buffers.</title><p>Equal numbers of dissociated PC3 cells were solubilized in lysis buffer containing RIPA, Triton X-100 or SDS (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>) and analyzed for cyclin B1 by Western blot (A).

There was some variability between lanes but, based on multiple gels, it was clear that cyclin B1 was readily extracted by all methods.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0007064.g002"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Manipulation of Cyclin B1 Levels in Cell Lines</title><p>Our perception was that relative average levels of cyclin B1 do not vary over a wide range between human cell lines or stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes. Therefore, to create cell preparations with a wider range, we manipulated the <underline>average</underline> expression of cyclin B1 for cell populations by altering growth conditions. Cyclin B1 is expressed at levels at or below the level of detection in early-mid G1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007064-Viallard1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007064-Viallard2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> and is thought to be essentially absent in G0, therefore, growing cells to confluency or serum starvation should decrease the average expression of cyclin B1. Conversely, growing cells at a low density (3000&#x02013;5000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>) enhances growth rate and therefore increases the number of cells in G2 and M, during which cyclin B1 levels peak. These extremes resulted in 3 and 4 fold ranges in average cyclin B1 expression for DU145 and PC3, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007064-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). To obtain populations with higher average levels of cyclin B1, DU145 and PC3 cells were treated with nocodazole to arrest cells in metaphase. Cyclin B1 is normally at or near peak levels in metaphase. Additionally, when cells are synchronized by any of several methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007064-Gong1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007064-Darzynkiewicz1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> or arrested with nocodazole (this paper), cyclin B1 levels per cell increase to supra-normal levels as a function of time. Compared to confluent cultures, cyclin B1 intensity of treated DU145 cells increased 18 fold at 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007064-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).

The range of the purified cyclin B1 and the number of cells per lane were adjusted so that each cell band was within the range of the purified standards. Each lane was adjusted to equal protein content by adding trypsin inhibitor. A representative Western blot of recombinant cyclin B1 with some standard cell preparations is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007064-g005">Figure 5A</xref>. To quantify Tag, we had adjusted the standard and the amount of cell lysate to give a narrow range of intensities to accommodate the narrow linear range of X-ray film. For cyclin B1 we used direct chemiluminescence detection with the FluorS MultiImager, which is linear over 3 orders of magnitude, so a wide range standard curve could be generated. The relationship between band intensity and the amount of cyclin B1 applied to each lane was determined by linear regression. The band intensity, the number of cells per lane, the regression slope and intercept, and the molecular weight of cyclin B1 were then used to calculate the average number of cyclin B1 molecules per cell for each standard cell lysate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007064-t001">Table 1</xref>).

These cells were used for subtraction of non-specific binding of antibody and autofluorescence (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials &#x00026; Methods</xref>). The range of average specific fluorescence values for the standard cell preparations was &#x0223c;12 fold (highest/lowest), while the range of average cyclin B1 levels by Western blots was &#x0223c;16 fold for the same samples.

This equates to a 1.3 fold difference in range ratio here and an &#x0223c;6 fold range ratio previously (Western range/cytometry range). We interpret this to indicate that the cytometry here was improved over the previous study. The Tag study differed with (1) a higher affinity antibody, (2) secondary immunostaining, (3) fluorescein as the fluorophore (compared to Alexa Fluor 647), and (4) X-ray film (compared to CCD camera). Of these, it seems likely that use of the brighter Alexa Fluor antibody that provides more photons in a spectral region with less autofluorescence, and perhaps less non-specific antibody staining (the antibody is used at a significantly lower staining level and the fluor does not carry a net charge). Analysis of the same standard cell preparations for cyclin B1 in this study using primary or secondary immunostaining with fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated antibodies displayed only an approximately 2 fold range ratio, supporting this idea.

Determination of molecules by cytometry and the standard curve agreed with Western blotting for K562 (cytometry&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1.2 X Western). However, for RKO, the cytometry/standard curve method produced a mean that was 2.2 X that of the Western blots. For HeLa cells, cytometry&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.4 X Western. These differences are acceptable when compared to other efforts to measure cyclin B1 (see below), and the values fall within the 95&#x00025; prediction interval for the standard curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007064-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). However, the error seem biased for the RKO and HeLa determinations. Rather than being distributed evenly, all determinations except one fall on one side or the other of the calculated correlation. If this bias is real, we do not know the source, however, for HeLa cells we have a speculative explanation. The HeLa sample was very confluent with 92&#x00025; of the cells in G1. This means that a majority of the cells express levels of cyclin B1 that are below the threshold of detection by cytometry (this is estimated to be below 3&#x02013;5&#x00025; of the maximum expression of cyclin B1 for HeLa cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007064-Soni1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>). In this case, the higher sensitivity of Western blotting could result in measuring the population average of cyclin B1, whereas cytometry will register a large fraction of cells as zero (on average). If this is substantiated, this approach is limited when populations have high fractions of cells that express biomarker levels near the threshold of detection by cytometry. Also, if substantiated, it may be possible to derive a correction for this, at least for cyclin B1 and similar epitopes, by determining the relationship between degree of underestimate and cell density.</p><fig id="pone-0007064-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007064.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Test cell lines.</title><p>Samples of HeLa, K562, and RKO were fixed with methanol then stained for cyclin B1 with GNS1-AlexaFluor 647 (A647) and DNA (DAPI).

This should also be within the committed part of G1, although this is speculative. It may be useful to note that despite the fact that these are three highly cultured human tumor cell lines of different lineages (myeloid, colon, cervical) and even though the HeLa cells were growing very slowly as a population, the end point cyclin B1 levels are remarkably close.

There is a very wide range of levels reported and some uncertainty about the exact size of the cells within any one study, but if we either use the reported concentrations or use cell size values that are reasonable, the resulting cyclin B1 concentrations fall into groups with a difference of 3 orders of magnitude between them.

Cyclin B1 was eluted with 1M sodium propionate, 150 mM NaCl, 10&#x00025; dioxane, and 0.5&#x00025; NP40 at pH 5.0 (solution E). A shallow gradient to 50&#x00025; solution E followed by a steep gradient to 100&#x00025; solution E was used to collect fractions. Samples were frozen in dry ice/ethanol and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. Fractions were monitored by Western blotting. Cyclin B1 fractions were pooled and concentrated in 30K MW MSI Ultrafuge (Westboro, MA) centrifuge filters. The concentrate was subjected to anion exchange chromatography as follows. Pooled fractions were re-equilibrated in solution A without NP-40 (EconoPac 10 DG, BioRad) then concentrated in MSI Ultrafuge or Millipore (Bedford, MA) Ultrafree-4 centrifuge filters and mixed with a Macro-Prep High Q Support (BioRad) anion exchange resin in solution A.
