They negatively regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally by translational repression and target mRNA degradation. miRNAs have been shown to play crucial roles in muscle development and in regulation of muscle cell proliferation and differentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>By comparing miRNA expression profiling of proliferating myoblasts versus differentiated myotubes, a number of modulated miRNAs, not previously implicated in regulation of myogenic differentiation, were identified. Among these, miR-221 and miR-222 were strongly down-regulated upon differentiation of both primary and established myogenic cells. Conversely, miR-221 and miR-222 expression was restored in post-mitotic, terminally differentiated myotubes subjected to Src tyrosine kinase activation. By the use of specific inhibitors we provide evidence that expression of miR-221 and miR-222 is under the control of the Ras-MAPK pathway. Both in myoblasts and in myotubes, levels of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 inversely correlated with miR-221 and miR-222 expression, and indeed we show that p27 mRNA is a direct target of these miRNAs in myogenic cells. Ectopic expression of miR-221 and miR-222 in myoblasts undergoing differentiation induced a delay in withdrawal from the cell cycle and in myogenin expression, followed by inhibition of sarcomeric protein accumulation. When miR-221 and miR-222 were expressed in myotubes undergoing maturation, a profound alteration of myofibrillar organization was observed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>miR-221 and miR-222 have been found to be modulated during myogenesis and to play a role both in the progression from myoblasts to myocytes and in the achievement of the fully differentiated phenotype. Identification of miRNAs modulating muscle gene expression is crucial for the understanding of the circuits controlling skeletal muscle differentiation and maintenance.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Skeletal myogenesis requires the occurrence of specific coordinated events, including exit from the cell cycle, transcription of muscle-specific proteins, fusion into polynucleated fibers and assembly of the contractile apparatus. Such complex processes are regulated at multiple levels.

To search for miRNAs specifically modulated during the progression from myoblasts to myotubes and in myotubes subjected to Src-induced perturbation, a miRNA expression profile was determined by quantitative real-time PCR in proliferating myoblasts maintained at 35&#x000b0;C in DM, in myoblasts allowed to differentiate for 48 hours at 41&#x000b0;C in DM, and myotubes differentiated at 41&#x000b0;C for 30 hours and then shifted to 35&#x000b0;C for 18 hours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007607.s001">Table S1</xref>). Novel miRNAs, not previously described as linked to myogenic differentiation, were identified and, among them, we chose all miRNAs showing a degree of modulation between myoblasts and myotubes bigger than eight-fold, and a selected group of microRNAs modulated to a lesser extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007607-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Expression of miR-16, previously found to be unaffected by muscle differentiation, was used to normalize different samples and microRNA modulation was expressed as fold increase or decrease in myotubes, compared to myoblasts. Two miRNAs, miR-135a and miR-367, were strongly up-regulated in differentiated myotubes to an extent comparable to that measured for miR-1 and miR-133a, previously shown to be specifically up-regulated in differentiated murine muscle cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007607-Chen2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

Other members of the miR-29-family, namely miR29a and miR29c, although occupying chromosomal positions adjacent to miR-29b, were down-modulated to a lesser extent.

In this context, we investigated whether this pathway was also involved in the regulation of miR-221/222 expression. Therefore, QMb-ts were treated at 35&#x000b0;C with the MEK inhibitor U0126, or infected with adenoviruses expressing RasN17, a dominant negative Ras mutant, or GFP as control. After 2 days, myoblasts were analyzed for expression of miR-221/222 and miR-1 and for the accumulation of p27 and muscle-specific proteins. Inhibition of the Ras-MAPK pathway by RasN17 or U0126 efficiently inhibited accumulation of miR-221/222 and induced expression of miR-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007607-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>) concomitantly to that of p27 protein and sarcomeric myosin and &#x003b1;-actinin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007607-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). Note that the levels of miR-221/222 following block of Ras-MAPK pathway are comparable to those observed in myotubes at 41&#x000b0;C, further supporting the central role played by the Ras-MAPK pathway in controlling expression of miR-221/222 downstream of Src. In order to verify whether this pathway was involved in miR-221/222 regulation independently of proliferation, QMb-ts myotubes were subjected to Src activation in the presence of U0126 and analyzed for the expression of miR-221/222 and miR-1.

By comparing miRNA expression profiling of proliferating quail embryo myoblasts and terminally differentiated myotubes, we identified a number of miRNAs strongly modulated upon differentiation that had not been previously described in other myogenic cell contexts. Two of them in particular, miR-221 and miR-222, were down-regulated during differentiation in all myogenic cells examined. Expression of miR-221 and miR-222 was restored in post-mitotic avian myotubes subjected to activation of thermolabile Src kinase, a finding that correlates with the consistently elevated levels of miR-222 expression observed in human muscle disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007607-Eisenberg1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> and in muscles of 3- and 18-months-old <italic>mdx</italic> dystrophic mice (B. C., L. C. and G. F., unpublished observations). Together, these findings strongly suggest that miR-222 plays a role in muscle cell damage. miR-221 and miR-222 are both up-regulated in several tumor-derived cell lines and in cancer patients and recent studies suggest that miR-221 and miR-222 promote cell cycle progression of tumor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007607-Ciafre1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007607-Pallante1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, we found that expression of miR-221/222 can be induced in a post-mitotic context, thus in a proliferation-independent fashion.</p><p>miR-221/222 have been shown to control protein levels of the cell-cycle inhibitors p27 and p57 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007607-Galardi1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007607-Visone1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007607-Fornari1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007607-Medina1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Here we report that also in myogenic cells the coordinated expression of miR-221 and miR-222 inversely correlates with the expression of p27 and demonstrate that p27 is a direct target of both miRNAs in myoblasts. In contrast, no down-modulation of p57 was observed in myotubes from mouse myoblasts over-expressing miR-221/222; moreover, the avian p57 mRNA homologue does not appear to harbor putative target sequences for miR-221 and miR-222 (B. C., L. C. and G. F., unpublished observations). Over-expression of miR-221/222 in myoblasts undergoing differentiation, while hampering p27 accumulation and inducing a transient delay in the exit from the cell cycle, was not sufficient to maintain myoblast proliferation. Our findings are in keeping with the observation that in tumor cells reduced expression of p27 is not sufficient to sustain active cell proliferation in the absence of growth factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007607-Medina1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Beyond contributing to modulation of cell proliferation, novel regulatory functions of miR-221 and miR-222 are described in progression and achievement of full myogenic differentiation. Indeed, forced expression of miR-221/222 both in myoblasts induced to differentiate and in post-mitotic myocytes caused a diminished accumulation of muscle specific proteins and modification of cellular morphology. Moreover, both avian and mammalian myotubes displayed defects in sarcomere assembly, a specific trait of the fully differentiated phenotype. Having established that p27 is a target of miR-221 and miR-222 in myoblasts and is down-modulated by miR-221/222 unscheduled expression in post-mitotic myocytes, the question arises of whether inhibition of p27 expression accounts for the observed defects of myogenic differentiation. It was previously reported that abrogation of p27 in C2C12 myoblasts reduces fusion and expression of muscle myosin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007607-Messina1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, although overall morphology and assembly of sarcomeric structures were not analyzed. It is noteworthy that, beyond control of cell cycle, p27 may regulate several other functions both in myoblasts and in other cell types, such as cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007607-Messina1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, tumor progression, apoptosis and cytoskeletal dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007607-Besson1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, a negative feedback loop has been described to occur between p27 and RhoA, a pivotal regulator of the actin cytoskeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007607-Besson1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, and over-expression in myotubes of RhoA leads to alterations strikingly similar to those induced by ectopic expression of miR-221 and miR-222 (L.C. and G.F., unpublished observations). Therefore, it is possible that the alterations of morphology and sarcomere assembly that we observe in myotubes expressing ectopic miR-221 and miR-222 are mediated by down-modulation of cell cycle-independent functions of p27 and/or by inhibition of other targets.</p><p>Being the miRNA world a relatively recent field of investigation, very little is known about the pathways regulating the expression and function of these RNAs. It was recently reported that signalling through the ERK MAPK delayed expression of muscle-specific miRNAs in C2C12 myoblasts undergoing differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007607-Sweetman1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Here we describe for the first time that in QMb-ts myoblasts induced to differentiate and in post-mitotic myotubes the expression of miR-221 and miR-222 is under the positive control of the Ras-MAPK signalling pathway, independently of proliferation. This well correlates with the finding that inhibition of the Ras-MAPK pathway in QMb-ts myoblasts induced the expression of p27 and muscle-specific proteins and the ability to fuse and assemble contractile structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007607-Ciuffini1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. We confirm that the Ras-MAPK pathway negatively regulates expression of miR-1 in myoblasts, but we show that this miRNA is relatively insensitive to this pathway in myotubes subjected to Src activation. Src and the Ras-MAPK pathway have been implicated in repression of MyoD and myogenin transcriptional activity in myoblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007607-Perry1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007607-Falcone2">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007607-Russo1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref> and, recently, MRFs have been shown to regulate transcription of muscle-restricted miR-1, miR-133 and miR-206 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007607-Rao1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007607-Sweetman1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, likely by direct binding to their presumptive promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007607-Rao1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

Therefore, the modulation of miRNA expression observed in QMb-ts may represent a mechanism linking cytoplasmic intracellular signaling initiated by Src through MAPK-pathway with nuclear events leading to transcriptional inhibition of muscle gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007607-Falcone2">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. It is becoming clear that miRNAs are important elements of the differentiation program of skeletal muscle cells.
