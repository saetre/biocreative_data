We previously reported a cDNA encoding the full-length human RDM1 protein. Here, we describe the identification of 11 human cDNAs encoding RDM1 protein isoforms. This repertoire is generated by alternative pre-mRNA splicing and differential usage of two translational start sites, resulting in proteins with long or short N-terminus and a great diversity in the exonic composition of their C-terminus. By using tagged proteins and fluorescent microscopy, we examined the subcellular distribution of full-length RDM1 (renamed RDM1&#x003b1;), and other RDM1 isoforms. We show that RDM1&#x003b1; undergoes subcellular redistribution and nucleolar accumulation in response to proteotoxic stress and mild heat shock. In unstressed cells, the long N-terminal isoforms displayed distinct subcellular distribution patterns, ranging from a predominantly cytoplasmic to almost exclusive nuclear localization, suggesting functional differences among the RDM1 proteins. However, all isoforms underwent stress-induced nucleolar accumulation. We identified nuclear and nucleolar localization determinants as well as domains conferring cytoplasmic retention to the RDM1 proteins. Finally, <italic>RDM1</italic> null chicken DT40 cells displayed an increased sensitivity to heat shock, compared to wild-type (wt) cells, suggesting a function for <italic>RDM1</italic> in the heat-shock response.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="pdb"><title>Accession No.</title><kwd>EF488473-EF488482</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The RNA recognition motif (RRM) is a widespread nucleic acid-binding domain of about 90 aa that displays a conserved protein fold and, with the exception of two small peptide motifs involved in RNA interaction (RNP1 and RNP2), a great variability in sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Although RRM domains are encountered primarily in RNA-binding proteins, their targets are not restricted to RNA. Thus, some RRMs have been shown to bind single-stranded (ss) DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2 B3 B4">2&#x02013;4</xref>) or double-stranded (ds) DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7 B8">5&#x02013;8</xref>), or even to mediate protein&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). RRM-containing proteins tend to have a modular structure consisting of one or multiple copies of the RRM, in association with other protein domains, such as the arginine-serine-rich (RS) domain found in the serine-arginine (SR) protein family of splicing factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), or the arginine-glycine-rich (RGG) domain found, for instance, in nucleolin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and some heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). These auxiliary domains have been shown to act as protein&#x02013;protein interaction modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), participate in the interaction with RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and/or contribute to the intracellular localization of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18 B19 B20 B21 B22 B23 B24">18&#x02013;24</xref>). RRM-containing proteins display a wide subcellular distribution that reflects both the variety and multiplicity of their targets and their essential participation in processes such as transcriptional regulation, RNA splicing, editing and processing, RNA export, sequestration, transport, translation and stability, chromatin and telomere metabolism. In line with some of these activities, trafficking between intracellular and/or intranuclear compartments has been reported for several RRM-containing proteins, illustrating a highly dynamic and regulated subcellular distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>).</p><p>Recently, we identified a novel RRM-containing protein in vertebrates. Disruption of the <italic>RDM1</italic> gene (for <italic><underline>R</underline>A<underline>D</underline>52 <underline>M</underline>otif 1</italic>) encoding this protein in the chicken B cell line DT40 resulted in an increased sensitivity to the anti-cancer drug cisplatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Using gel-shift assays and electron microscopy, we showed that purified, recombinant RDM1 binds RNA and ssDNA, as well as dsDNA on which it assembles filament-like structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). RDM1 was also able to recognize distortions of the double helix caused by cisplatin-DNA adducts <italic>in vitro</italic>. The primary sequence of RDM1 revealed a single, N-terminal RRM but none of the auxiliary domains that are known to be associated with this motif. However, the RRM domain of RDM1 is followed by a short region, named RD motif, which is conserved in the DNA recombination and repair protein, RAD52 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). In RAD52, the region comprising this motif plays an essential role in ssDNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Biochemical analysis of a chicken RDM1 variant mutated in its RD motif revealed altered ssDNA-binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Based on these observations, we proposed a role for the RD motif of RDM1 as a modulator of its RRM. To date, the biological targets and function of RDM1 remain unknown.</p><p>We previously reported the identification of a human cDNA encoding a 284-aa ORF corresponding to the full-length RDM1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). In this report, we undertook a reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis of <italic>RDM1</italic> expression. We describe the identification of eleven cDNAs encoding RDM1 isoforms. This extensive repertoire is generated by alternative pre-mRNA splicing and differential usage of two translational start sites, resulting in proteins with long or short N-terminus and a great diversity in the exonic composition of their C-terminus. By using tagged proteins and fluorescent microscopy, we examined the subcellular distribution of full-length RDM1, which was renamed RDM1&#x003b1;, and some of long N-terminal isoforms. We found that RDM1&#x003b1; undergoes subcellular redistribution and nucleolar accumulation in response to proteotoxic stress and mild heat shock. In the absence of stress, the long N-terminal isoforms displayed distinct patterns of subcellular distribution, ranging from a predominantly cytoplasmic to an almost exclusive nuclear localization. However, all isoforms underwent stress-induced nucleolar accumulation. We identified nuclear and nucleolar localization determinants as well as domains conferring cytoplasmic retention to the RDM1 proteins, thus providing a structural basis for the diversity of their subcellular localizations. Finally, we report that <italic>RDM1</italic> null chicken DT40 cells exhibit an increased sensitivity to heat shock, compared to wild-type (wt) cells, suggesting a novel function for <italic>RDM1</italic> in the heat-shock response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Reagents and antibodies</title><p>Lactacystin and MG132 were from Calbiochem.

Preliminary RT-PCR analyses using primers designed to amplify the complete <italic>RDM1</italic> ORF from a variety of tissues and cell lines suggested the expression of isoforms arising from alternative splicing (data not shown, see also below). Limited evidence for alternative splicing of <italic>RDM1</italic> pre-mRNA was also reported in the AceView annotations of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) human genome database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/IEB/Research/Acembly/index.html">http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/IEB/Research/Acembly/index.html</ext-link>).

To learn more about the various forms of RDM1, we carried out a RT-PCR analysis on total RNA from HEK293T cells, using primer pairs designed to amplify isoforms containing the first ATG (hereafter referred to as long N-terminal forms). Gel analysis revealed a major band corresponding to the expected <italic>RDM1</italic> product, as well as four smaller bands of lower intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, left panel). Similarly, reactions carried out with primers designed to amplify short N-terminal forms (containing the second ATG) revealed four bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, right panel). Identical profiles were obtained with cDNA prepared from HeLa and MCF7 cells (data not shown, see also below). After sequencing, we established that the various bands obtained in each reaction corresponded to alternatively spliced variants. In total, nine <italic>RDM1</italic> cDNAs were characterized in this analysis. The structure of the RDM1 proteins encoded by these cDNAs is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C. Full-length RDM1 was renamed RDM1&#x003b1;. We used the prefix &#x00394;N- to designate isoforms translated from the second ATG, which lack exon 1 and contain an additional 9 aa in front of exon 2. Additional nomenclature was devised to reflect the presence of exons 2&#x02013;7 (RDM1&#x003b1; and &#x00394;N-RDM1&#x003b1;), or the exclusion of exon 4 (RDM1&#x003b2; and &#x00394;N-RDM1&#x003b2;), exon 5 (RDM1&#x003b3; and &#x00394;N-RDM1&#x003b3;), exons 2 + 4 (RDM1&#x003b4;) and exons 4 + 5 (RDM1&#x003b5; and &#x00394;N-RDM1&#x003b5;). Skipping of exon 4 in the &#x003b2; and &#x003b4; isoforms results in a frame shift and premature termination within exon 5. Premature termination also occurs within exon 6 in the &#x003b5; isoforms. In contrast, no frame shift accompanies the loss of exon 5 in the &#x003b3; isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). With the exception of RDM1&#x003b4;, which does not contain exon 2, all isoforms contain exons 2 and 3. The RT-PCR data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B suggest that RDM1&#x003b1; and &#x00394;N-RDM1&#x003b2; are the most abundant forms produced from the first and second translation initiation codon, respectively. Finally, two additional isoforms (named RDM1&#x003b6; and &#x00394;N-RDM1&#x003b6;, arising from the exclusion of exons 4&#x02013;6) were identified in cells exposed to a mild heat shock (see below and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Thus, alternative pre-mRNA splicing and differential usage of two translational start sites generate an extensive repertoire of RDM1 isoforms. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Structure of the human <italic>RDM1</italic> gene and the RDM1 protein isoforms.

In both cell types, and regardless of the nature and the location of the tag on RDM1&#x003b1;, the fusion proteins were found predominantly in the cytoplasm and, to a minor extent, in the nucleus. The fusion proteins were largely excluded from the nucleolus, which was identified by phase contrast illumination and chromatin staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, B), and also by indirect immunofluorescence, using an antibody against the resident nucleolar protein nucleolin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). This pattern of distribution was also observed in HuH7 cells, as well as in living HEK293 cells and in cells stably expressing the EGFP-protein fusions (data not shown and see below).

As illustrated for EGFP-RDM1&#x003b1; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 3</xref>A and B, the major effect of these drugs was the accumulation of the fusion proteins in the nucleolus. When the confocal settings were optimized for the visualization of the GFP signal in the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, second image), or in cells expressing less protein fusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C), the fusion protein could be seen to form circular or more entangled structures that sometimes overlapped with peri-nucleolar chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C) or resided within the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>E&#x02013;G).

As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>F and G, although RDM1&#x003b1; and nucleolin were very closely associated, little or no overlap was observed between the two proteins. Likewise, RDM1&#x003b1; did not co-localize with fibrillarin, a factor involved in pre-rRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>H). However, RNA staining with the RNA-selective dye F22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>) revealed an extensive overlap between RDM1&#x003b1; and nucleolar RNA, even though large regions of the nucleolar RNA did not contain RDM1&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>I). Inhibition of the proteasome has been shown to induce the disruption of nucleolar architecture and alter the distribution of nucleolar proteins, including nucleolin and fibrillarin, as well as rRNA and rRNA precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). Thus, partial segregation of rRNA precursors and their processing factors was observed in response to proteasomal inhibition, and factors involved in early and late preRNA processing, which overlapped extensively in the absence of stress, underwent spatial separation after MG132 treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). Our observations therefore suggest that part of the rRNAs redistributed in response to proteasomal inhibition might become targets for RDM1&#x003b1; accumulating in the nucleolus.</p><p>In addition to promoting its nucleolar accumulation, proteotoxic treatment also affected the overall distribution of RDM1&#x003b1; in the nucleoplasm. In particular, dot-like or more irregular subnuclear structures containing RDM1&#x003b1; were found to accumulate in many cells treated with MG132 or lactacystin (see for instance, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, B and D). We considered the possibility that these structures corresponded to specific nuclear bodies. When stressed cells were stained with antibodies directed against the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein, a component of PML bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>), extensive juxtaposition or colocalization of some RDM1&#x003b1;-containing structures with PML was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A), suggesting the association of RDM1&#x003b1; with PML bodies. These nuclear bodies have been implicated in several processes such as sensing of cellular stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>), transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>) and chromatin remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). Several indications also suggest that they function as storage sites, to regulate protein activity within the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). In many cells, PML-positive foci also accumulated in the nucleoli of cells treated with proteasomal inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B), consistent with published studies showing that a fraction of PML protein dissociated from the PML bodies to relocate to the nucleolus in response to MG132 treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). However, we found no correlation between the presence of PML in the nucleolus and that of RDM1&#x003b1; (data not show; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, where no PML protein is found in the nucleoli colonized by RDM1&#x003b1;).

CBs play a role in the transport and maturation of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) involved in pre-mRNA processing, as well as small nucleolar RNPs (snoRNPs) involved in rRNA modification and processing; they have also been implicated in the cell response to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). In addition, whereas CBs do not colocalize with PML bodies, they are often found in close proximity, suggesting the exchange of components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). The fact that RDM1&#x003b1; can be found in association with both types of nuclear bodies may therefore suggest some concerted action of PML bodies and CBs during proteotoxic stress. Under normal conditions, cells displaying nuclear RDM1&#x003b1; foci were infrequent. However, colocalization with PML bodies or CBs could sometimes be observed in foci-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D and E). Taken together, these observations suggest that RDM1&#x003b1; interacts with PML bodies and CBs under normal conditions, and that this association greatly increases in response to proteotoxic stress. Whether the recruitment of RDM1&#x003b1; to PML and CBs serves as a sequestration mechanism to regulate its activity, or reflects a biochemical function within these bodies, is currently unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Mild heat stress induces accumulation of RDM1&#x003b1; in the nucleolus</title><p>Inhibition of proteasome-mediated protein degradation leads to the accumulation of proteins normally targeted for degradation as part of the execution of certain cellular programmes or because they are aggregated, misfolded or damaged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>).

Therefore, we determined whether a heat-shock stress altered RDM1&#x003b1; subcellular distribution in HEK293T and HeLa cells. Following transfection with plasmids expressing the RDM1&#x003b1; protein tagged with EGFP, the cells were subjected to a mild heat-shock treatment (43&#x000b0;C, 30 min) before fixation and analysis. As illustrated representatively for HEK293T cells in Supplementary Figure S2A, the fusion protein accumulated in the nucleolus in response to heat shock, forming circular and more entangled structures. This accumulation, which affected essentially all cells, was reversible, as more than 90% of the cells displayed normal subcellular distribution of the fusion proteins after a recovery period of 2 h at 37&#x000b0;C (data not shown). Furthermore, incubation of the cells with cycloheximide (20 &#x003bc;g/ml) for 1 h prior to heat shock did not inhibit the nucleolar accumulation of RDM1&#x003b1; (Supplementary Figure S2B), indicating that the heat-shock induced relocalization of RDM1&#x003b1; did not depend on protein neo-synthesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Subcellular distribution of RDM1&#x003b1; during transcriptional arrest</title><p>Transcriptional inhibition represents a form of stress that greatly affects the architecture of the nucleolus. Transcriptional arrest mediated by inhibition of RNA polymerase I and/or II elicits nucleolar segregation and the formation of nucleolar caps consisting of nucleolar components originating from the original nucleolus, as well as nuclear components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55 B56 B57">55&#x02013;57</xref>). A comprehensive study using concentrations of actinomycin D sufficient to inhibit both RNA pol I and II (resulting in fully segregated nucleoli), has shown that nucleolar segregation is a dynamic process that also involves the redistribution of nucleoplasmic proteins and RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Thus, in response to transcriptional arrest, the defining regions of the nucleolus [fibrillar centres, dense fibrillar components and granular components (GC)] redistributed in domains called nucleolar caps and central body (that was originally the GC). Although some nucleolar proteins (mainly from the GC) dispersed in the nucleoplasm after transcriptional arrest, these domains retained many of their original proteins and RNAs. In addition, proteins and RNA components from many nuclear bodies relocated to discrete nuclear caps, whereas numerous nucleoplasmic proteins, including several RNA-binding proteins, formed large nucleolar caps (34, and references therein). Because it can occur under physiological states and can be followed by nucleolar reassembly, Shav-Tal <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>) have proposed that nucleolar segregation evolved as a flexible mechanism to redistribute specific nuclear components in response to transcriptional arrest, whilst keeping certain basic interactions, thus facilitating efficient reassembly upon transcriptional resumption.</p><p>To determine its possible involvement in nucleolar capping caused by transcriptional arrest, we examined the subcellular distribution of RDM1&#x003b1; in response to specific inhibition of RNA pol I (50 ng/ml actinomycin D, 2 h) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>), inhibition of both RNA pol I and pol II (5 &#x003bc;g/ml actinomycin D, 2 h) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>) or specific inhibition of RNA pol II (50 &#x003bc;g/ml &#x003b1;-amanitin, 5 h) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). In all cases, RDM1&#x003b1; remained predominantly cytoplasmic, whilst being also present in the nucleus, as observed with untreated cells (Supplementary Figure S3). This suggested that ongoing transcription was not required for its nucleocytoplasmic distribution. In the majority of cells, low levels of actinomycin D, which caused p80 coilin to redistribute at the nucleolar periphery, had little apparent effect on the subcellular localization of RDM1&#x003b1; (data not shown). In a few cells, however, some RDM1&#x003b1; protein could be seen at the rim of the nucleolus, where it partially overlapped with p80 coilin, as well as in the centre of the nucleolus (Supplementary Figure S3A). In contrast, cells treated with high levels of actinomycin D, consistently showed the relocalization of a fraction of RDM1&#x003b1; in nucleolar rings or cap-like structures that were surrounded by a dense chromatin ring from which the protein was excluded, and some protein also colonized the centre of the nucleolus (Supplementary Figure S3B). Little or no overlap was observed between RDM1&#x003b1; and p80 coilin in these structures. Nucleolar relocalization of RDM1&#x003b1; was much less apparent when &#x003b1;-amanitin was used to inhibit RNA pol II specifically, although in some instances a fraction of RDM1&#x003b1; could also be seen at the nucleolar periphery (Supplementary Figure S3C).</p><p>Because <italic>RDM1</italic> null cells display increased sensitivity to cisplatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), and since cisplatin has been shown to inhibit rRNA synthesis and cause nucleolar segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>), we tested whether RDM1&#x003b1; relocated to nucleolar caps in response to cisplatin.

Since exon 3 is common to all the isoforms reported here, we first looked whether it contained specific intracellular localization signals by expressing a EGFP-RDM1<sub>90&#x02013;133</sub> fusion protein in HeLa cells. (A schematic of all the constructs used in this study is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>F). As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A, the fusion protein displayed a prominent signal in the nucleus, and in particular in the nucleolus; only little GFP signal was detected in the cytoplasm where a punctuate pattern was sometimes observed. Exon 3 must therefore contain nuclear and nucleolar localization domains. Classical nuclear localization signals (NLS) consist of one (monopartite NLS) or two (bipartite NLS) stretches of basic amino acids residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>). Likewise, stretches of basic residues (in single or multiple copies) have been found in the nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) of numerous proteins (25,61, and references therein), whereas other proteins rely on their nucleic acid-binding domains to associate with the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>). The 41-aa sequence of exon 3 contains a stretch of basic residues at position 98&#x02013;100 (RHK), as well as the previously identified RD motif (aa 104&#x02013;132), which the evidence suggests is involved in modulating the DNA-binding properties of RDM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>D). The RD motif contains several aromatic residues that might be involved in nucleic acid interactions. In a preliminary experiment, we found that the RD motif on its own was unable to mediate the nucleolar recruitment of EGFP (data not shown). As a step to further delineate the nuclear/nucleolar targeting regions of RDM1, we therefore substituted AAA for either RHK at position 98&#x02013;100, or YYF at position 120&#x02013;122 of exon 3, within the EGFP-RDM1<sub>90&#x02013;133</sub> fusion protein. The (120&#x02013;122) YYF-AAA mutation did not affect the subcellular distribution of the fusion protein, which was still essentially nuclear and nucleolar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). However, compared to wt exon 3, a brighter GFP signal was consistently observed in the nucleolus of cells expressing the (120&#x02013;122) YYF-AAA variant, suggesting that the mutation affected intranuclear trafficking. In contrast, the (98&#x02013;100, RHK-AAA) mutation dramatically reduced the levels of GFP signal observed in the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C), indicating that this stretch of residues was a crucial component of the NoLS in exon 3. In addition, the (98&#x02013;100, RHK-AAA) variant accumulated less predominantly in the nucleus, and a more intense GFP signal was found instead in the cytoplasm, suggesting that aa 98&#x02013;100 also played a role in the transport of exon 3 into the nucleus. Identical observations were made with HEK293T cells (data not shown). <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Nuclear and nucleolar localization signals in exon 3 of RDM1&#x003b1;.

In the absence of any stress, we found that the fusion protein was cytoplasmic and nuclear, but excluded from the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>E).

These experiments suggest that other domains of RDM1&#x003b1; can mediate its nucleolar targeting.</p></sec><sec><title>Subcellular distribution of the RRM domain of RDM1</title><p>RRM domains have been shown to mediate the intracellular localization of numerous proteins. The RRM identified by Pfam spans residues 17&#x02013;92 of RDM1; it initiates within exon 1 (aa 1&#x02013;32), which contains its putative RNP2 signature (LLVWEL) (aa 17&#x02013;22), and terminates at the end of exon 2 (aa 33&#x02013;92). We therefore examined the subcellular distribution of an EGFP-RDM1<sub>1&#x02013;92</sub> fusion protein. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A (left panel) shows that the fusion protein is localized primarily in the nucleus, with little GFP signal in the cytoplasm. This indicates that, like exon 3, the RRM of RDM1 can also mediate nuclear localization of EGFP. Whereas the EGFP-RDM1<sub>1&#x02013;92</sub> fusion is clearly also nucleolar, it is mainly in the nucleoplasm, in contrast to what was observed with the EGFP-exon3 fusion. However, nucleolar accumulation of the EGFP-RDM1<sub>1&#x02013;92</sub> fusion was observed in response to heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A, right panel). <fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Subcellular localization of the RRM domain as well as N-terminal truncation mutants of RDM1&#x003b1;.

In the absence of stress, both fusion proteins showed a subcellular distribution reminiscent of RDM1&#x003b1;, being predominantly cytoplasmic and also nuclear but not nucleolar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B and C, left panels). Moreover, both displayed nucleolar accumulation in response to heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B and C, right panels) or proteasomal inhibition (Supplementary Figure S4). Taken together, these observations suggest that the C-terminal half of RDM1&#x003b1; (exons 4&#x02013;7) contains cytoplasmic retention domains as well as determinants involved in its stress-induced nucleolar accumulation.</p><p>Because RDM1&#x003b1; colocalized extensively with nucleolar RNA in cells treated with inhibitors of the proteasome, and to explore the role of its proposed nucleic-acid binding motifs in mediating this interaction, we next studied the distribution of the EGFP-RDM1<sub>90&#x02013;284</sub> and EGFP-RDM1<sub>133&#x02013;284</sub> fusions relative to nucleolin and RNA in HEK293T cells treated with MG132. In both cases, little or no overlap was seen between the fusion proteins and nucleolin. In addition, the GFP signal of the fusion proteins still coincided extensively with nucleolar RNA (Supplementary Figure S4A and B). Similar observations were made with the EGFP-RDM1&#x003b1;-&#x00394;E3 construct (data not shown). These observations suggest that RDM1&#x003b1; may be recruited to nucleolar RNA indirectly, via interactions with protein partners. Similarly, the loss of exons 1&#x02013;3 did not prevent the association of the fusion proteins with PML or p80 coilin (data not shown), indicating that the ability of RDM1&#x003b1; to interact with nucleic acids is not required for its recruitment to PML and CBs.</p></sec><sec><title>Subcellular distribution of other RDM1 isoforms</title><p>The isoforms reported in this study arise from alternative splicing events involving only splice donor and acceptor sequences that delineate the exons of the full-length RDM1&#x003b1; protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Therefore, in addition to providing insights into their localization and function, the study of these isoforms should also be indicative of the contribution of its various exons to the subcellular location of RDM1&#x003b1;. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref> illustrates the subcellular distribution patterns of selected isoforms expressed as EGFP-protein fusions and observed in the absence of stress (left panels) or in response to heat shock (right panels). In this report, we restricted our analysis to the long N-terminal isoforms. We found that RDM1&#x003b2;, which lacks exons 4&#x02013;7, was primarily nuclear and nucleolar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>A), consistent with the localization determinants assigned to the RRM and exon 3. In addition, the nucleolar distribution pattern of RDM1&#x003b2; was heterogeneous, some transfectants displaying more GFP signal in the nucleolus than others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>A, upper and lower panels). A predominantly nuclear and nucleolar distribution was also observed with the heat-shock inducible isoform RDM1&#x003b6; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>B). Importantly, RDM1&#x003b3;, which only lacks exon 5, was also located predominantly in the nucleus; little GFP signal was observed in the cytoplasm. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>C). However, RDM1&#x003b3; was still essentially non-nucleolar. Taken together, these observations suggest that the nuclear/nucleolar targeting domains present in the N-terminal part of RDM1&#x003b1; (exons 1&#x02013;3) must be controlled in part by a cytoplasmic retention signal located in exon 5, as well as by other domains that modulate intranuclear trafficking and nucleolar accumulation of the RDM1 proteins. These notions were, however, complicated by the analysis of the RDM1&#x003b4; isoform (consisting solely of exons 1 and 3), which was found evenly distributed in the cytoplasm and the nucleus despite lacking exons 4&#x02013;7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>D). This pattern contrasted with the almost exclusive nuclear localization of exon 3 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A), indicating that, in the absence of stress, the nuclear/nucleolar targeting functions mediated by exon 3 can be partially neutralized by sequences located in exon 1. Finally, all the isoforms studied here displayed nucleolar accumulation in response to heat shock (right panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>A&#x02013;D) or proteotoxic treatment (data not shown). <fig id="F9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p>Subcellular distribution of various long N-terminal RDM1 isoforms.

However, a bright GFP signal was now concentrated in concave nucleolar caps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>E, panel a). The type(s) of nucleolar cap in which RDM1&#x003b2; resides following inhibition of transcription is currently unknown.

Using primers designed to amplify alternatively spliced variants produced from two translation initiation sites, we have uncovered 11 cDNAs that are expressed in a variety of cell lines under normal growth conditions or in response to heat shock. While this manuscript was in preparation, an mRNA with a different 3&#x02032;-untranslated region, which encodes a novel RDM1 isoform containing the first five exons of RDM1&#x003b1; followed by a small, specific C-terminal extension was deposited in the NCBI database (accession number NM_001034836.1), adding to the complexity of this repertoire. The diversity of the RDM1 proteins lies in the presence or absence of sequences encoded by exon 1 and exons 4&#x02013;7. Indeed, it is notable that, with the exception of RDM1&#x003b4;, all the RDM1 isoforms described to date contain exons 2 and 3. That the RDM1 proteins articulate around these two exons argues for their functional importance, as discussed below.</p><p>As a step to elucidating the function of the RDM1 proteins, we have examined the intracellular localization of RDM1&#x003b1; and the other long N-terminal forms (containing exon 1). Our analysis has revealed a great diversity in the subcellular distribution patterns of these proteins. Thus, some variants were predominantly cytoplasmic, whereas others were almost exclusively nuclear. Likewise, great differences were seen in the nucleolar localization of these proteins. We suggest that the observed differences in subcellular distribution reflect functional differences among the RDM1 isoforms.</p><p>Our work has identified important determinants of the subcellular localization of the RDM1 proteins in the absence of stress. Exon 3, retained in all RDM1 isoforms, was found to contain nuclear and nucleolar targeting domains. Although NoLS and NLS signals remain to be delineated with precision within the 41-aa sequence of this exon, our data indicate that nucleolar accumulation of EGFP-tagged exon 3 was critically dependent upon the integrity of a small stretch of basic residues (R<sub>98</sub>HK). NoLS, consisting of stretches of basic residues present in single or multiple copies, have been identified in several nucleolar proteins and proposed to function by providing a protein-interaction interface with proteins that associate with the nucleolus (25,61, and references therein). Whether a similar mechanism applies to exon 3 remains to be determined. Substitution of AAA for R<sub>98</sub>HK also decreased the overall levels of exon 3 in the nucleus, suggesting that these residues might be part of a NLS as well. Nuclear and nucleolar targeting domains were not restricted to exon 3 as a construct consisting of exons 1 + 2 was found to mediate the nuclear/nucleolar localization of EGFP, arguing for an important function of the RRM in the nucleus. Interestingly, the RRM domain localized less predominantly to the nucleolus than exon 3. The notion that both the RRM and exon 3 of RDM1 contribute functions in the nucleus raises the possibility of interplay between these domains. Studies of human La, a RRM-containing protein involved in the maturation of precursor RNAs located in the nucleoplasm or nucleolus, indicate that its intranuclear trafficking results from interplay between a functional NoLS and an RRM that is essential for its exit from the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). That a similar interplay operates between the NoLS of exon 3 and the RRM in some of the RDM1 proteins might explain the observed heterogeneity in nucleolar abundance of the RDM1&#x003b2; isoform. Finally, our analyses so far have been limited to the long N-terminal isoforms. However, future studies of the short N-terminal RDM1 isoforms will be important since these forms lack exon 1 and thus the proposed RNP2 signature of the RRM. Others have shown that deletion of RNP2 in RRM1 or RRM2 of human La protein affected subnuclear localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>). Whether the loss of exon 1 in the short N-terminal RDM1 isoforms affects the integrity and/or nucleic acid-binding properties of their RRM, as well as the determinants of its subcellular distribution, remains to be elucidated.</p><p>In addition to nuclear/nucleolar targeting domains, we have identified domains involved in the cytoplasmic retention of the RDM1 proteins. Comparison of the subcellular distribution patterns of RDM1&#x003b1; and RDM1&#x003b3; indicates that one such domain is located in exon 5, as loss of this exon converts a predominantly cytoplasmic protein into a primarily nuclear one. Likewise, analysis of RDM1&#x003b4; suggests that sequences within exon 1 play a role in cytoplasmic retention by partially neutralizing the nuclear/nucleolar targeting functions of exon 3 to promote its cytoplasmic localization. References to cytoplasmic retention sequences are well documented in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64 B65 B66 B67">64&#x02013;67</xref>). Based on these and other studies, several hypotheses can be made regarding the role of the cytoplasmic retention regions identified in RDM1&#x003b1;. Firstly, they could mask potential nuclear localization signals located elsewhere in the protein, and require post-translational modification or conformational changes for these signals to be exposed in order to allow nuclear shuttling. Secondly, the cytoplasmic retention regions could shelter nuclear export signals. Although RDM1&#x003b1; does not contain the classical leucine-rich nuclear export sequence (NES) found in the proteins exported by CRM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>), nor the M9- or KNS-types of NES identified in hnRNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>), it is possible that it harbors a yet-unidentified NES. Finally, the cytoplasmic retention domains identified in this study could mediate important protein interactions or participate in substrate recognition in the cytoplasm. Since RDM1&#x003b1; is predominantly cytoplasmic, it is therefore possible that its major partners/targets reside primarily in the cytoplasm. We propose that its cytoplasmic retention domains allow RDM1&#x003b1; to fulfil RNA-binding activities in the cytoplasm. In support of this notion, preliminary analyses of immunopurified RDM1&#x003b1; complexes have identified cytoplasmic as well as nuclear RNAs associated with RDM1&#x003b1; (Van Dyck <italic>et al.</italic>, unpublished data). The characterization of these RNAs should illuminate the biological role of RDM1&#x003b1; in RNA metabolism.</p><p>Some RDM1 isoforms localized to the nucleolus in the absence of stress, arguing for a function within this nuclear organelle. Moreover, RDM1&#x003b1; and the long N-terminal isoforms accumulated in the nucleolus in response to certain stresses. The nucleolus assembles around the clusters of rDNA repeats and its primary function is to host ribosome biogenesis, including rDNA transcription, rRNA processing and pre-ribosome assembly. In addition to the factors involved in these reactions, the nucleolus also hosts hundreds of proteins from many functional classes that associate with the nucleolus in a dynamic manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>). It is now well documented that the nucleolus plays an important role in stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>), and a growing list of proteins have been shown to be excluded from or accumulate in the nucleolus in response to various forms of stress such as DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>), inhibition of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>), proteasome inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>) and heat shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). The evidence suggests that stress-induced nucleolar sequestration or release of a protein can serve as a mechanism to regulate protein function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>). The nucleolus can also function as a reservoir for unfolded proteins transported by molecular chaperones in an attempt to prevent damage to other nuclear compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>). It has also been proposed that nucleolar accumulation induced by inhibition of the proteasome reflects the stabilization of high-turnover proteins normally targeted for degradation in the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>). To date, however, it has not been possible to detect the 26S proteasome in nucleoli (46, and references therein). In this study, nucleolar recruitment of the RDM1 isoforms was observed in response to three forms of stress that significantly alter the architecture of the nucleolus and its functions in rRNA transcription and/or processing; proteasomal inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>), heat shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>) and transcriptional arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). The partial association of RDM1&#x003b1; with nucleolar RNA in MG132-treated cell suggests that the targets of RDM1&#x003b1; might include rRNAs or precursor rRNAs. Such association, however, did not require the proposed nucleic acid-binding domains of RDM1, indicating that it is mediated at least in part by protein&#x02013;protein interactions. Similarly, the presence of RDM1 isoforms in nucleolar caps following transcriptional arrest may reflect the existence of newly exposed RNA and/or protein partners.</p><p>In this study, we found that chicken DT40 <italic>RDM1</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup><italic><sup>/</sup></italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells were more sensitive than wt cells to a heat shock carried out at 45&#x000b0;C. <italic>RDM1</italic> was dispensable for cell survival after exposure to MG132, suggesting functional redundancy in the mechanisms that operate in response to proteasome inhibition or that <italic>RDM1</italic> is specifically required during the heat-shock response.

Whether there is a functional link between the cisplatin- and heat-shock sensitive phenotypes of <italic>RDM1</italic> null cells is currently unknown. Because physical agents and various chemicals that cause DNA damage can induce the expression of heat-shock proteins (HSPs), and since certain HSPs have been proposed to play a role in DNA repair and genomic stability (76,77, and references therein), it is possible that RDM1 impacts on DNA repair by modulating the expression and/or activity of HSPs. However, studies with Ehrlich ascites tumor cells have shown that cisplatin does not elicit a general stress response, inducing instead the expression of the small heat-shock protein Hsp25 via a transcription-independent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>). Others have shown that multidrug resistance can be induced by mechanisms dependent upon heat-shock factors (79, and references therein), and it is therefore also possible that the cisplatin-sensitive phenotype of <italic>RDM1</italic> null cells results from dysfunction of these factors in the absence of <italic>RDM1</italic>. Finally, our data suggest that <italic>RDM1</italic> plays a role in the cell response to extremely high temperatures in chicken cells. Avians present relatively high physiological temperatures compared with mammals, and functional differences have been observed between the heat-shock factors that mediate survival at high temperatures in avians and mammals. For instance, the functions fulfilled by human HSF1 are distributed in chicken cells between HSF1 and an avian-specific factor called HSF3, which is required for resistance to extremely high temperatures (59, and references therein). Thus, it will be important to determine whether and how the heat-shock sensitive phenotype of the chicken <italic>RDM1</italic> null cells relates to the subcellular redistribution and nucleolar accumulation of the human RDM1 proteins as well as the up-regulation of some human RDM1 isoforms seen after mild heat shock.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkm753_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="nar_gkm753_nar-01287-r-2007-File011.tif"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="nar_gkm753_nar-01287-r-2007-File012.tif"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="nar_gkm753_nar-01287-r-2007-File013.tif"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="nar_gkm753_nar-01287-r-2007-File014.tif"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="nar_gkm753_nar-01287-r-2007-File015.doc"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="nar_gkm753_nar-01287-r-2007-File016.doc"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="nar_gkm753_nar-01287-r-2007-File017.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This study was funded by La Ligue contre le Cancer, Comit&#x000e9; du Rh&#x000f4;ne, France; Association pour la Recherche sur le Cancer, France.
