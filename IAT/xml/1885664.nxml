RdgC, a recombination-associated DNA-binding protein, is a potential negative regulator of RecA function. Here, we have determined the crystal structure of RdgC from <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. The J-shaped monomer has a unique fold and can be divided into three structural domains: tip domain, center domain and base domain. Two such monomers dimerize to form a ring-shaped molecule of approximate 2-fold symmetry. Of the two inter-subunit interfaces within the dimer, one interface (&#x02018;interface A&#x02019;) between tip/center domains is more nonpolar than the other (&#x02018;interface B&#x02019;) between base domains. The structure allows us to propose that the RdgC dimer binds dsDNA through the central hole of &#x0223c;30&#x02009;&#x000c5; diameter. The proposed model is supported by our DNA-binding assays coupled with mutagenesis, which indicate that the conserved positively charged residues on the protein surface around the central hole play important roles in DNA binding. The novel ring-shaped architecture of the RdgC dimer has significant implications for its role in homologous recombination.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Homologous recombination systems contribute to the maintenance of genome integrity and are essential for the repair of stalled replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Genetic studies of the recombination-dependent growth C (<italic>rdgC</italic>) gene in bacterial systems have suggested that it is involved in DNA replication and recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). In <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> (the gonococcus), RdgC is required for efficient pilin antigenic variation and plays some role in cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). The <italic>Escherichia coli rdgC</italic> gene encodes a DNA-binding protein of 34&#x02009;kDa, whose expression level was at its highest during exponential phase, reaching its maximum at &#x0223c;1000 dimers per cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Its level decreased sharply to &#x0223c;50 dimers per cell in stationary phase. This profile suggests that RdgC might function during the period of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).</p><p>The RecA proteins and their homologs play a key role in recombinational DNA repair in bacteria and eukaryotes. Their aberrant reactions could result in gross chromosomal rearrangements that lead to human diseases, including cancer. Therefore, their functions must be tightly regulated, and understanding how the RecA family of recombinases is regulated is of utmost importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). The <italic>E. coli</italic> RdgC protein is a potential negative regulator of the function of RecA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). It inhibits RecA-promoted DNA strand exchange, RecA-mediated ATPase activity and RecA-dependent LexA cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Sedimentation equilibrium data indicated that <italic>E. coli</italic> RdgC exists in solution as a mixture of oligomeric states in equilibrium, most likely monomers, dimers and tetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). This concentration-dependent change in the oligomeric state appears to affect its mode of binding to DNA and its capacity to inhibit RecA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). The primary mechanism of RdgC inhibition appears to involve a simple competition for DNA-binding sites, especially on double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).</p><p>Deletion of the <italic>E. coli rdgC</italic> gene alone causes no obvious phenotype but is highly deleterious in strains lacking certain enzymes involved in recombination and replication restart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). RdgC is essential for the growth of an <italic>E. coli</italic> strain lacking PriA, indicating that it might affect replication fork progression or fork rescue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). PriA provides a means to load the DnaB replicative helicase at DNA replication fork and D loop structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). RdgC is, therefore, a key factor in the rescue of stalled or broken forks and subsequent replication restart. <italic>dnaC</italic> suppressors of PriA can overcome this inviability, especially when RecF, RecO or RecR is inactivated, which indicates that RdgC avoids or counters the toxic effect of these proteins by limiting inappropriate RecA loading on SSB-coated ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).</p><p>The DNA-binding ability of the RdgC protein has been demonstrated clearly using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RdgC binds non-specifically to dsDNA and with higher affinity than ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). RdgC from <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> also binds DNA with little specificity for sequence or structure, like the <italic>E. coli</italic> protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). RdgC exhibits no preference for DNA replication or recombination intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). However, no detectable domains or nuclease activity could be identified for the <italic>E. coli</italic> RdgC protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The complexes of <italic>E. coli</italic> RdgC with both linear and supercoiled circular plasmid DNA were imaged using atomic force microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). RdgC was found to have an increased affinity to DNA ends and to promote bending of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). RdgC has the effect on DNA superstructure; the promotion of DNA condensation was observed at high protein concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Recombination is largely enhanced by close contacts of distant regions along the DNA strands through condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is a ubiquitous environmental Gram-negative bacterium that belongs to the &#x003b3; subdivision of the Proteobacteria. Orthologs of the <italic>rdgC</italic> gene are found only in &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; subdivisions of the Proteobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The amino acid sequence of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> RdgC, a 306-residue protein, shows 46 and 36% identities against those of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>N. meningitidis</italic>, respectively. Despite the importance of DNA-binding ability of RdgC in its biological roles, the structural details of RdgC and the mechanism of its action remain unclear. Here, we report the crystal structure of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> RdgC as determined by the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) method of X-ray crystallography. It reveals that RdgC dimer is ring-shaped, with a central hole of &#x0223c;30&#x02009;&#x000c5; diameter. The inside surface around the central hole is rich in conserved, positively charged residues, which are implicated in DNA-binding by mutagenesis. We propose that dsDNA binds to RdgC through this central hole. Our structure provides a solid structural framework for a better understanding of the role of RdgC in homologous recombination.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>The <italic>rdgC</italic> gene (PA3263) was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the genomic DNA of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain PAO1 as a template.

The bases in bold denote the NdeI and XhoI cleavage sites, respectively. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and XhoI, and was then inserted into the NdeI/XhoI-digested expression vector pET-21a(+) (Novagen). This vector construction adds an eight-residue tag (LEHHHHHH) to the carboxyl terminus of the gene product to facilitate protein purification.</p><p>The protein was expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> C41 (DE3) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). The cells were grown at 37&#x000b0;C up to OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.6 in Luria&#x02013;Bertani medium that contained 50&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> ampicillin, and the protein expression was induced by 0.5&#x02009;mM isopropyl-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The cells were allowed to grow at 20&#x000b0;C for 22&#x02009;h after IPTG induction and were harvested by centrifugation at 4200&#x02009;<italic>g</italic> (6000&#x02009;rev&#x02009;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>; Sorvall GSA rotor) for 10&#x02009;min at 4&#x000b0;C. The cell pellet was resuspended in an ice-cold lysis buffer [20&#x02009;mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 500&#x02009;mM sodium chloride, 5&#x02009;mM imidazole] and was then homogenized with an ultrasonic processor. The crude cell extract was centrifuged at 36&#x02009;000&#x02009;<italic>g</italic> (18&#x02009;000&#x02009;rev&#x02009;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>; Hanil Supra 21&#x02009;K rotor) for 60&#x02009;min at 4&#x000b0;C, and the recombinant protein in the supernatant fraction was purified in three chromatographic steps.</p><p>The first purification step utilized the C-terminal hexahistidine-tag by Ni<sup>2+</sup>-chelated HiTrap chelating column (GE Healthcare). The eluent was diluted 3-fold with 50&#x02009;mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.4. The diluted solution was applied to a 20-ml heparin-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare), which was previously equilibrated with a buffer of 50&#x02009;mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1&#x02009;mM dithiothreitol and 1&#x02009;mM EDTA. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0&#x02013;2.0&#x02009;M sodium chloride in the same buffer. The first peak corresponded to high molecular aggregates of RdgC and the second peak to RdgC dimers, which was also consistent with our dynamic light scattering measurements. When the aggregates were not separated from the dimers, the protein readily aggregated within a day. The dimer fractions were concentrated to &#x0223c;6&#x02009;mg&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> concentration using an YM10 ultrafiltration membrane (Millipore-Amicon) and further purified by gel filtration on a HiLoad XK 16 Superdex 200 prep-grade column (GE Healthcare), which was previously equilibrated with a buffer of 50&#x02009;mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 200&#x02009;mM sodium chloride, 1&#x02009;mM dithiothreitol and 1&#x02009;mM EDTA. The first peak corresponding to the high molecular aggregates of RdgC was only a minor component, and the second peak corresponding to RdgC dimers was stable for several weeks when frozen at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C. The procedure for purifying the SeMet-substituted protein was the same, except for the presence of 10&#x02009;mM dithiothreitol in all buffers used during purification steps. Dynamic light scattering experiments were performed at 24&#x000b0;C, with the protein (at 2&#x02009;mg&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> concentration) dissolved in a buffer consisting of 50&#x02009;mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1&#x02009;mM dithiothreitol, 1&#x02009;mM EDTA and 200&#x02009;mM sodium chloride on a Model DynaPro-801 instrument (Wyatt, Santa Barbara, CA, USA). The protein concentration was estimated by measuring the absorbance at 280&#x02009;nm, employing the calculated extinction coefficient of 20&#x02009;910&#x02009;M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (SWISS-PROT; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.expasy.ch/">http://www.expasy.ch/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Mutagenesis and electrophoretic mobility shift assay</title><p>Point mutants were prepared using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The seven mutants R4A, F120A, K146A, R198A, R208A, Q212A and R252A were well expressed and soluble. The three mutants K70A, R81A and R211A were not expressed, while R122A mutant was expressed but was not soluble. Therefore, we mutated Lys70, Arg81, Arg122 and Arg211 into aspartate. The K70D, R81D, R122D and R211D mutants were well expressed and soluble. The soluble mutants were expressed and purified under the conditions identical to those for the wild type, except that the heparin-Sepharose column step was omitted. All of the soluble mutants had similar elution profiles as the wild type upon gel filtration, and the dimer fractions were used for DNA-binding assays. We mixed 5&#x02009;&#x003bc;l of RdgC (1.1&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x02009;&#x003bc;l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and 5&#x02009;&#x003bc;l of a linear dsDNA with 414&#x02009;bp (63&#x02009;ng&#x02009;&#x003bc;l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), corresponding to the molar ratio of 64:1 for RdgC dimer to dsDNA. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 10&#x02009;min at room temperature. RdgC&#x02013;DNA complexes were analyzed by 1.5% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis in 1&#x000d7; TAE buffer (45&#x02009;mM Tris-acetate at pH 8.3, 1&#x02009;mM EDTA). DNA bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining. For DNA-binding assays, the protein concentration was measured with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit.</p></sec><sec><title>Crystallization and X-ray data collection</title><p>Crystals were grown by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at 24&#x000b0;C by mixing equal volumes (2&#x02009;&#x003bc;l each) of the protein solution (at 19&#x02009;mg&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> concentration in a buffer consisting of 50&#x02009;mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1&#x02009;mM dithiothreitol, 1&#x02009;mM EDTA and 200&#x02009;mM sodium chloride) and the reservoir solution.

It can be divided into three structural domains: center domain, tip domain and base domain. Center domain (residues 1&#x02013;73 and 121&#x02013;167) includes a six-stranded anti-parallel &#x003b2;-sheet with two flanking &#x003b1; helices (&#x003b1;1 and &#x003b1;4). The helix &#x003b1;1 runs nearly parallel to the two outermost strands &#x003b2;2 and &#x003b2;3, which in turn lie adjacent to &#x003b2;4. Strands &#x003b2;2 and &#x003b2;3 are separated by a loop. The helix &#x003b1;4 is nearly orthogonal to the &#x003b2;-strands. Tip domain (residues 74&#x02013;120) contains two &#x003b1; helices (&#x003b1;2 and &#x003b1;3) and is inserted between strands &#x003b2;4 and &#x003b2;5 of the center domain. It sticks out from the center domain. The two connections between the center domain and the tip domain are rich in conserved residues, hinting at an important functional role of these joints. They could act as a hinge for a possible conformational change. The C-terminal region of the polypeptide chain is folded into the base domain (residues 168&#x02013;306), which consists of a five-stranded anti-parallel &#x003b2;-sheet with four &#x003b1;-helices, three of which (&#x003b1;5, &#x003b1;6 and &#x003b1;8) cover one side of the &#x003b2;-sheet.

The monomer&#x02013;monomer interface buries a solvent-accessible surface area of &#x0223c;1360&#x02009;&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> per monomer, corresponding to &#x0223c;8% of the total surface area of the monomer (Protein&#x02013;Protein Interaction Server at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/PP/server/">http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/PP/server/</ext-link>). Polar and nonpolar atoms in interface are 44 and 56%, respectively. The interface can be divided into two kinds: &#x02018;interface A&#x02019; involving both the tip domains and center domains, and &#x02018;interface B&#x02019; involving the base domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). These two interfaces have significantly different characters. </p><p>The interface A is formed largely by the crossing over of the two tip domains in the dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). This interface covers a surface area of &#x0223c;565&#x02009;&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> and is largely nonpolar, with the polar and nonpolar atoms in the interface being 37.5 and 2.5%, respectively. Phe120 contributes considerably to the nonpolar character of the interface between the tip domains, accounting for &#x0223c;150&#x02009;&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> of the interface area. Phe120 is part of a highly conserved sequence segment and lies at the boundary between the tip domain and the center domain. The aromatic ring of Phe120&#x02032; inserts into a hydrophobic pocket, which is formed by the hydrophobic residues Ile74, Leu75, Pro76, Val79, Leu115, Ala119 and Phe120 of the neighboring monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). The primed residue belongs to the adjacent subunit. These residues are well conserved in the RdgC family (indicated by green triangles below the aligned sequences in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). As these hydrophobic residues are located near the molecular 2-fold axis, the two clusters of hydrophobic side chains are merged into a single, large cluster in the dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). Of the 16 hydrogen bonds that exist between the two subunits, only one is made in this interface between Arg118 and Arg118&#x02032;. </p><p>The interface B is contributed to exclusively by the two base domains. This interface covers a surface area of &#x0223c;795&#x02009;&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>. The polar and nonpolar atoms in this interface are 50% each. The two &#x003b2;-sheets of the two base domains merge into a single ten-stranded antiparallel &#x003b2;-sheet in this interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Thus, 15 of 16 inter-subunit hydrogen bonds are clustered in this interface. The hydrogen bond networks can be divided into two types. The first type involves the main chain atoms of Val206, Arg208 and Lys210 in strand &#x003b2;9; this strand associates with the equivalent strand from the other subunit in an antiparallel manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). The other type involves both the side chain and main chain atoms. The side chain of Arg211&#x02032; interacts with the backbone of Gly204, while the side chain of Lys227 hydrogen bonds to those of both Gln212&#x02032; and Glu218 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D). In addition, the side chain of Gln212&#x02032; interacts with that of Asp199 and the backbone of Arg211&#x02032; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D). Arg211, Gln212, Glu218 and Lys227 are highly conserved among the RdgC family members. The residues participating in the hydrogen bond networks are indicated by red circles below the aligned sequences in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>. The observation that conserved residues play important roles in forming the dimer implies that dimerization of RdgC is critical for its function.</p><p>If one or both of interfaces A and B are to be broken for functional reasons such as for allowing dsDNA to enter into the central hole of the RdgC dimer, we can conceive of three scenarios. The first possibility would be a simultaneous breakage of the two interfaces A and B. The second would be the sequential disruption of the interfaces A and B. The third would be the disruption of only one of the two interfaces A and B. Sedimentation equilibrium indicated the presence of monomers in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>), which is consistent with the first two scenarios. If the third scenario holds, RdgC dimers could possibly exist in two conformations in solution, i.e. a closed form as observed in the present crystal structure, and an open form, in which one of the two interfaces A and B is broken.</p></sec><sec><title>A model for DNA binding by RdgC and DNA-binding assay</title><p>The net charge of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> RdgC is highly negative, since each monomer contains 12 aspartate, 13 glutamate, 10 lysine, 9 arginine and 2 histidine residues. The net charge of a dimer would be &#x02212;12 (or &#x02212;8), if we assume none (or all) of histidines to be positively charged. The electrostatic potential at the molecular surface of RdgC dimer shows that the charge distribution on the protein surface is highly nonuniform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). Since the inner surface of the RdgC dimer is rich in conserved, positively charged residues and the diameter of the central hole (&#x0223c;30&#x02009;&#x000c5;) is approximately similar to that of other toroidal DNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), it appears likely that RdgC dimers bind dsDNA through the central hole. Despite extensive co-crystallization and soaking trials with linear dsDNAs of different lengths (14-mer, 16-mer and 18-mer), we could not locate the bound DNA experimentally. We attribute this difficulty to the nature of sequence-nonspecific DNA binding by RdgC. Therefore, we built a crude model of a DNA complex of the RdgC dimer by fitting dsDNA into the central hole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). This model is supported by the DNA-binding assays coupled with mutagenesis, as described below. It is also consistent with the suggested binding site size of &#x0223c;16&#x02009;nt for the <italic>E. coli</italic> RdgC dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>) and the approximate thickness (&#x0223c;40&#x02009;&#x000c5;) of the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> RdgC dimer. </p><p>When we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assay for dsDNA binding, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> RdgC did not require Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions (Supplementary Figure 2), unlike <italic>Deinococcus radiodurans</italic> RecR, which required high concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). ATP was not required for dsDNA binding by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> RdgC, either (Supplementary Figure 2). This is consistent with an apparent lack of an ATP-binding pocket in the RdgC dimer structure.</p><p>In order to identify the residues that are important for dsDNA binding, we carried out mutational analyses. The residues for mutagenesis were selected on the basis of the modeled complex between RdgC dimer and dsDNA, together with sequence conservation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C). We prepared eleven point mutants (R4A, K70D, R81D, F120A, R122D, K146A, R198A, R208A, R211D, Q212A and R252A). These eleven mutated residues are well conserved among RdgC proteins. Eight mutants (R4A, K70D, R81D, R122D, K146A, R198A, R208A and R252A) had a lower affinity for dsDNA than the wild-type RdgC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D). These eight mutated residues are indicated by blue squares below the aligned sequences in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>. This result indicates that dsDNA binds to the inside surface around the central hole of the RdgC dimer, since the mutated residues are located on the inner surface of the RdgC dimer. It is worth mentioning that a single mutation introduces two alterations per RdgC dimer.</p><p>The three mutants (F120A, R211D and Q212A) were prepared to investigate whether dimerization of RdgC is crucial for dsDNA binding. Phe120 is a key residue located in the inter-subunit interface A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B), while Arg211 makes hydrogen bonds in the interface B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D) and Gln212 is involved in both intra- and inter-subunit interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D). dsDNA binding by the F120A mutant is considerably weakened, compared to either the R211D or Q212A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D). This result suggests that destabilization of the ring-shaped architecture of the RdgC dimer is deleterious for tight dsDNA binding and that interface A is probably more important than interface B for dsDNA binding. dsDNA-binding affinity of the Q212A mutant was lower than the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D), whereas that of the R211D mutant was comparable to the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D). This result suggests that disruption of the inter-subunit interface B is also detrimental for dsDNA binding but to a smaller extent than disruption of the interface A. It further suggests that the side chain of Arg211 is not involved in recognizing dsDNA. It is interesting that the DNA complex for wild type forms a distinct band (lane 3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D), as opposed to a more diffuse band as one would expect if the complexes contained different numbers of RdgC dimers.

Despite a superficial resemblance of the overall ring-shaped architecture of the RdgC dimer with those of other toroidal DNA-binding proteins, the internal arrangement of the secondary structure elements in the RdgC dimer is strikingly different from those of other toroidal DNA-binding proteins.

It was observed that the effects of RdgC on RecA-promoted DNA strand exchange were much more pronounced than the effects of RdgC on other RecA functions, when RdgC was added to the reaction late (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). By examining the effects of the DinI protein on RdgC-mediated inhibition of RecA activities, it was concluded that the potent effect of RdgC in the inhibition of strand exchange did not primarily reflect a displacement of RecA in the nucleoprotein filament by RdgC, but instead a binding of RdgC to the dsDNA substrate so as to make it unavailable to the filaments for strand exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).</p><p>Our work contributes to a better understanding of the inhibition mechanism of RecA function by RdgC. The ring-shaped architecture with a central hole that is suitable for the binding of dsDNA lends RdgC with a capacity to hold dsDNA very tightly. Therefore, we suggest that RdgC dimers probably function as a tight dsDNA gripper and physically block access to the target dsDNA by RecA filaments, because tight encircling of dsDNA by RdgC dimers, possibly as a linear aggregate, would prevent the two strands from dissociating. However, it remains unclear how the closed-ring structure of the RdgC dimer might allow binding of a large number of RdgC dimers on the duplex DNA. It may be conceivable that each RdgC dimer can open temporarily at one or both of its two inter-subunit interfaces so that dsDNA can enter the central hole.</p><p>RdgC was at its highest level during exponential phase, reaching its maximum of &#x0223c;1000 dimers per <italic>E. coli</italic> cell. Its level decreased sharply to &#x0223c;50 dimers per cell in stationary phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Under normal cellular conditions, RecA is maintained at &#x0223c;1000 molecules per cell (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.els.net/">http://www.els.net/</ext-link>). Following LexA repressor cleavage, the level of RecA protein in the cell increases by as much as 20-fold. RdgC inhibition of the RecA function by a simple competition mechanism at the cellular concentration of RdgC clearly requires a much higher affinity for DNA by RdgC than RecA. Possible protein&#x02013;protein interactions between RdgC dimers might have a profound effect on the affinity for DNA, when a large number of RdgC dimers are bound on a duplex DNA. If only one of the two inter-subunit interfaces can open up and the 2-fold symmetry axes of the RdgC dimers are misaligned sufficiently, the escape of DNA from a linear array of interacting RdgC dimers would be extremely difficult. Alternatively, both inter-subunit interfaces of each dimer may open up simultaneously. A line of indirect evidence for the possible protein&#x02013;protein interactions between RdgC dimers is provided by the cooperative binding of RdgC to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Cooperativity of RdgC binding may be caused by local and distant protein&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). A kind of side-by-side interaction between two adjacent molecules of RdgC dimer is present in the crystal, burying an accessible surface area of &#x0223c;750&#x02009;&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> at the interface. The interaction involves mostly the less polar side surface of the dimer (left side of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A), with 2-fold symmetry axes of the two interacting RdgC molecules making an angle of &#x0223c;90&#x000b0; when viewed down the central holes and &#x0223c;15&#x000b0; when viewed perpendicular to the holes. This may explain the observed DNA bending by RdgC, which was speculated to be a necessary step in the working mechanism of RdgC, if one can assume that the strong protein&#x02013;protein interactions in the crystal were relevant for protein&#x02013;protein interactions in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>RdgC protein was shown to have a potent effect on RecA protein-promoted DNA strand exchange in E. coli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). In a series of experiments, RdgC was added after RecA filaments had formed on the ssDNA and 5&#x02009;min after the linear dsDNA was added. With 3&#x02009;&#x003bc;M RecA, a sharp reduction in DNA strand exchange products was seen with 0.4&#x02009;&#x003bc;M RdgC, and the generation of products was abolished at 0.8&#x02009;&#x003bc;M RdgC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). This suggests that the binding affinity of RdgC to dsDNA is considerably higher than that of RecA. The high affinity of RdgC could be explained by its ring shape and the suggested mode of DNA binding. Tetrameric species of E. coli RdgC, which started to form at around 2&#x02009;&#x000b5;M concentrations, were speculated to be the species with the most potent inhibitory effect, possibly by having a higher affinity for DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Higher affinity for DNA of the tetrameric species could be understood, if the formation of a tetramer in solution involves a protein&#x02013;protein interaction similar to the side-by-side interaction between two adjacent RdgC dimers in the crystal, although there is no experimental evidence. Obviously, there are still many open questions that need to be addressed in future biochemical experiments.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUMMARY</title><p>The crystal structure of RdgC, a recombination-associated DNA-binding protein, determined in this study reveals that the polypeptide chain is uniquely folded and two monomers associate to form a ring-shaped dimer with a central hole of &#x0223c;30&#x02009;&#x000c5; diameter. The inner surface around the central hole is rich in positively charged residues. These structural features suggest that dsDNA runs through the central hole when it binds to RdgC dimers. This idea is supported by our mutational studies, which indicate that the conserved, positively charged residues around the central hole are important for dsDNA binding. The toroidal architecture of the RdgC dimer provides a sound framework for a better understanding of its role in homologous recombination.</p><sec><title>Coordinates</title><p>Atomic coordinates and the structure factor data have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession code 2OWY).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkm144_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="nar_gkm144_nar-00073-f-2007-File007.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank the staff at beamlines BL-5A, BL-6A and NW-12A of Photon Factory, Tsukuba, Japan, and beamlines BL-4A and BL-6B of Pohang Light Source, Pohang, Korea, for assistance during X-ray diffraction experiments.
