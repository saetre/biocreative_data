To dissect their role in FLT3-ITD&#x02013;mediated transformation, we performed bone marrow reconstitution assays. Unexpectedly, FLT3-ITD cells deficient for PIM1 failed to reconstitute lethally irradiated recipients, whereas lack of PIM2 induction did not interfere with FLT3-ITD&#x02013;induced disease. PIM1-deficient bone marrow showed defects in homing and migration and displayed decreased surface CXCR4 expression and impaired CXCL12&#x02013;CXCR4 signaling. Through small interfering RNA&#x02013;mediated knockdown, chemical inhibition, expression of a dominant-negative mutant, and/or reexpression in knockout cells, we found PIM1 activity to be essential for proper CXCR4 surface expression and migration of cells toward a CXCL12 gradient. Purified PIM1 led to the phosphorylation of serine 339 in the CXCR4 intracellular domain in vitro, a site known to be essential for normal receptor recycling. In primary leukemic blasts, high levels of surface CXCR4 were associated with increased PIM1 expression, and this could be significantly reduced by a small molecule PIM inhibitor in some patients. Our data suggest that PIM1 activity is important for homing and migration of hematopoietic cells through modification of CXCR4. Because CXCR4 also regulates homing and maintenance of cancer stem cells, PIM1 inhibitors may exert their antitumor effects in part by interfering with interactions with the microenvironment.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Genetic alterations that lead to uncontrolled protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity are a hallmark of human malignant myeloproliferative disorders. Fusion genes involving ABL or PDGFR are the molecular correlate of chronic myeloproliferative disorders, whereas activating mutations of FLT3 are recurrently found in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chalandon and Schwaller, 2005</xref>). The success of small molecules that block oncogenic tyrosine kinase activity, such as imatinib-mesylate (Gleevec; Novartis), provided a proof of principle for targeted antileukemic therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Giles et al., 2005</xref>). However, the successful clinical use of such compounds has been challenged by the development of drug resistance and a limited clinical efficacy in patients with acute leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">von Bubnoff et al., 2003</xref>). To overcome these limitations, identification of critical signaling mediators downstream of an oncogenic tyrosine kinase is essential to identify new targets that would allow the development of an efficient combined therapeutic approach. There is strong evidence that most oncogenic tyrosine kinases mediate malignant transformation through parallel activation of several signaling pathways such as JAK&#x02013;STAT, PI3K&#x02013;AKT, RAS&#x02013;RAF&#x02013;MAPK, or NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chalandon and Schwaller, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Retroviral gene tagging in <italic>c-myc</italic>&#x02013;induced lymphomas in mice has led to the identification of the PIM family of serine/threonine kinases that encompasses three members: PIM1, PIM2, and PIM3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mikkers et al., 2002</xref>). Transgenic mouse models have demonstrated that PIM kinases exert their oncogenic potential mainly in cooperation with various oncogenes. Targeted inactivation of one, two, or all three PIM genes resulted in mice with some growth retardation and mild defects in steady-state hematopoiesis, but these mice were fertile with a normal lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mikkers et al., 2004</xref>). PIM1 has been characterized as one of the first target genes of STAT5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mui et al., 1996</xref>). In vitro and in vivo experimental work has demonstrated that constitutive STAT5 activation is a hallmark of a wide spectrum of hematological malignancies and that STAT5 is an essential mediator for transformation by oncogenic tyrosine kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schwaller et al., 2000</xref>). Interestingly, both PIM1 and PIM2 are frequently overexpressed in leukemia and lymphoma as well as in some solid tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amson et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mizuki et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hammerman et al., 2005</xref>). As PIM kinases are constitutively active and their expression is regulated predominantly by transcription and/or proteasomal degradation, this suggests that PIM kinases play an important role in hematological malignancies. Further in vitro functional studies have provided evidence that activation of PIM1 and/or PIM2 is important for malignant transformation by oncogenic tyrosine kinases such as FLT3-ITD, expressed in &#x0223c;25% of human AML cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agrawal et al. 2008</xref>). These studies indicated that small molecules inhibiting PIM kinases could provide a promising therapeutic avenue for hematological malignancies. However, it remains unclear whether one or both of the hematopoietically expressed PIMs (PIM1 and PIM2) are essential for mediating disease manifestations induced by oncogenic PTKs.</p><p>CXCL12, which is also known as SDF1 (stromal cell&#x02013;derived factor 1), mediates signals through the chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) that are essential for homing and maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lapidot et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ratajczak et al., 2006</xref>). There is increasing evidence that CXCR4 is a key regulator of homing and retention of leukemic stem cells within the marrow niche that allows these cells to escape spontaneous and chemotherapy-induced cell death as well as promoting metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Juarez and Bendall, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burger and Kipps, 2006</xref>). These findings are supported by the negative prognostic impact of high CXCR4 expression levels in patients with AML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rombouts et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Spoo et al., 2007</xref>). Consequently, targeting leukemic stem cells within the bone marrow by disruption of the CXCL12&#x02013;CXCR4 interaction by small molecule inhibitors has been recently proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zeng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Juarez et al., 2007</xref>). There is strong evidence that the CXCL12&#x02013;CXCR4-mediated growth promotion and migration is not limited to leukemia but is also essential for the spreading of tumor-initiating cells of many solid tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Croker and Allan, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Using bone marrow cells from PIM knockout mice, we show that in vivo malignant transformation by the FLT3-ITD mutant is independent of PIM2. However, our experiments unexpectedly unravel that PIM1 is important for bone marrow reconstitution in lethally irradiated hosts. Further functional analysis suggests that PIM1 regulates surface CXCR4 expression in hematopoietic cells lines and in AML blasts. Collectively, our work reveals a previously unknown function of the oncogenic PIM1 serine/threonine kinase as regulator of homing and migration of bone marrow cells involving functional interaction with the CXCL12&#x02013;CXCR4 signaling axis.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>To investigate the role of PIM kinases in hematological diseases induced by oncogenic PTKs, we expressed the constitutively active FLT3-ITD mutant in primary mouse bone marrow cells. Expression of FLT3-ITD in WT cell induced growth factor-independent growth in liquid culture as well as in methylcellulose. Compared with WT bone marrow, expression of FLT3-ITD in PIM1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells resulted in a significantly lower number of colonies growing with and without IL-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). No differences in colony formation or growth properties were observed when FLT3-ITD was expressed in bone marrow cells from mice lacking the PIM2 gene (PIM2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) compared with WT mice when grown in presence or in absence of IL-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Liquid culture of the cells over 5 d revealed no difference in viability but a general reduced growth rate of bone marrow cells originating from PIM1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals compared with PIM2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> or WT mice (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082074/DC1">Fig. S1, B&#x02013;D</ext-link>). These in vitro results suggest that PIM1, and not PIM2, is involved in signaling events that are essential for IL-3 and/or FLT3-ITD&#x02013;regulated proliferation. To further study the role of PIMs in FLT3-ITD&#x02013;mediated leukemogenesis in vivo, we performed bone marrow transduction/transplantation experiments using WT or PIM1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> or PIM2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> donor mice. Mice that were transplanted with cells lacking PIM1 showed no hematological disorder during 1-yr posttransplant observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Histological analysis of the normal sized spleens of animals that had been transplanted with PIM1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> FLT3-ITD&#x02013;expressing cells did not show any significant pathological changes 6 mo after transplant (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082074/DC1">Fig. S2</ext-link>, top). In contrast, all animals that received a transplant of FLT3-ITD&#x02013;transduced bone marrow cells from WT or PIM2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice developed a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by a massive expansion of EGFP-positive myeloid (CD11b<sup>+</sup>) cells in the peripheral blood assessed by flow cytometry 26 d after transplantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). There was no significant difference in survival between recipients of WT versus PIM2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> bone marrow transduced with FLT3-ITD, with both mice groups succumbing to a fatal disease within a median survival time of 108 and 138 d, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Histopathological examination of the spleens of sick mice revealed extensive infiltration with neoplastic myeloid cells in mice that received a transplant of FLT3-ITD&#x02013;infected WT as well as PIM2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> bone marrow cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082074/DC1">Fig. S2, middle and bottom</ext-link>). All mice receiving a transplant of FLT3-ITD&#x02013;transduced bone marrow developed exactly the same mixed myeloid/T lymphoid phenotype, irrespective of the genetic background of the transplanted bone marrow (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082074/DC1">Fig. S3</ext-link>). Observation of the EGFP<sup>+</sup> reconstituted cells revealed significant expansion of FLT3-ITD&#x02013;expressing WT or PIM2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells within the first month after transplant. In contrast, although detectable over several weeks, FLT3-ITD&#x02013;expressing PIM1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> underwent no significant expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>In vitro and in vivo FLT3-ITD&#x02013;mediated transformation in the presence and absence of PIM serine/threonine kinases.</bold> (A) Comparative analysis of clonogenic growth of FLT3-ITD&#x02013;expressing bone marrow cells from FVB/N (WT) and PIM1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> or PIM2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. 10<sup>4</sup> cells were sorted (EGFP<sup>+</sup>) 48 h after infection and plated in methylcellulose in presence or absence of IL-3.

All mice that underwent transplantation with FLT3-ITD&#x02013;transduced WT or PIM2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> bone marrow died or were sacrificed because of disease conditions.

During the first series of experiments, we applied a nonmyeloablative irradiation dose to FVB/N mice (750 rad). To further exclude the possibility of a homing failure in PIM1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells, we increased the irradiation to a lethal dose of 900 rad and repeated the experiments. Again, animals receiving FLT3-ITD&#x02013;expressing cells from WT and PIM2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> donors developed an identical myelolymphoproliferative disorder to that described in the previous paragraph (unpublished data). In contrast, all recipients receiving PIM1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> bone marrow expressing the control vector (<italic>Mig-IRES-EGFP</italic>) alone or FLT3-ITD died rapidly (within 22 d) because of the lack of bone marrow reconstitution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Careful examination of the hematologic parameters showed that in contrast to animals transplanted with PIM2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and WT cells, in recipients receiving PIM1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells the white cell, red cell, and platelet counts declined rapidly in the first 2 wk after transfer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082074/DC1">Fig. S4</ext-link>). This unexpected observation suggests that PIM1 might play an essential role in early bone marrow reconstitution. Although previous work has demonstrated that PIM1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> bone marrow cells show some growth defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Domen et al., 1993</xref>), as shown in colony-forming assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>), the number of HSCs, as assessed by the determination of the number of lineage-negative (Lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup> Sca1<sup>+</sup> Kit<sup>+</sup>) cells, was not reduced in PIM1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> when compared with WT animals (FVB/N; not depicted).</p><p>The rapid declines in hematopoietic cells of all lineages, leading to death of animals within the first month after transplant, suggest that PIM1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> HSCs have not only a proliferation defect but also impaired migration and/or homing capacities. To understand the role of PIM1 in HSC homing, we performed a series of experiments in which we labeled bone marrow cells from WT or PIM1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice with a vital dye (CFSE), transplanted equal numbers of positively labeled and viable cells into lethally irradiated recipients, and determined the amount of cells in spleen and bone marrow 4 and 20 h after transplant.

No significant difference in viability of CFSE-labeled cells was observed between the genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>).

Interestingly, we found that bone marrow cells from PIM1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, but not PIM2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, expressed lower levels of surface CXCR4 when analyzed by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>) but did not show any differences in the expression of other surface molecules involved in homing such as the integrins &#x003b1;4 and &#x003b1;5 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082074/DC1">Fig. S5</ext-link>).

Interestingly, Western blot analysis revealed no change in total CXCR4 protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). Furthermore, expression of a dominant-negative PIM1-KD mutant also down-regulated cell surface CXCR4 expression, suggesting that PIM1 kinase activity is necessary (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082074/DC1">Fig. S7 A</ext-link>). These data suggested that PIM1 does not influence the total protein level of CXCR4, but may control the surface presentation, and that PIM1 activity might be necessary. We therefore tested whether the reexpression of PIM1 in PIM1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> bone marrow cells could rescue surface CXCR4 expression and migration toward a CXCL12 gradient. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>, retroviral expression of PIM1 in bone marrow cells from PIM1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> background increased surface CXCR4 expression to the level of WT littermates. In addition, expression of PIM1 restored the capability of cells to efficiently migrate toward CXCL12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>). These results strongly suggested that PIM1 regulates CXCR4 surface expression and function in hematopoietic cells.

Treatment of the cells with the PIM inhibitor also impaired CXCL12-induced, but not PMA-induced, ERK phosphorylation (Fig. S7 B).

In analogy to previous studies, 1.5 h after exposure of JURKAT cells to 10 nM CXCL12, the majority of surface CXCR4 has been internalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ding et al., 2003</xref>).

Collectively, these experiments suggest that PIM1 might play an important role for proper surface reexpression of CXCR4.</p><p>Functional regulation of CXCR4 by PIM1 activity raised the question of whether PIM1 kinase directly modifies the CXCR4 receptor. In support of a direct association, immunolocalization studies in JURKAT cells showed partially overlapping signals for CXCR4 and PIM1 predominantly in the cytoplasm (Fig. S8 B). CXCR4 undergoes ligand-dependent and ligand-independent endocytosis and surface reexpression depending on the integrity of the intracellular C-terminal domain rich in serine and threonine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Busillo and Benovic, 2007</xref>). We identified three putative PIM1 consensus sites in this region (S325, S330, and S339) containing either the preferred -5 or -3 arginine (position relative to the target serine; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>). To assess their potential as a PIM1 phosphorylation site, the C-terminal 46 residues of CXCR4 were expressed as a GST fusion protein (GST-C46) and treated in vitro with purified PIM1 protein. A single PIM1-dependent phosphorylation was detected by a shift of +80 Da in the intact protein mass as determined by electrospray ionization liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, whereas no phosphorylation was detected on GST alone. To further define the phosphorylation site, a series of C-terminal deletion constructs were prepared, treated with PIM1, and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Phosphorylation was observed for short deletions, including the construct GST-C46&#x00394;13, but was lost upon further truncation, locating the likely substrate site to the C-terminal residue S339 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>). To confirm this result, the phosphorylation reaction was repeated with an 11-mer peptide derived from this site and a similar peptide containing the mutation S339A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref>). Importantly, MALDI TOF experiments revealed PIM1-dependent phosphorylation of the WT peptide but not the S339A mutant peptide. This data suggests that PIM1 regulation of CXCR4 results from direct phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain. Generation of a phosphospecific antibody has previously allowed the demonstration that phosphorylation of CXCR4-S339 occurs upon stimulation of brain cancer cells by CXCL12 or by phorbol-ester or EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Woerner et al., 2005</xref>). We used this antibody in a series of in vitro kinase assays to show that PIM1-dependent phosphorylation of CXCR4 was lost specifically in the S339A mutant but not in the mutants S325A or S330A, which correspond to the other putative PIM1 recognition sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 C</xref>). Treatment of JURKAT cells with the PIM1 inhibitor K00486 resulted in reduced CXCL12 and PMA-induced phosphorylation of CXCR4-S339 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 D</xref>, top). Similarly, reduced CXCL12-induced phosphorylation of CXCR4-S339 was observed upon siRNA-mediated knockdown of PIM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 D</xref>, bottom).

PIM kinases have been reported as being deregulated by oncogenic PTK fusions, such as the FLT3-ITD mutant found in up to a third of human AMLs. These studies have produced partly conflicting results regarding the role of PIM1 or PIM2 (which are both expressed in the hematopoietic system) in the pathogenesis of PTK-mediated leukemogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mizuki et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agrawal et al., 2008</xref>). Our study addressed the role of PIM kinases in primary cells, and the results showed that transformation of hematopoietic cells by FLT3-ITD in vitro and in vivo is independent of PIM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). This finding is unexpected, as previous work demonstrated that targeting of PIM2 by siRNA or by expressing dominant-negative kinase dead mutants (PIM-KD) significantly impaired growth and survival or FLT3-ITD&#x02013;expressing hematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agrawal et al., 2008</xref>). However, the previous experiments were performed in immortalized cell lines that stably express FLT3-ITD, whereas in the present work primary mouse bone marrow cells were used.</p><p>The PIM kinases have been identified through serial retroviral gene tagging in <italic>c-myc</italic>&#x02013;induced lymphomas in WT mice, as well as in PIM knockout mice, suggesting that the loss of one PIM can be compensated for by deregulation of the others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mikkers et al., 2004</xref>). However, there are studies suggesting that in some situations, the loss of a particular PIM kinase may not be compensated for by the presence of other PIMs. For example, the growth of bone marrow&#x02013;derived mast cells from PIM1 knockout animals is significantly reduced despite induction of PIM2 by IL-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Domen et al., 1993</xref>). Our present work clearly demonstrates that in primary mouse bone marrow cells expressing FLT3-ITD, the lack of PIM1 cannot be compensated for by the presence of PIM2. Using bone marrow reconstitution assays, we show that FLT3-ITD induces a lethal myelo- and lymphoproliferative disorder in vivo in the absence of PIM2. Interestingly, PIM1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells expressing an empty retrovirus (<italic>MigRI</italic>) or FLT3-ITD transplanted in a sublethally irradiated host were detectable but gradually declined over several weeks after transplant (unpublished data). Transplantation of an identical number of PIM1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells into lethally irradiated hosts resulted in early death (2&#x02013;4 wk) of all recipients, suggesting that cells lacking PIM1 have an inherent homing defect, which was further confirmed in a series of experiments measuring homing to the bone marrow and the spleen 4 and 20 h after transplant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). However, expression of FLT3-ITD in bone marrow cells from PIM1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice resulted in generally impaired growth in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref> and Fig. S1), indicating that these cells do not only display a homing defect but also have a growth disadvantage compared with WT or PIM2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> bone marrow cells.</p><p>Homing of HSCs to the bone marrow niche is a complex and still poorly understood process involving several signaling pathways. There is strong evidence that interaction of the chemokine CXCL12, which is expressed on stroma cells, with its receptor CXCR4, which is expressed on HSCs, plays an essential role in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Juarez and Bendall, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lapidot et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burger and Kipps, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ratajczak et al., 2006</xref>). Proper functioning of the CXCL12&#x02013;CXCR4 axis seems to be crucial for directing homing/engraftment of normal, as well as leukemic, HSCs into bone marrow after transplantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Peled et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tavor et al., 2004</xref>). Our results provide strong evidence that PIM1 can functionally regulate CXCR4. Absence of PIM1 is associated with impaired CXCL12-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux and activation of downstream effectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). In addition, functional down-regulation by siRNAs, expression of a dominant-negative&#x02013;acting kinase-dead mutant, or treatment with a small molecule PIM kinase inhibitor leads to down-regulation of CXCR4 expression at the surface of hematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figs. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). In addition, colocalization studies, as assessed by immunofluorescence, and in vitro kinase assays suggest that PIM1 may directly modify the intracellular C-terminal domain of CXCR4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref> and Fig. S8 B). However, we cannot rule out that kinase-active PIM1 indirectly regulates the phosphorylation of CXCR4 through another yet unidentified kinase.</p><p>Our results show that PIM1 regulates surface expression of CXCR4. PIM1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> hematopoietic cells have a subtle but measurable defect in cytokine-mediated proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Domen et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). Therefore, it is very likely that impaired in vivo homing of PIM1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> marrow cells might be the result of inappropriate function of several PIM targets including CXCR4. Interestingly, PIM1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> marrow cells do not completely lack CXCR4. In fact, they express less surface CXCR4, most probably as a consequence of inappropriate reexpression. As PIM1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are viable and have a normal lifespan, a lower amount of surface CXCR4 seems to be sufficient to regulate steady-state hematopoiesis.</p><p>G protein&#x02013;coupled receptors like CXCR4 are regulated by desensitization, internalization, and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Busillo and Benovic, 2007</xref>). CXCR4 seems to undergo ligand-dependent and -independent internalization and surface reexposure in hematopoietic cells. In both internalization and reexposure of CXCR4, the serine/threonine-rich intracellular C terminus seems to play a key role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Orsini et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pelchen-Matthews et al., 1999</xref>). Natural mutants in patients with WHIM syndrome, as well as artificial truncation and alanine scanning mutagenesis, have suggested multiple regions in the CXCR4 C-terminal domain as potential phosphoacceptor sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hernandez et al., 2003</xref>). However, although multiple protein kinases have been proposed (PKC, GRK3, and GRK6), no specific kinase has yet to be clearly implicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Busillo and Benovic, 2007</xref>). In this study, we observed that functional interference of PIM1 leads to a decrease in CXCR4 surface expression, whereas the total amount of the CXCR4 protein remains unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). In addition, our work suggests that PIM1 regulates surface reexpression, whereas internalization of the receptor seems to be not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>). A similar phenotype has been observed in T cells deficient in SYT3 (synaptotagmin 3), although the underlying mechanism remained unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Masztalerz et al., 2007</xref>). Our experiments using mass spectrometry and in vitro kinase assays show that PIM1 is able to directly phosphorylate Ser339 in the CXCR4 C-terminal domain in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). It is worth noting that this site is in a motif that closely resembles the consensus PIM recognition motif with &#x02212;5 arginine and &#x02212;2 histidine although the preferred &#x02212;3 arginine is absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bullock et al., 2005a</xref>).

Interestingly, both CXCL12&#x02013;CXCR4 and EGF&#x02013;EGFR lead to activation of the JAK&#x02013;STAT signaling pathway, which regulates PIM1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Soriano et al., 2003</xref>), whereas PMA treatment is also known to produce a rapid induction of PIM1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wingett et al., 1996</xref>). As some of the PIM1 target sites, like the apoptosis regulator BAD (Ser112) or the cell cycle regulator p21<sup>(WAF1)</sup> (Thr145/Ser146), are also phosphorylated by other protein kinases, such as RAF1, PAK5, RSK2/5 for the former and PKC-&#x003b4; or AKT for the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aho et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>), it is unlikely that PIM1 is the only kinase that phosphorylates CXCR4-Ser339. Although the exact mechanisms remain to be elucidated, based on our results, PIM1-regulated phosphorylation of CXCR4-S339 could provide an interaction platform for proteins that regulate receptor surface reexpression. Elevated PIM1 levels frequently observed in leukemia and solid tumors would facilitate CXCL12-mediated signaling by increasing surface reexpression of the receptor. This hypothesis is supported by our observation of significantly increased migration toward CXCL12 in cells that overexpress PIM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>).</p><p>Interaction of CXCL12 with CXCR4 does not only provide signals for efficient migration and homing, but seems also to support survival of hematopoietic progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lataillade et al., 2002</xref>). There is increasing evidence that CXCR4 is a key regulator of homing and retention of leukemic stem cells within the marrow niche, allowing these cells to escape spontaneous and chemotherapy-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Juarez and Bendall, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sipkins et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burger and Kipps, 2006</xref>). These findings are supported by the negative prognostic impact of high CXCR4 expression levels in patients with AML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rombouts et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Spoo et al., 2007</xref>). Consequently, targeting leukemic stem cells within the bone marrow by disruption of the CXCL12&#x02013;CXCR4 interaction by small molecule inhibitors has been recently proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zeng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Juarez et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The association of elevated PIM1 expression with expression of high levels of surface CXCR4 in leukemic blasts from AML patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>) suggests that targeting aberrant PIM activity by small molecules would be rather promising by its effects on interfering not only with self-renewal but also with migration and homing of leukemic cells. Indeed, structural analysis of PIM1 has allowed us to identify a group of selective small molecule inhibitors with potent antileukemic activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pogacic et al., 2007</xref>). Short-term treatment of fresh leukemic blasts from six AML patients with the PIM inhibitor (K00486) resulted in a significant decrease of steady-state surface CXCR4 expression in four samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Ongoing experiments aim to understand why some AML blasts are resistant to CXCR4 regulation after treatment with the PIM inhibitors.</p><p>Collectively, we have dissected the role of PIM serine/threonine kinases for FLT3-ITD leukemogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Our work demonstrated that PIM2 is dispensable for transformation by FLT3-ITD and cells lacking PIM1 are impaired for growth and survival that cannot be overridden by FLT3-ITD. Most importantly, our work demonstrates that PIM1 activity directs cellular homing and migration by regulation of surface CXCR4 expression, suggesting that increased PIM1 expression supports CXCL12&#x02013;CXCR4-mediated homing of leukemic stem cells and could also be implicated in metastasis formation in human cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>DNA constructs and growth factors.</title><p>The complementary DNA (cDNA) of mouse FLT3-ITD was provided by H.
