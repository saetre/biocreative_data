Based on these observations, we investigated if human middle ear epithelial cells could release IL-1 alpha upon exposure to a lysate of NTHi and if this cytokine could have a synergistic effect on beta-defensin 2 up-regulation by the bacterial components.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The studies described herein were carried out using epithelial cell lines as well as a murine model of acute otitis media (OM).

The majority of the cases of OM are caused by three pathogens: <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, nontypeable <italic>Haemophilus influenzae </italic>(NTHi) and <italic>Moraxella catarrhalis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Bacterial adherence to mucosal surfaces is a first step in respiratory infections. NTHi, <italic>S. pneumoniae </italic>and <italic>M. catarrhalis </italic>have all been shown to adhere to human upper respiratory epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Li and colleagues demonstrated that NTHi binds to and activates toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) on the surface of epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The TLRs have been shown to be involved in the activation of many host genes, including cytokines, chemokines and antimicrobial peptides such as &#x003b2;-defensin 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>The defensins are cationic (polar) molecules with spatially separated hydrophobic and charged regions. <italic>In vitro</italic>, the defensins (at micromolar concentrations) have a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against bacteria, fungi, and even some enveloped viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In humans and other vertebrates, the defensins can be divided into the &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-defensin subfamilies on the basis of the position and bonding of six conserved cysteine residues. The &#x003b1;-defensins are produced by neutrophils and intestinal Paneth's cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The &#x003b2;-defensins, on the other hand, are mainly produced by epithelial cells of the skin, kidneys, and trachea-bronchial lining of nearly all vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Multiple &#x003b2;-defensin genes have been identified and three have been characterized at the peptide level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. &#x003b2;-defensin 1 is expressed constitutively by variety of cell types, while &#x003b2;-defensin 2 expression is highly up-regulated by exposure to inflammatory stimuli such as bacterial components or proinflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>We have recently shown that both human &#x003b2;-defensin 1 and 2 have bactericidal /bacteriostatic activity against NTHi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].

Furthermore, the biological relevance of IL-1&#x003b1; as an inducer of &#x003b2;-defensin 2 in the tubotympanum has been demonstrated in <italic>in vivo </italic>studies that have shown IL-1&#x003b1; to be one of the cytokines induced in a rat model of OM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>In the present study we demonstrate that NTHi treatment of human middle ear epithelial cells results in release of IL-1&#x003b1; and that this cytokine and NTHi can synergistically up-regulate human &#x003b2;-defensin 2 (DEFB4) expression. Here, a note should be added regarding the new nomenclature of the b-defensin family of molecules <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/nomenclature/searchgenes.pl"/>. Human b-defensin 2 is now called DEFB4 and its mouse orthologue is called b-defensin 4 (Defb4). This change has created some confusion in the scientific community. Thus, to avoid confusion and remain consistent with the nomenclature used in our previous studies, will continue to refer to molecule under investigation as b-defensin 2.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>Recombinant interferon-&#x003b3;-inducible protein-10 (IP-10), regulated upon activation, normally T-expressed, and presumably secreted (RANTES), interleukin (IL)-1&#x003b1;, IL-6, IL-8 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1&#x003b2; (MIP-1&#x003b2;) were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).

Three mice were for each time point including two control groups: non-treated and PBS-inoculated.</p><p>All aspects of animal handling were performed according to approved IACUC guidelines. The mice were transtympanically inoculated with 10 &#x003bc;l of the NTHi lysate (1:10 dilution) after anesthesia with Ketamine (5 mg/100 g). Middle ear mucosal RNA was then harvested at 6, 9, 12 and 24 hours post inoculation by irrigation of the bulla with three, 3.5 &#x003bc;l Trizol washes (Invitrogen). Briefly, the mice were anesthetized using Ketamine (5 mg/100 g), and then decapitated. A small incision (1 cm) was made in the retroauricular area and the cortical bone of the bulla was exposed after dissection. A hole, sized 2 mm &#x000d7; 2 mm, was made using the sharp scalpel followed by irrigation of the bulla with Trizol. The total Trizol volume was then increased to 200 &#x003bc;l and RNA was precipitated per the manufacturer's instructions. The middle ear mucosa was inflamed in all NTHi-treated mice, but effusion was not seen in all groups.

Co-treatment of HMEEC cells with suboptimal doses IL-1&#x003b1; and NTHi lysate, however, had a synergistic effect on the activation of the &#x003b2;-defensin 2 mRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>) and its promoter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>). In contrast, this synergistic effect was not noted in Hela or A549 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). Moreover, the synergistic effect in HMEEC cells was inhibited by the p38 inhibitor (SB203580), but not by the MEK inhibitor (PD98059) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). These results suggest that unlike IL-1&#x003b1;, which up-regulates &#x003b2;-defensin 2 transcription via the ERK pathway, the synergistic up-regulation of &#x003b2;-defensin 2 transcription by IL-1&#x003b1; and NTHi components is mediated via the p38 MAP kinase pathway.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Individual and synergistic regulation of &#x003b2;-defensin 2 (DEFB4) by NTHi lysate and IL-1&#x003b1;.

Furthermore, in contrast to IL-1&#x003b1; that acts via the ERK MAP kinase pathway to induce &#x003b2;-defensin 2 transcription, the synergistic effect of this cytokine on &#x003b2;-defensin 2 up-regulation by NTHi molecules appears to be mediated by the p38 MAP kinase pathway (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Such synergism may be a way of boosting the epithelial cells' initial response to NTHi and its components.</p><p>The signaling mechanisms appear to be more complicated in the presence of both exogenous and endogenous inducers. NTHi, an exogenous inducer and TNF-&#x003b1;, an endogenous inducer synergize with each other to induce NF-&#x003ba;B activation and consequently up-regulate inflammatory mediators including IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-8 as well as TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. NTHi first interacts with its receptors of host cells such as Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and leads to the activation of multiple signaling cascades resulting in the up-regulation of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1;. The up-regulated TNF-&#x003b1; in response to NTHi synergize with NTHi to induce NF-&#x003ba;B via two distinct signaling pathways, the NIK-IKK-I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; and the MEKK1-MKK3/6-p38 MAPK pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>Strains of NTHi, a small gram-negative bacterium, exist as commensal organisms in the human nasopharynx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Nasopharyngeal colonization of NTHi may persist for prolonged periods of time, even in the antibody-containing mucosal secretions since the bacteria undergo antigenic variation. This can occur by several molecular mechanisms such as point mutation, gene amplification, phase variation or horizontal gene transfer and homologous recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Although NTHi rarely causes life-threatening infections, it is nonetheless a clinically important pathogen since it causes otitis media in children and exacerbates chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The interactions between NTHi and the host are not well understood. These interactions determine chronic colonization with or without inflammation or disease. The interaction of NTHi antigens and specific host molecules are likely to be involved in the transition of NTHi from a commensal to a pathogenic organism. Further studies are, however, needed to elucidate these mechanisms.</p><p>Our results showed that the induction of &#x003b2;-defenin 2 by NTHi is not a pan-epithelial response, in that Hela and A549 cells do not highly respond to NTHi lysates, whereas HMEEC cells do. In addition, although NTHi treatment up-regulated IL-1&#x003b1; expression in Hela, A549 and HMEEC cells, treatment of the cells with IL-1&#x003b1; resulted in the up-regulation of &#x003b2;-defensin 2 only in A549 and HMEEC, but not in Hela cells. These results indicate that expression patterns of receptors or signaling molecules is cell-specific and thus determines the responses to extracellular stimuli. Our results are in agreement with earlier reports of the hypo-responsiveness of A549 cells to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and of A549 and normal human bronchial epithelial cells to Gram-positive group B Streptococci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. A deficiency in the expression of TLR2 and 4 may also explain the lack response of these cells to NTHi as well. Our experimental observation of the non-responsiveness of Hela cells to NTHi, is on the other hand different from previous observations demonstrating transcriptional up-regulation of &#x003b2;-defensin-2 by LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] or activation of NF-&#x003ba;B by NTHi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. This apparent difference, however may be explained by Mineshiba and colleagues' use of LPS and the fact that Shuto and coworkers studied the nuclear translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B, which may not be in itself sufficient for the transcriptional activation of &#x003b2;-defensin-2 in Hela cells.</p><p>Although the autolysis of NTHi has not been documented, it is likely that NTHi undergoes autolysis similar to that seen with Haemophilus influenzae type b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], S. pneumoniae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] or E. coli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Cytoplasmic, as well as membrane components of NTHi are thought to persist in the effusion and act as long lasting inducers of inflammation. This notion is supported by the fact that bacterial DNA is detectable in most sterile effusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], whereas endotoxin is detectable in 60% of the cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. While the molecules (possibly surface antigens) of intact NTHi have been demonstrated to induce proinflammatory cytokines in human respiratory epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], other studies have shown that the cytoplasmic fraction of lysed NTHi also contains important molecules for stimulating epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. The NTHi lysate used in this study was prepared by sonification of the bacteria and mimics normal pathophysiology.</p><p>Interleukin 1 is a central mediator of the inflammatory response and occurs in two forms. Although the acidic form, known as IL-1&#x003b1;, and the neutral form, IL-1&#x003b2;, only share 45% homology at the nucleic acid level, both proteins bind to the same receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Furthermore, both proteins are pleiotropic and affect processes such as inflammation, immunity and hemopoiesis. Moreover, while IL-1&#x003b2; is active only in its secreted form, IL-1&#x003b1; is active as an intracellular precursor, a membrane-associated cytokine, as well as a secreted molecule.</p><p>Our results suggest a role for IL-1&#x003b1; but not IL-1&#x003b2; in the up-regulation of &#x003b2;-defensin 2 transcription. These results are consistent with the observations that IL-1&#x003b1; and not IL-1&#x003b2;, released from epithelial cells infected with respiratory syncytial virus, enhanced expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 in pulmonary epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Moreover, our data suggest that the induction of IL-1&#x003b1; production in middle ear epithelial cells and the autocrine/paracrine effect of this molecule may be one of the central events involved in the up-regulation of chemotactic factors for the recruitment of immune cells into the middle ear. It should be noted that although the concentration of IL-1&#x003b1; released into the culture medium was less than 100 pg/ml/10<sup>6 </sup>cells, since the molecule is acting in an autocrine manner, its effective concentration is likely to be much higher locally.</p><p>In our previous studies, we demonstrated that IL-1&#x003b1; could up-regulate &#x003b2;-defensin 2 transcription via a Src-dependent MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Interestingly however, the present study shows that the p38 MAP kinase, not the ERK1/2 pathway is involved in synergism of IL-1&#x003b1; and NTHi components. Moreover, our preliminary results suggest that the p38 MAP kinase pathway is involved in the activation of &#x003b2;-defensin 2 transcription by NTHi (unpublished data). We postulate that the activation of ERK and p38 MAP kinase pathways can result in a synergistic up-regulation of &#x003b2;-defensin 2. These results point to the complexity of the signaling pathways that control the expression of innate immune molecules such as &#x003b2;-defensin 2 and indicate the need for further investigation into the regulation of &#x003b2;-defensin 2 by NTHi and IL-1&#x003b1;.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We demonstrate that epithelial cell-derived IL-1&#x003b1; can synergistically act with NTHi components to up-regulate human &#x003b2;-defensin 2 (DEFB4) via the p38 MAP kinase pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>OM: otitis media</p><p>NTHi: nontypeable <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic></p><p>TLR: toll-like receptor</p><p>IL: interleukin</p><p>MAP kinase: mitogen-activated protein kinase</p><p>MEK: MAPK/ERK kinase</p><p>ERK: extracellular signal-regulated kinase</p><p>DEFB: human beta-defensin</p><p>IP: interferon-&#x003b3;-inducible protein</p><p>RANTES: regulated upon activation, normally T-expressed, and presumably secreted</p><p>MIP: macrophage inflammatory protein</p><p>HMEEC: human middle ear epithelial cell line</p><p>IKK: I-kappa-B kinase</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SKM performed most of experiments and data analysis.</p><p>HYL prepared the lysate of NTHi, and assisted experiments related with bacteriology.</p><p>HP performed the cytokine macroarray analysis.</p><p>TT extracted RNA, and performed real time quantitative PCR.</p><p>RP performed transfection of the &#x003b2;-defensin 2 promoter construct and luciferase assay.</p><p>KC maintained the cell line and helped measuring IL-1&#x003b1; with ELISA.</p><p>AA oversaw study design and analysis, and drafted the manuscript.</p><p>DJL is recipient of NIDCD R01 DC005025-03, which supported this work and the studies were conducted in his laboratory, with him as the principal investigator.</p></sec><sec><title>Pre-publication history</title><p>The pre-publication history for this paper can be accessed here:</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/6/12/prepub"/></p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr X.X.
