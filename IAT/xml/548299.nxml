Tissue-specific regulation of LPL activity is a major mechanism to distribute lipids among tissues according to the physiological needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Current information indicates that in adipose tissue, the regulation is post-translational and occurs by a shift of the lipase protein towards an inactive form under the influence of another gene with short-lived message and product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This information derives from <italic>in vivo </italic>experiments. To study the underlying mechanism an <italic>in vitro </italic>model is urgently needed. Experiments with isolated adipocytes do not seem to bring out the mechanism and the <italic>in vivo </italic>experiments indicate that it is the extracellular LPL that is the target for the regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. We have therefore explored the possibility to use tissue explants and report our experiences in this paper. The results support the view that it is the extracellular enzyme that is being regulated. Unfortunately the preparation of tissue explants seems to trigger a proteolytic response in the tissue.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>LPL activity and mass decreased when explants of rat adipose tissue were incubated</title><p>In the first set of experiments we incubated explants of rat adipose tissue and followed LPL mass and activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). LPL mass decreased by more than 50% in three hours. The decrease then continued so that after six hours only around 20% of the original mass remained. With tissues from fed rats, in which most of the LPL protein is in the catalytically active form, the LPL activity decreased in parallel to LPL mass. In tissues from fasted rats, in which most of the LPL protein is in the catalytically inactive form, the decrease was less steep for LPL activity than for LPL mass. The inset in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> shows that there was a delay of about two hours before the decrease of LPL mass accelerated. There was no difference between tissue from fed and fasted rats.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Changes in LPL mass and activity during incubation of adipose tissue explants. </bold>Epididymal adipose tissue was dissected from fed and 24 h-fasted rats, cut into small pieces and rinsed in cold PBS.

The inset shows a separate experiment where incubations were stopped at shorter times. Only LPL mass was followed in that experiment.

There was some variation in the absolute values but the results were in principle the same, a rapid decline of LPL mass and activity. The rate at which LPL mass decreased was similar with tissue explants from fed and fasted rats, and LPL activity roughly followed LPL mass in tissues from fed rats.</p><p>One possible explanation could be that LPL was released from the tissue into the medium. The amounts of LPL mass or activity that appeared in the medium were, however, small (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). To test whether lipase might have adsorbed to the plastic dishes these were rinsed out with warm SDS solution, but only small amounts of LPL protein were recovered (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Hence it is clear that there was a loss of LPL mass from the system.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Changes in LPL mass during incubation.

Isolated adipocytes, incubated under the same conditions as the tissue explants, released LPL activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) and mass (data not shown) to the medium, while cellular activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) and mass (data not shown) increased slightly. Total LPL activity in the system increased by about 60% during four hours of incubation. When cycloheximide was added, the release of LPL to the medium was virtually abolished and cellular LPL activity decreased with time. Total LPL activity in the system decreased by almost 70%. This demonstrates that the cells depend on synthesis of new LPL protein to sustain LPL activity and secretion to the medium. Adipocytes isolated from tissue explants that had been incubated for three or six hours as in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> retained the ability to release LPL to the medium (not shown). Hence, the loss of LPL activity that occurred when tissue explants were incubated was not due to a loss of LPL production within adipocytes. In these experiments we also noted that the release of LPL from adipocytes was similar whether the cells were isolated from fed or fasted rats (not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>LPL activity in cells and in medium during incubation of isolated adipocytes, and the effect of heparin. </bold>Adipocytes (from 180 &#x02013; 200 g rats) were incubated under the same conditions as used for the tissue explants in Figure 1 without (filled symbols) or with (open symbols) 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide. &#x025cf;, &#x025cb; &#x02013; adipocytes; &#x025bc;, &#x025bd; &#x02013; medium.

Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> shows that in fresh explants of adipose tissue a substantial fraction of tissue LPL could be released by heparin. More LPL was released from tissues of fed rats (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). When the tissue explants were incubated for three hours before the heparin challenge, much less LPL was released and after six hours virtually no LPL was released (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This suggested that the decrease of LPL affected mainly the extracellular enzyme. To test this hypothesis we isolated adipocytes from tissue explants after three or six hours of incubation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The LPL activity and mass in the adipocytes was the same when the cells were isolated from tissue explants that had been incubated for three or six hours as when they were isolated from fresh tissue explants. Hence, it was extracellular LPL (calculated as the difference between tissue total and adipocytes) that accounted for the rapid decrease of tissue LPL during incubation.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Changes in the amount of heparin-releasable LPL mass during the incubation. </bold>Conditions as in Figure 1 but at the designated times, the explants of adipose tissue were transferred to new medium containing heparin and incubated for a further 45 min.

Isolated adipocytes have been tried in several laboratories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], but the differences with nutritional state are rather small. This is true whether one measures LPL within the cells or the rates at which the cells secrete LPL to the medium. These observations are repeated here. The lack of difference within adipocytes indicates that other cell types are needed and may in fact be responsible for the pronounced down-regulation of extracellular LPL activity that occurs on food deprivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. We therefore tried to use tissue explants, which have proved valuable in other studies of adipose tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Our results show that degradation of the enzyme was a major process when explants were incubated. The degradation occurred extracellularly; LPL mass and activity in the adipocytes did not change during incubation for up to six hours. Added <sup>125</sup>I-LPL was degraded and this was prevented by addition of MMP inhibitors to the medium.</p><p>There must be damage of cells when the tissue is cut into small pieces, and there is probably some degree of hypoxia during incubation of the pieces. Cultured explants have, however, been widely and successfully used to explore various aspects of adipose tissue biology ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and references therein). In preliminary experiments we found that the explants retained their ability to take up glucose, to synthesize proteins and to secrete leptin. Adipocytes isolated from the explants after several hours of incubation had the same LPL activity as adipocytes from fresh tissue (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). This indicates that the cells produced LPL at an essentially unchanged rate, since the LPL activity in adipocytes decreased rapidly when protein synthesis was inhibited by cycloheximide (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Hence, the rapid decrease of LPL when explants were incubated was not due to a general loss of functionality, but reflected specific processes leading to degradation of extracellular LPL.</p><p>Our results are in line with observations made already in the sixties. There was evidence from chromatographic separations for at least two different forms of LPL in rat adipose tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Cunnigham and Robinson found that incubation of fat pads from fed rats resulted in a rapid loss of LPL activity until a low activity, stable to prolonged incubation, was attained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In contrast, the LPL activity of isolated fat cells was stable to prolonged incubation. The concept of stable and unstable forms of the lipase can now be interpreted as a reflection of extracellular lipase that is exposed to proteolysis, and intracellular lipase that is protected from the extracellular proteases.</p><p>The degradation of LPL in conditioned medium was almost completely abolished by the two non-specific MMP inhibitors that we tested. We have not characterized the proteolytic activity further but note that adipose tissue produces at least two MMPs, 2 and 9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The loss of LPL mass during incubation of tissue explants was relatively slow during the first two hours and then accelerated. It is likely that the tissue trauma and/or the loss of blood circulation triggered an activation of the MMP system. It has been shown that primary culture of human adipose tissue explants dramatically alters adipocyte gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. It is of interest to note that LPL activity does not decrease during perfusion of fat pads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], whereas it does decrease when whole fat pads are cut out and incubated <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Two pathways for turnover of adipose tissue LPL have been demonstrated so far. One is dissociation of the lipase, perhaps after loss of catalytic activity, into the blood and degradation in the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Release of LPL into blood from adipose tissue has been directly demonstrated by measurement of arterio-venous difference in man [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. This pathway can, however, not operate in tissue explants. Another pathway, demonstrated with cultured fat cells, is endocytosis and degradation in lysosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This pathway did not seem to contribute significantly in the present system since the rate at which LPL mass decreased was not affected by chloroquine. The present findings suggest a third pathway, extracellular proteolysis in the tissue.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The rapid decrease of LPL that occurs when adipose tissue explants are incubated engages only the extracellular enzyme. The adipocytes continue to produce and secrete the enzyme and intracellular LPL remains essentially constant for at least six hours.</p><p>The decrease in extracellular LPL is due to proteolytic cleavage/degradation of both active and inactive forms of the enzyme.</p><p>The effects of inhibitors indicate, but do not prove, that the degradation is mediated by MMPs.

Detection was mediated via the 5D2 monoclonal antibody (a kind gift by Dr John Brunzell, University of Washington, Seattle) followed by a peroxidase conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody. Absorbance at 490 nm was measured in a Spectramax microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).</p><p>DNA content was assayed using Labarca's method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro </italic>incubation of adipose tissue</title><p>Epididymal adipose tissue was dissected out from fed or 24 h fasted rats. The tissue was cut into small pieces (5 mg or less). A total of about maximal 100 mg tissue pieces were immediately put into culture plates. Each well contained 15 ml of Parker Medium 199 supplemented with 2% BSA, 0.5% casein hydrolysate, 10 mM glucose and adjusted to pH 7.4. Incubations were at 37&#x000b0;C and 5 % CO<sub>2</sub>: 95 % O<sub>2 </sub>with continuous gentle shaking motion in a Cellstar Incubator (Queue Systems, Asheville, Canada). After incubation, the tissues were prepared for measurement of LPL activity and mass as described above. In some experiments samples of the medium were taken for assay of LPL activity and/or mass.</p><p>In some experiments adipocytes were prepared after collagenase treatment of the tissue pieces as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. To measure heparin releasable LPL (HR-LPL), adipose tissue explants were incubated with heparin (final concentration was 50 IU/ml) for 45 min at 37&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>Student's t-test was used for analysis of the data.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>GW carried out the experiments and participated in their design and in writing of the manuscript, TO participated in the design of the study and drafted the manuscript.
