Although there have been rare isolates of <italic>F. tularensis </italic>in Australia, tularemia is mainly a disease of the Northern hemisphere that is spread by blood-sucking mosquitoes, flies, and ticks or acquired from contact with infected animals such as rabbits, rodents, and beavers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Occasionally, local outbreaks of tularemia are associated with contact or consumption of contaminated natural water. In addition, <italic>F. tularensis </italic>is potentially a threat as a bioterrorist agent due to its high infectivity and lethality when inhaled. <italic>F. novicida </italic>is highly related at the DNA level to <italic>F. tularensis</italic>, and serves as a model organism since it is very virulent in mice while being avirulent in humans.</p><p><italic>F. tularensis </italic>is a gram-negative, facultative intracellular bacterium capable of survival and replication in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. A common virulence strategy of intracellular pathogens is to favorably modulate the intracellular milieu of hosts for their own benefit. In <italic>Legionella pneumophila </italic>a type IV secretion system (T4SS) delivers effectors that allow the pathogen to replicate in ribosome-studded phagosomes that fail to fuse with lysosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. <italic>Salmonella enterica </italic>relies on a pathogenicity island-encoded type III secretion system (TTSS) to modify phagosome biogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], including inhibition of phago-lysosomal fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and the NADPH oxidase-mediated killing by host cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Other intracellular pathogens, such as <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, degrade the phagosomal membrane and escape into the cytoplasm to replicate freely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. <italic>F. tularensis </italic>initially resides in a phagosome which accumulates some late endosome markers. After about four hours most <italic>F. tularensis </italic>cells escape the phagosome and grow in the cytoplasm. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Although an intact <italic>iglC </italic>gene is needed for <italic>F. tularensis </italic>to escape phagosomes, the role of IglC is unknown.</p><p>We recently described a <italic>Francisella </italic>pathogenicity island (FPI) harboring several genes necessary for intracellular growth. Four FPI genes, <italic>iglABCD</italic>, are organized in an apparent operon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The production of IglC mRNA is in part dependent on MglA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] which is thought to be a global regulator of virulence factors in <italic>F. tularensis</italic>. By analogy with its <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>homologue, SspA, MglA likely interacts with RNA polymerase to directly or indirectly alter transcription of several genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Disruption of <italic>mglA </italic>or <italic>mglB </italic>results in mutants that are severely attenuated for virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. IglC has been shown to be induced about four-fold during intracellular growth relative to broth growth and necessary for virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and it was recently demonstrated that inactivation of <italic>iglC </italic>and <italic>mglA </italic>result in mutants that remain in phagosomes that fuse with lysosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Although an <italic>iglA </italic>transposon insertion mutant has been shown to be defective for intracellular growth, it could not be ruled out that the observed phenotype was due to interruption of transcription of downstream genes, including <italic>iglC </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we use <italic>F. novicida </italic>to investigate the properties of IglA and its role in <italic>F. novicida </italic>intracellular growth. <italic>F. novicida </italic>is particularly suited for these studies since, unlike <italic>F. tularensis</italic>, it contains only one copy of the FPI, and this simplifies the construction of mutants. Further, the biology of <italic>F. novicida </italic>growth in human macrophages is indistinguishable from that of <italic>F. tularensis </italic>strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and thus <italic>F. novicida </italic>serves as a valid surrogate for virulent strains when studying basic aspects of <italic>Francisella </italic>intracellular growth. In this work we supply evidence that IglA is a cytoplasmic protein that interacts with IglB, and is required for intramacrophage growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>IglAB homologues in diverse bacteria are organized in a conserved gene cluster</title><p>Homologues of <italic>iglA </italic>and <italic>iglB </italic>exist in several bacterial species that are either animal or plant pathogens or plant symbionts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] but there are no known homologues of <italic>iglC </italic>or <italic>iglD</italic>. IglAB homologues in <italic>Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella enterica, Rhizobium leguminosarum</italic>, and other bacteria are found in a cluster of genes encoding proteins known as IcmF-associated homologous proteins (IAHPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Recently, it was demonstrated that this gene cluster encodes components of a proposed type VI secretion system (T6SS) in <italic>Vibrio cholerae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>In light of the emerging role of IAHP/T6SS in the secretion of proteins we re-examined the ORFs in the FPI to determine if components of a type VI secretion system may be present. Three essential components of a T6SS are a protein with an IcmF-motif and two linked genes that correspond to <italic>iglA </italic>and <italic>iglB</italic>. A BLASTP search revealed that an IcmF region was found as part of the C-terminal third of PdpB which aligned with the corresponding regions of proteins belonging to the IcmF conserved orthologous group (COG3523.2 with an E-value of 7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-9</sup>). The identification of IglA and IglB as members of COGs is much clearer. IglA has strong identity to members of COG3516 (E-value of 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-20</sup>) and IglB has strong identity with COG3517 (E-value of 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-102</sup>). Remarkably all of the relatives of <italic>iglAB </italic>are organized in the same order, and are always adjacent to each other on the chromosome. The <italic>iglAB </italic>genes together with an <italic>icmF</italic>-containing gene form the core set of genes that suggest the presence of a type VI secretion system. We also found through BLASTP analysis that the deduced product of an ORF 380 bp downstream of <italic>pdpB </italic>(shown as "<italic>vgr</italic>" in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) shows a weak similarity (E-value 0.15) to the family of <italic>vgr</italic>-encoded proteins, such as VgrG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] which is secreted by a T6SS in <italic>V. cholerae</italic>. Vgr proteins are hydrophilic proteins that contain <underline>v</underline>aline-<underline>g</underline>lycine <underline>r</underline>epeats, and are found in a number of gram negative pathogens. Another ORF, 4587 bp downstream of <italic>pdpB </italic>show similarity (E-value, 0.0005) to proteins in COG3455 that includes the IAHP-associated protein DotU. The clustering of <italic>iglAB </italic>and the <italic>icmF</italic>-containing <italic>pdpB </italic>gene, together with two other IAHP-associated genes strongly suggests that the FPI carries a type VI secretion system.</p></sec><sec><title>IglA expression in an <italic>mglAB </italic>background</title><p>Previously RT-PCR analysis of the level of <italic>iglA</italic>, <italic>iglC </italic>and <italic>iglD </italic>transcripts revealed a role of MglA in regulating expression of the <italic>iglABCD </italic>operon mRNA production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. We wished to test if IglA protein expression levels are depressed in mutant <italic>mglA </italic>and <italic>mglB </italic>backgrounds. Western immunoblot analysis of IglA in an <italic>mglA </italic>mutant and an <italic>mglB </italic>background revealed that IglA is not expressed at detectable levels in these strains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>IglA expression during intramacrophage growth</title><p>Previous studies provide evidence that MglA expression peaks at about 5 hours after infection of macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and that IglC expression is maximal at between 6 and 24 hours after infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. To access the pattern of IglA expression during <italic>F. novicida </italic>infection of macrophages, we lysed J774 macrophages at various time points after infection with the wild type strain U112 and examined the lysates for IglA using immunoblotting. In our assays IglA was first detectable at 8 hours post-infection, peaked at 10 hours, and showed a decline by 12 hours (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In broth grown cultures IglA appeared to be maximally expressed at the late logarithmic phase of growth.</p></sec><sec><title>IglA is cytoplasmically located</title><p>Knowing the cellular localization of a protein can help lead to a hypothesis as to its biological role. To investigate the subcellular localization of IglA, we fractioned <italic>F. novicida </italic>U112 into soluble and membrane-associated fractions and determined the amount of IglA in each fraction by immunoblot analysis. The data from this experiment revealed that IglA is exclusively a soluble protein (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Although IglA lacks a signal peptide sequence, it could not be ruled out that IglA localizes to the periplasm by a novel mechanism. Therefore, we isolated the periplasmic contents from <italic>F. novicida </italic>and determined by immunoblotting that IglA does not localize to this compartment. We also failed to detect IglA in culture supernatant (data not shown). The data from these experiments strongly suggest that IglA is a cytoplasmic protein. In agreement with this, the IglA homologue in <italic>Salmonella enterica </italic>has been predicted to be localized to the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>IglA interacts with IglB in vivo</title><p>To investigate interactions of IglA with other <italic>F. novicida </italic>proteins we performed immunoprecipitations with anti-IglA antibody on soluble proteins. A co-precipitating protein with a relative molecular mass of approximately 60 was detected (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). This protein band was excised and subjected to MALDI-TOF analysis, and the resulting peptide fragment masses were submitted to searches against predicted peptide fragments of prokaryotes in the MASCOT data bank. This analysis revealed that the only significant match was IglB from <italic>F. novicida </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). The relative molecular mass of the co-precipitated protein is consistent with this result as IglB is predicted to be 58 kDa. Immunoprecipitations performed with an <italic>iglA </italic>null strain did not result in the appearance of the 60 kDa band, nor did immunoprecipitations of U112 done with pre-immune serum. These results strongly suggest that IglA and IglB interact in the cytoplasm of <italic>F. novicida</italic>.</p><p>Supporting the hypothesis that IglA interacts with IglB is the finding that IglB mutants but not IglC mutants lack detectable IglA (see below, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Presumably a lack of association of IglA with IglB makes the former susceptible to degradation.</p></sec><sec><title>Deletion mutagenesis of <italic>iglA </italic>and complementation of the mutant strain</title><p>An <italic>iglA </italic>deletion mutant, ODB2, was constructed using a two-step integration-excision method (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). First, the PCR-amplified 1.5 kbp regions flanking <italic>iglA </italic>were joined so as to leave <italic>iglB </italic>intact, including its ribosome binding region. This recombinant construct was ligated to an erythromycin resistance-<italic>sacB </italic>cassette and the ligation mixture was used to chemically transform <italic>F. novicida </italic>JL0 to erythromycin resistance. The JL0 strain is a derivative of U112 that has a deletion in one of its putative sucrose hydrolase genes, and is thus sensitive to sucrose when <italic>sacB </italic>is expressed. This strain behaves like wild type in our virulence assays (data not shown). An erythromycin resistant colony was grown and plated on agar media containing 10% sucrose which acts as a counter selective marker for the <italic>sacB </italic>gene. Sucrose sensitive strains were examined for loss of <italic>iglA </italic>by PCR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Attempts to genetically complement the &#x00394;<italic>iglA </italic>strain by incorporating <italic>iglA </italic>into a <italic>F. tularensis </italic>plasmid pFNLT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] failed, presumably because the over-expression of IglA was lethal to <italic>F. novicida</italic>. Hence, an <italic>in cis </italic>complementation approach was devised, allowing <italic>iglA </italic>to be incorporated into the chromosome linked to a kanamycin resistance marker (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). The <italic>iglA </italic>deletion strain failed to produce IglA as determined by Western immunoblotting (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). However, the &#x00394;<italic>iglA </italic>strain retained expression of IglC at parental strain levels. <italic>In cis </italic>complementation of the &#x00394;<italic>iglA </italic>strain resulted in a strain that regained partial expression of IglA. An insertion mutant of <italic>iglB </italic>gave a reduction in the amount of IglC that was made, and this is not surprising since many insertion mutation decrease the expression of downstream genes. Surprisingly, this same mutant lacked expression of IglA, suggesting that the co-expression of IglB is needed for expression of IglA or to prevent degradation of IglA. Disruption of <italic>iglC </italic>however, does not affect the amount of IglA detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>IglA is required for growth in the J774 macrophage cell line</title><p>Previous work has suggested that IglA is required for <italic>F. novicida </italic>intramacrophage growth and virulence; however, its role has never been unequivocally demonstrated. In order to assess the requirement for IglA expression in intramacrophage growth we used our defined deletion and complemented strains to infect a culture of the J774 macrophage cell line. The data shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> illustrates that the &#x00394;<italic>iglA </italic>strain is incapable of intramacrophage growth, as is the <italic>iglC </italic>negative strain, CG62. The &#x00394;<italic>iglA </italic>strain that was complemented for IglA production partially regained its ability to grow in macrophages. The residual defect in intracellular growth is not unexpected since we showed that the expression of IglA was not at wild type levels. &#x00394;<italic>iglA </italic>replicated as the parental strain in broth (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>The &#x00394;iglA strain has lowered virulence in chicken embryos</title><p>When the &#x00394;<italic>iglA </italic>strain was used to infect chicken embryos it caused low mortality when compared to wild type <italic>F. novicida </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). The wild type strain of <italic>F. novicida </italic>caused 100% mortality at day 5 post infection at an infecting dose of 600 CFU, whereas the &#x00394;<italic>iglA </italic>strain caused only 14% mortality at day 6 with an infecting dose of 4,500 CFU (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>) or 50% mortality at day 6 with an infecting dose of 45,000 CFU (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>There is growing evidence that the <italic>iglABCD </italic>operon is needed for <italic>F. tularensis </italic>intracellular growth and virulence and that the MglAB proteins are involved in regulating the expression of <italic>iglABCD</italic>. However, there is very little genetic and corresponding biochemical data demonstrating the roles of MglAB and IglAB and their corresponding homologues in other bacteria. For example, while it is clear that MglA plays a role in regulating the amount of <italic>iglABCD </italic>transcript it is unclear if the role precisely corresponds to that of the <italic>E. coli </italic>SspA protein. The data that exists for the functioning of SspA suggest that much of the regulation of stationery phase proteins occurs indirectly via the repression of H-NS, and that some of the effect of SspA is post-transcriptional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>There is also growing evidence that proteins encoded by IAHP clusters, of which IglAB homologues are important components, are involved in secretion of proteins from gram-negative bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. There are approximately 30 homologues of <italic>iglAB </italic>and in every case the two genes are adjacent to each other and arranged in the same gene order. In this work we provided biochemical evidence that the IglAB proteins physically associate with each other and are localized to the cytoplasm. The surprising finding that inactivation of the <italic>iglB </italic>gene results in the disappearance of the IglA protein suggest that the presence of IglB is required for IglA to be stable.</p><p>IglA was first identified as a locus that when inactivated by a transposon insertion rendered <italic>F. novicida </italic>defective for growth in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, it could not be ruled out that the effect was due to interruption of transcription of downstream genes. In this report, we provide strong evidence that IglA is necessary for intracellular growth as a non-polar <italic>iglA </italic>deletion mutant was defective for growth in a mouse macrophage-like cell line. <italic>In cis </italic>complementation of the &#x00394;<italic>iglA </italic>strain restored intramacrophage growth although the growth was slower than in the wild type strain. The <italic>in cis </italic>complementation strategy created two <italic>iglA </italic>promoter regions on the chromosome, one on either side of a kanamycin resistance cassette. It is conceivable that this results in aberrant regulation of <italic>iglA </italic>expression, which could explain why the growth of the complementation strain lags early during infection. We were unable to complement the <italic>iglA </italic>deletion mutant <italic>in trans </italic>with pFNLTP1::<italic>iglA</italic>, a high copy-derivative of an endogenous <italic>Francisella </italic>plasmid. Presumably, over-expression of IglA was lethal to <italic>F. novicida</italic>.</p><p>We hypothesize that IglA and IglB are cytoplasmic, chaperone-like proteins that are involved in secretion of virulence factors. Therefore, the biological significance of IglAB interaction may be to secrete <italic>Francisella </italic>effector molecules. In other pathogens, secretion of virulence proteins often requires interaction between two cytoplasmic proteins. For example, in <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic>, a complex composed of SycN and YscB function as chaperones for YopN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], which is secreted to the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Also, interaction of IcmS and IcmW is required for translocation of effector proteins via the Dot/Icm complex during <italic>Legionella pneumophila </italic>intracellular growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Hager <italic>et al. </italic>recently demonstrated protein secretion by <italic>F. novicida </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. We did not observe any difference in secreted peptides between broth-grown wild type <italic>F. novicida </italic>and the &#x00394;<italic>iglA </italic>strain by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis (data not shown). This observation is not surprising given the fact it has been demonstrated that secretion involving IAHPs is a highly regulated or an <italic>in vivo-</italic>induced process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>In summary, our results suggest that IglA and IglB are interacting cytoplasmic proteins that are required for intramacrophage growth. The significance of the interaction may be to secrete effector molecules that affect host cell processes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The <italic>Francisella </italic>Pathogenicity Island harbors uncharacterized genes implicated in virulence. By constructing an in-frame deletion mutant we have shown that the FPI gene <italic>iglA </italic>is needed for intramacrophage growth. Biochemical characterization of IglA strongly suggests that it is a cytoplasmic protein that interacts physically with IglB. In addition, we provide data that show IglA is induced during infection of macrophages. Bioinformatics analysis of the FPI suggests that it is similar to virulence loci that encode a protein secretion apparatus.

Kanamycin (45 &#x003bc;g/ml) or erythromycin (30 &#x003bc;g/ml) or 10% sucrose were added as needed.</p></sec><sec><title>Subcellular fractionation</title><p>1000 ml of overnight <italic>F. novicida </italic>U112 culture was harvested and resuspended in 50 ml of cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Cells were broken by repeated passage through a French Pressure cell (American Instruments Co, Silver Spring, MD) at 1200 PSI. Unbroken cells were removed by 20 min of centrifugation at 10,000 &#x000d7; <italic>g </italic>at 4&#x000b0;C, and a sample was taken as the total protein fraction. The lysate was subjected to ultracentrifugation (Beckman L8-70, rotor Type 45 Ti) for 1 hr at 100,000 &#x000d7; <italic>g </italic>at 4&#x000b0;C to pellet the membranes. The supernatant (soluble protein fraction) was removed, whereas the membrane pellet was resuspended in 2.5 ml of 1% Sarkosyl (Sigma). The sarkosyl soluble (inner membrane) and the sarkosyl insoluble (outer membrane) were separated by ultracentrifugation for 1 hr at 100,000 &#x000d7; <italic>g </italic>at 4&#x000b0;C in a Beckman TLA-100.3 ultramicrocentrifuge. The activity of the inner membrane-associated enzyme NADH oxidase was determined per mg of protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] for each of the fractions as a measure of the relative mixing of the different cell compartments. The soluble fraction contained 3%, the sarkosyl soluble membrane fraction 79% and the sarkosyl insoluble membrane fraction 18% of the NADH oxidase activity. In addition, we found that 90% of IglC was found in the soluble fraction (data not shown) and 10% was in the total membrane fraction. IglC could not be detected in the sarkosyl-soluble or sarkosyl-insoluble membrane fractions. As IglC has previously been shown to be a soluble protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], this served as another control of our fractionation experiment. Isolation of periplasmic proteins was performed as described by Nossal and Heppel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Co-immunoprecipitation</title><p>500 &#x003bc;l of soluble fraction was pre-cleared by incubation with 20 &#x003bc;l protein-G/Agarose beads (40% slurry; EMB Bioscience, La Jolla, CA) and 10 &#x003bc;g nonspecific antibody for 1 h at room temperature (RT). Beads and bound proteins were removed by centrifugation and the soluble fraction was incubated with 10 &#x003bc;l rabbit anti-IglA serum or nonspecific antibody for 1 h at RT followed by addition of 75 &#x003bc;l protein-G/Agarose beads and incubation 1 h at RT. Complexes were recovered by centrifugation, 6500 rpm, 3 min, and beads were washed three times with 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Na<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>PO, pH 7.2. After the final wash, complexes were resuspended in 30 &#x003bc;l SDS-PAGE loading buffer and the sample was boiled for 5 min. Beads were removed by centrifugation and released proteins were separated on a 12% Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrlamide electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gel. The immunoprecipitated material was examined by immunoblotting with anti-IglA to confirm that IglA was present (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>SDS-PAGE and Western blotting</title><p>To normalize the amount of protein added to each lane, the concentration of protein samples were determined by use of the BCA assay (Pierce). SDS-PAGE was performed according to standard techniques. Separated proteins were transferred onto a Trans Blot<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>nitrocellulose (BioRad) or Immobilon-FL (Millipore) membrane and blocked with 5% skim milk (Difco) in PBS. Anti-IglA, and anti-IglC antibody were used at dilutions of 1:4,000 and 1:500 respectively. To detect bound antibody blots were incubated with IRDye800DX-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or IRDye700DX-conjugated goat anti-rat immunoglobulin G (Rockland, Gilbertsville, Pa.) and visualized in a LiCor Odyssey imaging system.</p></sec><sec><title>MALDI-TOF</title><p>Following SDS-PAGE separation of proteins in-gel digestion with trypsin was carried out, and peptides extracted. 10 &#x003bc;l of the peptide sample was loaded on to a C18 zip tip and washed three times in 10 &#x003bc;l of 0.1% TFA and eluted with 2 &#x003bc;l of 50% ACN and 0.1% TFA containing 10 mg/ml 4-hydroxy alpha cyanocinnamic acid.
