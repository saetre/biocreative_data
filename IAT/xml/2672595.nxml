The neuronal growth cone is a dynamic structure at the tip of the axon that provides the traction force necessary for axon outgrowth and acts as a sensor. It explores the environment by integrating guidance cues that influence its direction and remodeling. These functions depend on the cytoskeleton reorganization and dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005405-Zhou1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005405-Dent1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Although the actin cytoskeleton has been proposed as a major target of guidance cues due to its peripheral location in the growth cone and its crucial role in extension and retraction of filopodia and lamellipodia when they encounter tropic cues, the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton has also been involved in the guiding process through intracellular signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005405-GordonWeeks1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Changes in the organization of MTs were proposed to occur later in vivo, as a consequence of formation and disassembly of actin filaments. However, recent studies have revealed that MTs do not remain passively bundled in the growth cone center since a dynamic population of MTs composed of tyrosinated-tubulin is able to enter the actin-rich peripheral domain (P-domain) of the growth cone and to grow along actin filaments in filopodia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005405-Kalil1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We have studied the role of tubulin tyrosination, a post-translational modification of the tubulin that allows, after elimination of the C-terminal tyrosine of neo-synthesized &#x003b1;-tubulin by a carboxypeptidase, its re-addition by the tubulin tyrosine ligase (TTL). This post-translational modification leads to the presence of tyrosinated-tubulin (tyr-tubulin) at the dynamic plus-ends of MTs while older and more stable MTs are mainly composed of detyrosinated tubulin, called glutamylated-tubulin (glu-tubulin) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005405-Paturle1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005405-Webster1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Despite the absence of functional links between the tyrosination state of MTs and their dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005405-Webster2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, it appears that dynamic MTs contain tyr-tubulin, whereas bundled MTs in the central domain of the growth cone (C-domain) are detyrosinated and more stable. In <italic>TTL</italic> knock-out mice (<italic>TTL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>), detyrosinated tubulin is accumulated and mice die perinatally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005405-Erck1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. A previous analysis of <italic>TTL</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice has revealed that tyr-tubulin is involved in the control of proper neurite extensions of hippocampal neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005405-Erck1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, the recruitment of Clip-170, a plus-end tracking protein (&#x0002b;TIP protein) that binds to MTs, and of other MT &#x0002b;TIP proteins, which have a cytoskeleton-associated protein glycine-rich (CAP-Gly) MT binding domain, such as Clip115 and p150 Glued, is impaired in <italic>TTL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005405-Peris1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, to better understand how the presence of the C-terminal tyrosine on &#x003b1;-tubulin influences neurite outgrowth, a deeper analysis of the intracellular organization of axons during outgrowth was necessary.</p><p>Precerebellar nuclei (PCN) provide an interesting model to study guidance cues. Indeed, PCN neurons, dorsally located in the rhombic lips, migrate ventrally through a tangential neurophilic migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005405-Rakic1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, emitting first a leading process, the future axon, and then translocating their cell bodies in the leading process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005405-BlochGallego1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. The floor plate is a source of both contact molecules and chemotropic factors, such as Netrin-1 that can influence both axon guidance and cell bodies migration of various PCN neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005405-BlochGallego2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005405-Yee1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005405-Alcantara1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> and act as an intermediate target for migrating PCN neurons.</p><p>Although admitted that axon growth and guidance depend on well-coordinated cytoskeletal dynamics, the direct characterization of specific cues remained a challenge. Only recently have small GTPases - in particular the Rho/Rho Kinase pathway and myosin II contractility - been altogether involved in regulation of microtubule behavior during neuronal growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005405-Schaefer1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. It has also been reported that upon Myosin II inhibition, the movement of actin filaments and MTs immediately stopped and MTs unbundled in the gowth cone neck <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005405-Burnette1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Here, we explore the role of tubulin re-tyrosination on growth cone pathfinding through the analysis of <italic>TTL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> PCN neurons that are deprived of tyr-tubulin. We report that the pathfinding of <italic>TTL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> axons is disturbed in the vicinity of the floor plate in vivo. Ex vivo, in hindbrain open-book preparations, growth cones are enlarged and exhibit a complex morphology with numerous mis-oriented filopodia, especially when reaching the floor plate. In vitro in a collagen matrix, axon outgrowth is decreased, although still oriented toward a local attractive Netrin-1 source. Supernumerary exploring branches also develop all along the axons. In addition, the cytoskeletal organization in the growth cone is disrupted since detyrosinated MTs abnormally enter the peripheral actin-rich domain and they exhibit a decreased local recruitment of Myosin IIB. These observations are concomitant and consistent with an increased activity of Rac1 small GTPase observed in <italic>TTL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> hindbrains. The distal accumulation of Myosin IIB can be significantly rescued after pharmacological inhibition of Rac1 activity. Altogether, these results suggest that re-tyrosination at the MTs plus-ends is required for the formation and intracellular organization of a functional growth cone at the tip of the axon.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>In vivo, the migratory process develops properly in the absence of <italic>TTL</italic>, but inferior olivary fibers show an abnormal aspect in the vicinity of the floor plate</title><p>Newly synthesized &#x003b1;-tubulin carries a tyrosine residue on its C-terminal.

To further compare the aspect of individual axons and growth cones, a GFP-expression plasmid was electroporated unilaterally at the rhombic lip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005405-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). To analyze whether the growth speed was affected by the absence of tyrosination, we fixed GFP-electroporated organotypic cultures after 30, 48 and 72 hours and confirmed that axon outgrowth could develop ex vivo with a proper time course and amplitude.

Surprisingly, wt and <italic>TTL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> PCN neurons showed distinct behaviours when leaving the explant to enter the collagen matrix. Actually, inside the explants, the wt GFP-electroporated neurons emitted a single primary neurite that entered the collagen matrix straightaway toward the Netrin-1 source (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005405-g006">Fig. 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005405.s007">Movie S3</xref> in supplementary material). Conversely, the aspect of GFP-electroporated <italic>TTL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> neurites was often modified when they contacted the edge of the explants as they started to emit an increased number of primary and secondary neurites. By this way, they seemed to explore extensively the environment and the border of the explant, but few of them succeeded in getting out of the explant to enter the collagen matrix (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005405-g006">Fig. 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005405.s008">Movie S4</xref> in supplementary material), which could explain the decreased total axon outgrowth upon TUJ1 staining and threshold quantification, observed from 1 DIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005405-g003">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005405-g004">Fig. 4</xref>).

Actually, this may reflect a difficulty for leading processes with detyrosinated MTs to move forward through a soft tridimensional substrate like collagen, that may offer less adhesion sites for growth cones than their physiological environment. Although it is admitted that the behavior of some cells can vary on substrates of various stiffness, very few molecular cues have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005405-Discher1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> for a review). We have tested the role of stiffness/softness for PCN outgrowth and their link with MTs tyrosination by culturing rhombic lip explants in collagen matrices of increasing concentrations, 25&#x00025;, 50&#x00025; and 75&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005405-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). Interestingly, in wt explants, the maximum outgrowth was reached with an intermediate concentration of collagen (50&#x00025;), whereas when the collagen was diluted (25&#x00025;) or concentrated (75&#x00025;), the total outgrowth of the leading processes decreased to similar levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005405-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). These results indicate that the density of the matrix can indeed have significative effects on leading process outgrowth in wt neurons. It suggests that an intermediate softness could be required to get the formation of enough adhesion sites without impeding the normal progression of the growth cone through the matrix, because of its density. At the reverse, collagen density has less effect on <italic>TTL</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> explants since we did not succeed in increasing their outgrowth neither by increasing nor by decreasing the collagen concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005405-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>), pointing out that collagen seems to be a more challenging type of substrate for <italic>TTL</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> growth cones than for wt ones, but its relative softness does not seem to affect the outgrowth of <italic>TTL</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>leading processes.</p><p>Altogether, these in vitro experiments in collagen matrix showed that <italic>TTL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> leading processes have no guidance defect which was consistant with our in vivo observations.

We demonstrate that axons in which tubulin retyrosination does not occur emit supernumerary neurites ex vivo and in vitro. In vitro assays reveal a reduction of axon length and their axon trajectories are not straight when they grow in a collagen matrix, or ex vivo when they approach the floor plate. The pathway defects reported here in <italic>TTL</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mutant hindbrains are specially emphasized around the floor plate, possibly due to its composition in both adhesion and diffusible guidance molecules, but they could also reflect a general growth defect or sensitivity in the absence of TTL. In addition, the absence of tubulin retyrosination prevents the proper intracellular organization of the growth cone cytoskeletal components. Nevertheless, <italic>TTL</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> axons can still follow their global pathway in/ex vivo and reach their target.
