To gain insights into Cdc24 function, we isolated cold-sensitive chromosomal suppressors of the temperature-sensitive <italic>cdc24-M38</italic> allele.

Collections of conditional-lethal cell division cycle (<italic>cdc</italic>) mutants generated by random mutagenesis of both yeasts have played an important role in facilitating the identification of a large number of protein factors essential for different stages of the replication process. In <italic>S.pombe</italic>, for example, genes encoding all three essential replicative DNA polymerases have been identified in this way (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c1">1</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>S.pombe</italic> the <italic>cdc24-M38</italic> mutant was initially isolated as one of the <italic>cdc</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c2">2</xref>). Cells carrying this temperature-sensitive mutation halt cell cycle progression when shifted to the restrictive temperature, becoming arrested in late S-phase with incompletely replicated DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c4">4</xref>). The <italic>cdc24</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> gene encodes an essential 501 amino acid protein with no apparent homologs in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c4">4</xref>).</p><p>Two lines of evidence indicate possible interactions between Cdc24 and DNA polymerase &#x003b4; (Pol &#x003b4;). First, Cdc24 physically and genetically interacts with two accessory proteins for DNA polymerase &#x003b4;: the large subunit of replication factor C (RF-C) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), encoded by <italic>rfc1</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> and <italic>pcn1</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c6">6</xref>). Secondly, overexpression of the <italic>cdm1</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> gene, encoding a non-essential subunit of Pol &#x003b4;, suppresses the temperature-sensitive lethality of the <italic>cdc24-M38</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c7">7</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>dna2</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> gene was also identified as a multicopy suppressor of a temperature-sensitive <italic>cdc24</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c3">3</xref>). <italic>dna2</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> interacts genetically, not only with <italic>cdc24</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup>, but also with <italic>cdc1</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> and <italic>cdc27</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> (encoding the essential small subunits of Pol &#x003b4;), <italic>cdc17</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> (encoding <italic>S.pombe</italic> DNA ligase I), and <italic>rad2</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> (encoding the <italic>S.pombe</italic> homolog of the nuclease Fen-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c8">8</xref>). Fen-1 is required for the Okazaki fragment processing in the mammalian SV40 <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA replication system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c9">9</xref>). Dna2 binds to Cdc24 strongly in the yeast two-hybrid assay system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c8">8</xref>). This helicase&#x02013;endonuclease is required for DNA replication, but not for the bulk DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c8">8</xref>). This phenotype is the same as those of <italic>cdc24</italic> and <italic>cdc17</italic>.</p><p>In addition to having weak DNA helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c11">11</xref>), budding yeast Dna2p also has single-stranded DNA-specific endonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c12">12</xref>). Indeed, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have suggested that Dna2 acts as a nuclease in Okazaki fragment maturation during lagging strand DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c14">14</xref>, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c15">15</xref>). Taken together, these genetic and biochemical results suggest the most likely function of Cdc24 is in the process of Okazaki fragment maturation, perhaps as a regulator of Dna2 activity, or as an adaptor molecule, linking Dna2 to Pol &#x003b4;.</p><p>DNA helicase molecules play important roles in various DNA transactions including DNA replication, recombination and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c18">18</xref>). In budding yeast, in addition to Dna2p, at least three other DNA helicases appear to be involved in DNA replication. The MCM helicase complex has DNA helicase activity and is proposed to act by unwinding duplex DNA at replication origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c19">19</xref>). In addition, this complex moves with replication fork after initiation of DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c20">20</xref>), and is also required for the elongation phase of DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c21">21</xref>). The MCM protein complex is therefore a good candidate for the replicative helicase that unwinds DNA duplex ahead of the moving replication fork. Two additional <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> DNA helicases, Pif1p and Rrm3p, are also likely to have functions in the DNA replication (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c22">22</xref>). Pif1p is 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; DNA helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c24">24</xref>) that functions both in the nucleus and in mitochondria. In the nucleus, Pif1p inhibits both <italic>de novo</italic> telomere formation and telomere elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c26">26</xref>) and in this way protects cells against gross chromosome rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c27">27</xref>). In the mitochondria, Pif1p is involved both in mtDNA repair and recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c28">28</xref>). Rrm3p, a putative DNA helicase protein highly homologous to Pif1p, is suggested to be a replicative DNA helicase specific for ribosomal DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c29">29</xref>). Interestingly, Pif1p and Rrm3p have opposite functions in replication fork movement at rDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c29">29</xref>). As a result Pif1p and Rrm3p are thought to have similar substrate specificities but to exert different effects on them. The Pif1p&#x0002f;Rrm3p subfamily of DNA helicases is conserved from yeast to human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c26">26</xref>). However there are no reports of detailed analysis of Pif1p subfamily helicases other than in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>.</p><p>Here we report the isolation of the <italic>S.pombe</italic><italic>pfh1</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> gene, which encodes a DNA helicase homologous to Pif1p subfamily DNA helicases, as a suppressor mutation of the <italic>cdc24-M38</italic> mutant. We present evidence that Pfh1 DNA helicase is essential for cell viability (in contrast to the case of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> homologs Pif1p and Rrm3p) and that Pfh1 is required for cell cycle progression in late S-phase and for the proper response to DNA-damaging agents. These results lead us to propose that Pfh1 performs essential functions in both chromosomal DNA replication and DNA repair in <italic>S.pombe</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Fission yeast strains and media</title><p>The strains of <italic>S.pombe</italic> used in this study are listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf590tb1">1</xref>.

These two single <italic>pfh1</italic> mutants were still cold sensitive for growth (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf590f1">1</xref>). To analyze the phenotype of these mutants, exponentially growing cells at 34&#x000b0;C were shifted down to 18&#x000b0;C and analyzed by DAPI staining. At 34&#x000b0;C, <italic>pfh1-R20</italic> cells were slightly elongated compared with <italic>pfh1</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf590f2">2</xref>A), suggesting that the Pfh1-R20 mutant protein has reduced activity even at the permissive temperature of 34&#x000b0;C. After the temperature shift to 18&#x000b0;C, <italic>pfh1-R20</italic> cells ceased cell proliferation and arrested with elongated morphology and a single nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf590f2">2</xref>A). This phenotype suggested that the <italic>pfh1</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> gene was required for cell cycle progression. To analyze the <italic>pfh1-R20</italic> arrest point in the cell cycle, DNA content was analyzed by flow cytometry.

Rad1 is required for DNA replication&#x0002f;damage checkpoint function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c42">42</xref>): the <italic>rad1-1</italic> mutant fails to arrest the cell cycle when DNA is unreplicated or damaged. If <italic>pfh1</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> is required for the completion of DNA replication, <italic>pfh1</italic> mutant cells would be expected to enter mitosis when combined with the <italic>rad1-1</italic> mutation. To test this, we generated <italic>pfh1-R20 rad1-1</italic> double mutants by tetrad analysis. However, we found that <italic>pfh1-R20 rad1-1</italic> cells grew very slowly, forming only microcolonies at 34&#x000b0;C. These cells were streaked on YE plates and incubated at 18&#x000b0;C for 24 h and examined by DAPI staining. Cells displaying nuclear abnormalities suggestive of inappropriate entry into mitosis were frequently observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf590f2">2</xref>C). These phenotypes were also observed in cells grown even at a permissive temperature of 34&#x000b0;C. Similar results were obtained from the analysis of <italic>pfh1-R23 rad1-1</italic> cells (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that <italic>pfh1</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> is required for S-phase completion. To investigate this further, we constructed <italic>pfh1</italic> double mutants with &#x00394;<italic>chk1</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>cds1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c45">45</xref>). Both Chk1 and Cds1 are downstream kinases of the DNA replication&#x0002f;damage checkpoint pathway. By the analysis of these mutant cells at 18&#x000b0;C, we found that checkpoint arrest required Chk1 but not Cds1: elongated cells were not observed in <italic>pfh1-R20</italic> &#x00394;<italic>chk1</italic> or in <italic>pfh1-R23</italic> &#x00394;<italic>chk1</italic>, whereas <italic>pfh1-R20</italic> &#x00394;<italic>cds1</italic> and <italic>pfh1-R23</italic> &#x00394;<italic>cds1</italic> cells were elongated at 18&#x000b0;C (data not shown). This result suggested that loss of Pfh1 function triggers a <italic>chk1</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup>-dependent late S&#x0002f;G2 DNA damage checkpoint pathway. Similar checkpoint dependencies were reported with other S-phase cell division cycle mutants, such as <italic>pol3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c46">46</xref>) and <italic>cdc17</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c45">45</xref>).</p><p>The chromosomes of <italic>pfh1</italic> mutant cells were analyzed by pulse-field gel electrophoresis in which incompletely replicated chromosomes fail to enter the gel.

This was achieved by spotting cells onto YE plates containing HU or MMS, or by irradiating cells spotted onto YE plates with UV. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf590f2">2</xref>E, <italic>pfh1-R20</italic> mutant cells showed only a slightly increased sensitivity to UV compared with <italic>pfh1</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> cells but were highly sensitive to both HU and MMS.

Therefore, the <italic>pfh1</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> gene was required for the proper response to nucleotide pool depletion (the consequence of HU addition) and for repairing DNA damage caused by MMS.</p><p>There are two possible explanations for the sensitivity to HU. The mutant cells may be inherently checkpoint defective, i.e. entry into mitosis may result in the presence of HU, with lethal consequences. Alternatively, the cells may arrest normally in HU, but be unable to recover from the arrest to resume normal growth. In order to distinguish between these possibilities, we exposed <italic>pfh1</italic> mutant cells to HU transiently and investigated their viability and morphology over a period of time (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf590f3">3</xref>A&#x02013;C). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf590f3">3</xref>A, cell number increase in the <italic>pfh1-R20</italic> and <italic>pfh1-R23</italic> cultures ceased following HU exposure: the elongated morphology of <italic>pfh1-R20</italic> and <italic>pfh1-R23</italic> cells at 6 h incubation in HU indicated that checkpoint function was intact in these cells, in contrast to <italic>rad1-1</italic> cells which showed cut phenotype without cell elongation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf590f3">3</xref>C). These results indicated that HU sensitivity of <italic>pfh1</italic> mutant cells arose not from a checkpoint defect but from a problem in the recovery process.</p></sec><sec><title>Isolation of the <italic>pfh1</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> gene</title><p>To isolate the <italic>pfh1</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> gene, both <italic>S.pombe</italic> genomic DNA and SV40 promoter-driven cDNA libraries were screened for clones that could suppress the cold sensitivity of <italic>pfh1-R20</italic> and <italic>pfh1-R23</italic> cells. We isolated three cDNA clones and one genomic clone that rescued the mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf590f4">4</xref>A). All three cDNA clones contained the same ORF, and this ORF was also present in the genomic DNA clone. The ORF was identical to a gene located on the <italic>S.pombe</italic> chromosome II cosmid clone SPBC887 (EMBL accession no. AL033388) at nucleotides 28298&#x02013;30756. (Note that we confirmed the presence of the predicted 41 bp intron in the ORF by comparison between cDNA and genomic DNA sequences.)

A database search revealed that Pfh1 is related to the Pif1p and Rrm3p proteins of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, with amino acid identities of 35 and 33&#x00025;, respectively. Pif1p is a 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; DNA helicase implicated in mitochondrial DNA recombination and repair, telomere length regulation, and replication fork progression in ribosomal DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c29">29</xref>).

The gel was either Coomassie stained (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf590f7">7</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;10) or analyzed by western blot (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf590f7">7</xref>, lanes 11&#x02013;20). Both wild-type NusA-Pfh1 and mutant NusA-Pfh1K338E were efficiently expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic> in soluble forms (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf590f7">7</xref>, lanes 2 and 7, respectively), and both proteins were purified to near homogeneity using the purification procedure described in Materials and Methods (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf590f7">7</xref>, lanes 5 and 10). Some of the smaller polypeptides present in the fractions eluted from the Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-charged HiTrap-chelating column (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf590f7">7</xref>, lanes 3 and 8) appear to be proteolyzed products since they were detected by monoclonal antibody specific for penta-histidine in western blot analyses (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf590f7">7</xref>, lanes 13 and 17).</p></sec><sec><title>ATPase and helicase activities of Pfh1</title><p>With purified wild-type NusA-Pfh1, we were able to detect ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf590f8">8</xref>A. The amount of ATP hydrolyzed was proportional to the amounts of enzyme added, resulting in 233, 625 and 1505 pmol of ATP hydrolysis with 30, 90 and 270 ng, respectively, of enzyme. ATP hydrolysis by NusA-Pfh1 was dependent on the presence of ssDNA and Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. In contrast, ATP hydrolysis was not detected by NusA-Pfh1K338E when we used the same amounts of enzyme as wild-type protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf590f8">8</xref>A). This result confirms that the Pfh1 has intrinsic ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity. We next examined whether NusA-Pfh1 possesses helicase activity and found that wild-type NusA-Pfh1 was able to unwind the 30 bp partial duplex DNA present in &#x003a6;X174 sscDNA, whereas the mutant NusA-Pfh1K338E failed to do so. This is consistent with the result above. The unwinding activity of wild-type Pfh1 was also dependent on the presence of ATP and Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. The removal of NusA tag by thrombin cleavage neither increased nor decreased the ability of the recombinant NusA-Pfh1 enzyme to hydrolyze ATP (data not shown).</p><p>Since the <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> Pif1p helicase unwinds DNA in the 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c24">24</xref>), we tested whether <italic>S.pombe</italic> Pfh1 unwinds duplex DNA in the same direction as Pif1p. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf590f8">8</xref>C, NusA-Pfh1 utilized a partial duplex substrate with a 5&#x02032; tail only, but not the substrate with a 3&#x02032; tail, demonstrating that Pfh1 translocates and unwinds duplex DNA in the 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; direction like <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> Pif1p. It is noteworthy that unwinding by Pfh1 was more efficient with oligonucleotide-based substrates than with &#x003a6;X174-based substrate. For example, &#x0003e;80&#x00025; of substrate was unwound with 30 ng of Pfh1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf590f8">8</xref>C) with oligonucleotide-based substrate, while &#x0003e;270 ng of Pfh1 was required for comparable unwinding of the &#x003a6;X174-based substrate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf590f8">8</xref>B). This is likely to be due to the presence of bulk ssDNA in &#x003a6;X174 sscDNA that may sequester a large fraction of enzyme.</p></sec><sec><title>Catalytic activity is essential for Pfh1 function <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>To examine the essentiality of catalytic activity of Pfh1 <italic>in vivo</italic>, we constructed plasmid pREP81-pfh1K338R expressing Pfh1-K338R, which contains a mutation in the ATP-binding motif. pREP81-pfh1 and pREP81-pfh1K338R were transformed to <italic>pfh1-R20</italic> cells and we examined the suppression ability of cold sensitivity.

Exponentially growing Pfh1-GFP expressing cells were then analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. The fluorescent signal of the Pfh1-GFP protein was observed in the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf590f9">9</xref>), consistent with the notion that the Pfh1 protein functions in chromosomal DNA replication. Although some fluorescence could also be detected in the cytoplasm of Pfh1-GFP expressing cells (in ribbon-like patterns reminiscent of previously published images of <italic>S.pombe</italic> mitochondria), these were also seen, at similar intensity, in wild-type cells lacking the GFP protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf590f9">9</xref>). Unlike Pif1p, therefore, Pfh1 in <italic>S.pombe</italic> appears to be exclusively nuclear.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The Cdc24 protein plays an important role in chromosomal DNA replication in fission yeast. Cells carrying temperature-sensitive mutations in the <italic>cdc24</italic> gene undergo cell cycle arrest when shifted to the restrictive temperature, becoming arrested with incompletely replicated chromosomes prior to the onset of mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c4">4</xref>). Previously, <italic>cdc24</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> has been shown to interact with three genes encoding subunits of the DNA polymerase &#x003b4; holoenzyme complex (Pol &#x003b4;&#x02013;PCNA&#x02013;RF-C) in <italic>S.pombe</italic>, as well as with the <italic>dna2</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> gene which encodes a nuclease-helicase required for Okazaki fragment processing.

In the case of Pcn1, Rfc1 and Dna2, these genetic interactions reflect physical interactions between the encoded proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have shown physical associations, direct or indirect, between Cdc24 and PCNA, and between Cdc24 and Rfc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c4">4</xref>). Yeast two-hybrid analysis suggests that Cdc24 and Dna2 interact directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c8">8</xref>).</p><p>In order to isolate novel factors that interact with <italic>cdc24</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup>, we identified cold-sensitive chromosomal suppressors of the temperature-sensitive <italic>cdc24-M38</italic> mutant allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c2">2</xref>). Amongst 37 such mutants, we mapped five to a single complementation group. We cloned the corresponding gene, which we named <italic>pfh1</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup>, and here describe the results of <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis of the function of Pfh1, an 805 amino acid protein homologous to Pif1p and Rrm3p DNA helicase family members in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c22">22</xref>).</p><p>To elucidate the <italic>in vivo</italic> function of <italic>pfh1</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup>, we analyzed the cold-sensitive <italic>pfh1-R20</italic> and <italic>pfh1-R23</italic> cells as well as the <italic>pfh1</italic>-disrupted cells. All the data, including genetic interactions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf590f1">1</xref>), mutant phenotype (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf590f2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf590f3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf590f5">5</xref>), mRNA expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf590f6">6</xref>), 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; DNA helicase activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf590f8">8</xref>), essentiality of this activity <italic>in vivo</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf590f4">4</xref>B), and cellular localization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf590f9">9</xref>) suggest that Pfh1 has an essential function in chromosomal DNA replication. However, like Cdc24 and Dna2, Pfh1 is not required for bulk DNA synthesis (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf590f2">2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf590f5">5</xref>E).</p><p>To understand the enzymatic function of Pfh1, we purified recombinant protein expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic> to near homogeneity and demonstrated that Pfh1 protein has ssDNA-dependent ATPase and 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; DNA helicase activities (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf590f8">8</xref>). In addition, we introduced a point mutation at a lysine residue in the ATP-binding pocket predicted to be essential for ATPase activity, demonstrated that the recombinant mutant protein did indeed lack such activity, and introduced the mutant allele into <italic>pfh1-R20</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>pfh1</italic> cells. Since this mutant gene could not complement the cold sensitivity of <italic>pfh1-R20</italic> cells nor lethality of &#x00394;<italic>pfh1</italic> cells, we conclude that the essentiality of <italic>pfh1</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> is based on its catalytic activity.</p><p>What is the cellular function of Pfh1? One fascinating possibility is that Pfh1 functions in Okazaki fragment processing together with the Dna2&#x02013;Cdc24 complex. Conceivably, the Pfh1 helicase could cooperate with Dna2. Recently, we found that DNA helicase and endonuclease activities of budding yeast Dna2p are tightly coupled to ensure efficient removal of the flap during the Okazaki fragment maturation step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c49">49</xref>). In budding yeast, Dna2p helicase activity assists this process by removing secondary structures present in the flap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c49">49</xref>). In this context, since purified <italic>S.pombe</italic> Dna2 lacks any detectable ATPase (helicase) activity (H. Y. Kang and Y. S. Seo, unpublished results), fission yeast Dna2 may require a coupled DNA helicase to execute complete removal of the flap in the Okazaki fragment maturation step. Pfh1 may therefore unwind DNA secondary structures present in the flaps formed by displacement synthesis by DNA polymerase &#x003b4; (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c15">15</xref>). Further characterization of the biochemical properties of the Pfh1 helicase <italic>in vitro</italic> will doubtless prove highly informative.</p><p>A further issue to be addressed concerns the extent of Pfh1 function throughout the genome. In budding yeast, the Pfh1 homologs Pif1p and Rrm3p have been termed <italic>region-specific</italic> helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c22">22</xref>): Pif1p is believed to function in mtDNA, telomere DNA and rDNA whereas Rrm3p is involved in rDNA replication (where its function opposes that of Pif1p). This raises the possibility that, in <italic>S.pombe</italic>, the function of Pfh1 (and by implication, perhaps that of Cdc24 also) might be confined to certain regions of the genome only, such as the rDNA repeats on chromosome III. However, it is worth noting that, in contrast to <italic>pfh1</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup>, neither <italic>PIF1</italic> nor <italic>RRM3</italic> is an essential gene in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>. Indeed, budding yeast cells mutated for both genes are viable. Thus, there are clear differences between the two yeast systems.</p><p>In addition to its role in chromosomal DNA replication, Pfh1 also appears to have an essential role to play in the repair of DNA damage: <italic>pfh1</italic> mutant cells are highly sensitive to exposure to the DNA-alkylating agent MMS. Whether Pfh1 is required to cope with the effects of MMS-induced damage specifically in S-phase remains to be seen.</p><p>Finally, during the preparation of this manuscript, Zakian and co-workers reported the isolation and characterization of the <italic>pfh1</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> gene on the basis of the protein sequence similarity between Pfh1, Pif1p and Rrm3p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf590c50">50</xref>). For the most part, their results mirror ours. However, in an echo of the situation in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, these authors also observed telomere shortening in &#x00394;<italic>pfh1</italic><italic>S.pombe</italic> cells, consistent with a role for Pfh1 in telomere length regulation. Still, these authors also demonstrated that telomere length regulation was not the sole essential function of Pfh1 protein by showing that <italic>pfh1</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> was essential for cell viability even in a strain with circular chromosomes lacking telomeric sequences. Clearly, further work is required to unambiguously assign a function to Pfh1.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf590f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Suppression of the temperature sensitivity of the <italic>cdc24-M38</italic> by the <italic>pfh1-R20</italic> and <italic>pfh1-R23</italic> mutations.
