Enzyme activity, protein expression and mRNA of CYP3A2, a correlate of human CYP3A4, and CYP2C11, responsive to inflammatory mediators, were assessed 0.25, 1, 4, and 14 days after administration of several different recombinant adenoviruses at a dose of 5.7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>12 </sup>virus particles (vp)/kg to male Sprague Dawley rats. Wild type adenovirus, containing all viral genes, suppressed CYP3A2 and 2C11 activity by 37% and 39%, respectively within six hours. Levels fell to 67% (CYP3A2) and 79% (CYP2C11) of control by 14 days (<italic>p </italic>&#x02264; 0.01). Helper-dependent adenovirus, with all viral genes removed, suppressed CYP3A2 (43%) and CYP2C11 (55%) within six hours. CYP3A2 remained significantly suppressed (47%, 14 days, <italic>p </italic>&#x02264; 0.01) while CYP2C11 returned to baseline at this time. CYP3A2 and 2C11 were reduced by 45 and 42% respectively 6 hours after treatment with PEGylated adenovirus, which has a low immunological profile (<italic>p </italic>&#x02264; 0.05). CYP3A2 remained suppressed (34%, <italic>p </italic>&#x02264; 0.05) for 14 days while CYP2C11 recovered. Inactivated virus suppressed CYP3A2 activity by 25&#x02013;50% for 14 days (<italic>p </italic>&#x02264; 0.05). CYP2C11 was affected similar manner but recovered by day 14.

In turn, their diversity, expression and function may also be modified by these substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Numerous clinical reports have also described altered pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles of drugs during infection or inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In these instances, the activity and expression of CYP is downregulated, leading to ineffective treatment regimens, unexpected adverse reactions and in, some cases, drug-drug interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Similar effects have been reported with respect to the expression and function of CYP isforms 3A2 and 2C11 after a single dose of recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 for a period of 14 days in the male Sprague Dawley rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The expression and function of these isoforms, selected for their predominance in drug metabolism (CYP3A2) and their responsiveness to inflammatory stimuli (CYP2C11), are largely influenced by the dose (5.7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>&#x02013; 5.7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>12 </sup>viral particles/kilogram (vp/kg)) and the nature of the transgene cassette. Although much is known about the regulatory processes associated with CYP3A2 and 2C11 expression, the exact mechanism by which virus infection alters these metabolic enzymes is currently unknown.</p><p>Recombinant adenoviruses were chosen as model pathogens to further define processes by which viral infection alters expression of CYP3A2 and 2C11 for several reasons. Although wild type adenovirus infections are common in the general population and often cause self-limited respiratory infections, they also induce significant illness and high mortality in specialized patient populations such as those receiving allogenic stem cell and solid organ transplants and those with acute respiratory illnesses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Within the last decade, extensive use of adenovirus serotype 5 as a vector for gene therapy and vaccine development has increased understanding of the biology and the genetic features of the virus. This information has fostered the production of a series of recombinant viruses with minimal viral elements to reduce the host immune response and extend the length of gene expression achieved by this otherwise highly efficient vector. In this report, a panel of recombinant adenoviruses were studied in a Sprague Dawley rat model to test the hypothesis that changes in hepatic CYP expression and function after a single systemic dose of virus may not be solely due to the immune response against viral gene products and capsid proteins. Wild type adenovirus serotype 5, capable of causing mild illness in the general public and more severe complications in the immunosuppressed and those with asthma and COPD, was used as a positive control. It contained all virus expression elements. A first generation adenoviral vector, expressing the <italic>E. coli </italic>beta-galactosidase transgene (AdlacZ) was included as an important control for direct comparison of results previously reported to those obtained from animals treated with the other modified vectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The early region 1 (E1, involved in virus replication) and early region 3 (E3, involved in evasion of the host immune response) parts of the virus genome were removed in this vector to accommodate the beta-galactosidase transgene cassette. A PEGylated version of this virus, which has a significantly lower immunological profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and an inactive control, AdlacZ inactivated by exposure to riboflavin and UV light, were included to study the effect of the immune response against virus capsid proteins and virus receptor interactions on expression and function of CYP. A helper-dependent adenoviral vector (HDAd), devoid of all viral genes and containing the <italic>E. coli </italic>beta-galactosidase transgene, was also included to fully study the effect of viral gene expression on CYP. CYP protein expression, activity, and mRNA were evaluated at 0.25, 1, 4 and 14 days, a time course highlighting key points during adenoviral gene expression and the host immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Serum alanine amintotransferase levels and histological evaluation of liver tissue were used to evaluate the toxicity associated with administration of each vector. Expression patterns of the pregnane &#x000d7; receptor (PXR) and the retinoid &#x000d7; receptor alpha (RXR&#x0221d;), involved in transcriptional regulation of CYP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and those associated with several signal transduction pathways in the liver are also discussed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Effect of administration of recombinant adenoviruses on hepatic CYP3A2 expression and function</title><p>Hepatic CYP3A2 protein expression, catalytic activity, and mRNA levels were analyzed at 0.25, 1, 4, and 14 days after administration of either wild type virus or several different recombinant adenoviruses. Six hours after administration, each virus significantly suppressed CYP3A1/2 protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The most pronounced effect was observed in samples obtained from animals given wild type (WT) virus with protein levels 46% of those seen in saline treated animals (Vehicle, <italic>p </italic>&#x02264; 0.01).

Microbial infection can significantly compromise the expression and function of hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, responsible for catalyzing biochemical processes necessary to maintain physiological homeostasis and conversion of medicinal agents to pharmacologically or toxicologically active metabolites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. <italic>In vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>studies suggest that cytokines and other immunoresponsive molecules associated with the acute phase of the immune response are largely responsible for this effect. We have found that a single dose of recombinant adenovirus significantly suppresses CYP3A2 and 2C11 expression and function in the male Sprague-Dawley rat for 14 days, long after the innate immune response against the virus resolves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In an effort to prevent corresponding increases in drug-drug interactions, potential therapeutic failures of vital medications and secondary health problems due to interruption of natural biochemical processes during microbial infection, the experiments described in this manuscript were designed to determine how recombinant adenovirus alters CYP expression and function.</p><p>None of the modifications commonly made to reduce the immunogenicity and toxicity associated with adenoviral vectors completely resolved aberrations in hepatic CYP. Administration of helper-dependent adenovirus (HDAd), devoid of all viral genes and significantly less immunogenic than wild type or first generation adenoviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], suppressed CYP3A2 protein, activity, and gene expression for 14 days (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <italic>p </italic>&#x02264; 0.01). Samples obtained from animals given the PEGylated virus, which is also significantly less immunogenic than the other viruses tested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], followed a similar trend, suggesting that the immune response may not be the cause of suppression of this key hepatic isoform. At later timepoints, CYP mRNA levels were suppressed in animals given HDAd in a manner similar not only to the first generation virus, but to that of wild type virus, containing all viral genetic elements, suggesting that transcription and expression of viral genes cannot fully account for the observed reduction of CYP3A2. Administration of the helper-dependent and PEGylated viruses did, however, minimize changes in the expression and function of CYP2C11 with expression, activity, with mRNA beginning to recover four days after administration and resolving to baseline by day 14 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, <italic>p </italic>&#x02264; 0.05). This and data reported previously in which an E1/E3 deleted first generation adenovirus containing some viral gene expression elements but not a transgene cassette and another containing murine erythropoietin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], further support the hypothesis that changes in the expression and function of CYP2C11 correlates with the immunogenicity of the vector and the trasngene constructs while changes in CYP3A2 may be due to shifts in cellular processes to support transgene production.</p><p>Many of the vectors employed in these studies had a mild toxicity profile with respect to serum alanine amintotransferase (ALT) levels. Only samples obtained from animals treated with the AdlacZ and WT vectors contained significant amounts of ALT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). The PEGylated virus transduced hepatocytes in a similar manner to AdlacZ without affecting ALT, but still altered CYP expression and function (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Treatment with the HDAd vector also did not affect ALT, but changes in CYP were still observed. Taken together, these results suggest that CYP alterations are not merely the result of hepatotoxicity arising from transgene product accumulation or overwhelming viral gene expression.</p><p>In an effort to identify a potential mechanism by which Ad infection alters CYP expression and function, we first chose to examine changes in expression of the pregnane &#x000d7; receptor (PXR). Transcription of CYP3A2 is thought to occur by heterodimerization of two orphan nuclear receptors, PXR and the retinoid &#x000d7; receptor alpha (RXR&#x003b1;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. RXR&#x003b1; is a nuclear receptor that forms complexes with many other molecules to regulate gene transcription, whereas PXR has been often referred to as the "master" regulator of CYP3A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. PXR levels were significantly suppressed 24 hours after administration of all active recombinant viruses but recovered to baseline levels in all groups except those given wild type virus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, <italic>p </italic>&#x02264; 0.05). Given that CYP3A2 continued to be suppressed in all groups given active virus beyond 24 hours, we believe that changes in CYP3A2 expression and function may not be mediated by changes in PXR during adenovirus infection. This is further supported by another study in which it was reported that CYP was significantly suppressed in PXR knockout mice after treatment with bacterial endotoxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>Although no appreciable changes in PXR and RXR mRNA levels were detected after administration of any of the vectors studied, post-translational modifications of these proteins and CYP itself such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination and redistribution between the nucleus and cytoplasm in response to virus-induced cell signaling cascades could account for the observed reduction in CYP during adenovirus infection and would not be readily detectable by the techniques used to assess changes in CYP, RXR and PXR described in this manuscript [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The possibility that these modifications are occurring and, in turn, impacting CYP expression and function is highlighted by the fact that administration of the UVAd vector significantly suppressed enzyme activity as early as six hours, an effect that lasted for 14 days in the case of CYP3A2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This profound post-translational effect that a genetically inactive yet intact virus had on each CYP isoform may be the direct result of interaction of capsid proteins with virus receptors and subsequent internalization of virus particles at the cellular level. Binding of the fiber protein to the primary adenovirus receptor, the Coxsackievirus and Adenovirus receptor (CAR), facilitates interactions between penton base proteins and cell surface integrins promoting virus internalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Engagement of integrin receptors during this process initiates several signal transduction pathways such as extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK), phophatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinases A and C (PKA and PKC) which may contribute to the observed changes in CYP after administration of any of the vectors included in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Data from <italic>in vitro </italic>studies and microarray analysis of hepatic tissue provide further support that notion that engagement of integrin receptors, common points of entry for many pathogenic organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], is sufficient to initiate changes in CYP3A2. Treatment of primary hepatocytes with a peptide known to block integrin receptors and prevent adenoviral infection significantly reduced CYP3A2 activity with respect to untreated controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F10"><label>Figure 10</label><caption><p><bold>Engagement of Integrin Receptors with a Non-Infectious Peptide Suppresses CYP3A2 in Primary Rat Hepatocytes</bold>.

Expression of genes associated with the PI3K, PKC and nuclear factor kappa B (NFKB) pathways were induced with respect to those found in saline treated animals on average by a factor of 3.8, 4 and 4.6 respectively by each of the viruses included in this study. These pathways are of particular interest in the context of explaining our findings with respect to PXR and RXR expression. Ding and Staudinger described an increase in PXR activity in the presence of compounds that induced protein kinase A <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].

It has also been shown that activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), a kinase downstream of PKC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], induces phosphorylation of RXR&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], which causes it to redistribute from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, preventing it from forming the heterodimer complex with PXR and suppressing CYP expression and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Microarray data also suggests that changes in CYP after adenovirus infection may be in response to products associated with the NFKB pathway. The small heterodimer partner (SHP), an orphan nuclear receptor specifically expressed in the liver and a limited number of other tissues, is a transcriptional co-activator of NFKB and is also activated by JNK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].

Peak areas of corresponding hydroxylation metabolites were measured and compared to peak areas of the internal standard within the same run.</p></sec><sec><title>RT-PCR</title><p>Hepatic RNA was isolated with TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were stored at -80&#x000b0;C prior to analysis. Hepatic RNA (1 &#x003bc;g) was generated using a reverse transcription kit, RETROscript, (Ambion, Austin, TX) following the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was performed using ReadyMix PCR Reaction Mix (Sigma-Aldrich). Each reaction (final reaction volume 12.5 &#x003bc;l) contained 0.5 &#x003bc;l of reverse-transcription product, 0.1 mM of each primer and 1 &#x003bc;l of QuantumRNA&#x02122; 18S internal standard (Ambion, Austin, TX) at a primer:competimer ratio of 4:6 for CYP 3A2 and 2C11 and 3:7 for PXR and RXR reactions. Gene-specific reaction conditions and primer sequences are summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.
