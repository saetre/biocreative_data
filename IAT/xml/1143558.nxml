In addition, inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and c-Src significantly blocked cell motility and invasion of AC2M2 cells expressing wild-type ezrin.

One important molecule is the membrane cytoskeletal crosslinker protein ezrin, a member of the ezrin&#x02013;radixin&#x02013;moesin family, which is well documented to regulate several cytoskeletal-related functions, including cell adhesion, cell survival and cell motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. There is also increasing evidence that ezrin regulates tumour progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Comparison of gene expression profiles in paired metastatic and nonmetastatic tumour cell lines and tissue samples revealed a strong increase in ezrin expression in metastases from rodent mammary and human pancreatic and colorectal carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Likewise, ezrin exhibited strong expression in a variety of invasive human cancers, including osteosarcomas, melanomas, astrocytic tumours, and pancreatic, lung and endometrial carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Further studies have indicated that suppression of ezrin protein function abrogates pulmonary metastases of murine rhabdomyosarcoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and osteosarcoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], suggesting that ezrin may be a key regulatory molecule in malignant disease. However, the role played by ezrin in breast cancer metastasis has not been delineated.</p><p>Ezrin is regulated by an intramolecular association of its amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal domains that masks their protein&#x02013;protein binding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Unfolding of the molecule into an active conformation occurs following binding to phosphoinositides and phosphorylation on the carboxyl-terminal threonine 567 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The open molecule binds various membrane-associated adhesion molecules and ion exchangers to the amino-terminal region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], and polymerized F-actin via the carboxyl-terminal domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Ezrin is involved in signal transduction pathways that depend on tyrosine kinases. Stimulation of cells with epidermal growth factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] or hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] results in phosphorylation of ezrin primarily at two tyrosine residues (Tyr145 and Tyr353), which are important in regulating ezrin function. Phosphorylation of ezrin at these two tyrosine residues is required for tubulogenesis and motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and Tyr353 regulates a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt-dependent cell survival pathway through association with the p85 subunit of PI3K [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Our laboratory developed a mouse mammary carcinoma cell line, SP1, for studies of tumour progression and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The parent SP1 cells form cadherin-based cell&#x02013;cell contacts, exhibit oestrogen-dependent primary tumour growth following transplantation <italic>in vivo</italic>, and are poorly metastatic. Recently, we showed that ezrin acts cooperatively with activated c-Src in deregulating cadherin-based cell&#x02013;cell contacts and scattering of SP1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. We further showed that blocking ezrin function by overexpressing a truncated domain (amino-terminal amino acids 1&#x02013;309) of ezrin, which has dominant-negative function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], abrogates cell scattering and enhances cadherin-based cell&#x02013;cell contacts in SP1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. These findings prompted us to examine the role played by ezrin in cell invasion and metastasis of breast carcinoma cells. For this study, we used a highly metastatic variant cell line, namely AC2M2, selected from rare metastatic nodules of SP1 cells <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. AC2M2 cells exhibit strong cytoplasmic localization of cadherins and extensive filopodia with weak cell&#x02013;cell contacts. Our findings show that overexpression of the dominant negative amino-terminal ezrin mutant in AC2M2 cells abrogates <italic>in vivo </italic>metastasis and inhibits cell motility and invasion <italic>in vitro</italic>. Furthermore, cells overexpressing the amino-terminal ezrin mutant showed marked reduction in PI3K/Akt, Erk1/2 and c-Src activities, indicating a possible role for these signalling molecules as downstream effectors of ezrin in the metastatic process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies and reagents</title><p>Rabbit anti-sheep IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA, USA).

AC2M2 cells are a highly metastatic variant selected from the SP1 cell line following three times serial passage of a lung metastatic nodule into the mammary fat pad of syngeneic mice, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Invitrogen, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) supplemented with 7% foetal bovine serum.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell transfection</title><p>The pCB6 vector containing cDNA encoding VSVG-tagged ezrin or the VSVG-tagged amino-terminal truncated domain (amino acids 1&#x02013;309) of ezrin was previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. All transfections were carried out with Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Canadian Life Technology, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Stable transfectants were selected with G418 (450 &#x003bc;g/ml; Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, Ontario, Canada) and individual clones were isolated. Exogenous protein expression in each clone was confirmed using indirect immunofluorescence (data not shown) and semiquantitative western blot analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Indirect immunofluorescence</title><p>Indirect immunofluorescence staining was conducted as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Briefly, cells were plated overnight on cover slips, fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 and blocked for 30 min with 3% bovine serum albumin. Cells were incubated with anti-cadherin antibody, followed by the appropriate secondary antibody. Preparations were observed using a Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada) in the Queen's Cancer Research Institute and Protein Discovery and Function Facility. Image acquisitions were processed using Adobe Photoshop software.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blotting</title><p>Cells were grown to 60% confluence in six-well tissue culture plates (NUNC, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), rinsed with ice-cold PBS with 0.1 &#x003bc;mol/l CaCl<sub>2 </sub>and 0.1 &#x003bc;mol/l MgCl<sub>2 </sub>(PBS*), and lysed in 2&#x000d7; Laemmli buffer. For blotting with phospho-specific antibodies, cells were serum-starved overnight and plated on fibronectin-coated (10 mg/ml) plates for the times indicated. For analysis of c-Src, the cytoskeletal fraction was first extracted by a 1-min incubation with 250 &#x003bc;l of a Triton X-100 buffer (soluble fraction) that preserves cytosketal-associated material (csk buffer: 50 mmol/l MES, 3 mmol/l EGTA, 5 mmol/l MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5% Triton X-100; pH 6.4). The remaining cellular material (insoluble fraction) was rinsed quickly with 500 &#x003bc;l csk buffer, and was further extracted with 250 &#x003bc;l 2&#x000d7; Laemmli buffer. Protein determination of cell lysates was performed using a DC protein assay kit (Biorad, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). All cell lysates were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (with 2.5% &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-mercaptoethanol) and transferred to PVP (polyvinylpyrrolidone) membranes. The membranes were blocked and probed with the appropriate primary and secondary antibodies, followed by chemiluminescence with the Northern Lightning&#x02122; reagent (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences Inc., Boston, MA, USA). Semiquantitation of exogenous versus endogenous ezrin expression was determined by western blotting of serial dilutions of total cell lysates (0.6&#x02013;20 &#x003bc;g), as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The fold increase in exogenous ezrin expression was determined by comparing the titration end-point of the corresponding ezrin band in each clone with that of cells transfected with empty pCB6 vector. For amino-terminal ezrin expressing clones, the ratio of VSVG&#x02013;amino terminal ezrin to endogenous ezrin normalized to actin was calculated using densitometric analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Tumour transplantation and metastasis</title><p>SP1 and AC2M2 cell lines were injected (7.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3 </sup>cells in 10 &#x003bc;l/mouse) into the mammary fat pad of syngeneic mice, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Primary tumour growth was monitored every 2&#x02013;3 days, and metastasis in lung, viscera, liver and draining lymph nodes was assessed 6 weeks later. Histological analysis of tissue sections stained with haematoxylin and eosin was performed to confirm the presence of metastases in the various organs. Based on the gross and histological analyses, animals were assessed as positive or negative with respect to metastasis. At least eight mice were included in each group.</p></sec><sec><title>Wound healing assay</title><p>Cells were plated onto 12-well tissue culture dishes (NUNC) at near confluence in complete tissue culture medium. Confluent cells were scored using a 20 &#x003bc;l Eppendorf micropipette tip. The medium was immediately replaced, and spontaneous cell migration was monitored using a Nikon inverted microscope for 18&#x02013;24 hours, as indicated. For experiments comparing transfected clones, analysis at 18 hours is shown because maximal differences between groups were observed at this time. For experiments with pharmacological inhibitors, the assay was allowed to proceed for 24 hours to optimize the effect of the inhibitors. Viability of cells was maintained during this assay period. Phase contrast images were captured, and the distance of wound closure (compared with control at t = 0 hours) was measured in three independent wound sites per group. Relative cell motility was calculated as the wound width at t = 0 hours minus the wound width at t = 18&#x02013;24 hours, as indicated. Values from at least three independent experiments were pooled and expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD).</p></sec><sec><title>Invasion assay</title><p>Transfected AC2M2 cells were plated in 24-well transwell cultures (NUNC). Cells (5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup>) were overlayered in 200 &#x003bc;l of 0.5% foetal bovine serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium on Matrigel-coated transwell membranes (8 &#x003bc;m pore size), and with 0.5 ml of complete medium in the lower chamber. After 36&#x02013;48 hours (as indicated) the cells were fixed and stained with Harris's modified haematoxylin (Fisher Scientific, Nepean, Ontario, Canada), and noninvading cells on the top of the membrane were removed using a Q-tip. The membranes were then mounted on glass slides, and images corresponding to the entire membrane surface were captured using an Olympus inverted microscope equipped with a CCD camera (Apogee Instruments Inc., Auburn, CA, USA). The total numbers of cells invading through the membrane were quantitated using ImagePro software (Symbol Technologies, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Values were normalized to empty pCB6 vector group in each experiment, and the results from at least three independent experiments were pooled and expressed as mean relative cell invasion &#x000b1; SD.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical significance among metastasis groups was determined using the two-sided Fisher's exact test. The day at which tumours reached 1 cm diameter was determined by linear regression analysis of growth curves from individual mice, and expressed as mean &#x000b1; SD. Statistical significance between groups in the motility and invasion assays was assessed using a Fisher's two-tailed t-test with Microsoft Excel software.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Overexpression of amino-terminal ezrin inhibits metastasis of AC2M2 breast carcinoma cells</title><p>We previously showed that overexpression of a truncated amino-terminal domain of ezrin blocks HGF-induced migration and morphogenesis of epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and reduces cell scattering in SP1 carcinoma cells expressing activated c-Src [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. We therefore examined the effect of amino-terminal ezrin on invasion and dissemination of a highly metastatic mammary carcinoma variant cell line, namely AC2M2, which is derived from SP1 cells. We generated stable transfectants of AC2M2 cells expressing VSVG-tagged wild-type and amino-terminal ezrin in a pCB6 eukaryotic expression vector, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Ezrin protein levels in clones transfected with pCB6 vector containing wild-type ezrin were found to be increased approximately 4-fold and 8-fold, respectively, in WTC4 and WTC6 cells compared with cells transfected with empty vector, as determined by semiquantitative western blotting (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). Expression of amino-terminal ezrin was increased 1.6-fold and 4.5 fold, respectively, in NTC6 and NTC7 cells compared with endogenous ezrin and normalized to actin, as determined by densitometric analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). AC2M2 cells transfected with empty pCB6 vector, or overexpressing wild-type ezrin exhibited strong cytoplasmic expression of cadherins and filopodia extensions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c&#x02013;e</xref>). In contrast, overexpression of amino-terminal ezrin expression caused strong membrane localization of cadherins with increased cell&#x02013;cell contacts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1f,g</xref>).</p><p>To assess the role of ezrin function in metastasis, clones of AC2M2 cells overexpressing wild-type ezrin or amino-terminal ezrin were injected into the mammary fat pad of syngeneic female mice, and metastases were assessed 6 weeks after injection (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). No change in primary tumour growth rate was observed, as assessed by percentage primary tumour take and day of 1 cm tumour diameter, except for one amino-terminal expressing clone (NTC6), which showed reduced tumour growth rate. To compensate, mice in this group were killed approximately 1 week later to allow all tumours to grow to an equivalent size. Untransfected AC2M2 cells exhibited extensive pulmonary metastases (10/11), as compared with the poorly metastatic parent SP1 cells (3/13; <italic>P </italic>= 0.003). Pooled AC2M2 cells transfected with empty pCB6 vector (7/8) or two clones overexpressing wild-type ezrin (13/15 and 6/7) were also strongly metastatic. In contrast, expression of amino-terminal ezrin caused a marked reduction in metastases in two independent clones (0/8 and 3/8; <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.0001 and <italic>P </italic>= 0.002, respectively). Similar results were obtained with an additional amino-terminal ezrin overexpressing clone (NTB8) from an independent transfection (0/5; <italic>P </italic>= 0.002). Analysis of pooled results showed that metastases in the three amino-terminal ezrin groups (3/21) were strongly reduced compared with the two wild-type ezrin groups (19/22; <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.0001).</p><p>Histological analysis of various organ sites in animals with tumours transfected with empty pCB6 vector or wild-type ezrin (WTC4, WTC6) revealed massive tumour nodules in the lung (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a,b</xref>), as well as occasional metastases in the small intestine (data not shown). In contrast, the majority of mice injected with tumour cells overexpressing amino-terminal ezrin (NTC6, NTC7, NTB8) showed no metastatic lesions; the few metastases that did form (in the NTC7 group) were generally smaller and primarily localized to vascular channels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c,d</xref>). These findings suggest that ezrin function is necessary for metastasis in this breast cancer model.</p></sec><sec><title>Overexpression of amino-terminal ezrin inhibits cell motility and invasion of AC2M2 cells</title><p>Metastasis is a multistep process involving intravasation, transport through the vasculature or lymphatics, and extravasation into target organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Previous studies indicated a role for ezrin in HGF-induced cell scattering and migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. We therefore examined the role played by ezrin in cell motility and invasion of metastatic AC2M2 cells. Wound healing assays were conducted using AC2M2 cells transfected with empty pCB6 vector or a vector encoding wild-type ezrin or amino-terminal ezrin. A wound was scored on a cell monolayer, and the wound closure was assessed at various times up to 24 hours. Our results show that expression of amino-terminal ezrin reduced the ability of AC2M2 cells to close the wound by approximately 2.5-fold compared with cells transfected with empty pCB6 vector or with wild-type ezrin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). Invasion assays were carried out using Matrigel-coated transwell culture chambers, and invading cells were counted after 36&#x02013;48 hours using image analysis. AC2M2 cells expressing wild-type ezrin showed increased cell invasion compared with cells transfected with empty pCB6 vector, whereas amino-terminal ezrin expressing clones exhibited markedly reduced cell invasion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>PI3K and c-Src are required for ezrin-mediated cell motility and invasion of AC2M2 cells</title><p>PI3K, c-Src and MAPK pathways have been implicated in cell motility and invasion in many cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. As a first step in unravelling the signalling pathways involved in cell motility and invasion of AC2M2 cells overexpressing wild-type ezrin, we determined the effect of specific signal transduction inhibitors on these functions. The results showed that the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 markedly attenuated cell motility (3-fold) of two clones overexpressing wild-type ezrin as well as cells transfected with empty pCB6 vector (data not shown; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a,b</xref>). The c-Src inhibitor SU6656 had a moderate (1.5-fold) blocking effect on cell motility. In contrast, the MEK inhibitor PD098059 had no detectable effect. In addition, cell invasion was dramatically inhibited by both PI3K and c-Src inhibitors, but not by the MEK inhibitor (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>). All three inhibitors at the concentrations indicated were previously shown to block activity of the respective kinases, as determined by western blotting with the corresponding phospho-specific antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] (data not shown). Thus, PI3K and c-Src pathways, but not the MAPK pathway, are required for both cell motility and invasion of wild-type ezrin-expressing AC2M2 cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Overexpression of amino-terminal ezrin abrogates signalling through PI3K/Akt, c-Src, and MAPK pathways in AC2M2 cells</title><p>The results shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a&#x02013;c</xref> raise the possibility that PI3K and c-Src are downstream of ezrin in the regulation of cell motility and invasion in AC2M2 cells. To investigate this notion, we examined the effect of amino-terminal ezrin on phosphorylation of Akt S473 (a downstream effector of PI3K [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]), c-Src Y418 (within the c-Src catalytic domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]) and Erk1/2 T185/Y187 (within the activation loop of Erk1/2; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d</xref>). Serum-starved AC2M2 cells were plated on fibronectin for the times indicated, lysed, and subjected to western blotting with the appropriate phospho-specific antibodies. Interestingly, expression of Akt pS473 was increased in metastatic AC2M2 cells (empty vector) compared with the poorly metastatic parental SP1 cells. Overexpression of amino-terminal ezrin, compared with wild-type ezrin, markedly reduced the level of Akt pS473 in AC2M2 cells, indicating regulation by ezrin of the PI3K/Akt pathway in these cells. In parallel, the level of phospho-Erk1/2 (pT185/pY187) was sustained in AC2M2 cells transfected with empty pCB6 vector or wild-type ezrin, and was reduced in cells expressing amino-terminal ezrin. Because activated c-Src associates with its substrate at the focal adhesion complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], we examined c-Src pY418 in both the Triton X-100 soluble and insoluble (cytoskeletal-associated) fractions in AC2M2 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4e</xref>). Our results show that the levels of cytoskeletal-associated total c-Src and c-Src pY418 were increased in cells overexpressing wild-type ezrin, but were markedly reduced in cells expressing amino-terminal ezrin. In contrast, the level of c-Src pY418 in the soluble fraction (and in total cell lysates; data not shown) remained unchanged in all cell groups. Thus, ezrin plays a key role in stabilizing the activities of PI3K and c-Src, as well as Erk1/2.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study we demonstrate for the first time that ezrin function is required for metastasis of breast carcinoma cells. Our results show that inactivating ezrin function by overexpressing a dominant-negative (amino-terminal) ezrin mutant blocks spontaneous pulmonary metastases of mammary carcinoma cells transplanted into the orthotopic site. We further show that overexpression of wild-type ezrin increases carcinoma cell invasion, whereas amino-terminal ezrin causes reduced cell scattering, motility and invasion, thus indicating a possible mechanism by which ezrin regulates progression to invasive cancer. Similar reports have shown that overexpressing ezrin antisense [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] or an ezrin T567A dominant-negative mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] blocks both experimental and spontaneous metastasis of murine rhabdomyosarcoma and osteosarcoma cells, and in the latter report the rate-limiting effect was demonstrated to be on early survival of metastastic cells. Thus, ezrin may have multiple effects on the metastatic cascade.</p><p>Moreover, we found that overexpression of wild-type ezrin does not augment metastasis of parental SP1 cells. Furthermore, no increase in expression of endogenous ezrin was observed in the metastatic (AC2M2) compared with the parent SP1 cell lines (data not shown). These findings imply that overexpression of ezrin alone is not sufficient to induce metastasis in this tumour model, suggesting that multiple pathways are involved in the metastatic cascade. However, it is difficult to relate quantitative changes in exogenous ezrin overexpression directly with dominant active or negative functional effects, because the signalling networks involved are complex and the functional assays are long term (18&#x02013;36 hours for cell motility and invasion, and 5 weeks for metastasis). Our focus was therefore on the qualitative effects on breast cancer metastasis of blocking ezrin function using a dominant-negative amino-terminal ezrin mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Our finding that Akt S473 phosphorylation is enhanced in AC2M2 cells compared with parental SP1 cells suggests a key role for the PI3K/Akt pathway in metastasis. Expression of amino-terminal ezrin reduced the levels of Akt S473 phosphorylation to that of SP1 cells, indicating a dominant regulatory effect of ezrin on PI3K/Akt signalling in AC2M2 cells. Furthermore, inhibition of PI3K blocked both cell motility and invasion in AC2M2 cells overexpressing wild-type ezrin, indicating that PI3K is a downstream effector of ezrin in these functions. In addition to its role in cell motility via PI3K, ezrin may also participate in metastasis by increasing cell survival. Indeed, we previously showed that ezrin signals cell survival by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, although Erk1/2 activation is also reduced in amino-terminal ezrin-expressing cells, inhibition of the MAPK pathway has no detectable effect on cell motility or invasion in this tumour model. However, previous reports have indicated that an activated MEK mutant can rescue early survival of metatastic osteosarcoma cells expressing ezrin antisense [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. It is therefore possible that an ezrin-dependent MAPK pathway still plays a role in our breast metastasis model, as demonstrated by Khanna and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>We also observed a strong increase in cytoskeletal-associated c-Src pY418 in cells overexpressing wild-type ezrin, and this effect was abrogated in cells expressing amino-terminal ezrin. Furthermore, inhibition of c-Src activity partially blocks cell motility and completely abrogates invasion of ezrin-expressing AC2M2 cells. These findings are consistent with our previous demonstration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] of a reciprocal relationship between c-Src and ezrin in phosphorylation/activation of these two proteins, and their role in regulating cell spreading and cell migration. The interactive role played by ezrin with c-Src in cell adhesion-dependent functions may provide an important mechanism by which integrin signals are amplified through the cytoskeleton. Previous findings from our laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] have shown that inhibition of specific integrin function can block metastasis of breast carcinomas. The findings presented here raise the possibility that ezrin and c-Src are key regulators of integrin-dependent steps in cell invasion and metastasis.</p><p>Because both PI3K and c-Src are key effectors downstream of ezrin in the cell motility and invasive phenotypes, these signalling pathways are likely to be rate limiting in the regulation by ezrin of metastatic progression <italic>in vivo</italic>. In addition, cooperativity between PI3K and c-Src may be important in regulating ezrin function in cell motility and invasion, for example through activation of Rho GTPases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In addition, interaction of ezrin with other signalling molecules such as the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+ </sup>exchanger regulatory factor (NHERF-1), recently described to be altered in breast cancer, may also be involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Further investigation is required to assess the relevance of these downstream pathways in breast metastasis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the present study we show for the first time that ezrin is required for invasion and metastasis of mammary carcinoma cells. We further show that PI3K and c-Src activities are modulated by ezrin and are required for ezrin-dependent cell invasion. Because we recently showed that c-Src is also upstream of ezrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], and acts cooperatively with ezrin in deregulating cell&#x02013;cell contacts and cell scattering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], we propose that coordinate upregulation of ezrin and c-Src activity may be a key regulatory step in metastatic breast disease. Together, our findings suggest that ezrin activation may represent an effective prognostic marker and a potential target for treatment of invasion and metastasis of human breast cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>HGF = hepatocyte growth factor; MAPK = mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK = mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; PBS = phosphate-buffered saline; PI3K = phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; SD = standard deviation; VSVG = vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>BEE carried out the tumour transplantation and metastasis studies and the cell motility, and wrote the manuscript.
