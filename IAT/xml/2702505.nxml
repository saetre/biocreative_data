In vertebrates, there are two talin genes. <italic>Talin 1</italic> is essential for integrin-mediated cell adhesion; the role of <italic>talin 2</italic> is unclear. Here we report a detailed analysis of mammalian <italic>talin 2</italic>. This reveals the existence of a previously unrecognized promoter associated with a CpG island, and separated from the first coding exon by numerous alternatively spliced noncoding exons spanning &#x0003e; 200 kb. Analysis of a mouse gene trap line shows that this promoter accounts for most of the talin 2 expression in adult tissues. We also demonstrate that testis and kidney express truncated talin 2 isoforms that lack the N-terminal half of the protein, and provide evidence for the developmentally regulated expression of the short testis-specific talin 2 isoform in elongating spermatids. Finally, we identify four tissue-specific alternative splicing events within the coding region of <italic>talin 2</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>integrins</kwd><kwd>spermatogenesis</kwd><kwd>talin 2</kwd><kwd>talin 2 isoforms</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Talin is a large (&#x0223c; 270 kDa, &#x0223c; 2540 amino acids) dimeric cytoskeletal protein that couples the integrin family of &#x003b1;&#x003b2; heterodimeric cell adhesion molecules to the actin cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>]. It also plays a key role in regulating the affinity of integrins for their ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>]. Talin contains an N-terminal FERM domain (residues 1&#x02013;400) that contains binding sites for &#x003b2;-integrin cytoplasmic domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>], F-actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>], the adaptor protein Wech [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>] and also PIP-kinase type 1&#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>], which is part of the signalling pathway that regulates assembly of integrin-mediated cellular junctions with the extracellular matrix (ECM). The FERM domain is linked to a large flexible rod that contains a second integrin-binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>], at least two actin-binding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>], and multiple binding sites for the cytoskeletal protein vinculin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>], which is involved in stabilizing cell&#x02013;ECM junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>].</p><p>There are two talin genes in vertebrates, which have conserved intron&#x02013;exon boundaries and encode very similar proteins (74% amino acid sequence identity) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>]. However, <italic>talin 1</italic> has relatively small introns resulting in a gene of &#x0223c; 30 kb, whereas <italic>talin 2</italic> is much bigger (coding sequence &#x0223c; 190 kb), owing to the presence of larger introns. <italic>Talin 2</italic> is predicted to be the ancestral gene, and it appears to have undergone duplication in chordates prior to the emergence of vertebrates to produce <italic>talin 1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>]. Talin gene duplication also occurred in the Amboebozoa, and <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> has two talin genes, <italic>TalA</italic> and <italic>TalB</italic>, which encode proteins with distinct functions: TalA is required for cell&#x02013;substrate adhesion, phagocytosis and cytokinesis, whereas TalB is required for the force transmission required to support morphogenetic movements during differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>].</p><p>Studies in mammalian systems have largely focused on talin 1, which is ubiquitously expressed, and is implicated in a wide variety of integrin-mediated events. At the cellular level, disruption of both <italic>talin 1</italic> alleles (<italic>Tln1</italic>) in mouse ES cells confirms previous findings that talin 1 is required for the assembly of integrin-containing cell&#x02013;ECM junctions (focal adhesions) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>]. However, in lymphoid cells, integrins also mediate cell&#x02013;cell interactions, and talin 1 is required for T-cell receptor-mediated clustering and polarization of integrin &#x003b1;L&#x003b2;2 (lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1) and the regulation of its affinity for intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and for the assembly of the immunological synapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>]. Talin 1 also regulates the affinity of lymphocyte integrin &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;1 (very late antigen-4) for vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 on endothelial cells, which is important for lymphocyte trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>], and in macrophages, talin 1 is required for phagocytosis mediated by &#x003b1;M&#x003b2;2 integrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>]. In mice, disruption of both <italic>Tln1</italic> alleles results in embryonic lethality at 8.5&#x02013;9.5 days <italic>post coitum</italic>, owing to gastrulation defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>], and more recent studies, using a conditional <italic>Tln1</italic> allele, have demonstrated that talin 1 is required for the activation of platelet integrins <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>], for the integrity of the myotendinous junction in skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>], and for the association of the plasma membrane with the cytoskeleton in megakaryocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>].</p><p>The role of talin 2 is much less clear. Northern blotting initially suggested that in the mouse, <italic>Tln2</italic> expression was more restricted than <italic>Tln1</italic> expression, and <italic>Tln2</italic> mRNAs were most abundant in heart, brain and skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>]. However, more recent western blotting data and expression studies with a mouse gene trap line suggest that <italic>Tln2</italic> may be more widely expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>]. The interpretation of published immunocytochemical studies on the expression and cellular localization of talin in tissues is complicated by the fact that many of the commonly used talin antibodies cross-react with both proteins, although studies with isoform-specific antibodies have recently been published. Talin 2, but not talin 1, was localized to the costameres and intercalated discs in cardiomyocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>], whereas talin 1 and talin 2 were both localized in the myotendinous junction, which may explain why mice with a muscle-specific inactivation of <italic>Tln1</italic> have an only mildly dystrophic phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>]. Talin 2 is reportedly the most abundant isoform in brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>], and is found in the synapse, where a talin 2&#x02013;PIP-kinase type 1&#x003b3; complex is thought to play a role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>]. Surprisingly, mice homozygous for a <italic>Tln2</italic>&#x003b2;-Geo gene trap inserted in intron 28 are viable and fertile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>], suggesting either that talin 2 is not essential or that the talin 2&#x02013;&#x003b2;-galactosidase fusion protein contains the key functional elements of the talin 2 protein. Northern blot data also suggest that the gene trap insertion only ablates <italic>Tln2</italic> mRNA in a subset of tissues, such as heart and testis, as some residual expression is detected in other tissues, e.g. brain and kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>]. Thus, splicing out of the gene trap may well lead to expression of low levels of wild-type talin 2. A completely null allele will be required to address these issues.</p><p>Most mouse tissues express several large <italic>Tln2</italic> transcripts, ranging in size from 7 to 10 kb, and smaller <italic>Tln2</italic> transcripts have been detected in testis (4.8 kb) and kidney (3.9 kb), although these are too short to encode the full-length protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>]. In order to fully characterize the structure of <italic>talin 2</italic>, to understand the origins and functions of its multiple transcripts, and to inform the design of future knockout and knockdown experiments, we report here a detailed analysis of <italic>Tln2</italic> based on <italic>in silico</italic>, RT-PCR and functional genomic approaches.</p><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Mouse <italic>Tln2</italic> spans 414 kb and contains multiple 5&#x02032; noncoding exons</title><p>Initial studies on human and mouse <italic>talin 1</italic> and <italic>talin 2</italic> showed that, although they share the same genomic structure, <italic>talin 2</italic> is a much larger gene, owing to the larger size of the <italic>talin 2</italic> introns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>]. Analysis of mouse expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and cDNAs covering the 5&#x02032;-end of mouse <italic>Tln2</italic> now reveals an additional eight 5&#x02032;-exons spanning 236 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Table S2</xref>). These exons do not encode any ORF in-frame with the rest of the <italic>Tln2</italic> coding sequence, and to reflect the absence of coding potential, we numbered them exon &#x02212;7 (most 5&#x02032;) to exon 0 with respect to the first known coding exon (exon 1). The two most 5&#x02032; exons are embedded in a 1.45 kb CpG island (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref>). To confirm the presence of transcripts containing both the first coding exon (exon 1) and the most 5&#x02032; exon (exon &#x02212;7), we used RT-PCR on mRNAs isolated from 13 tissues. Sequencing of the 248 bp amplicon detected in all tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>) revealed that it contains exon &#x02212;7, exon &#x02212;5, exon &#x02212;2 and exon 1; this is identical to the combination found in EST BQ964581.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref>). Other alternatively spliced transcripts were expressed at lower levels in some tissues, e.g. brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figs 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1</xref>). These results: (a) show that previously uncharacterized alternatively spliced 5&#x02032;-exons are present in <italic>Tln2</italic> transcripts; (b) suggest that they originate from a new ubiquitous promoter lying within a CpG island; and (c) demonstrate that <italic>Tln2</italic> is much larger (&#x0223c; 414 kb) than previously thought.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The 5&#x02032;-end of mouse <italic>Tln2</italic> is associated with a CpG island and contains a large number of 5&#x02032;-UTR exons scattered over 200 kb. (A) Schematic diagram of the 5&#x02032;-region of mouse <italic>Tln2</italic> and corresponding ESTs. <italic>Tln2</italic> is transcribed from the minus strand; consequently, the mouse chromosome 9 telomere is on the left (Tel.) and the centromere is on the right (Cen.). Boxes represent previously known exons; dashed boxes denote new putative exons and are linked to the rest of <italic>Tln2</italic> by a dashed line. The first codon (ATG) is in exon 1, which contains both noncoding and coding sequences. Noncoding exons (grey) are numbered from 0 to &#x02212;7. The CpG island associated with exon &#x02212;7 is represented by a grey rectangle. The identity and position of the gene trap insertion downstream of exon &#x02212;3 are indicated. Below the genomic structure, ESTs are shown that contain different combinations of <italic>Tln2</italic> exons. The distance between the exons is indicated in bp, and the oblique lines represent splicing events. (B) RT-PCR between exon &#x02212;7 and exon 1 (primers <italic>a</italic> + <italic>b</italic>) revealed widespread expression of <italic>Tln2</italic> from the CpG island region in adult mouse tissues. Gen., genomic DNA; H<sub>2</sub>O, negative water control; RT+, reversed-transcribed RNA; RT&#x02212;, non-reversed transcribed control. <italic>Gapdh</italic> primers were used to assess the amount of cDNA used in PCR reactions.

(C) 5&#x02032;-RACE anchored in exon &#x02212;7 confirmed the 5&#x02032;-end of <italic>Tln2</italic>. The sequence of exon &#x02212;7 and flanking 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; (lower-case) sequences are shown. The position of the RACE primers in exon &#x02212;7 is indicated by half-arrows. The RACE products obtained were cloned and sequenced. The position of the transcriptional start sites is indicated by squares and circles in brain and kidney respectively. The number of clones obtained at each position is also shown. (D) The gene trap insertion downstream of exon &#x02212;3 dramatically reduces levels of talin 2 in mouse adult tissues. Proteins from wild-type (wt) and homozygous gene trap (gt/gt) mice were analysed by western blotting. Equal amount of total proteins were loaded, and talin 2 was detected with a monoclonal antibody against talin 2 (epitope within residues 482&#x02013;991). Vinculin was used as an additional loading control and as a normalization reporter to quantify the reduction in Tln2 expression by luminometry (% of residual talin 2). The reduction in talin 2 levels was &#x0223c; 80% in brain, 63% in heart, 93% in kidney, and 97% in spleen.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ejb0276-1610-f1"/></fig><p>In order to establish that <italic>Tln2</italic> does not extend further in the 5&#x02032; direction, we generated RACE cDNA libraries using total RNA from mouse brain and heart. Two rounds of amplification with nested primers in exon &#x02212;7 revealed the presence of a diffuse 150 bp fragment compatible with a transcription start site in or near the CpG island (data not shown). Cloning and sequencing of the PCR products confirmed that the 5&#x02032;-end of the <italic>Tln2</italic> transcripts lies within the CpG island, although the transcription start site varied slightly within the same tissue and also between tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1C</xref>). This may reflect the absence of a TATA-box, and suggests that the <italic>Tln2</italic> promoter associated with the CpG island is a housekeeping promoter that relies on the positioning of various combinations of transcription factors (TFs) for transcription initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>]. Analysis of the 5&#x02032;-end of human <italic>TLN2</italic> confirms that, as in mouse, transcription is driven from a CpG island situated &#x0223c; 200 kb away from the first coding exon, and that the 5&#x02032;-UTR exons, some of which are conserved between mouse and human, show complex patterns of alternative splicing in different cell types (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Conservation of 5&#x02032;-UTR <italic>talin 2</italic> exons in humans. &#x02212;, minus strand; +, plus strand; ND, not detected; NA, not applicable.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mouse</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Location on chromosome 9</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Distance to first coding exon (bp)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Conservation on human chromosome 15</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Distance to first coding exon in humans (bp)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CpG island</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">67 480 506&#x02013;67 481 954</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">236 635</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60 469 795&#x02013;60 471 688</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">255 081</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Exon &#x02212;7</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">67 481 698&#x02013;67 481 838 (&#x02212;)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">236 519</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60 470 017&#x02013;60 470 174 (+)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">256 595</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Exon &#x02212;6</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">67 480 721&#x02013;67 481 441 (&#x02212;)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">236 122</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60 470 426&#x02013;60 471 217 (+)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">255 552</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Exon &#x02212;5</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">67 407 421&#x02013;67 407 510 (&#x02212;)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">162 191</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60 555 817&#x02013;60 555 905 (+)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">170 864</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Exon &#x02212;4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">67 387 385&#x02013;67 387 419 (&#x02212;)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">142 100</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ND</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NA</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Exon &#x02212;3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">67 387 139&#x02013;67 387 210 (&#x02212;)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">141 891</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ND</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NA</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Exon &#x02212;2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">67 307 723&#x02013;67 307 796 (&#x02212;)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">62 477</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60 669 179&#x02013;60 669 251 (+)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">57 518</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Exon &#x02212;1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">67 276 569&#x02013;67 276 610 (&#x02212;)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31 291</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ND</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NA</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Exon 0</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">67 252 059&#x02013;67 252 157 (&#x02212;)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6838</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60 716 850&#x02013;60 716 923 (+)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9846</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Exon 1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">67 245 319&#x02013;67 245 490 (&#x02212;)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NA</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60 726 769&#x02013;60 726 937 (+)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NA</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ATG</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">67 245 487 (&#x02212;)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NA</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60 726 802 (+)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NA</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title><italic>In silico</italic> identification of a conserved minimal promoter associated with the CpG island</title><p>As the CpG island is conserved in other mammals (data not shown), we sought to establish whether a conserved promoter is present in the vicinity. We used two different <italic>in silico</italic> methods (<sc>frameworker</sc> and <sc>dialign tf</sc>; Genomatix) to analyse a 2.2 kb segment upstream of exon &#x02212;7 in six different mammalian species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3</xref> and Experimental procedures). Both approaches revealed the presence of the same highly conserved cluster of TF-binding sites just upstream of the transcriptional start sites identified by 5&#x02032;-RACE in the mouse CpG island. The arrangement and position of these sites is strictly conserved in six different species, and they are predicted to recruit ubiquitously expressed TFs, such as nuclear respiratory factor 1, elongation factor 2 (E2F), cAMP-responsive element binding protein and E-twenty-six (ETS), which are associated with a large number of ubiquitously expressed housekeeping genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>]. These results strongly suggest that a core promoter is embedded within the CpG island at the 5&#x02032;-end of the mammalian gene, and that its use underlies the ubiquitous expression of <italic>Tln2</italic> transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>). Furthermore, examination of chromatin modification data supplied with the latest human genome build (<sc>ensembl</sc> v50; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S4</xref>) strongly supports the idea of a promoter associated with the CpG island in humans. Indeed, it indicates that a 298 bp region overlapping our minimal promoter bears chromatin features characteristics of a promoter, i.e. presence of histone H2AZ, H3K9 monomethylation, H3K4 dimethylation and trimethylation, and DNAse I hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S4</xref>). It also suggests that, at least in humans, no other sequences upstream of the first coding exon exhibit the same features, and therefore that a single promoter may control the expression of <italic>TLN2</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Transcription from the CpG island accounts for the majority of <italic>Tln2</italic> expression in adult tissues</title><p>To get a better insight into the functional significance of the CpG island and its associated promoter, we analysed mice carrying a gene trap insertion in the intron downstream of exon &#x02212;3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref> and Experimental procedures), which should interrupt transcription from the CpG region. Mice homozygous for the gene trap (gt/gt) were viable, and we therefore analysed talin 2 levels in various tissues (brain, heart, kidney and spleen) by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1D</xref>). Strikingly, the gene trap insertion led to a dramatic reduction in talin 2 levels in all four tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1D</xref>). This indicates that the region upstream of exon &#x02212;3 contains one or several major site(s) of transcription initiation. It also strongly suggests that the promoter identified in this study is a major <italic>Tln2</italic> promoter. However, the gene trap failed to completely ablate talin 2 expression. This could be due to the intrinsic properties of gene traps, as skipping of gene trap cassettes and alternative splicing around the transgene have previously been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>]. Alternatively, it is possible that other <italic>Tln2</italic> promoters exist downstream of the gene trap insertion. Nevertheless, the extent of the reduction in talin 2 level observed strongly suggests that transcription upstream of the gene trap, most likely from the promoter in the CpG island, is responsible for the majority of talin 2 production in adult tissues.</p></sec><sec><title>A truncated talin 2 is expressed in elongating spermatids of the mature testis</title><p>Northern blots of testis mRNA reveal a 4.8 kb <italic>Tln2</italic> transcript that is too small to encode the full-length protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>].

Use of this ATG would add a unique 30 amino acid sequence to the N-terminus of this truncated talin 2 isoform, which otherwise would be identical to residues 1121&#x02013;2542 of the C-terminal half of full-length talin 2. However, the above RT-PCR data suggest that a second protein product may result from the skipping of exon 25c. In this case, the transcript would contain a unique 5&#x02032;-UTR, and the next in-frame ATG would be located in exon 26. Consequently, the protein would not contain the N-terminal 30 amino acid extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2C</xref>), and would be equivalent to residues 1153&#x02013;2541 of full-length talin 2. To investigate whether exon 25b encodes the 5&#x02032;-end of the short testis transcript, we first carried out quantitative RT-PCR. This showed that <italic>Tln2</italic> transcripts possessing sequences downstream of exons 25b and 25c are 20 times more abundant in testis than transcripts initiating upstream of exon 25 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Fig. S5A</xref>). This strongly suggests that the vast majority of <italic>Tln2</italic> transcripts in testis initiate downstream of exon 25. 5&#x02032;-RACE experiments confirmed that exon 25b represents a genuine <italic>Tln2</italic> transcription start site in testis. The position of the start site varies slightly in the three clones that we sequenced, and no TATA-box was detected upstream of exon 25b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2B</xref>). From the above results, we conclude that these short <italic>Tln2</italic> transcripts are expressed at high levels specifically in testis, and that they contain a unique 5&#x02032;-end composed of either exon 25b or exons 25b and 25c.</p><p>To establish whether the &#x0223c; 4.8 kb <italic>Tln2</italic> transcripts in testis gives rise to truncated talin 2 protein(s), we used a gene trap mouse line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>] in which the transgene is inserted between exons 28 and 29 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A</xref>). Because the gene trap cassette is downstream of exons 25b and 25c, it is predicted to interrupt the transcription of both long (ubiquitous) and short (testis-specific) <italic>Tln2</italic> transcripts. If full-length talin 2 (270 kDa) and the shorter isoforms (153 kDa) coexist in testis, they should both be detected in wild-type animals with an antibody raised against the C-terminal region of talin 2, whereas both proteins should be absent in homozygous gene trap mice. Furthermore, the gene trap cassette should lead to the expression of two talin 2&#x02013;&#x003b2;Geo fusion proteins that can be detected by an antibody against &#x003b2;-galactosidase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2D</xref>). As predicted, the levels of talin 2 proteins were dramatically reduced in tissues from homozygous (gt/gt) mice, and they were replaced by the predicted talin 2&#x02013;&#x003b2;Geo fusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2D</xref>). These results establish for the first time the existence of a truncated talin 2 in testis, which we have named Ts-talin 2 (testis-talin 2). We have not detected Ts-talin 2 in any other tissues.</p><p>As Ts-talin 2 lacks the integrin-binding site found in the N-terminal FERM domain of full-length talin, we sought to establish whether it could localize to cell&#x02013;ECM junctions. Analysis of NIH-3T3 cells transiently expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)&#x02013;Ts-talin 2 confirmed that the protein was efficiently expressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Fig. S6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Doc.

The results show that Ts-talin 2 is not expressed in prepubertal testis (2 weeks) but is upregulated at the onset of puberty (4&#x02013;6 weeks in the C57Bl/6 mouse strain). Concomitantly, the full-length protein is downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3A</xref>). In addition, our gene trap mouse line, which reports expression of both full-length talin 2 and Ts-talin 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A</xref>), allowed us to follow the expression pattern of the two proteins during this developmental switch. In heterozygotes, the &#x003b2;-galactosidase fusion protein was expressed in myoid cells and Leydig cells at the periphery of the seminiferous tubules, and this pattern of expression was identical at 2 and 12 weeks of age. However, strong punctate &#x003b2;-galactosidase staining appeared in the seminiferous epithelium after puberty. This was detected in only a subset of immature tubules, and was replaced by more diffuse staining as the tubule progressed towards the spermiation point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3B</xref>). Dissection of portions of seminiferous tubules, staged by transillumination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>], revealed that these dot-like structures are only present between the end of stage VIII (end of spermiation), when the transition between round and elongating spermatids is initiated, and the end of stage I, when elongating spermatids start forming bundles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>] (data not shown). Squashes of tubules from stages VIII&#x02013;XII and XII&#x02013;I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>] were used to analyse further the expression of the &#x003b2;-galactosidase&#x02013;talin 2 fusion protein. This showed that the dot-like structures are localized in the cytoplasm of early elongating spermatids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3C</xref>). A proportion of dots were also observed in enucleated vesicles (data not shown), reminiscent of the residual bodies lost during the process of spermatid elongation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>]. Together with our western blotting data, these results strongly suggest that the expression of full-length talin 2 is restricted to myoid and Leydig cells, whereas Ts-talin 2 is characteristic of the early stages of spermatid elongation.</p><fig id="fig03" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Ts-talin 2 is developmentally regulated and is expressed in early elongating spermatids.

Together, these results provide new evidence of the complexity of <italic>Tln2</italic> transcription and suggest that the gene encodes at least three different transcripts, which are subject to alternative splicing in a tissue-specific and/or isoform-specific manner.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, we have carried out a detailed analysis of mouse <italic>Tln2</italic> and showed that it spans over 400 kb. This is much larger than previously reported, owing to the presence of a new promoter associated with a CpG island located 236 kb upstream of the first coding exon. This promoter drives transcription of <italic>Tln2</italic> mRNAs containing a number of 5&#x02032;-exons scattered over &#x0223c; 200 kb, none of which generate an ORF in-frame with the rest of the <italic>Tln</italic>2 coding sequence. We conclude that they are 5&#x02032;-UTR exons. These untranslated exons are subject to alternative splicing, and this probably explains why several large <italic>Tln2</italic> transcripts can be detected in northern blots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>]. The smallest RT-PCR amplicon derived from the mouse 5&#x02032;-UTR is composed of exons &#x02212;7, &#x02212;5 and &#x02212;2. When this is linked to the sequence encoding the full-length protein, it gives rise to a 9.2 kb transcript, whereas a <italic>Tln2</italic> transcript containing all of the authenticated 5&#x02032;-UTR exons (&#x02212;7, &#x02212;6, &#x02212;5, &#x02212;2 and 0) would be about 10 kb in length. These are similar in size to the 9.5 kb and 10 kb transcripts detected in northern blots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>]. However, we have yet to determine the full extent of alternative splicing of the 5&#x02032;-UTR exons. The failure to detect transcripts containing exons &#x02212;4 and &#x02212;1 in adult mouse tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>) suggests that their inclusion is tissue-specific and/or developmentally regulated. It also raises the question as to whether they are ever included in <italic>Tln2</italic> transcripts initiating at the CpG island. Interestingly, exons &#x02212;4 and &#x02212;1 are the most 5&#x02032; sequences in ESTs derived from mouse blastocysts and 13-day-old embryo heart respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref>), suggesting that there may be alternative transcriptional start sites in the vicinity of exons &#x02212;4 and &#x02212;1.</p><p>With respect to human <italic>TLN2</italic>, previous studies have assumed that transcription is initiated at the first base of the first coding exon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>]. However, we demonstrate that some of the 5&#x02032;-UTR exons observed in the mouse are conserved in human <italic>TLN2</italic>, and that large <italic>TLN2</italic> transcripts exist in human tissues. Moreover, using RT-PCR and human fibroblast and heart mRNAs, we detected additional novel 5&#x02032;-UTR exons linking exon &#x02212;7 to exon 1. Thus, the 5&#x02032;-UTR of human <italic>TLN2</italic> is similarly complex, although not all the 5&#x02032;-UTR exons are conserved between human and mouse (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2</xref>). The role of such a complex alternatively spliced 5&#x02032;-UTR is unclear, although its conservation between species implies an important functional role. It could, for instance, regulate the stability of the corresponding transcripts at different levels, either intrinsically or in response to cellular cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>].</p><p>Our data in mouse show that a major <italic>Tln2</italic> promoter is associated with the CpG island upstream of these 5&#x02032;-UTR exons, and that this is conserved in all mammals. The <italic>in silico</italic> characterization of this promoter was based on the rationale that polymerase II promoters usually contain multiple TF-binding sites, the spatial organization (framework) of which defines the specificity of the promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>]. Using this stringent approach, we identified a minimal core promoter that is conserved in mammals and contains a common framework of binding sites for the ubiquitously expressed TFs nuclear respiratory factor 1, E2F, cAMP-responsive element binding protein and ETS-1. However, of the above TFs, only ETS-1 has previously been implicated in cell adhesion, via transcriptional regulation of metalloproteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>]. Clearly, further experimental work will be required to confirm the role of these TFs in regulating <italic>Tln2</italic> expression. Interestingly, in humans, the region that we have defined as the conserved minimal promoter is the only <italic>TLN2</italic> sequence bearing chromatin features characteristic of a promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S4</xref>).</p><p>Direct experimental proof that the distal CpG region contains a major <italic>Tln2</italic> promoter comes from studies with mice carrying a gene trap insertion in intron &#x02212;3. The results establish that the majority of talin 2 expressed in adult tissues is derived from transcripts that initiate upstream of exon &#x02212;3. However, the gene trap insertion failed to totally abolish talin 2 expression, and the levels of residual talin 2 varied between tissues. This may be due to splicing around the gene trap, the efficiency of which may vary from tissue to tissue, or to the presence of a tissue-specific promoter(s) downstream of the insertion. Indeed, the existence of a muscle-specific promoter in human <italic>TLN2</italic> just upstream of the ATG of exon 1 has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>], although the authors only identified individual TF-binding sites <italic>in silico</italic> rather than conserved clusters. If this promoter is authentic, then our data show that it is clearly not the only promoter used in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figs 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S2B</xref>).</p><p>The next level of complexity resides in the existence of additional <italic>Tln2</italic> promoters that give rise to short <italic>Tln2</italic> transcripts in certain tissues, the evidence for which was originally based on northern blots of testis and kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>]. We have verified the existence of two short <italic>Tln2</italic> transcripts that are restricted to adult testis, and that differ at the 5&#x02032;-end, owing to alternative splicing of the first coding exon (exon 25c). This should result in the expression of two short talin 2 isoforms that span residues 1121&#x02013;2542 and 1153&#x02013;2542 of the full-length talin 2, the notable difference being that the former contains a unique 30 amino acid N-terminal extension encoded by exon 25c (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figs 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6</xref>). We have confirmed by western blotting that the predominant talin 2 isoform in testis has a molecular mass of &#x0223c; 150 kDa and that its expression correlates with the onset of puberty in mice. Furthermore, analysis of the &#x003b2;-galactosidase&#x02013;talin 2 reporter generated by the insertion of a gene trap downstream of the testis-specific transcriptional start site (intron 28; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>) revealed that upregulation of Ts-talin 2 at puberty correlates with the appearance of strong and localized X-gal staining in the cytoplasm of early elongating spermatids and in enucleated vesicles, reminiscent of residual/cytoplasmic bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>]. Therefore, we propose that Ts-talin 2 might play a key role in the regulation of spermatid elongation and/or migration through the seminiferous epithelium. These processes are thought to involve cell&#x02013;cell contacts between elongating spermatids and the apical ectoplasmic specializations (ESs) of surrounding Sertoli cells. Various laminin isoforms, integrin &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;1 heterodimers, F-actin and other cytoskeletal and signalling molecules have been implicated on both sides of the spermatid&#x02013;ES junction, although, interestingly, the linker proteins between the extracellular laminins and the cytoplasm of the elongating spermatid are currently unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>]. If Ts-talin 2 is important in spermatogenesis, one would predict that spermatogenesis should be defective in mice homozygous for the gene trap insertion in intron 28, which results in a dramatic reduction in the level of Ts-talin 2. However, these mice are viable and fertile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>]. Quantitative RT-PCR across the insertion site, and careful examination of western blots, reveals that transcription downstream of the gene trap still occurs, and a low level of the Ts-talin 2 is still present in the testis of these mice (data not shown). Thus, the gene trap may well be a hypomorphic rather than a null allele, and a more thorough investigation of the phenotype of these mice is required.</p><p>The second short <italic>Tln2</italic> transcript identified here contains a unique 5&#x02032; noncoding exon (34b), and was found mainly but not exclusively in kidney. Using western blotting, we have confirmed that the corresponding 90 kDa protein is expressed in kidney, although we have not detected it in embryonic or adult kidney epithelial cell lines (NRK, HEK-293, Cos-7; data not shown) or in other tissues. However, the expression of the corresponding short transcripts in other tissues suggests that the protein(s) may be present at low levels, perhaps in a subset of cells. The protein is predicted to span residues 1608&#x02013;2542, and therefore lacks the N-terminal region of full-length talin 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6</xref>).</p><fig id="fig06" position="float"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Diagram of the main talin 2 isoforms.

Clearly, these regulatory functions have been lost from both the testis and kidney short talin 2 isoforms, and in testis, these may not be required, given the unique architecture and molecular composition of the ES junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>]. However, both isoforms contain the second integrin-binding site in the rod as well as the highly conserved C-terminal actin-binding site and several vinculin-binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6</xref>), and therefore still retain the potential to link integrins to the actin cytoskeleton.</p><p>Evidence has recently come to light regarding the existence of a microRNA, <italic>miR-190</italic>, in sense orientation within intron 51 of mouse <italic>Tln2</italic> (<sc>ensembl</sc>, genome release 50, gene ENSMUSG00000076379, coordinates chromosome 9: 67 084 458&#x02013;67 084 542). <italic>MiR-190</italic> is highly conserved both in sequence and in position in <italic>talin 2</italic> in all vertebrates analysed so far. It is also present and expressed from the unique <italic>talin</italic> gene of insects (12 <italic>Drosophila</italic> species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>] and the honey bee, <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>]), thus confirming the relationship between the ancestral <italic>talin</italic> gene and <italic>talin 2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>]. However, <italic>miR-190</italic> is absent in the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> genome, indicating that <italic>miR-190</italic> first appeared in the Arthropod lineage and was maintained throughout the chordates. Interestingly, <italic>miR-190</italic> is expressed in mouse testis and kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>], where the two <italic>Tln2</italic> short transcripts are highly expressed, as well as in various human cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>], and is upregulated in primary myelofibrosis patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>]. As <italic>miR-190</italic>, like many intronic microRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>], is transcribed as part of larger primary transcripts, it is possible that one of the functions of the short <italic>Tln2</italic> transcripts is to produce <italic>miR-190</italic>. Intriguingly, out of the 36 <italic>miR-190</italic> target genes common to at least two different prediction algorithms and conserved in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>], 12 are genes involved in cell adhesion or related processes, e.g. members of the ARP 2/3 complex (<italic>ACTR3</italic> and <italic>ARPC5</italic>), cadherins (<italic>CDH2</italic>, <italic>PCDH9</italic>), myosin VA (<italic>MYO5A</italic>), dystroglycan and attractin precursors (<italic>DAG1</italic> and <italic>ATRN</italic>), neurofascin (<italic>NFASC</italic>), hyalouronan synthase (<italic>HAS2</italic>), and <italic>KRAS2</italic>. Clearly, it will be important to establish the origin of <italic>miR-190</italic> transcripts, and their expression profile, targets, and function.</p><p>In addition to the short talin isoforms, we have also identified four alternatively spliced <italic>talin 2</italic> transcripts. Exon 43 is skipped in one variant, and comparison of talin 1 and talin 2 sequences (74% identity) shows that this would delete residues 1912&#x02013;1960, equivalent to helix 45 and helix 46 of the talin 1 rod (Protein Data Bank ID: 2b0h). Helix 46 contains one of the numerous vinculin-binding sites (VBS3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6</xref>) in talin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>], and deletion of this region would be predicted to destroy this site. Unfortunately, it has not been possible to detect the corresponding protein by western blotting, because the difference in molecular mass (5.46 kDa) does not allow separation from full-length talin 2. We have also detected inclusion of exon 54b in the main <italic>talin 2</italic> transcript expressed in brain and at lower levels in other tissues. The extra 15 amino acids encoded by exon 54b, which are totally conserved between mouse and human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>], are inserted into the N-terminal region of helix 61 of the talin rod. In talin 1, this helix is part of a five-helix bundle that forms the C-terminal actin-binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>], and therefore the insertion could have important functional implications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6</xref>). Clearly, an antibody against the extra amino acid sequence will be required to establish whether the corresponding protein is actually expressed in brain.</p><p>In summary, our results demonstrate the complexity of the mammalian <italic>talin 2</italic> gene and provide direct evidence for the existence of at least three different protein isoforms expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Moreover, the occurrence of four alternative splicing events raises the possibility that the number of talin 2 isoforms is actually much higher. Thus, we currently predict the existence of six talin 2 variants in addition to the three short protein isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6</xref>). This highlights the need to use isoform-specific talin 2 antibodies, where possible, for immunolocalization and biochemical studies. The results also have important implications for the design and interpretation of experiments aimed at defining the expression and the function of talin 2. First, as there are several <italic>Tln2</italic> promoters, the use of gene traps as reporters of <italic>Tln2</italic> expression patterns should be considered with care. Second, the fact that the <italic>Tln2</italic> gene traps fail to ablate talin 2 expression indicates that exon skipping may cause problems in designing <italic>Tln2</italic> mutant alleles. Third, the use of small interfering RNAs downstream of exon 25b or exon 34b should be avoided, as they will affect expression of both full-length and the shorter variant(s) of talin 2. Instead, targeting of transcript-specific exons (e.g. 25b, 25c, or 34b) and/or promoters might be preferrable. Fourth, the presence of microRNA <italic>miR-190</italic> within the 3&#x02032;-region of the <italic>Tln2</italic>/<italic>TLN2</italic> gene raises questions about its function, the role of the short <italic>Tln2</italic> transcripts, and the protein isoforms that they encode, and should also be taken into consideration in the design of knockout strategies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>EST and cDNA analysis</title><p>We used the National Institute for Allergy Mouse Gene Index (version 5) and the Mouse Genome Assembly through the <sc>ensembl</sc> portal (build 37; NCBI reference sequence version 36) to carry out our analysis.

Heterozygous gene trap mice (gt/+) were either outbred onto a C57/Bl6 background to establish a colony or intercrossed in order to generate homozygotes (gt/gt). Combinations of primers (see gene trap ES cells and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Table S1</xref>), detecting both the presence and the absence of the gene trap at the insertion point, allowed discrimination between heterozygous and homozygous mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Protein lysates from tissues and western blotting</title><p>Tissues were dissected from genotyped animals, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C. The frozen tissues were lysed and homogenized with a Polytron tissue homogenizer as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>], in the presence of a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA; Set III; 1 : 100 dilution) plus a calpain II inhibitor (E64d; Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA; 1 &#x003bc;g&#x000b7;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). Protein concentrations were determined in 5 &#x003bc;L aliquots in triplicate using the Bradford assay (Coomassie Plus Kit; ThermoScientific) with BSA standards. Aliquots of tissue lysates containing 40 &#x003bc;g of protein were denatured at 100 &#x000b0;C for 2 min in the presence of 5 m<sc>m</sc> Tris/HCl (pH 6.8), 4% glycerol, 1.6% SDS, 2% bromophenol blue, and 1%&#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol. The samples were subjected to SDS/PAGE (6% gels), and the proteins were electroblotted onto Hybond P membranes using wet transfer in 2.5 m<sc>m</sc> Tris base and 9.6 m<sc>m</sc> glycine. Excess protein binding sites were blocked by incubation in 5% dried milk in NaCl/Tris (pH 7.4). The long isoform of talin 2 was detected using a mouse monoclonal antibody (68E7) raised in this laboratory against an N-terminal recombinant mouse talin 2 peptide (amino acids 482&#x02013;911) and diluted 1 : 200 in blocking buffer. Polypeptides containing the C-terminal region of talin 2 were detected with an in-house mouse monoclonal antibody (53-121A1, epitope 2479-2494; 1 : 50 dilution) or a polyclonal antibody raised in rabbits against residues 2477&#x02013;2491 of human talin 2 (1 : 3500 dilution). Vinculin was detected using the mouse monoclonal antibody F9 as previously described, with a 1 : 400 dilution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>]. &#x003b2;-Galactosidase was detected with a rabbit polyclonal primary antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK; ab4761, 1 : 1000 dilution). Bound primary antibodies were detected by adding anti-mouse IgGs (GE Healthcare UK Ltd, Chalfont St Giles, UK; 1 : 2500 dilution) or anti-rabbit IgGs (Sigma; A6154, 1 : 3500) coupled to horseradish peroxidase. Horseradish peroxidase activity was detected using an ECL Kit (SuperSignal West Pico; ThermoScientific), and autoradiographic films were exposed for varying amounts of time. Semiquantitation of the relative abundance of talin 2 across samples was performed using Adobe <sc>photoshop</sc>. Films were scanned and the images were inverted. Rectangles of constant surface area were drawn around the talin 2 and vinculin bands, and the mean luminosity of each rectangle was determined in Adobe <sc>photoshop</sc>. Levels of talin 2 were obtained by normalizing the talin 2 to the vinculin signals and by comparing the values between samples.</p></sec><sec><title>Cryosections and X-gal staining</title><p>Testes were dissected and frozen in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) medium (R. A. Lamb, London, UK) and 20 &#x003bc;m frozen sections were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde for 5 min, and stained for &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity overnight at 37 &#x000b0;C in 1 &#x000d7; NaCl/P<sub>i</sub> with 2.5 m<sc>m</sc> X-gal, 5 m<sc>m</sc> potassium ferrocyanide, 5 m<sc>m</sc> potassium ferricyanide, 2 m<sc>m</sc> MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2% sodium deoxycholate and 0.4% NP-40. The slides were washed three times in 1 &#x000d7; NaCl/P<sub>i</sub>, and nuclei were counterstained with haematoxylin. After being rinsed in cold water, the slides were dehydrated in 70, 90 and 100% ethanol, postfixed twice in xylene, and mounted in DPX synthetic resin.</p></sec><sec><title>Seminiferous tubule dissection and X-gal staining</title><p>The testis was decapsulated, and the tubules were staged and dissected as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>]. The relevant portions of tubules were squashed on a slide using a coverslip, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen before being fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 5 min. X-gal staining was performed as described for cryosections, and nuclei were counterstained with 4&#x02032;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI; Invitrogen) for 5 min at room temperature. Slides were subsequently washed three times in 1 &#x000d7; NaCl/P<sub>i</sub> before mounting. Differential interference contrast and DAPI-stained images were acquired on a Leica DM5000B microscope fitted with a 40&#x000d7; objective and a Leica DFC420C imaging system.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to P.
