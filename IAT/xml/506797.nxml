When active, these elements propagate by reverse transcription of RNA intermediates. The synthesized cDNA copies insert themselves within their host genome, which results in the inactivation or activation of genes located in the vicinity. These transpositions can then be a major source of mutations and as such contribute to the induction and&#x0002f;or enhancement of pathological processes. Nevertheless, retrotransposons are ancient constituents of eukaryotic genomes, indicating that their transposition is tightly controlled so as not to be too deleterious, and that they have now reached a status and a life cycle compatible with their own host's life cycle. In that respect, they constitute an adequate system to study interactions that should exist between these potentially mutagenic, parasite-like elements and their host.</p><p>Although their control at different steps of their replication cycle can limit transposition, transcriptional initiation is the first rate-limiting step in this process. Thereby, LTR retrotransposons display a strict pattern of expression, confining their transcription to some very specific tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c5">5</xref>). Such specificities involve interactions between host-encoded, <italic>trans</italic>-regulatory proteins and complementary <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory protein binding sites located within the retrotransposon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c6">6</xref>).</p><p>For the past few years, our laboratory has been engaged in studying the control of an LTR retrotransposon, <italic>ZAM</italic> from <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, that is similar in structure and replication cycle to mammalian retroviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c7">7</xref>). This element is generally present with a very low copy number (not exceeding two copies) in the lines studied. However, one line called Rev exists in which this control has been disturbed, resulting in a high expression of <italic>ZAM</italic> and an increased mobilization rate. In the process of analyzing this control, we have found that <italic>ZAM</italic> expression is subject to two types of controls: one restricts its expression to specific somatic cells in the ovaries; the other silences this expression in most of the lines tested but not in &#x02018;Rev&#x02019;. We previously reported that this latter control, which depends on the genetic background of the line, is controlled by an heterochromatic locus located in 20A2-3 on the X chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c8">8</xref>). However, we had not investigated the molecular basis of its control that restricts expression to a specific subset of somatic cells located at the posterior pole of the oocyte and that was only observed in the Rev line when silencing is abolished. In this study, we carried out an in-depth analysis of the intrinsic regulatory properties of <italic>ZAM</italic> and the host-encoded factor that defines this strict tissue specificity.</p><p>The expression pattern of LTR retrotransposons is partly controlled by sequences located in <italic>cis</italic>, on the retrotransposon proper and generally on the LTR. The LTRs are composed of a U3 region, a central R and a U5 region. The transcription initiation site defines the boundary between U3 and R regions. The polyadenylation site corresponds to the boundary between R and U5 regions. We have found that the first 190 bp of the U3 region of <italic>ZAM</italic> can drive expression of reporter genes in a pattern that reproduces the ovary expression pattern of endogenous <italic>ZAM</italic> elements. This establishes this 190 bp as a short and defined enhancer. We used this accessible system to identify factors involved in the transcriptional specificity. Since <italic>ZAM</italic> is transcribed in the follicle cells located at the posterior pole of the oocyte, we focused our attention on <italic>Drosophila</italic>-encoded factors known to be necessary for the differentiation of these cells.</p><p>During <italic>Drosophila</italic> oogenesis, cell&#x02013;cell signaling occurs between the germ-line-derived oocyte and the somatically-derived follicle cells that surround it. The follicle cell layer becomes polarized along the anterior&#x02013;posterior axis when the oocyte induces the follicle cells at one end of the egg chamber to adopt a posterior rather than an anterior fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c9">9</xref>). This induction requires Gurken in the germ line and the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologue of the epidermal growth factor receptor, EGFR, in the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c11">11</xref>). Gurken is thought to bind directly to the EGFR to activate a typical receptor tyrosine kinase signal transduction cascade that specifies posterior fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c13">13</xref>). Some of the effectors and target genes of EGF receptor pathway have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c16">16</xref>). One of them is an ETS transcription factor encoded by the <italic>pointed</italic> gene that is expressed in response to activation of the EGF receptor pathway, and brings about its negative regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c17">17</xref>).</p><p>The present study has revealed a connection between EGF receptor signaling and regulation of <italic>ZAM</italic> expression. Indeed, we have shown that the EGF receptor pathway is necessary for the expression of <italic>ZAM</italic> in the posterior follicle cells. The transcriptional factor involved has been identified as the Pointed2 protein, an ETS-binding protein that is able to bind an ETS-binding site located at position 79 on the <italic>ZAM</italic> sequence.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Fly stocks</title><p>The fly strains used were <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> an S-line in which <italic>ZAM</italic> is silenced, and Rev, a U-line in which <italic>ZAM</italic> expression is active (both from the collection of INSERM U384); [hs-FLP 12, FRT 42D <italic>top<sup>CO</sup></italic>, FRT 42D hs-<italic>myc</italic>] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c18">18</xref>); <italic>pnt<sup>&#x00394;88</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c19">19</xref>); <italic>UASpntP1</italic>, <italic>UASpntP2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c20">20</xref>); GAL 4 line 55B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c15">15</xref>); [<italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> 70FLP; <italic>cu kar</italic><sup>2</sup><italic>Sb</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>TM6, Ubx e<sup>S</sup></italic>] (kindly provided by Kent Golic); [<italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>; P&#x0007b;w &#x0002b; mC &#x0003d; UAS-GFP.nls&#x0007d;14], [<italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>; P&#x0007b;ry &#x0002b; t7.2 &#x0003d; neoFRT&#x0007d;82B P&#x0007b;w &#x0002b; t<sup>&#x0002a;</sup> ry &#x0002b; t<sup>&#x0002a;</sup> &#x0003d; white-un1&#x0007d;90<sup>E</sup>], [<italic>w<sup>&#x0002a;</sup></italic>; P&#x0007b;ry &#x0002b; t7.2 &#x0003d; neoFRT&#x0007d;82B P&#x0007b;w &#x0002b; mC &#x0003d; Ubi-GFP&#x0007d;83] (Bloomington Stock Center).

We previously reported that indeed, the tissue specificity and a strain control are determined by the <italic>ZAM</italic> LTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c8">8</xref>). In order to focus on the tissue specificity of its transcription and better localize sequences involved, we constructed plasmids containing <italic>ZAM</italic> sequences and a <italic>LacZ</italic> reporter gene which could mimic <italic>ZAM</italic> expression <italic>in vivo</italic>. To this end, a PCR-amplified <italic>ZAM</italic> fragments containing the U3 region (1&#x02013;310) was fused to the <italic>E.coli LacZ</italic> gene in a P-element transformation vector. Since the 310 bp do not contain the <italic>ZAM</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c7">7</xref>), they have been cloned in a transgenic vector upstream of a minimum hsp70 promoter fused to <italic>LacZ</italic>. This construct has been called pZ310. It has been injected into <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> flies, and five independent transgenic lines were established. Using a histochemical assay for &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity, we have studied the expression of the <italic>LacZ</italic> reporter gene controlled by <italic>ZAM</italic> U3 sequences. In two independent transgenic lines, &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity is detected in the somatic follicle cells located at the posterior pole of follicles all along the ovarioles (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh708f1">1</xref>). This transcription of <italic>LacZ</italic> exactly reproduces the expression pattern of endogenous <italic>ZAM</italic> elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c1">1</xref>) and of the full length LTR of ZAM when fused to <italic>LacZ</italic> [(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh708f1">1</xref>A and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c8">8</xref>)]. To define the sequence involved more precisely, we then tested the first 190 bp from the N-terminal part of U3 (1&#x02013;190) fused to LacZ (pZ190). The established transgenic line obtained with such a transgene expressed the LacZ reporter in the follicle cells located at the posterior pole of the oocyte. This indicated that the enhancer specific to this patch of cells is contained within the 190 bp of U3. The transgenic approaches used in this experiment demonstrate that the tissue-specific expression of <italic>ZAM</italic> is only dependent on sequences present in the U3 region of <italic>ZAM</italic> LTR and more precisely in its first 190 bp.</p></sec><sec><title>The EGF receptor signaling pathway controls the tissue-specific expression of <italic>ZAM</italic></title><p>The identity of the terminal follicle cells where <italic>ZAM</italic> expression is detected, is determined by an oocyte signal transmitted to the follicle cells by the EGF receptor localized at the surface of the follicle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c18">18</xref>). We therefore investigated whether the EGF receptor pathway is also responsible for the tissue specificity of <italic>ZAM</italic>. For this purpose, we tested the responsiveness of the U3 region through the pZ310 transgenes to signaling molecules of the EGF pathway, and searched whether mutations affecting this signaling also affect the expression of the transgenes.</p><p>In the first set of experiments, we generated small marked mosaic clones homozygous for <italic>top<sup>CO</sup></italic> [a null allele of the EGF receptor (<italic>Egfr</italic>) gene, also called <italic>torpedo</italic> in <italic>D.melanogaster</italic>] in the posterior follicle cells during oogenesis, and followed their <italic>ZAM</italic> control by staining for the &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity of the pZ310 transgene. The generation of <italic>Egfr</italic><sup>&#x02212;&#x0002f;&#x02212;</sup> follicle cell clones were induced through <italic>FLP</italic> mitotic recombination in females <italic>trans</italic>-heterozygous for hs-<italic>myc</italic> and <italic>top<sup>CO</sup></italic>. One daughter of a recombinant follicle cell carries two copies of <italic>myc</italic>, whereas the other lacks <italic>myc</italic> and is homozygous for <italic>top<sup>CO</sup></italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh708f2">2</xref>A).</p><p>In homozygous <italic>top<sup>CO</sup></italic> clones at the posterior follicle cells of stage 9 to 10 of oogenesis, we found that <italic>ZAM</italic> expression is abolished (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh708f2">2</xref>B). The <italic>LacZ</italic> staining is specifically absent in the mutant <italic>top<sup>CO</sup></italic> cells whereas it is detected in the surrounding cells expressing <italic>myc</italic>. This pattern of expression has been found in all the four clones generated in this experiment. Since removal of the <italic>Egfr</italic> causes an absence of <italic>ZAM</italic> expression, we conclude that <italic>ZAM</italic> expression is dependent on the EGF signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>The Pointed transcription factor activates <italic>ZAM</italic> expression</title><p>In order to identify the transcription factor involved in <italic>ZAM</italic> expression, we next investigated whether a transcription factor acting downstream of the EGF receptor signaling pathway could be involved in transducing the EGF-type signal to the <italic>ZAM</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c18">18</xref>).

A wild-type chromosome was marked with the <italic>GFP</italic> gene controlled by a <italic>ubiquitin</italic> promotor which directs expression in all the follicle cells. The chromosome bearing the <italic>pnt<sup>&#x00394;88</sup></italic> null allele does not carry the <italic>GFP</italic> marker. Thus <italic>pnt<sup>&#x00394;88</sup></italic> homozygous mutant cells can be easily detected due to a lack of GFP expression. On another hand, <italic>ZAM</italic> expression is followed by staining for the &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity of the pZ190 transgene. Eleven mosaic clones were generated in posterior follicle cells. <italic>LacZ</italic> staining was never detected in these 11 clones, indicating that pZ190 is only expressed in cells in which Pointed is expressed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh708f3">3</xref>). Thus, we conclude that <italic>ZAM</italic> expression depends on the Pointed transcription factors.</p><p>To further investigate the implication of <italic>Pointed</italic> in the restricted expression of <italic>ZAM</italic> in follicle cells with a posterior fate, we ectopically expressed <italic>pointed</italic> in another cell lineage owing to the GAL4&#x0002f;UAS system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c26">26</xref>) and examined the pZ190 expression. The GAL4 driver present in line <italic>55B</italic> was used to induce expression of UAS-target genes in the anterior follicle cells at the ventral and dorsal sides of oocytes in stages 8 to 10, which is illustrated by staining for GFP expressed from an <italic>UAS-GFP</italic> target transgene [Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh708f4">4</xref> and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c15">15</xref>)]. The Gal4 line <italic>55B</italic> carrying the <italic>UAS-GFP</italic> transgene as a marker, was then crossed to lines bearing Gal4-responsive <italic>pntP1</italic> or <italic>pntP2</italic> genes: <italic>UAS-pntP1</italic> or <italic>UAS-pntP2</italic>. This cross led to two independent lines with the following genotypes: [<italic>UAS-GFP</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>CyO</italic>; <italic>UAS-pntP1</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>55-Gal4</italic>] and [<italic>UAS-GFP</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>CyO</italic>; <italic>UAS-pntP2</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>55-Gal4</italic>] in which GFP and PntP1 or PntP2 are co-expressed in the anterior follicle cells. Submitted to the Gal4 driver, expression of these transgenes is thus driven in the same cells as the <italic>UAS-GFP</italic> transgene. Their expression is then indirectly followed through staining for GFP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh708f4">4</xref>). In a final set of crosses, pZ190 was introduced within the genome leading to flies with the following genotypes: [<italic>UAS-GFP</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>pZ190</italic>; <italic>UAS-pntP1</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>55-Gal4</italic>] and [<italic>UAS-GFP</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>pZ190</italic>; <italic>UAS-pntP2</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>55-Gal4</italic>]. This allowed testing of the effects of ectopic expression of PntP1 and PntP2, respectively, on <italic>ZAM</italic> transcription by staining for &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity.</p><p>When ovaries dissected from females [<italic>UAS-GFP</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>pZ190</italic>; <italic>UAS-pntP1</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>55B-Gal4</italic>] were examined no expression of pZ190 over 10 independent clones examined could ever be detected in the anterior follicle cells where PntP1 is ectopically expressed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh708f4">4</xref>A). In contrast, in ovaries dissected from females with the [<italic>UAS-GFP</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>pZ190</italic>; <italic>UAS-pntP2</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>55B-Gal4</italic>] genotype, <italic>LacZ</italic> staining due to an ectopic expression of pZ190 generated was clearly detected in numerous cells located at the anterior pole of the oocyte, and expressing PntP2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh708f4">4</xref>B). As illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh708f4">4</xref>B, <italic>LacZ</italic> staining due to the expression of pZ190 is not observed in all the cells expressing GFP. Several reasons can be considered. First, the PntP2 transgene may not be expressed in all the cells in which the <italic>UAS-GFP</italic> transgene is present. Second, the incomplete rescuing of <italic>LacZ</italic> expression could be due to a lower level of PntP2 expression compared to its endogenous expression within the posterior follicle cells. Third, PntP2 is active as a phosphorylated protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c27">27</xref>). When ectopically expressed, PntP2 may be less phosphorylated and therefore less efficient. Fourth, the transcriptional activation of <italic>ZAM</italic> by PntP2 may require a specific co-factor expressed at a limited rate in these anterior cells. Nevertheless, these experiments clearly show that activation of <italic>ZAM</italic> transcription may be partially recovered, in follicle cells ectopically expressing PntP2. These data indicate a functional requirement of PntP2 for proper patterning of <italic>ZAM</italic> expression in follicle cells with a posterior fate.</p></sec><sec><title>Pnt interacts with an ETS binding site located within the first 190 bp of <italic>ZAM</italic></title><p>As Pointed is a transcription factor, there remains the question of whether it binds to the 190 bp of <italic>ZAM</italic> directly or indirectly. We expressed the DNA binding domain of Pointed tagged with GST in bacteria, and performed gel-shift mobility assays using the 190 bp fragment as a probe (see Materials and Methods). We have found that the GST&#x02013;PntC fusion protein does indeed bind the 190 bp long probe of <italic>ZAM</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh708f5">5</xref>A) while a control lysate programmed with a GST peptide alone, with no Pointed sequence, is not. Additionally, the ability of an unlabeled 190 bp fragment to outcompete the DNA binding complex confirmed this result (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh708f5">5</xref>B).</p><p>We then proceeded to determine which site within the 190 bp is responsible for this binding, and scanned the <italic>ZAM</italic> promoter region <italic>in silico</italic> for putative ETS binding sites (EBS). One site potentially recognized by a <italic>Drosophila</italic> ETS transcription factor (5&#x02032;-GGAA-3&#x02032;) was found at position 79 according to <italic>ZAM</italic> sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c28">28</xref>). If the ETS transcription factor is Pointed, then it should associate directly with this ETS-binding site, and one would expect to see competition when an excess of an oligonucleotide encompassing the domain is used. This is indeed what has been obtained. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh708f5">5</xref>B, the ZAMets oligonucleotide (from nucleotides 72 to 86 on <italic>ZAM</italic> sequence, see Material and Methods) efficiently competed with the complex. Additionally, an oligonucleotide such as Mut identical to ZAMets but with a mutated ETS binding site (see Materials and methods) is then unable to compete with the complex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh708f5">5</xref>B). These results indicate that the transcription factor Pointed directly binds an ETS-binding site present at position 79 within the <italic>ZAM</italic> sequence.</p><p>If Pointed associates with the ETS-binding site of <italic>ZAM</italic>, it should bind the ZAMets oligonucleotide in gel-shift assays. We performed a gel-shift assay using the ZAMets oligonucleotide as a probe. We have found that the GST&#x02013;PntC fusion protein does indeed bind ZAMets (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh708f5">5</xref>C), while a control lysate with a GST peptide alone does not. Additionally, an unlabeled ZAMets primer added as a 25- or 100-fold excess is able to outcompete the DNA binding complex while Mut, the mutated primer for the EBS is not (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh708f5">5</xref>C). Overall, these results indicate that Pointed associates with an ETS binding site located at positions 79 to 82 within the <italic>ZAM</italic> LTR.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Oogenesis involves direct interaction between germline cells and somatic follicle cells for the successful development of fertile eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c29">29</xref>). We have found that such intercellular communications from germ line to somatic line in the first instance, and from somatic line to germ line in the second also play crucial roles in the replication cycle of an LTR retrotransposon <italic>ZAM</italic> from <italic>D.melanogaster</italic>. We previously demonstrated the necessity of a somatic cell to germ cell communication for the transport of <italic>ZAM</italic> particles. Indeed, <italic>ZAM</italic> particles formed within the follicle cells take benefit of the vittelogenin traffic to sort out of the follicle cells and enter the closely apposed oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c1">1</xref>). Here, we show that in the first steps of its replication cycle, <italic>ZAM</italic> requires another signal transmitted by the germ line and received by the somatic line.</p><sec><title>The somatic transcription of <italic>ZAM</italic> depends on the Pointed factor acting downstream of the EGF receptor pathway</title><p>We previously reported that <italic>ZAM</italic> transcripts are detected in a group of somatically derived cells, which are the follicle cells surrounding the posterior part of the oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c1">1</xref>). This transcription of <italic>ZAM</italic> implies that a tissue-specific promoter controls its expression during oogenesis. By analyzing the long terminal repeat and specifially introducing the U3 region (5&#x02032; part of the LTR) upstream of the reporter gene <italic>LacZ</italic> into flies (leading to the so-called pZ310 transgenic flies), we demonstrate that this region contains the tissue-specific enhancer of ZAM. Furthermore, a similarly restricted pattern of expression was found in another series of transgenic flies called pZ190 that we have generated using 190 bp of the 5&#x02032; end of U3. <italic>LacZ</italic> expression was found to be similar to that observed when the full-length LTR or the U3 region was fused to <italic>LacZ</italic>. These transgenic lines indicate that the essential <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements for the transcriptional regulation of the <italic>ZAM</italic> promoter are included within its first 190 bp.</p><p>It has been well described that the EGF receptor pathway is necessary for the differentiation of these very specific follicle cells where <italic>ZAM</italic> is expressed. Through a genetic approach, we further demonstrated that the first 190 bp of <italic>ZAM</italic> are also the direct target of the EGF receptor pathway. Mosaic clones of cells homozygous for a null allele of the <italic>torpedo</italic> gene, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> EGF receptor, were generated within the posterior follicle cells. <italic>LacZ</italic> staining due to the pZ310 (U3&#x02013;<italic>LacZ</italic>) or pZ190 (190 bp&#x02013;<italic>LacZ</italic>) transgene expression was undetected in the clones, whereas it was present within surrounding cells with a wild-type genotype.</p><p>Various factors have been shown to be involved in mediating a transcriptional response upon the reception of signals from the EGF receptor pathway. Two of them are the isoforms encoded by the <italic>pointed</italic> genes: Pointed1 and Pointed2. Ectopic expression of Pointed2 in a subset of follicle cells with an anterior fate of differentiation (instead of a posterior fate as necessary for <italic>ZAM</italic> expression) has shown that the presence of Pointed2 causes an ectopic expression of the pZ190 transgene in these anterior follicle cells. This result contrasts with what is observed in a wild-type background or with ectopic expression of Pointed1 in the anterior follicle cells, which does not allow <italic>ZAM</italic> expression within those follicle cells with an anterior fate. Our data therefore indicate that Pointed2 is a necessary positive effector in <italic>ZAM</italic> expression. Pnt2 is required for proper cell determination during various stages of <italic>Drosophila</italic> development: in the eyes or during the development of renal tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c32">32</xref>). Nevertheless, expression of endogenous <italic>ZAM</italic> elements has never been detected in these tissues. Similarly, when we ectopically expressed Pointed2 in the eyes under control of a Glass-Gal4 driver, no LacZ staining resulting from the ectopic expression of pZ190 could be detected (data not shown). These results indicate that the expression of PntP2 is necessary but not sufficient to activate <italic>ZAM</italic>. Additional co-factors are almost certainly required for a refined regulation of its transcription in the specific tissue, i.e. the ovaries. Such co-factors have not been identified yet, however, we have to stress the fact that, at this time of our study, Pointed1 cannot be definitely discarded as a potential candidate. Indeed, if PntP2 acts in parallel or downstream of PntP1, our experiments would not have allowed us to detect its involvement in <italic>ZAM</italic> transcription.</p><p>Whatever the multiple factors involved, we have provided further evidence that Pointed, and its ETS-binding site common to PntP1 and PntP2, is able to activate <italic>ZAM</italic> transcription via its direct binding to <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements present in the responsive target of 190 bp. <italic>In silico</italic> we have found that an ETS binding site (5&#x02032;-GGAA-3&#x02032;), located within the 190 bp at position 79 according to <italic>ZAM</italic> sequence, is indeed the precise target DNA sequence recognized by Pointed. Overall, these data indicate that Pointed binds <italic>ZAM</italic> LTR and is a key factor in determining the strict expression of <italic>ZAM</italic> in the follicle cell layer in response to a signal emitted by the oocyte.</p><p>An outcome of the present investigation is that genes that are regulated by the Pointed factor and participate in differentiation of the posterior lineage of follicle cells could be identified by using the characterized target DNA sequence of <italic>ZAM</italic> as an easily detectable marker. Thus it provides an entry point to monitor the EGF receptor pathway and study mechanisms of posterior follicle cell induction and patterning in <italic>Drosophila</italic> at the transcriptional level. Additionally, our study provides an experimental tool, the <italic>ZAM</italic> promoter, which can be specifically used to direct expression of any transgene to the posterior pole of the oocyte.</p></sec><sec><title>Biological significance of a retroviral cycle starting within a somatic tissue, whereas its ultimate insertion occurs within the germ line</title><p>At the biological level, an intriguing question yet to be answered is why <italic>ZAM</italic> expression takes place in a somatic tissue in response to a signal (Gurken) transmitted by the oocyte while novel insertions are precisely known to occur in the germ line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c33">33</xref>). We can hypothesize that it is advantageous for the retrotransposon to produce its transcripts in somatic cells to circumvent transcriptional arrest of the oocyte during meiosis. Alternatively, a high expression of <italic>ZAM</italic> occurring directly within the germ line might generate too many proviral copies of <italic>ZAM</italic> and be deleterious for the next generation. In the course of evolution, an adaptive strategy to limit the extent of <italic>ZAM</italic> insertion within the germ line could have led the element to be expressed outside of the germ line. Expression within a somatic lineage and its subsequent transfer to the germ line could decrease the efficiency of its insertion and confer a selective advantage. Alternatively, some defence mechanism may specifically protect the germ line from the presence of any retroviral&#x0002f;retrotransposon RNA. This constraint may have led <italic>ZAM</italic> to adopt a novel strategy to invade the germ line. It starts its replication cycle and assembles viral-like particles (VLP) in a somatic tissue of the reproductive apparatus. While encapsidated in particles, the RNA genome is converted into a cDNA. When VLPs enter the closely apposed germ line by virtue of retroviral infection, DNA copies of the retroelement are no more recognized by the host defence selectively addressed against RNA invasions. The retroviral element can then complete its replication cycle leading to insertion within the host germ-line.</p><p>Recent studies implicate the biological role of dsRNA-mediated silencing as a transposon repression and antiviral mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c37">37</xref>). This host surveillance system is known to be active in the germ line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c39">39</xref>) and could certainly account for such a protection against LTR retrotransposons. However, numerous questions remain to be addressed to demonstrate whether this mechanism could have acted as an evolutionary constraint, resulting in <italic>ZAM</italic>, and potentially some related elements being transcribed in the somatic lineage.</p><p>This expression of <italic>ZAM</italic> within a somatic tissue apposed to the germ line is reminiscent of what is observed for some mouse or chicken viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c41">41</xref>), or for endogenous retroviral particles which are massively expressed in the human placenta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c43">43</xref>). A question raised by our data is: could some HERVs be expressed in placental tissues because of a signal emitted by the fetus? The fetal tissue would then be responsible for the acquisition of specific trophoblastic functions that have been attributed potentially to HERVs, such as protection against retroviral infection, protection of the fetus against maternal immune system, or placenta morphogenesis through fusogenic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh708c45">45</xref>). Although the question is open, it would be worth studying signals coming from the fetus, that could ultimately be responsible for endogenous retroviruses activation in the placenta.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh708f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><italic>ZAM</italic> expression in the ovaries of adult females.
