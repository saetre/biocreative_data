While recent progress has begun to unveil some of the molecular mechanisms of mitotic spindle displacement, far less is known about how spindle displacement is precisely timed. A conserved mitotic progression mechanism is known to time events in dividing cells, although this has never been linked to spindle displacement. This mechanism involves the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), its activator Cdc20/Fizzy, its degradation target cyclin, and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK). Here we show that these components comprise a previously unrecognized timer for spindle displacement. In the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Caenorhabditis elegans</named-content> zygote, mitotic spindle displacement begins at a precise time, soon after chromosomes congress to the metaphase plate. We found that reducing the function of the proteasome, the APC, or Cdc20/Fizzy delayed spindle displacement. Conversely, inactivating CDK in prometaphase caused the spindle to displace early. The consequence of experimentally unlinking spindle displacement from this timing mechanism was the premature displacement of incompletely assembled components of the mitotic spindle. We conclude that in this system, asymmetric positioning of the mitotic spindle is normally delayed for a short time until the APC inactivates CDK, and that this delay ensures that the spindle does not begin to move until it is fully assembled. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that mitotic progression times spindle displacement in the asymmetric division of an animal cell. We speculate that this link between the cell cycle and asymmetric cell division might be evolutionarily conserved, because the mitotic spindle is displaced at a similar stage of mitosis during asymmetric cell divisions in diverse systems.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Throughout animal development, and in stem cells, many cell divisions are asymmetric. The one-cell-stage <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> embryo divides asymmetrically, as a result of a displacement of the mitotic spindle to one side of the cell. As in other cell divisions, a mitotic progression machinery ensures that all chromosomes are associated with the metaphase plate before anaphase begins. This machinery involves the anaphase-promoting complex and its activator Cdc20/Fizzy, which target proteins for destruction by the proteasome; the cyclin that is targeted for degradation by the proteasome; and a cyclin-dependent kinase. We have asked whether the same machinery has a second function, delaying movement of the spindle to an asymmetric position until spindle assembly is complete. To address this question, we used genetic, reverse genetic, and pharmacological techniques to disrupt the function of elements of the mitotic progression machinery. We find that the mitotic progression machinery does indeed time spindle positioning, acting to delay spindle displacement until spindle assembly completes. This demonstrates a previously unrecognized link between the mitotic progression machinery and asymmetric spindle positioning in an animal cell.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>The machinery that times entry into mitotic anaphase has the extra function during an asymmetric cell division of regulating when the mitotic spindle can shift to one side of a cell.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>McCarthy Campbell EK, Werts AD, Goldstein B (2009) A cell cycle timer for asymmetric spindle positioning.

Several molecules that are critical for such pulling forces have been identified. Pulling forces depend on components of a protein complex that includes cortical G alpha protein, the mitotic spindle component LIN-5, and the posteriorly enriched activators of G protein signaling GPR-1/2. This complex recruits the microtubule motor dynein, which is also essential for strong pulling forces. There are a number of models for how these proteins, and analogous proteins in other model systems, result in stronger pulling forces on one side of a cell &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000088-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. The transient enrichment of GPR-1/2 in the posterior cortex might increase the number of molecular links between dynein-associated microtubules and the cortex in the posterior. The G alpha, GPR-1/2, LIN-5 complex might also locally activate dynein motors, and/or promote handover of microtubules to dynein. Whether dynein functions here as a motor or only as a link to depolymerizing microtubules is not yet known. Other mechanisms may contribute to the inequality of pulling forces, including a PAR-dependent asymmetry in microtubule dynamics &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000088-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000088-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d; and the local antagonism of G alpha-GPR-1/2 signaling by the DEP domain protein LET-99 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000088-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;.

Pulling forces exist on the posterior side of the spindle, and these are balanced by a microtubule-based tether on the anterior side early in mitosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000088-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. In the absence of the tether, the posteriorly directed pulling forces are sufficiently strong to move the spindle prematurely &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000088-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;.

We speculate, therefore, that a switch may exist to modulate forces and move the spindle at a precise time. Such a switch could be temporally regulated in a number of ways. Spindle displacement might be timed by links to the mitotic cell cycle. For example, the cell cycle machinery might affect the activity or localization of one or more of the cortical proteins discussed above, perhaps through the activity of one of the mitotic cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes. Alternatively, mitotic progression and a progression of events at the cortex might run independently and in parallel. For instance, an intracellular signaling cascade at the cell cortex might affect the activity or localization of specific proteins that regulate spindle positioning. Such signaling could in principle result in active force generators being first activated beyond a threshold at a specific time after a developmental event such as fertilization, pronuclear meeting, or centration of the pronuclei.</p><p>We set out to test the hypothesis that mitotic progression regulates spindle displacement in an asymmetric cell division. <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> is an ideal system to explore this issue because it allows one to combine disruption of the mitotic progression machinery with microscopic imaging and precise quantification of chromosome and spindle dynamics. However, there has been a longstanding obstacle to studying this problem in <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content>: Mitotic progression proteins are essential for successful completion of oocyte meiosis, such that disrupting these proteins' functions typically results in meiotic arrest before first mitosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000088-b013">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000088-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. This has precluded a number of straightforward tests of the hypothesis that mitotic progression regulates spindle displacement. Here, we report a set of genetic, reverse genetic, and pharmacological experiments, each designed to circumvent this obstacle for specific steps of a mitotic progression pathway. Our experiments tested whether mitotic progression pathway components are required for timely spindle displacement in embryos by disrupting the functions of individual components as well as multiple components for epistasis analysis. Cells with fluorescently tagged spindle components were used to analyze in detail spindle displacement and mitotic progression, and to analyze the consequences of misregulating the timing of spindle displacement. Our results demonstrate that anaphase-promoting complex (APC)-dependent negative regulation of CDK, long known to function as a mitotic progression timer, serves a second role as a timer for spindle displacement. We show that this timing mechanism ensures that spindle assembly is completed before spindle components begin to move away from the center of the cell.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The Mitotic Spindle Moves to an Asymmetric Position at a Precise Time after the Completion of Chromosome Congression</title><p>There is disagreement about precisely when the mitotic spindle begins to shift to an asymmetric position in the <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> zygote.

The degree of chromosome congression was quantified by measuring, at each timepoint, the ratio of histone-GFP fluorescence intensity in a small region at the center of the chromosome mass to histone-GFP fluorescence intensity just outside of this region. We calculated the center of the chromosome mass by a method that makes this ratio especially sensitive to single chromosomes unassociated with an otherwise complete metaphase plate (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). This ratio peaks in metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000088-g001">Figures 1</xref>D and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000088-sg001">S1</xref>).

The period from completion of chromosome congression to the beginning of anaphase chromosome separation lasted an average of 66.9 &#x000b1; 8.8 (mean &#x000b1; standard deviation) s. The spindle began to shift early during this period, and at a consistent time from embryo to embryo, starting 10.8 &#x000b1; 11.3 s after we detected the completion of congression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000088-g001">Figure 1</xref>E).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Proteasome Function Is Required for Timely Spindle Displacement</title><p>The precise timing of spindle displacement relative to a mitotic event is consistent with our hypothesis that spindle displacement might be regulated by mitotic progression pathways.

To determine directly if precise spindle displacement timing depends on proteasome activity, we disrupted the function of the proteasome by two methods that can circumvent a known requirement for the proteasome in meiosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000088-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. First, to rapidly disrupt proteasome activity after meiosis was completed, we introduced a pharmacological inhibitor of the 20S proteasome's peptidase activity, <italic>clasto</italic>-lactacystin &#x003b2;-lactone (c-L&#x003b2;L) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000088-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;, to laser-permeabilized histone H2B:GFP and gamma-tubulin:GFP-expressing embryos. Second, we used <italic>rpt-6</italic> RNAi for specific targeting of a proteasome component in histone H2B:GFP and gamma-tubulin:GFP-expressing embryos. RPT-6 is a component of the 19S proteasome subunit, and its disruption has been shown to delay mitotic timing in the early embryo without disrupting meiosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000088-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. We confirmed that disrupting proteasome activity by these methods did not prevent spindle formation or chromosome congression in alpha-tubulin:GFP-expressing embryos and in histone H2B:GFP and gamma-tubulin:GFP-expressing embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000088-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000088-g002">2</xref>B).

Since each experiment that affected the timing of anaphase similarly affected the timing of spindle displacement, but spindle displacement preceded anaphase in each such experiment, we conclude that CDK inactivation has a more rapid effect on spindle displacement than on anaphase.

GPR-1/2, LIN-5, and LET-99 have distributions that are dynamic through mitosis, and these dynamic distributions might be temporally regulated directly or indirectly by CDK activity, although no such link is yet known &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000088-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000088-b047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000088-b049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000088-b051">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000088-b055">55</xref>&#x0005d;.

As discussed, it can be difficult to discern the complex roles of spindle-assembly checkpoint proteins in the absence of damage to the spindle itself.

As might have been expected, none of these methods caused a delay in anaphase without also compromising spindle integrity. In the absence of positive evidence that FZY-1 is responding to the spindle-assembly checkpoint, the possibility that FZY-1 is regulated in another way is a viable alternative.
